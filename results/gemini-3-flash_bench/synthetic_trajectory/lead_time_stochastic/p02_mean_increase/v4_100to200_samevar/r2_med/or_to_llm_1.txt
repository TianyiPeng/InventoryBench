Demand Analysis: Historical samples are [105, 36, 108, 110, 96]. Period 1 actual demand was 83. The demand seems to fluctuate around a mean of roughly 90. 4. OR Analysis: The OR agent recommends 136 units. Its calculation uses the promised lead time (L=2) and historical mean. It targets a base stock that covers demand for 3 periods (L+1). With an expected demand of ~90/period, a base stock around 400-410 (including safety stock) is likely. Since pipeline is 143, the raw order would be ~260, but the OR cap (which limits orders to roughly 1.5x mean demand plus safety) is restricting it to 136. 5. Strategy: I will follow the OR recommendation of 136. Although inventory is currently 0, there is a large order in transit (143) and total pipeline (143 + 136 = 279) is approaching the 3-period demand requirement.

My current view shows demands for P1-P3 as 83, 125, 107. The average is roughly 105 units/period. \n4. Strategy: There have been 0 sales for 3 periods due to stockouts/lead-time delays. The 327 units in transit represent about 3 periods of demand coverage. If P1's order (143) arrives this period (P4), it covers P4 demand plus a small safety margin. The OR recommendation of 2 units is extremely low because it likely sees the 327 in-transit as sufficient to cover the (L+1) window based on its internal calculations.

In-transit inventory consists of the order from Period 2 (136 units) and Period 4 (50 units), totaling 186. Since the Period 3 order arrived early (L=1), the Period 2 order (136 units) is now technically overdue (L=3 at start of P5) or highly likely to arrive in the current Period 5 arrival phase.\n3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand is [105, 36, 108, 110, 96] (using the user-provided sample list which slightly differs from the game history logs of [83, 125, 107, 86]). Averaging the game history samples results in ~100 units/period. \n4. Strategy: Total Pipeline (On-hand 105 + In-transit 186) = 291 units. Assuming a lead time of 2-3 periods, we need to cover roughly 3-4 periods of demand (~300-400 units). The OR recommendation is 32 units, which targets a base stock level. Given that 136 units (P2 order) are expected to arrive this period, adding 50-60 units is safer than 32 to ensure we don't stock out if demand spikes or if the P4 order is delayed.

With the 136-unit loss accounted for, the effective pipeline is 101 units. Total stock + effective pipeline = 274 units. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand mean is approximately 92 units. Recent periods show high variability (115, 110, then 56). Average demand over 3 periods (L+1) is ~276 units. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 units because it likely perceives the 136-unit lost shipment as part of the pipeline, inflating the inventory position. 5. Strategy: A total-stock-on-hand-and-pipeline of 274 units covers approximately 3 periods of average demand (274 / 92 = 2.97 periods). Since the target (L+1) is 3 periods and current inventory is just at that threshold, ordering a small amount reinforces the safety buffer against further lead-time volatility or shipment loss.",

If we exclude the lost/suspect shipments (P2 and P6), the 'effective' total inventory is 130 (on-hand) + 30 (P9 in-transit) = 160 units.

The most recent demand (P12) was 118, indicating a potential slight upward trend or high variance. \n4. Strategy: OR recommends 0 because it sees a large pipeline (306).

These 806 units are effectively lost. The functional pipeline consists of P24 (210) and P25 (210), totaling 420 units. Lead-Time Inference: Observed lead times recently range from 2 to 3 periods; I assume 2-3 periods for current orders. Demand Analysis: A sustained regime shift occurred at P16; demand for the last 10 periods (P16-P25) has averaged 203.9 units per period. Current stock (64) + effective pipeline (420) = 484 units. This covers slightly more than 2 periods of demand (408 units). Strategy: Since there is a risk of additional shipment losses and the lead time is at least 2 periods, I need to maintain a pipeline that covers at least 3 periods of demand (~612 units) to prevent stockouts.

Demand Analysis: Demand has stabilized in a higher regime, averaging approximately 198 units per period over the last 10 periods (P17-P26). Following a base-stock logic for a lead time of 2-3 periods (3+1 periods covering demand), we need roughly 800 units in the pipeline.

More critically, there is a recurring pattern of lost shipments in the pipeline. Inventory Analysis: Starting Period 34, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1856 is highly misleading due to accumulated historical losses (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P22, P24, P25, P29, P30 appear lost/stale).

Effectively, the pipeline for future periods consists only of the 210 units ordered in P33.
