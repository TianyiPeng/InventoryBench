Excluding the outlier, the average is approx 105. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 4. To maximize reward, I need to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). However, since I start with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, I am guaranteed to stock out in Period 1, 2, and potentially 3 depending on when the first shipment arrives. I will base my initial order on a target inventory level to cover ~3 periods of demand (approx 300 units) plus a small safety buffer to account for lead time uncertainty, aiming to stabilize the pipeline quickly.",

However, we are currently experiencing a 2-period gap in arrivals: orders from P41 (170 units) and P42 (210 units) did not arrive in the Period 42 conclude message (received at P43 start). The 'In-transit' total of 2790 units is heavily inflated by several historical lost shipments (P17-P19, P25, P29-P30, P33) and the current active pipeline. My active pipeline consists of P37 (250), P41 (170), and P42 (210), totaling 630 units. Given the 1-2 period lead time and the high risk of loss (attrition rate), I must maintain a continuous pipeline. To cover expected demand of ~210 units for the next few periods while addressing the current stockout, I will order 220 units to maintain the flow, assuming the P41 and P42 orders eventually resolve within the 1-3 period window.",

Assuming a lead time of roughly 2 periods, the P41 order is expected to arrive during Period 44 (the current period). To cover demand for Period 44 and Period 45 (approx 420 units total) while starting from 0, I need the P41 and P42 orders to arrive.

Lead time remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods recently (P40 arrived in 3 periods, P41 arrived in 3 periods).

Disregarding lost orders, the valid pipeline consists of orders from P44 (220), P45 (220), and the current decision for P46. To maintain a safety stock that covers a 3-period lead time (L) plus the current decision period (L+1 = 4 periods), we need to cover approximately 840 units (210 units * 4).

Adjusting the effective pipeline: P44 (220 units), P45 (220 units), and P46 (180 units) are the only realistically active shipments. Given the current on-hand inventory (99) and the expected demand of ~210, I expect to stock out in Period 47 before P44 arrives (likely in P47 or P48).

The P44 order (ordered 4 periods ago) should have arrived at the start of P48 (during the arrival resolution phase) if L=3. However, since we are currently in Period 48's decision phase, and starting inventory was recorded as 0 at the end of P47, we rely on the P44 delivery to satisfy P48 demand. Given we are approaching the game end (Period 50), we must ensure inventory for the final 3 periods (48, 49, 50). Total expected demand for P48-P50 is ~630.

Specifically, P44 is now 6 periods old and P45 is 5 periods old; following historical patterns of high attrition, these are high-risk for loss. However, I must assume a base pipeline logic where P46 onwards will arrive. To cover the current stockout and the next 3 periods (L=2 plus 1 safety), I need approximately 600-800 units. The in-transit total is 3400, but the 'In-transit' metric in the prompt often includes the massive backlog of lost orders (P17-P33).
