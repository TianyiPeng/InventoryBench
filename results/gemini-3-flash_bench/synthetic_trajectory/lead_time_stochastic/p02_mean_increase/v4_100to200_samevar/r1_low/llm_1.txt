There is a significant amount of 'lost' inventory (2080 units from P15-P33) that is essentially ignored for planning. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after P43. In-transit inventory excluding 'lost' stock consists of: P41 (200), P42 (250), P43 (250), totaling 700 units active in the pipeline. With a target stock cover of (L+1) = 4 periods (to account for L=3 variability) and a demand rate of ~220, the target position is 880 units. Current active pipeline (700) + On-hand (0) = 700. To reach the 880 target, an order of 180 would be standard, but given the stockouts in P41 and P42 and the high volatility/late arrival of P40, I will order 210 to ensure better service levels for the remaining periods (P44-P50), especially as the game nears its end and holding costs for excessive inventory becoming a risk vs. lost sales.",

The inventory on hand is 0. Total units in transit are 2790; however, based on the Carry-Over Insights, 2080 units are considered lost (P15-P19, P24-P25, P30, P33). This leaves an 'active' pipeline of 710 units (P42=250, P43=250, P44=210). For Period 45, we expect arrivals from P42 (250 units) to cover demand (~220). Since we are in Period 45 of 50, we must cover the remaining 6 periods (45-50). Total expected demand for P45-P50 is ~1320 units. Active pipeline is 710 units. Safety stock is minimal given the game end is approaching. Ordering 250 units maintains a flow to cover the later periods (48-50) without risking high terminal holding costs, considering the 2-3 period lead time.",

The active supply chain continues to exhibit a variable lead time between 1 and 3 periods, with the most recent arrivals (P40, P41, P42, P43) taking 2-3 periods. Total In-transit is 2540, but according to historical Carry-over Insights, a massive chunk of this (approx 2080 units from P15-P33) is likely lost and should be excluded from pipeline calculations. Excluding the 'lost' 2080 units, the 'active' In-transit consists of P44 (210 units) and P45 (250 units), totaling 460 units. Current On-hand is 310. Following the Period N+1 target logic (L=2, looking to cover periods 46, 47, and 48), the required inventory is 200 * 3 = 600 units. Current active pipeline (310 on-hand + 460 in-transit) = 770 units. This already exceeds the 3-period coverage needed (600). However, given the 50-period game limit and the risk of stock-outs from lead-time volatility, a small maintenance order to keep the pipeline moving is prudent, but we must avoid over-ordering as the game ends at P50 and holding costs equal profit.",

  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable at a mean of approximately 210 units per period (last 10 periods average ~215).

Current on-hand inventory is 86. In-transit inventory consists of: P44 (210 units, 3 periods old), P45 (250 units, 2 periods old), and P46 (50 units, 1 period old). Additionally, there is a large volume (2080 units) of 'lost' inventory from earlier periods that is not expected to arrive. Total expected demand for the remainder of the game (4 periods * 210) is roughly 840 units. Current reliable pipeline (86 on-hand + 210 from P44 + 250 from P45 + 50 from P46) equals 596 units. To cover the remaining demand of 840, we need approximately 244 more units. However, because we are approaching the game end (P50), any order placed now (P47) will arrive in P48, P49, or P50 (lead time 1-3). Ordering exactly what is needed to reach the target ending inventory near zero is optimal to avoid holding costs in the final period.",

The supply chain remains highly bifurcated: a total of 1,830 units (orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, P33) are considered lost as they are significantly overdue. Recent lead times for the 'active' supply chain have trended back toward 3 periods (P41 arrived in P44, P42 in P45, P43 in P45). Currently, Period 48 is the decision phase. We are at On-hand 0. Orders in transit from the active supply chain are: P44 (210), P45 (250), P46 (50), and P47 (250). Since P44 and P45 are now 3 and 2 periods old respectively, we expect arrivals during Period 48 or 49. As the game ends at Period 50, we only need to cover demand for Periods 48, 49, and 50. Total demand to cover is ~600 units. Our active pipeline (P44-P47) totals 760 units. However, given the P46 order was very small (50), and to ensure availability against a potential 3-period lead time for the final periods, I will place a small order of 100 units to bridge any gaps and manage the end-of-game risk without incurring excessive holding costs.",

{
  "rationale": "We are currently in Period 49, the penultimate period (Game ends at Period 50). The current demand regime is stable at approximately ~200 units per period. The supply chain has remained volatile throughout, with recent lead times for successful deliveries ranging between 1-3 periods. Large chunks of the in-transit inventory (2080 units from historical data) are confirmed as lost shipments. Looking at recent 'active' orders: Period 44 (210 units) is 5 periods old and likely lost; Period 45 (250 units) is 4 periods old and likely lost; Period 46 (50 units) is 3 periods old and could arrive today (P49) or tomorrow (P50); Period 47 (250 units) is 2 periods old; and Period 48 (100 units) is 1 period old. Since we only have Period 49 and Period 50 remaining, any order placed now (Period 49) would require a lead time of 0 or 1 to arrive in time to satisfy demand. Given that the minimum observed lead time in the 'reliable' phase was 1, and most were 2-3, an order placed today is unlikely to arrive before the game ends. However, our on-hand inventory is 0. We must rely on the arrival of orders from P46, P47, or P48. Placing a small order for P49 acts as a final hedge against a 1-period delivery for the final day's demand, though its utility is low. The priority is to not over-order and incur holding costs on the final day, but since current inventory is 0 and demand is ~200, the risk of holding cost is minimal compared to the profit of a sale.",

{
  "rationale": "The demand regime is stable at approximately 200 units per period (average last 10 periods: 198.8). The current inventory situation is critical as the on-hand balance is 0. The delivery system has become increasingly delayed: the most recent arrivals (Periods 43-45) showed lead times of 3 periods, whereas current 'active' orders from Periods 44-49 (totaling 1,110 units) have not yet arrived. Specifically, orders P44 (210 units), P45 (250 units), P46 (50 units), P47 (250 units), P48 (100 units), and P49 (200 units) are in the pipeline. With a typical lead time drift between 1-3 periods, P44 and P45 are highly likely to arrive in the next period (P51). To cover the gap across the 2-3 period lead time window and maintain service level for the stable ~200 demand, I will place an order that ensures the fresh pipeline (P44-P50) supports ~3 periods of demand (600 units) while accounting for the high volume currently in transit.",
