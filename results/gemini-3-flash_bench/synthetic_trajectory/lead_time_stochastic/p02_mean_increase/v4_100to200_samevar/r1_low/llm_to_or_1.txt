Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical performance yet. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Based on the provided demand history (Periods 1-5: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96), the initial mean demand is approximately 91 units per period. Since L=2, the total demand across the lead time + review period (L+1=3) is approximately 273. The standard deviation is approximately 31.4, resulting in a sigma_hat across 3 periods of roughly 54.4. I will set the parameters to reflect these initial estimates to ensure sufficient stock is ordered to cover the lead time, given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0/$1.0), which suggests a critical ratio of 0.5 (z=0).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The promised lead time is 2. In Period 1, an order of 143 units was placed, but arrivals for L=2 orders only occur during Period 3 (visible in Period 4). Consequently, Period 1 ended with 0 inventory, leading to 62 lost sales. The historical data shows high volatility (105, 36, 108, 110, 96). Given the high demand in Period 1 (62), the 5-period average (91) is a reasonable baseline. To recover from the initial stockout and cover the remaining lead time, I will use 'recent_N' for the demand forecast focusing on all available historical samples to stabilize the estimate, while keeping the lead time at the default promised value of 2.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders were placed in Period 1 (143 units) and Period 2 (105 units). Following the execution sequence, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (after this decision) and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Therefore, current on-hand is 0 and we have 248 units in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 62 and Period 2 was 161. Based on the provided historical samples (P1: 105, P2: 36, P3: 108, P4: 110, P5: 96), there is high volatility. Since we haven't seen a completed lead time cycle yet (first arrival expected at the end of P3), I will stick to the promised lead time and use the recent demand samples to forecast. The mean of the first 5 samples provided in the prompt is (105+36+108+110+96)/5 = 91. Using N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this initial variance.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. No shipments have arrived yet. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (143 units) was expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase, which would be reported in the 'Period 3 conclude' message visible now at the start of Period 4. Since 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0, the lead time is either longer than 2 or the shipment is delayed/lost. The current pipeline (in-transit) is 323 units (143 from P1, 105 from P2, 75 from P3). Demand has been volatile: 62, 161, 76. The average demand is roughly 100. Since we have 0 on-hand and have sold nothing despite demand occurring, we are in a stockout. I will maintain the L=2 setting for now as it is early, but I will increase mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (3 from history + 2 recent) to ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock to recover from the stockout. I'll use recent_N=5 to capture all available history.

Daily Profit: $60.00, Daily Holding Cost: $158.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-98.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been volatile, with samples: 62, 161, 76, 60 (average ~90). The promised lead time is 2, but observed actual lead times were 3 periods (for P1 order) and 1 period (for P3 order), averaging 2.0. Currently, on-hand inventory is 158 units with 105 units in-transit (ordered in P2). Since P2's order is at the promised lead time of 2 (it should arrive during P5), we expect arrivals soon. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio (1:1), the OR engine will target a 50% service level. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the engine use the average of observations, 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~90 per period), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the high variance (std ~48). This results in a base stock that covers (2+1)*90 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-30.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the chips(Regular) SKU. Demand has been relatively consistent, with a mean of approximately 91 units over the last 5 periods (62, 161, 76, 60, 64). Note that the demand data provided in the prompt header (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) appears to conflict with the Historical Game History (62, 161, 76, 60, 64); I will prioritize the Game History as it reflects actual inventory interactions. Lead times have shown significant variability: Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 order arrived in 1 period, averaging 2 periods (as promised). Current status: On-hand is 94, In-transit is 201 (from Period 2 and Period 5 orders). Since L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. Using the recent 5-period average (approx 85), mu_hat is set to 255. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility seen in Period 2.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 245 units in-transit. The game history shows significant lead time variability: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period. The promised lead time is 2. The most recent order (Period 2, 105 units) is now 5 periods old and hasn't arrived, suggesting it might be lost or stuck. Current demand average across the first 6 periods is ~89 units. In Period 6, we stocked out (sold 94 with a demand of 111). I will set L to 3 to account for the observed maximum lead time and provide a buffer against the current stockout. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of the last 4 periods (76, 60, 64, 111) which is 77.75. With L=3, mu_hat = (1+3)*77.75 = 311. For sigma_hat, I will use an explicit value based on the standard deviation of recent demand (approx 22.5) scaled by sqrt(1+L), which is 22.5 * 2 = 45.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability observed: actual lead times of 1 and 3 periods recorded. Potential lost/delayed shipment from Period 2 (105 units) as it is 5 periods overdue.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and high uncertainty in logistics. Historical demand for periods 1-7 (62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65) averages ~85.5 units. Current pipeline (311 units) consists of orders from P2 (105, 6 periods ago - likely lost), P5 (96), P6 (44), and P7 (66). Lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods, with one order significantly overdue. To restore service levels, I will adjust L to 'calculate' to reflect the average of successful deliveries (1 and 3 periods, avg=2) and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture recent volatility (avg ~73) while maintaining a sufficient base stock. The high sigma_hat (default) is necessary given the high variance in demand samples (ranging from 60 to 161).

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Order from Period 2 (105 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirms a lost shipment pattern. Pipeline inventory is over-inflated by these phantom units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 39 units on-hand and 149 in-transit. Based on the history, the order from Period 2 (105 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 149 consists of the lost 105 units, plus 44 units ordered in Period 6 (now 3 periods old). The 44 units ordered in P6 are currently at the 'promised' lead time limit (L=2) and should ideally arrive in Period 9 or 10. Actual lead times observed so far are 3, 1, 3, 1. The average is 2, which matches the promised lead time. Demand remains volatile but shows no clear trend shift outside the initial sample range (mean \u2248 80-90). To handle the lost units, I must account for the fact that the OR backend includes the 105 phantom units in its pipeline calculation. If I want the backend to order more, I need to set mu_hat high enough to overcome (on-hand + 149). However, setting mu_hat too high risks over-ordering if the 44 units also arrive. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (all actual game periods) for demand to capture recent variance, and keep L at default (2) to align with the average observed lead time.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and facing high demand variability. Historical demand samples (including Period 1-5 provided earlier and Period 1-9 from history) are: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96, 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65, 123, 104. The mean demand is approximately 91.5 units. The lead time is highly unstable: we have seen arrivals at L=1 and L=3, while the Period 2 order (105 units) is now 8 periods overdue and definitively lost. The current 'In-transit' of 232 units includes the 105 lost units (P2), 44 units (P6), and 83 units (P9). Because the OR engine's capped policy subtracts the full pipeline inventory (including the 105 'phantom' units), it will under-order unless we compensate. To ensure the backend places an order despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting an explicit L=3 to increase the base stock calculation, and using the recent 5 periods (avg ~93) to capture current demand levels. I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to a higher value (50) to account for the high volatility and stockout risk, ensuring the safety stock is sufficient to handle the lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Period 2 order (105 units) never arrived and is now 8 periods overdue; this permanently inflates 'In-transit' inventory viewed by the backend. Actual lead time is erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' count of 367 units. This 367 includes: P2 (105), P6 (44), P9 (83), and P10 (135). As noted in previous insights, the P2 order of 105 units is now 9 periods overdue and must be considered lost; however, it remains in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation, causing the OR engine to under-order. Additionally, the order from P6 (44 units) is now 5 periods overdue and also potentially lost or severely delayed. Lead times have been oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2). Demand is relatively stable but high, leading to frequent stockouts because the pipeline is clogged with these 'phantom' units (orders that won't arrive). To force the OR backend to order despite the inflated pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 (to account for the longer observed lead times) and an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock should be (L+1)*AvgDemand. With AvgDemand around 90-100 units and L=3 (4 periods total), the target is 400. To offset the ~149 lost units (105+44) effectively hidden in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 549 to ensure the backend places a meaningful order this period.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Order from Period 6 (44 units) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting a second lost or severely delayed shipment in addition to the Period 2 loss.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the system faces severe supply chain disruptions. On-hand inventory is 0, and lead times are erratic (varying between 1 and 3 periods). Crucially, there are two confirmed lost or severely delayed shipments: Period 2 (105 units, 10 periods overdue) and Period 6 (44 units, 6 periods overdue). These 149 units remain in 'In-transit', causing the OR backend to believe the pipeline is 549 units, whereas the effective pipeline is actually 400. To compensate and avoid further stockouts, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the base demand (L+1) * mean(recent_demand) and then add 149 units to 'trick' the backend into ordering since it will subtract the inflated 'In-transit' value. Recent demand (last 5 periods) is approx 90/period. With an effective L of 2 (conservative average), (1+2)*90 = 270. Adding the 149 'phantom' units gives a target of 419. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 130. Analysis of the history reveals a significant structural issue with 'In-transit' figures: the orders from Period 2 (105 units) and Period 6 (44 units) are 11 and 7 periods overdue, respectively, and are likely lost. Because these 149 units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count, the OR engine will chronically under-order unless we compensate. Of the 331 units 'In-transit', only 182 units (ordered Period 11) are actually expected to arrive. The actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2). Demand remains relatively stable with variations. To counter the 149 lost units inflating the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculated the expected base stock for a lead time of 2 ((1+2) * average_demand) and added 149 units to 'trick' the OR engine into placing an order that ignores the phantom inventory. Average demand is approx 90 units (mean of all samples). Target base stock = (3 * 90) + 149 = 419. Sigma is kept at default levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Confirmed loss of Period 6 order (44 units), now 7 periods overdue. Total phantom pipeline inventory is 149 units (P2: 105, P6: 44).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing a situation with significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Historically, orders from Period 2 (105 units) and Period 6 (44 units) are definitively lost, totaling 149 units that correctly stay in the 'In-transit' count but will never arrive. The backend OR engine's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will incorrectly subtract these 149 units, leading to severe under-ordering and stockouts. To compensate, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The mean demand for the last 13 periods is approximately 91 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the standard base_stock calculation would target (1+L) * 91 = 273 units. To offset the 149 units that the backend thinks we have but don't, I will set mu_hat to 273 + 149 = 422. This 'padding' ensures the backend orders enough to meet demand despite the lost shipments. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period lead times observed (P1, P5, P9), even though the average is closer to 2, to ensure a safer buffer given the erratic arrival history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a mean of 95.8 units per period over the last 10 periods (P5-P14), including a slight uptick in the most recent period. Lead times continue to be volatile, with observations of 1, 2, and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.3 periods. A critical issue remains: 'In-transit' inventory (216 units) includes 149 units from lost orders (Period 2: 105 units, Period 6: 44 units). The backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see the 216 units and significantly under-order because it believes 149 units are coming that never will. To compensate for this 149-unit deficit, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculation: Expected demand over (L+1) periods + Phantom inventory correction. Assuming L=2 (nominal), mu_hat = (2+1) * 96 + 149 = 288 + 149 = 437. This forces the base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the 'In-transit' error. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a demand of 99 units in Period 15. Analysis of 'In-transit' shows 368 units, but historical carry-over data confirms that 149 of these units are 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (Period 2: 105 units, Period 6: 44 units). The effective pipeline is actually 219 units (368 - 149). The actual lead time (L) has exhibited a pattern of 1, 2, and 3 periods, averaging 2.14 based on successful arrivals. I will use L=2 (promised) as the calculation method to stay close to the average while acknowledging the volatility. Demand remains steady with a 15-period mean of approximately 92. Demand samples provided in the prompt (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) average 91. To compensate for the 149 units of phantom inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its 'pipeline' calculation, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock should cover L+1 (3) periods of demand plus safety stock. Using (3 * 92) + buffer minus accounting for the 149 units the backend thinks we have, I am setting mu_hat higher to force an order that bridges the gap created by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative phantom inventory in 'In-transit' is 149 units (P2: 105, P6: 44). These units perma-bloat the backend's view of pipeline inventory, requiring upward mu_hat adjustments to trigger necessary replenishment.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17 with 0 units on-hand. Looking at the history, there is a consistent pattern of lost/delayed shipments: Period 2 (105 units) is 15 periods overdue, and Period 6 (44 units) is 11 periods overdue. These 149 units 'phantom' units are permanently inflating the In-transit total (425), tricking the OR backend into thinking we have more inventory coming than we actually do. To force the OR engine to order despite this bloat, I must explicitly set mu_hat. The demand has also spiked significantly in Period 16 (227 units), though previous periods averaged around 100. Average demand across all 16 periods is approximately 104 units. With a lead time L=2 (implied base), (1+L) * mean demand = 3 * 104 = 312. However, to offset the 149 phantom units and account for the recent demand spike, I will set mu_hat to 461 (312 + 149). This compensates for the missing inventory. Sigma_hat is set using recent history (last 5 periods) to capture the increased volatility seen in the 227-unit spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Demand spiked to 227 in Period 16, significantly higher than the ~100 average. Persistent phantom inventory of 149 units remains in-transit, necessitating ongoing mu_hat increases to bypass the base-stock logic's pipeline calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system faced a stockout as demand (186) exceeded arrived units (124). Total 'In-transit' is 337 units, but this includes 149 units of confirmed phantom inventory (Period 2: 105, Period 6: 44) that are 16 and 12 periods overdue respectively. The effective pipeline is actually 188 units (337 - 149). Observed lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.33). Demand has shown a significant upward shift in the last two periods (P16: 227, P17: 186), averaging 206.5, compared to the previous average of ~100. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 149-unit phantom inventory bloat, mu_hat must be set explicitly. Using a 3-period lead time safety factor (L=2, but covering L+1 periods of demand), I forecast demand for those 3 periods based on the recent elevated average (206.5 * 3 = 619.5) and add the 149 phantom units back to the requirement to neutralize their deduction by the backend's base-stock logic. Total mu_hat = 619.5 + 149 = 768.5. Sigma_hat is increased to account for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand increased from ~100 to ~200 (+100%). Total phantom inventory (P2, P6) remains 149 units, perma-bloating the In-transit view.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 600 in-transit. Since Period 16, demand has shifted from ~100 to ~200 units per period (last three periods: 227, 186, 210), confirming a sustained regime change. There is also a confirmed 149 units of phantom pipeline inventory (Period 2: 105, Period 6: 44) that will never arrive but remains in the OR backend's inventory position calculation. To force an order despite this perma-bloat, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. The promised lead time is 2, and observed lead times range from 1 to 3; I will use L=2 (default). With a 3-period demand window (L+1), expected demand at 200/unit is 600. To offset the 149 phantom units and ensure the base-stock exceeds the 600 in-transit units, I am setting mu_hat to 800 and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the recent high volatility. This setup aims to maintain a high service level during this elevated demand phase while overcoming the pipeline misinformation.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a demand regime shift that began in Period 16. Recent demand (P16-P19) has averaged 198.5 units/period, compared to the historical average of ~100. Furthermore, the 'In-transit' figure of 800 is heavily inflated by 149 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2: 105 units, P6: 44 units) which will never arrive. The backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) and the order cap (based on L=2) are severely restricting our ability to restock. To force a higher order volume and overcome the perma-bloat in 'In-transit', I am using 'explicit' L=3 (the maximum observed lead time) and an 'explicit' mu_hat of 1200. This 1200 target represents (3+1) periods of the current high demand (~200 * 4 = 800) PLUS the 149 units of 'phantom' inventory, plus a buffer to ensure the backend places an order despite the 800 'In-transit' visibility and the logic cap.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from ~100 to ~200. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 200.6 units. Lead times remain erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.33). There is a persistent phantom 'In-transit' inventory of 149 units (P2: 105, P6: 44) that will never arrive but prevents the OR backend from ordering because it believes they are coming. Since on-hand is 0 and we are stock-out, I must inflate mu_hat significantly to force an order. The target base stock should cover L+1 periods (estimated L=2, so 3 periods) at the current demand rate (~200). Target base stock = 600. However, the backend subtracts 'In-transit' (1141) from the base_stock. This is a massive gap. To force a replenishment order despite the 1141 'In-transit' units, I must set mu_hat to offset both the demand and the phantom inventory. I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to a value that forces a substantial order (~300-400 range) to match current regional demand while accounting for the high 'In-transit' figure being used in the backend's subtraction logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 has sustained at ~200 units/period (last 5 periods avg: 200.6). Lead lead time is highly variable (1-3 periods).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~100 to ~200 units per period. The last 6 periods show demand values of 227, 186, 210, 171, 209, and 187, averaging 198.3. However, there is a systemic issue with 'In-transit' inventory. We have 149 units of confirmed 'phantom' inventory (Period 2: 105 units, Period 6: 44 units) that are significantly past any observed lead time (max observed is 3). More critically, 'In-transit' has spiked to 1500 units while on-hand is 0. This suggests large recent orders (Periods 18-21: 263, 200, 341, 359) haven't arrived yet. The OR backend's capped policy will suppress new orders if it thinks the pipeline is full (1500 units). To force the engine to place orders despite this massive pipeline, I must set mu_hat extremely high to ensure the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) exceeds the pipeline. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat at 2500 (covering roughly 3 periods of the new 200/period demand plus a massive buffer for the pipeline bloat). L is set to 2 (promised) as actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory is massively inflated (1500 units) compared to on-hand (0) due to a cluster of recent large orders and historical phantom units (149). This necessitates aggressive mu_hat overrides to ensure replenishment continues.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16 from ~100 to ~200 units per period (last 7 periods average: 194.7). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there is a massive backlog resulting from zero arrivals between Period 18 and Period 22. The 'In-transit' figure of 2368 units is extremely high, but it is heavily skewed by 149 units of confirmed 'phantom' inventory (lost orders from P2 and P6) and a large cluster of recent orders (P18-P22) that have not yet arrived. Due to the high variable lead time (1-3 periods), many of these orders are overdue but not necessarily lost yet. To ensure the backend OR engine places an order despite the massive 'In-transit' pipeline (which triggers the base-stock cap), I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the actual demand. A mu_hat of 3000 (roughly 10x current demand) is used as a tactical bypass to force replenishment until the actual arrivals stabilize the physical on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged arrival gap: No arrivals recorded for periods 18-22, leading to critical stockouts and an inflated in-transit pipeline of over 2300 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1158.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, a massive arrival of 1568 units (from orders in P20, P21, and P22) resolved the severe stockout situation, bringing ending on-hand inventory to 1363. The demand regime remains stable in the higher bracket (~200 units/period) established since Period 16. However, the system still carries phantom in-transit inventory from lost shipments in Period 2 (105 units) and Period 6 (44 units), totaling 149 units. Additionally, recent orders from Period 15 (152 units), Period 18 (263 units), and Period 19 (200 units) are now overdue (8, 5, and 4 periods respectively), significantly higher than the 1-3 period lead time range. If these are also lost, the phantom inventory bloat is much higher. Given the current high stock level (1363 units), which covers roughly 6-7 periods of demand, I must prioritize reducing holding costs while the backend pipeline inventory view is reconciled. I will set mu_hat to 0 to stop further ordering until the current surplus is depleted and the 'In-transit' count becomes more realistic.

Carry-over insight: Massive arrival in Period 23 (1568 units) resolved stockout, resulting in high surplus (1363 units). Lead times for orders from P15, P18, and P19 (totaling 615 units) are significantly overdue, suggesting a large segment of the current 'In-transit' inventory (1432 units) may be lost shipments.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, on-hand inventory is 1205 units following a massive arrival (1568 units) in Period 23, which resolved a long stockout period. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized into a higher regime of approximately 200 units per period (last 9 periods average: 191). The In-transit pipeline of 1432 units is highly suspect. It contains confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (105) and Period 6 (44), but also significantly overdue orders from Period 15 (152 units, 10 periods overdue), Period 18 (263 units, 7 periods overdue), and Period 19 (200 units, 6 periods overdue). Given the promised lead time is 2 and the max observed lead time is 3, these 764 units (105+44+152+263+200) are likely lost. The remaining 668 units in transit (mostly from P23) plus the current 1205 on-hand units total 1873, which covers over 9 periods of demand at the 200-unit rate. Therefore, no new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat to a low 'explicit' value to ensure the backend's base-stock logic (which subtracts the bloated 1432 'In-transit' figure) does not trigger an order while we burn through the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed massive lead-time failures/lost segments for orders placed in P15, P18, and P19 (totaling 615 units), which, combined with earlier losses (149 units), creates a permanent 'In-transit' ghost inventory of 764 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1469.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high inventory state (On-hand: 1653) following a massive arrival in Period 23 and a subsequent arrival in Period 25. Demand has stabilized into a new regime of approximately 187 units per period (last 10 periods average is 187.4). The 'In-transit' figure of 800 units is dominated by historical phantom inventory (764 units), which consists of lost shipments from Period 2 (105), Period 6 (44), Period 15 (152), Period 18 (263), and Period 19 (200). These units have not arrived within the typical 1-3 period lead time and are significantly overdue. Because the 'In-transit' value is perma-bloated by 764 units, the OR backend's base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see a pipeline of 800 and on-hand of 1653, resulting in no orders being placed for a long time. Given the high current stock (representing ~8-9 periods of demand) and the presence of 764 ghost units out of 800 in-transit, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand regime of ~190 units while relying on the massive on-hand buffer to absorb any demand until the stock naturally depletes. No aggressive override is needed this period as we are overstocked.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1215.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory position is currently very high (On-hand: 1434 units) following the large arrival in Period 23 and Period 25. The current demand regime has stabilized at approximately 200 units per period (last 10 periods average: 189 units). There are 800 units in 'In-transit', but history confirms a significant portion of this is phantom inventory from lost shipments: P2 (105), P6 (44), P15 (152), P18 (263), and P19 (200), totaling 764 ghost units. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 36 units (800 total - 764 ghost). With an ending on-hand of 1434 and demand at ~200/period, we have over 7 periods of supply. The OR backend's logic would subtract the 800 in-transit units from the base stock, but since most are lost, it won't over-order. However, to avoid excessive holding costs from further unnecessary ordering while already overstocked, I will use 'recent_N' for the demand forecast to capture the 200-unit regime, and 'default' for lead time. No new orders are expected or needed given the high surplus.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory in 'In-transit' is confirmed at 764 units (P2: 105, P6: 44, P15: 152, P18: 263, P19: 200). Current demand regime is stable at ~190-200 units per period since Period 16.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16 from ~100 to ~200 units/period. The current context shows high On-hand inventory (1234 units) following a massive arrival in Period 23, which resolved a previous stockout. However, there is a significant volume of 'ghost' inventory in the In-transit pipeline. Specifically, orders from P2 (105), P6 (44), P15 (152), P18 (263), and P19 (200) totaling 764 units are severely overdue and confirmed lost. The reported In-transit of 800 units consists of these 764 ghost units plus 36 units from a more recent order (P17). Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock', these 764 phantom units will prevent replenishment until on-hand levels drop below critical safety thresholds, which is acceptable now due to high inventory but dangerous later. For Period 28, I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the ~200 demand regime (P17-P27 avg is ~192). L remains default (2) despite variability as the system is currently overstocked. I'll use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure the backend recognizes the current demand level of ~200 units per period over the 3-period horizon (L+1), effectively setting base_stock around 600, while the phantom-burdened pipeline handles the pause in ordering.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the inventory position is 1,054 units on-hand with 800 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 764 of those 800 in-transit units are confirmed lost (Period 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19 orders totaling 105+44+152+263+200=764). These 'phantom' units permanently inflate the pipeline calculation in the OR backend. The current demand regime has stabilized at an average of ~190-200 units per period since Period 16 (last 5 periods: 205, 158, 184, 219, 200, 180; average = 191). With on-hand inventory at 1,054 and expected future demand at ~200/period, the current stock covers approximately 5 periods. Since the promised lead time is 2, and the inventory is significantly above the target base stock, the OR backend logic (even with the ghost units) will naturally order 0. To ensure the backend doesn't prematurely reorder due to the phantom units when stock eventually dips, I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method (N=13 to cover the period since the demand shift) and L to default. This keeps the target values accurate relative to current demand while the high on-hand balance prevents unnecessary ordering.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at approximately 190-200 units per period since Period 16. The most recent 5-period average (P25-P29) is 198.8 units. On-hand inventory is currently 843 units, which provides a safety buffer of over 4 periods of demand. However, the 'In-transit' pipeline of 800 units is significantly comprised of historical lost shipments (ghost inventory). Evidence suggests that 764 units in the pipeline (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19) are lost and will never arrive. The backend subtracts these 764 phantom units from the target base stock when calculating orders. To maintain adequate stock levels and prevent a future stockout when the current on-hand inventory depletes, mu_hat must be set to compensate for this phantom 764-unit deficit. Calculation: Target base stock for (L+1=3) periods is approximately 600 units (3 * 200). To trigger a replenishment order when the backend thinks we already have 764 units coming, mu_hat needs to be elevated. Since current on-hand (843) + real pipeline (36) is already > 600, no order is needed immediately, but mu_hat must be calibrated so that once on-hand drops below ~600, the 'In-transit' phantom units don't block ordering. Setting mu_hat to 1364 (Target 600 + Ghost 764) ensures the system targets a real inventory level of 600.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stable at approximately 190-200 units per period (the average of the last 15 periods is 195). We are currently drawing down a large surplus from the massive Period 23 arrival. On-hand inventory is 620 units, which covers about 3 periods of demand. Pipeline inventory is currently 800 units, but 764 of those units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19), meaning the effective 'In-transit' inventory is only 36 units (likely from the Period 17 order or similar, though no order was placed in the last 7 periods). To ensure the OR backend triggers an order despite the 764-unit bloat in the 'In-transit' view, I must set mu_hat high enough to satisfy (base_stock - 800) > 0. Since demand is ~200/period and L=2, a standard base_stock (L+1=3 periods) would be ~600, which is less than the 800 units 'in-transit'. Therefore, I use an explicit mu_hat of 1200 (effectively 400 per period for 3 periods) to ensure we start replenishment as the surplus inventory depletes towards the desired safety stock level.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable at an average of approximately 190-200 units per period (last 5 periods average: 197.6). On-hand inventory is 446 units, which covers approximately 2.25 periods of demand. However, the 'In-transit' balance of 800 units contains 764 recognized 'ghost' or lost units (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19), meaning the effective pipeline is only 36 units. Without an order this period, on-hand inventory will likely drop below safety levels in two more periods. To trigger a replenishment from the OR backend, I must compensate for the 764 phantom units in the pipeline calculation. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time (historically 1-3 periods). I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to (1+L) * 200 plus the 764 ghost units. With a calculated L of 2, (1+2)*200 + 764 = 1364. This ensures the base_stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a positive order value despite the perma-bloated pipeline view.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is established at approximately 200 units/period (mean of the last 17 periods is ~194). Current on-hand inventory is 232, and the in-transit view is 918. However, from the carry-over insights, at least 764 units in the pipeline are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). This means the 'effective' pipeline is only 154 units (918 total - 764 phantom). Effective total inventory is ~386 units. With an average lead time of approx 2.2 periods, we need to cover about 3.2 periods of demand (approx 640 units) to avoid stockouts. The OR engine subtracts the full 918 from its target, so I must use 'mu_hat' to artificially boost the 'base_stock' target to compensate for the 764 ghost units. Setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 1400 (640 needed + 764 ghost units) ensures the OR logic triggers an order despite the massive phantom pipeline.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at approximately 190-200 units per period since Period 16 (last 5 periods mean: 198.4). On-hand inventory is 180, and the 'In-transit' balance of 1050 units includes 764 units of confirmed ghost/lost inventory (Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19). The active pipeline consists of orders from P33 (250 units) and recent unfulfilled needs. To bridge the gap created by ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set high enough to trigger replenishment. With a target of ~200 demand per period and a L+1=3 period horizon, the real inventory need is ~600 units. Adding the 764 ghost units to this target (total ~1364) ensures the backend sees a deficit against the reported 1050 + 180 = 1230 current 'inventory position'. I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat comfortably above the ghost-bloated inventory level to maintain stock as on-hand depletes.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at approximately 200 units per period since Period 16 (last 5 periods avg: 202.4). Current on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 34. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1220 units is severely compromised by 'ghost' inventory from historical lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (105), P6 (44), P15 (152), P18 (263), and P19 (200) are long overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 764 units. Subtracting these from the current 1220 'In-transit' leaves a realistic pipeline of 456 units (comprised of orders from P25, P33, and P34). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1220 from its base-stock target, mu_hat must be set explicitly high to force an order and bypass this 764-unit phantom inflation. With L=2 and mean demand ~200, a standard base stock would be ~600. To ensure the backend orders units today given it thinks we have 1220 + 0 on hand, I will set mu_hat to 1600. This provides a buffer to clear the 764 ghost units while maintaining a service level for the 200/period demand.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stable at approximately 200 units per period (last 10 periods average: 198.8). The 'In-transit' balance of 1600 units is significantly compromised by historical lost shipments. Confirmed lost units (ghost inventory) total 764 units (P2: 105, P6: 44, P15: 152, P18: 263, P19: 200). Additionally, orders from Period 33 (250 units) and Period 34 (170 units) are currently undelivered but within or just outside the typical 1-3 period lead time delivery window. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we are in a stockout state, an order must be triggered. Using L=2, the base stock targets (1+L) * demand. With ghost inventory at 764, the OR backend sees 1600 in-transit, perceives 'true' in-transit as 836, and on-hand as 0. To ensure the backend places an order of ~200-400 units to cover the stockout and lead time, mu_hat must be set to compensate for the 764 phantom units. I am setting mu_hat = (1+L) * 200 + 764 = 1364 to force the logic past the phantom pipeline.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stable at an average of approximately 200 units per period (last 10 periods average is 199.2). Recent demand has shown slightly higher volatility, with peaks around 237 units. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 following a stockout in Period 36. The 'In-transit' indicator shows 1430 units; however, historical data confirms a ghost inventory of 764 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19). Additionally, the order from Period 33 (250 units) is now 4 periods overdue, suggesting it may also be lost or severely delayed. If we assume P33 is lost, total ghost units = 1014. Actual pipeline is likely: 1430 - 1014 = 416 units (P35 order of 380 + minor remnants). Given the consistent demand, I will set mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at ~200 units/period. To overcome the backend's inflated 'In-transit' view and ensure replenishment orders are generated, mu_hat must be adjusted upward to account for the ~1014 ghost units. Setting mu_hat to 1600 (600 for demand + 1000 ghost offset) will trigger the necessary replenishment while keeping sigma_hat reflective of recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory in 'In-transit' likely increased to 1014 units as the Period 33 order (250 units) is now 4 periods overdue, joining confirmed losses from P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stabilized around 200 units per period (last 5 periods mean is 210 units). Lead times have settled near the promised 2 periods (P34 and P35 both took 2 periods). However, there is a confirmed massive inflation of the 'In-transit' pipeline. 'Ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, and now P33) totals 1014 units. This ghost inventory tricks the OR backend into thinking we have plenty of stock arriving, which would prevent it from ordering enough to meet actual demand. To counteract this, mu_hat must be set to a value high enough to offset the ghost units and the current on-hand stock (172 units). Total demand to cover for L+1 (3 periods) is approximately 630 units. To trigger a replenishment order of approximately 200-250 units while 'In-transit' + 'On-hand' = 1392, mu_hat needs to be set strategically high. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the standard calculation and account for the 1014 ghost units effectively.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory in 'In-transit' confirmed at 1014 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, and P33). Demand regime stable at ~210 units/period. Lead time is currently averaging 2 periods for recent arrivals.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, the system is in a stockout (On-hand: 0) following a demand of 210 in Period 38. The demand regime remains stable at approximately 200 units per period (last 10 periods average: 203). The 'In-transit' pipeline reported as 1328 units is significantly inflated by 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments. Based on the history, confirmed losses from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, and P33 total 1014 units. Subtracting these from the 1328 reported in-transit units gives an actual effective pipeline of 314 units (comprising the P37 order of 170 units and the P38 order of 108 units, plus minor noise). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to satisfy demand given the 1014-unit ghost inventory bias, mu_hat must be set to cover the desired base stock PLUS the ghost inventory. Desired base stock for L=2 is roughly (2+1)*200 = 600 units. Adding the 1014 ghost units results in a required mu_hat of approximately 1614. Setting mu_hat to 1650 using the 'explicit' method to trigger replenishment and overcome the pipeline bloat. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average recent lead time of 2 periods, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current regime's volatility.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at approximately 200 units per period since Period 16 (last 5 periods average: 201 units). However, the system faces a massive 'In-transit' accounting issue. There is confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 1,014 units (from periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, and now likely 33) that will never arrive but remains in the pipeline calculation. Total In-transit is currently 1,542. Subtracting the 1,014 ghost units leaves an actual pipeline of 528 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite this 1,014-unit inflation, I must override mu_hat to be significantly higher than the actual demand expectation. The base stock target needs to be around (1+L)*200 + safety stock. With L=2 (promised), target should be ~600-700. Since the backend subtracts 1,542 (pipeline) from its calculation, I set mu_hat to 1,800 to force a net positive order that maintains the flow of inventory, effectively bridging the 1,014-unit gap.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory in 'In-transit' remains confirmed at 1,014 units. Demand regime is stable at ~200 units/period (last 5 periods: 201 avg). Actual lead times are erratic but generally average 2 periods (latest observed: 2, 1).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 200 units per period since Period 16 (last 5 periods average: 208.6). Lead times are erratic (averaging ~2 periods recently: 1, 1, 2). The critical issue remains the 'ghost' inventory in the In-transit pipeline. I have confirmed 1,014 units are lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, and P33). The current In-transit total is 1,478, but 1,014 of these will never arrive. To ensure the backend OR engine places an order, mu_hat must be set to compensate for this phantom 1,014 units. The base-stock logic is: order = (mu_hat + safety_stock) - (on_hand + in_transit). With on-hand=105 and in-transit=1478, the backend sees 1,583 units available. To trigger a replenishment of roughly 200-300 units, mu_hat must be set significantly higher than its usual (1+L)*mean value. Using L=2 (promised/recent average), expected demand for (1+L) periods is 600. To offset the 1,014 ghost units and still target a base stock sufficient for demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1,650. This forces the engine to recognize a need despite the bloated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility (N=20).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 200 units per period since Period 16 (mean of last 5 periods: 219.8). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' pipeline is reported at 1545 units. However, consistent with previous periods, a significant portion of this pipeline is comprised of 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments. Verified losses include Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, and 33, totaling 1014 units. Furthermore, the order from Period 37 (170 units) is now 4 periods overdue (promised 2), suggesting it is also lost. This brings estimated total ghost inventory to 1184 units. The backend's base-stock logic subtracts the full 1545 in-transit units from the target level, which would prevent any new orders unless mu_hat is massively over-adjusted. To ensure an order is triggered despite 1545 - 1184 = 361 'real' in-transit units (and 0 on-hand), and to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1), I will set mu_hat to 1600. This value accounts for the ghost units while providing a target that facilitates replenishment to cover the current 200/period demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory in 'In-transit' likely increased to 1184 units as the Period 37 order (170 units) is now 4 periods overdue, joining losses from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, and P33. Actual lead times for surviving orders remain variable between 1-2 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 200 units per period since Period 16 (last 5-period average is 212.2). On-hand inventory is 0, indicating a stockout. The primary challenge is the significant quantity of 'ghost inventory' in the In-transit pipeline. Based on historical data, shipments from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P33, and now Period 37 (which is 6 periods overdue) are highly likely lost. The total confirmed and probable ghost inventory is approximately 1,184 units (105+44+152+263+200+250+170). With a visible In-transit of 1,600 units, only ~416 units (1,600 - 1,184) are likely real incoming stock (from P40, P41, P42). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite this perma-bloated pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to override the base-stock calculation. To cover an expected lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3 periods of demand) plus a safety buffer, I will set mu_hat to 1,800 units. This effectively treats the ghost inventory as non-existent to the backend's replenishment logic.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory in 'In-transit' increased to 1,184 units as P37 order (170 units) is now 6 periods overdue and essentially lost. Total ghost units: P2(105), P6(44), P15(152), P18(263), P19(200), P33(250), P37(170).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 200 units per period since Period 16 (last 5-period average: 210.2). Current on-hand inventory is critically low (8 units). The 'In-transit' figure of 1542 is heavily distorted by 1,184 units of confirmed ghost inventory from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P33, P37). The true functional pipeline consists of orders from P41 (67 units), P42 (55 units), and P43 (200 units). To ensure the OR backend places an order to cover the (L+1) horizon (3 periods ~ 600 units), I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the ghost inventory bias. Setting mu_hat to 'explicit' at 1800 units compensates for the 1,184 ghost units while targeting a base stock that supports the 200/period demand. Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods), so I will use a calculated average to reflect reality.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 200 units per period (last 5 periods mean: 219). On-hand inventory is 0 after multiple periods of stockouts or near-stockouts. The critical challenge remains the systematic 'In-transit' bloat caused by lost/phantom shipments. There are 1,184 units confirmed lost across periods P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P33, and P37. These units will never arrive but the backend OR engine counts them as pipeline inventory, preventing it from placing new orders. To counteract this, mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the 1,184 ghost units to force the OR logic to recognize the need for physical replenishment. I will use L=2 (promised and recent average), and mu_hat = (1+2)*210 + 1184 = 1814. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility (last 10 periods) to handle demand variance during the lead time.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable at approximately 200 units per period (last 5 periods average: 224, driven by higher spikes in P43 and P44). The 'In-transit' inventory of 1559 units is severely inflated by 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments. Based on history, orders from P2 (105), P6 (44), P15 (152), P18 (263), P19 (200), P33 (250), and P37 (170) are confirmed as lost, totaling 1184 ghost units. Excluding these, the effective pipeline is 375 units (likely P44: 250 and P45: 89, plus small residuals). Actual lead times have settled around 2-3 periods recently. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 1184 ghost units inflating the pipeline, mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand (~600 units) PLUS the ghost inventory (1184), approximately 1784 units. Setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 1800 units will bypass the pipeline bloat and trigger necessary replenishment for the final periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stable at approximately 200 units/period (last 5 periods average: 224.8). The in-transit inventory of 1,735 units is heavily distorted by ghost inventory. Total confirmed ghost units are 1,184 (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P33, P37). Furthermore, the order from Period 44 (250 units) is now 3 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting a lead time of 3+ or a potential new loss. Subtracting the 1,184 ghost units from the reported 1,735 results in an effective pipeline of 551 units. To ensure the backend places an order despite the phantom-inflated pipeline, mu_hat is set using an 'explicit' value. I calculate target base stock for a (L+1) window (3 periods) at ~200 demand/period plus the ghost inventory: (3 * 200) + 1184 = 1784. This forces the base-stock logic to recognize that most of the reported pipeline does not exist.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, we face zero on-hand inventory and an In-transit pipeline of 1,784 units. However, as noted in carry-over insights, 1,184 of these units are confirmed as 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 33, and 37). The true functional pipeline is 600 units (1784 - 1184). Demand has been stable at approximately 213 units/period over the last 10 periods (P38-P47). To initiate an order despite the massive (but false) In-transit total, I must provide an 'explicit' mu_hat that exceeds (functional_pipeline + ghost_inventory). With L=2, the base stock targets (1+L) periods of demand. Using a mean of 213, a 3-period demand is ~639. To ensure the backend places an order, mu_hat must be set above the Ghost units (1184) plus the desired replenishment level. I will use mu_hat = 1900 to ensure the policy triggers a meaningful order to cover the current stockout and upcoming demand, effectively bypassing the perma-bloat in the pipeline view.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory in 'In-transit' remains confirmed at 1,184 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P33, P37). Recent demand regime (P38-P47) is stable with an average of 213 units per period. Lead times for recent successful arrivals (P43-P45) have been 2-3 periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 210 units per period since Period 38 (last 10 periods average: 212.8). In-transit inventory is currently showing 1,900 units, but based on the carry-over insights, at least 1,184 of these are 'ghost' units from lost historical shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P33, P37). These ghost units permanently inflate the pipeline inventory calculated by the OR backend, leading to systemic under-ordering and stockouts. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the ghost inventory. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost units to bypass the 'In-transit' subtraction error. With an estimated lead time L=2, the required coverage is 3 periods or ~630 units. Adding the 1,184 ghost units results in a required base stock near 1,814. However, current on-hand is 0 and recent demand is 210-220. I will set mu_hat (which the OR engine converts to base stock) to a high explicit value of 1,850 to ensure the engine triggers an order despite the 1,900 'In-transit' figure. L is set to calculated to reflect the 2-3 period reality, and sigma_hat uses recent_N=10 to capture current volatility.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0 and the current demand regime remains stable around 200-210 units per period (last 10 periods average: 204). The 'In-transit' figure of 1,900 units is heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments). Known losses include: P2 (105), P6 (44), P15 (152), P18 (263), P19 (200), P33 (250), and P37 (170), totaling 1,184 units. Additionally, orders from P44 (250), P45 (89), P46 (176), P47 (49), and P48 (116) are in the pipeline. P44 is now 6 periods since ordering (3 periods beyond the 3nd-period expected arrival window), and P45 is 5 periods since ordering. It is likely that the P44 (250 units) and possibly P45 (89 units) orders are also lost, potentially increasing ghost inventory to 1,523 units. With on-hand at 0, the OR backend sees 'In-transit' as sufficient and won't order. I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat override to bypass this. To cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3), and account for the ~1,500 units of likely phantom inventory, I set mu_hat to 2,100 (approximately (200 * 3) + 1,500) to force a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory in 'In-transit' likely increased to 1,523 units as Period 44 (250 units) and Period 45 (89 units) orders are now significantly overdue (6 and 5 periods respectively) and show signs of being lost shipments alongside previous losses.
