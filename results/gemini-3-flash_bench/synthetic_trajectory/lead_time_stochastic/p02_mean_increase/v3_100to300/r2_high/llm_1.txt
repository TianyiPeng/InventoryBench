The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be usable for Period 3 demand. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I must place an order to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 periods). Based on the historical average (~101/period), the expected demand over three periods is roughly 303 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a slightly higher stock level is preferred to avoid stockouts. I will order 320 units to cover the pipeline and provide a small buffer for the initial periods.",

The 'In-transit' calculation of 2960 units is highly misleading because systematic shipment losses have been confirmed for orders P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 1300 units). Furthermore, the lack of arrivals from P24 and P25 in recent periods suggests a shift back toward a 3-period lead time.
