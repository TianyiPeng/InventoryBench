Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available (88, 148, 80, 84, 103), with a mean of 100.6 and a standard deviation of 27.9. The promised lead time is 2 periods. No orders have been placed yet, and on-hand inventory starts at 0. Given the high variability and the early stage of the game, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to set the baseline for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This ensures the backend calculates the base stock based on the specific distribution seen so far. The OR backend will automatically adjust for the lead time (L+1=3) using these samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 147 units with a promised lead time of 2. As expected, zero units arrived in the Period 1 conclusion phase (arrival resolution happens after the decision). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 147 in-transit. Historical demand over 5 periods averaged 100.6, but Period 1 actual demand was 99. The item 'chips(Regular)' has a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, meaning the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. A base stock policy at the median (z=0) is targetted. I will use the default methods for lead time (L=2) and demand statistics (mean and std of available history) to establish a baseline inventory position that covers L+1=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time (L) is 2. The game history shows orders placed in Period 1 (147 units) and Period 2 (142 units) have not arrived yet. Based on the 'CRITICAL TIMING EXAMPLE' in the instructions, an order placed in Period 1 with L=2 should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and become visible in Period 3's conclude message (which I will read at the start of Period 4). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' in Period 1 and Period 2 conclude messages is expected and does not yet indicate a lead time shift or lost shipment. Demand for the first 5 periods was [88, 148, 80, 84, 103], and recent observed demand in Period 1 and 2 (as reported in the conclude messages) was 99 and 100 respectively. This demonstrates a fairly stable demand regime around a mean of ~100. I will use the default methods for L and sigma_hat, and recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent mean demand trend (including the pre-game samples). mu_hat calculation by the backend will be (1+L)*mean_demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Historical demand for the first three periods has been very stable (99, 100, 99). However, we are currently facing a stockout because no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Order 1 (placed Period 1) was expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in Period 4's start; since 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0, the lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. Consequently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 289 units in transit (147 from P1, 142 from P2). To account for the observed delay and ensure the OR backend sets a sufficient base stock, I will explicitly set L=3. For demand, since the last 3 periods are extremely consistent (mean ~99.3), I will use recent_N with N=3 to stabilize the forecast, as the initial seed data (88, 148, 80...) appeared more volatile than the actual game execution demand so far.

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (visible at start of Period 5), indicating an actual lead time of 3 periods, which is longer than the promised 2. Current inventory status shows 43 units on-hand and 243 in-transit (orders from Period 2 and 4). Historical demand over the first 5 periods (including user provided samples: 88, 148, 80, 84, 103) averages approx 101 units per period. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the actual lead time observed. Since the demand seems relatively stable around a mean of 100-101 but has some variance, I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent behavior while the OR backend accounts for the lengthened lead time (Pipeline Stock = (L+1) * mean).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed as 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived at the end of Period 4).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and 348 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead-time logic reveals a shift. History shows the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3). The Period 2 order (142 units) was also expected to arrive in Period 5 if the lead time was 3, but it has not arrived yet ('arrived=0' in Period 5 conclude), suggesting the lead time is at least 4 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Observed demand is stable: {99, 100, 99, 104, 90}, with a mean of 98.4. Since inventory is currently 0 and we are facing stockouts, I will explicitly set L to 4 to reflect the observed delay and provide a more conservative pipeline coverage. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while accounting for the extended lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed to be at least 3-4 periods (Period 1 arrived at P4; Period 2 order not arrived by P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the system has zero on-hand inventory and 455 units in transit. Historical demand averages 103.8 units per period (samples: 99, 100, 99, 104, 90, 131). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed delivery for the Period 1 order was 3 periods. The Period 2 order (placed Period 2) has not arrived by the end of Period 6 (4 periods elapsed), and the Period 3 order was 0. This confirms a lead time shift to at least 3-4 periods. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the mean demand. To prevent further stockouts given the delayed arrivals, I am setting the lead time (L) to 4 for calculation purposes. I will use the mean of all 6 samples for mu_hat (approx 103.8 * (1+4) = 519) and the standard deviation of all samples for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Lead time confirmed as at least 4 periods (Period 2 order placed P2 not arrived by end of P6). Average demand stable at ~104 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the Period 4 order arrived at the end of Period 7, confirming a Lead Time (L) of 3 periods (Period 4 to Period 7). The Period 2 and Period 3 orders (lead time 2 promised) have not arrived and are significantly overdue, suggesting they are likely lost. Current on-hand inventory is 30 units, and there are 411 units in-transit (excluding the likely lost Period 2 and Period 3 orders, the pipeline consists of orders from Periods 5, 6, and 7 totaling 269 units). Based on the last 7 periods of demand data, the mean demand is approximately 99 units per period (99, 100, 99, 104, 90, 131, 71). To protect against the confirmed lead time of 3 periods and current stockout risks, I will set L to 3 and use recent_N (N=7) for demand and demand volatility to capture the average requirements for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently observed at 3 periods (P1 arrived P4, P4 arrived P7). Shipments from Period 2 and Period 3 are presumed lost after 5+ periods of no arrival.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we saw two arrivals: one from Period 5 (L=3) and one from Period 7 (L=1). This follows the P1 (L=3) and P4 (L=3) pattern, though P7 arrived surprisingly fast. Orders from P2 and P3 are still missing and are now treated as lost (exceeding twice the observed lead time). Demand is relatively stable with a recent average of approximately 100 units (Last 5 periods: 104, 90, 131, 71, 107; Mean = 100.6). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the most frequent observed lead time, resisting the outlier L=1 of P7 to avoid stockouts. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the recent_N method (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility and mean while smoothing out the noise from P6 and P7.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are out of stock (on-hand 0). History shows a volatile lead time. Period 1, 4, and 5 orders arrived with a 3-period lead time. Period 7 arrived with a 1-period lead time. Period 2 and 3 orders (totaling 142 units) are definitely lost. Our in-transit balance (318) consists of orders from Period 6 (107), Period 8 (0, wait - Period 8 ordered 0), Period 9 (69), and whatever was left before. Checking the history: P6 (107), P9 (69) = 176. The system reports 318 in-transit, which implies the the Period 2 (142) order is still technically 'in-transit' but effectively lost (it's been 8 periods). I will set L to 3 based on the most frequent actual lead time observed. Demand remains stable around a mean of ~104. Since we have zero on-hand and the OR engine uses pipeline inventory (which includes the 'zombie' lost order of 142), I need to use an explicit mu_hat to force a higher order volume to compensate for the inventory the OR engine thinks we have but we actually don't.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is consistently 3 periods for successful deliveries (P1, P4, P5 all took 3 periods). P2 (142 units) and P3 (0 units) orders are confirmed lost after 8 periods. P7 had an outlier lead time of 1 period.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable with a mean of approximately 104 units over the last 10 periods. However, the last two periods saw higher demand (111 and 131), suggesting a slight upward trend or increased volatility. Lead time analysis is crucial here: successful deliveries show a pattern of 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), with one anomaly of 1 period (P7). Shipments from P2 and P3 are clearly lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a significant 'in-transit' volume of 496 units (from orders at P6, P9, and P10). Given that L=3 is the reliable observed lead time, I will set L=3. For mu_hat, targeting (1+L) periods of demand (4 periods total), the mean of the samples is 104.8. 4 * 104.8 = 419.2. To account for recent higher demand and the current stockout (on-hand=0), I will use an explicit mu_hat of 440 to ensure the base stock is high enough to satisfy immediate demand once arrivals resume. Sigma_hat is calculated at approximately 18 per period; for (1+L) periods, this is sqrt(4)*18 = 36. I will use 40 to be safe against the recent volatility.

Lead time history shows that while the promised lead time is 2, the successful deliveries (P1, P4, P5) predominantly arrived in 3 periods, though P7 arrived in 1 period, and P2/P3 are confirmed lost. Because P6 (ordered 107 units), P9 (ordered 69 units), and P10 (ordered 178 units) have yet to arrive, and we just passed 5 periods since P6 and 2 periods since P10, we are in a stockout. To recover and properly set the base stock for the OR backend, I will set L=3 based on the most frequent actual lead time and use N=11 for mu_hat to capture the long-term stable mean of ~104. Given 'Profit=1.0' and 'Holding=1.0', the critical ratio q = 0.5, which targets a 50% service level; however, the OR backend's cap and the frequency of lost orders suggest we should ensure the pipeline is healthy. Setting L=3 and using all available samples (N=11) for demand will help stabilize the base stock target.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received orders from Period 9 (69 units, lead time 3) and Period 10 (178 units, lead time 2), resulting in a healthy on-hand inventory of 135 units. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 110 units (recent mean: 112, 99, 131, 111, 107). The observed lead times for successful deliveries are 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, and 2 periods (average approx 2.5). However, orders from P2 and P3 are officially lost. The current in-transit (249 units) includes the order from P6 (107 units), which is now 6 periods late and likely lost, and the order from P7 (57 units), which already arrived in P8 (this is a reporting quirk of the 'in-transit' total often seen in these simulations). For the OR calculation, I will use L=3 to be safe against the frequent 3-period lead time. I'm using recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the current stable consumption rate of ~110 units/period. This ensures the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~440 units) minus the reliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability remains high (1-3 periods); orders not arriving within 5 periods (e.g., P2, P3, P6) should be treated as lost. Demand is currently stable at ~110 units/period.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 110 units (Periods 11-13 average is ~108). The promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual observed delivery times for successful orders have mostly been 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9 all took 3 periods; P10 took 2; P7 took 1). Crucially, multiple orders are confirmed lost (P2, P3, P6). The current in-transit inventory is 313, but this includes the lost P6 order (107 units), meaning the active pipeline is likely 206 (313 - 107). To account for the typical 3-period lead time and maintain a sufficient base stock, I am setting L=3. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*110 = 440 using the recent 3-period demand stability. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility. This approach helps the OR engine calculate a higher base stock to compensate for the extended lead time and historical lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed lost shipment Period 6 (107 units) after 8 periods of no arrival. Active pipeline is total in-transit minus lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit units are 418. Based on historical data, multiple orders are confirmed or highly likely to be lost: P2 (142 units) and P3 (0 units) are over 10 periods old, and P6 (107 units) is 9 periods old. The current actual pipeline inventory is 418 - 142 - 107 = 169 units (from P13 and P14). Lead times for successful deliveries (P1, P4, P5, P7, P9, P10) have been 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, and 2 periods respectively, averaging 2.5 periods; however, the most frequent reliable lead time is 3 periods. I will use L=3 explicitly to ensure the system covers the (L+1) horizon. Demand has been stable around 110-112 units, with a slight uptick in recent periods (P10: 131, P12: 112, P13: 113, P14: 128). I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 5 periods (~119 units per period) multiplied by (1+L).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipments: P2 (142 units), P6 (107 units). Active pipeline is 169 units. Reliability of lead time is centered at 3 periods despite outliers.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 0 on-hand inventory and the system shows 476 units in-transit. However, based on the historical logs and carry-over insights, we must account for lost shipments to determine the actual active pipeline. Orders from Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (107 units) have not arrived after 14 and 10 periods respectively, confirming they are lost. The Period 9 (69 units) and Period 10 (178 units) orders arrived in Period 12. Therefore, the active pipeline consists of orders from Period 13 (64 units), Period 14 (105 units), and Period 15 (58 units), totaling 227 units. The lead time has stabilized around 3 periods for successful deliveries. Average demand over the last 15 periods is approximately 107 units/period. To ensure the OR backend places an order that covers the inventory gap while accounting for the lost units, I am setting L to 3 (the observed mode) and mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (L+1) periods of demand (4 * 107 = 428). This forces the backend to recognize that 428 (target) - 227 (active pipeline) = 201 units are needed, rather than assuming the 476 units in-transit are all coming.

Carry-over insight: Active pipeline is 227 units. Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (107 units) shipments are confirmed lost. Sustained demand average remains at ~107 units/period.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0) following a significant demand spike in Period 16 (280 units). The historical mean was ~107 units, but this jump to 280 needs to be accounted for, even if treated as a potential outlier or early signal of a trend. The 'In-transit' quantity of 412 includes confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (107 units). Subtracting these results in an active pipeline of 163 units (412 - 142 - 107 = 163). These active orders are from Period 14 (105 units) and Period 15 (58 units). I am setting L to 3 based on the most frequent actual lead time observed (Periods 4, 7, 8, 12, 13, and 16 all showed lead times of 2-3 periods). For demand, I will use a recent_N of 5 to incorporate the recent spike while maintaining some stability from prior periods. This will increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock to recover from the stockout and manage the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike at Period 16: demand recorded at 280 units versus a historical average of ~107 (+161% increase). Active pipeline verified as 163 units; Period 2 and 6 orders are confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 16 (280) and Period 17 (289) indicates a significant regime shift compared to the previous average of ~110 units (+155% increase). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total 'In-transit' is 485 units, but history confirms that Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (107 units) shipments are lost. Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 485 - 142 - 107 = 236 units. The observed lead time (L) is consistently 3 periods for successful deliveries. I am setting L=3 explicitly to reflect reality. Since we are in a new high-demand regime (last 2 periods), I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=2 to capture the roughly 285 units/period average (which translates to a base stock for L+1=4 periods of ~1140 units). This should trigger the OR backend to increase order volume to meet the new demand level while considering the 236 units already in the active pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average increased from ~110 to ~285 (+159%). Actual lead time stabilized at 3 periods for successful deliveries.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~110 to approximately 283 units per period (last three samples: 280, 289, 280). With on-hand inventory currently at 0, the goal is to aggressively stock up to meet this new demand level. Based on historical lead times (P13, P14 both arrived at 3 periods), I am setting L to an explicit value of 3 to reflect the observed persistent lead time rather than the promised 2. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+3) * 283 = 1132). Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the volatility within this new period. Note: The in-transit inventory of 780 units includes confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (107 units), totaling 249 units. The backend OR logic must account for this by targeting a base stock that covers the elevated demand despite the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16, with demand jumping from ~110 units to ~280 units (a 154% increase). The last four periods (16-19) show demand of 280, 289, 280, and 264. The average for this new regime is ~278 units. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand 0). Regarding lead times, the most consistent successful lead time is 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 1072 units includes confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (107 units), which should be ignored. The active pipeline consists of orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (58+178+295+292 = 823 units). Period 15 (ordered P15, expected P18/P19) is overdue and likely lost, but to be conservative, I will assume a lead time of 3 for the OR backend to set a base stock covering current high demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the shift accurately.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 16: demand increased from ~110 to ~278 (avg of P16-P19). Lead time is consistently 3 periods for successful deliveries. Shipments from P2, P6, and likely P15 are lost.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~110 units to ~287 units (average of P16-P20: 280, 289, 280, 264, 322). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (the duration of the spike) to capture this new mean. The lead time for successful deliveries is consistently 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P10, P13, P14), despite some variability. Current in-transit inventory is 1113 units, but several shipments must be deducted as lost: P2 (142 units), P6 (107 units), and P15 (58 units) are all significantly past the 3-period lead time. This leaves an active pipeline of 806 units (1113 - 142 - 107 - 58). With on-hand inventory at 0 and a lead time of 3, we need to cover 4 periods of demand (~1148 units). I use L=3 and recent_N=5 for demand parameters to ensure the OR backend aims for this higher service level while acknowledging the actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 16: demand increased from ~110 to ~287 (avg of P16-P20). Actual lead time for successful deliveries is 3 periods. Shipments from P2, P6, and P15 are confirmed lost (each silent > 5 periods).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~110 to ~271 (average of P16-P21). Period 21 saw a slight dip (203), but it's too early to declare a reversal. The lead time for successful deliveries remains consistently at 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P10, P13, P14 all took 3 periods, except for some outliers). Currently, on-hand is 0 and total in-transit is 1148. However, multiple shipments are confirmed/highly likely lost: P2 (142 units, Period 2), P6 (107 units, Period 6), and P15 (58 units, Period 15) which is now 7 periods overdue. Subtracting these (142+107+58=307) from 1148 results in an 'active' pipeline of 841 units. This active pipeline is currently covering roughly 3.1 periods of the new demand average (841 / 271). Given the lead time is 3, we need (L+1) = 4 periods of coverage. I will maintain the L=3 setting and use recent_N (N=6) to capture the higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which allows the OR backend to target a base stock sufficient for the current high-demand environment while accounting for the high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment: P15 (58 units) from Period 15, as it has not arrived after 7 periods. Cumulative lost units (P2, P6, P15) total 307 units. Recent demand volatility increased (standard deviation of P16-P21 is higher than previous periods).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to 22, the average is approximately 282 units/period (280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203, 336), with a standard deviation of roughly 44 units. The promised lead time is 2, but actual successful deliveries (P1, P4, P5, P9, P10, P13, P14) show a modal lead time of 3 periods. I will set L=3.

Regarding the pipeline, 'In-transit' is reported as 1148 units. However, we have confirmed several lost shipments: P2 (142), P6 (107), and P15 (58). These total 307 units. Therefore, the active pipeline is 1148 - 307 = 841 units. This active pipeline consists of orders from P17 (178), P18 (295), P19 (292), P20 (41), and P21 (35). The earliest of these (P17) was placed 6 periods ago, suggesting it may also be lost given the usual 3-period lead time, but I will remain conservative before declaring more losses. The OR backend uses (1+L) periods for base stock. With L=3, we need to cover 4 periods of demand (~1128 units). Since the active pipeline (841) is currently below this target and on-hand is 0, the OR engine needs to compensate. I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment: P15 (58 units) from Period 15. Total confirmed lost units currently stand at 307 (P2, P6, P15). Demand regime from P16-P22 remains stable at a high average of ~282 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 16 onwards) shows a significant shift, with a current average of approximately 282 units per period from P16-P23 (280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203, 336, 282). This represents a sustained higher demand level compared to the initial 110-unit average. Lead times for deliveries that actually arrive have stabilized around 3 periods, although a few outliers (L=2) exist. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline is 1072 units, but several shipments are confirmed lost (Period 2, 6, 15) totaling 307 units. Crucially, the large orders placed in Period 17 (178), 18 (295), and 19 (292) are now overdue (P17 is at L=6, P18 at L=5, P19 at L=4). However, arrivals in P23 (from P20 and P21) suggest that while some orders are lost or heavily delayed, the supply chain is still partially functional. To ensure we capture the higher demand regime, I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat (covering P16-P23). For lead time, while the mode is 3, the current system delay for the bulk of the pipeline warrants setting L to 3 to ensure we order enough to cover the lead time + review period. Sigma_hat will be set using recent_N to capture the increased volatility of the high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed massive pipeline uncertainty: Orders from P17 (178), P18 (295), and P19 (292) are significantly overdue (4-6 periods), while later orders from P20/P21 arrived in 2-3 periods. This indicates a 'bottleneck' or 'leapfrogging' delivery pattern where older large orders may be lost or severely delayed.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~110 to ~285 units per period. The recent 9-period average (P16-P24) is 287 units. The effective inventory position is severely compromised by overdue and likely lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P17 (178 units), P18 (295 units), and P19 (292 units) are now 5-7 periods overdue, while P20 and P21 arrived normally in 2-3 periods. This 'leapfrogging' strongly suggests the shipments from P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 765 units) are lost. Moving into Period 25, the total 'In-transit' is 1128. If we subtract the confirmed lost units from earlier periods (P2, P6, P15 = 307 units) and the likely lost large block (P17, P18, P19 = 765 units), the active pipeline is only 56 units (the P24 order). With on-hand inventory at 0 and a target base stock for a 3-period lead time requiring covering 4 periods of demand (approx 1150 units), the OR backend needs to place a massive order. I will use 'explicit' values for L and mu_hat to signal the permanent shift in lead time and demand, and set sigma_hat based on the high-volatility regime since Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Highly likely that orders from Period 17 (178), 18 (295), and 19 (292) are lost, as they have been leapfrogged by confirmed arrivals from Period 20 and 21. Total estimated lost units in transit: 1072 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~110 units to an average of ~293 units (P16-P25). The most recent demand at Period 25 was 375, suggesting a possible further upward trend or high volatility. Lead time for successful deliveries remains centered around 3 periods. However, the system is plagued by lost shipments. In-transit inventory is 1150 units, but orders from P17 (178), P18 (295), and P19 (292) are now 6-8 periods old and have been 'leapfrogged' by arrivals from P20 and P21. Following the established pattern, these 765 units are likely lost. Additionally, P2 (142), P6 (107), and P15 (58) are confirmed lost. Total estimated loss = 1072 units. Effective pipeline = 1150 - 1072 = 78 units. With on-hand at 0, the backend needs to order significantly to cover the new high-demand regime (mu_hat) while the L=3 setting ensures the order is sized to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. I use recent_N=10 to capture the high-demand regime since Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipments from Period 17 (178 units), Period 18 (295 units), and Period 19 (292 units) due to leapfrogging by P20/P21 and exceeding 6+ periods of delay. Total confirmed/highly likely lost units: 1072.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, increasing from ~110 to ~290 units per period. The average demand for the last 11 periods (P16-P26) is approximately 291 units. Lead times for successful deliveries center around 3 periods. However, the system is currently facing a massive crisis with 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Orders from Period 17 (178 units), Period 18 (295 units), and Period 19 (292 units) are extremely overdue (7-9 periods) and have been leapfrogged by successful arrivals from Period 20 and 21. Following the strategy to treat leapfrogged, long-overdue orders as lost, I am discounting P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 from the effective pipeline. Total confirmed/likely lost = 142(P2)+107(P6)+58(P15)+178(P17)+295(P18)+292(P19) = 1,072 units. Reported In-transit is 1,179 units, meaning the 'active' pipeline is only 107 units (orders from P20-P26 that haven't arrived yet). Current on-hand is 0. To ensure the OR engine orders enough to meet the new high-demand regime (~291 units/period), I use 'explicit' for mu_hat at (1+L)*291 = 1164 and set L to 3. Sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value (200) to account for recent volatility and lost shipment risk.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 27, shipments from P17, P18, and P19 are officially treated as lost (leapfrogged and >7 periods old). Total cumulative lost inventory: 1072 units. Active pipeline is effectively 107 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 16 onwards) shows a significant increase, averaging approximately 287 units per period (P16-P27 average is ~283, with P24-P27 showing a slight upward trend). On-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit of 1179 units is misleading because it includes confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (142), Period 6 (107), Period 15 (58), Period 17 (178), Period 18 (295), and Period 19 (292). Total lost units = 1072. Therefore, the actual active pipeline is 1179 - 1072 = 107 units (orders from P24, P25, P26). Successful delivery lead times have stabilized around 2-3 periods. Using recent_N=12 for demand to capture the high-regime average (~283) and high volatility. Setting L to recent_N=5 reflects the actual 2-3 period lead time observed for successful deliveries, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the current demand shift while factoring in the significant pipeline deficit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $29.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 remains sustained with an average demand of approximately 293 units/period (P16-P28). Recent demand variability is high. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 1150 units, but a significant portion is confirmed or highly likely to be lost based on 'leapfrogging' and extreme delays. Specifically, orders from P2 (142), P6 (107), P15 (58), P17 (178), P18 (295), and P19 (292) are treated as lost, totaling 1072 units. The active pipeline is thus 1150 - 1072 = 78 units (orders from P24, P25). The actual lead time for successful deliveries typically centers around 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the new demand level despite the perceived high pipeline, I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=13, covering the high-demand regime) and L=3 to reflect the consistent physical arrival time of successful shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Active pipeline verified at 78 units. Total lost units confirmed at 1072 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). High demand regime (avg ~293) stable for 13 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 30. Demand context: A high-demand regime is sustained since Period 16. Mean demand from Period 16-29 is ~293 units/period (280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203, 336, 282, 315, 375, 251, 298, 330, 257). Pipeline reconciliation: Total In-transit is 1177 units. However, based on 'leapfrogging' and long delays, 1072 units are confirmed as lost (P2: 142, P6: 107, P15: 58, P17: 178, P18: 295, P19: 292). Subtracting these from the 1177 in-transit leaves an active, viable pipeline of only 105 units (P24: 56, P25: 22, P29: 27). To ensure the OR engine orders effectively, I use 'explicit' for mu_hat based on the high regime (approx 293 * (1+L)) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility. Promised L is 2, but actual for successful deliveries is typically 3 periods. Using L=3 for parameters to account for the current lead-time reality.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 31. Demand context: A significant regime shift occurred at Period 16, with demand increasing from ~110 to ~293 units/period. The mean demand for the last 15 periods (P16-P30) is approximately 287. Lead time for successful deliveries typically oscillates between 2 and 3 periods, but supply chain reliability is poor. Confirmed/highly likely lost shipments include P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19, totaling 1072 units. The current 'In-transit' figure is 1177, but after subtracting these 1072 lost units, the effective active pipeline is only 105 units (consisting of orders from P24, P25, P26, and P29). With 0 on-hand inventory and a demand rate near 300, the system is severely under-stocked. I will set the lead time to an explicit '3' to account for the typical successful delivery window. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the high-demand regime since Period 16, which will signal the OR backend to place a large corrective order to cover the (L+1) period demand (~1150 units) minus the small active pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Active pipeline adjustment: Total in-transit (1177) includes 1072 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Effective active pipeline as of P31 is 105 units.

The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~110 to ~290 units per period. Examining the recent 16 periods (P16-P31), the mean demand is approximately 295. Currently, the system shows an In-transit total of 1177 units. However, based on the carry-over insights and historical logs, the shipments from Period 2 (142), Period 6 (107), Period 15 (58), Period 17 (178), Period 18 (295), and Period 19 (292) are almost certainly lost as they have been leapfrogged by more recent arrivals and are long overdue. The total confirmed lost units are 1072. Subtracting this from 1177 leaves an active pipeline of 105 units. My goal is to ensure the base stock (L+1 periods of demand) is covered. I will set L to 3 (the most frequent successful lead time) and use recent_N for mu_hat (N=16) to capture the high-demand regime. This will signal the OR backend to place an order to reach the required inventory level, effectively ignoring the 'ghost' units in the pipeline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~110 to ~297 (average of P16-P32). In-transit inventory is currently 1177 units, but 1072 of those units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) as they have been leapfrogged by more recent arrivals or have exceeded 8+ periods of delay. Consequently, the active pipeline is only 105 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a lead time of 3 periods, we need to significantly increase the base stock. Setting mu_hat using the last 17 periods (N=17) captures the high-demand regime, while L=3 reflects the consistent successful delivery time. The OR backend will see the high in-transit number (1177); to force an order despite this, I must set mu_hat to a level that accounts for the 'zombie' units in-transit. Since the OR engine subtracts total in-transit (1177) from base_stock, I will use an explicit mu_hat that is (Active Demand Forecast * (L+1)) + Confirmed Lost Units to bridge the inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total 'zombie' units (lost but still in-transit) confirmed at 1072. Active pipeline is only 105 units. High demand regime (P16-P32) average is 297 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34, we are in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16, with an average demand of ~297 units per period. The primary challenge is the significant quantity of 'zombie' units in the pipeline. Total in-transit is 1818, but 1072 of these are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The active pipeline consists of P24 (56), P25 (22), P29 (27), and P33 (641), totaling 746 units. On-hand is 0. Lead time for successful deliveries remains centered around 3 periods. To ensure the OR engine places the necessary order to cover this demand gap despite the 'zombie' units inflating the pipeline count, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 and an explicit mu_hat. The mu_hat is calculated at (1+3) * 300 = 1200. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 1800 (equivalent to ~450/period) will help the OR backend overcome the 'zombie' inventory (1072) and the active pipeline (746) to force an order that replenishes stock for the next cycle, accounting for the stockout state.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~110 units to an average of ~297 units (calculated from P16 to P34). Lead times for successful deliveries center around 3 periods, although significant reliability issues exist. There is a massive quantity of 'zombie' units in the 'In-transit' figure; specifically, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 1072 units) are confirmed lost based on leapfrogging by later deliveries and being over 10 periods old. Subtracting these from the current In-transit (1818 - 1072) leaves an active pipeline of 746 units. The order placed in P33 (641 units) is the primary component of this active pipeline and is expected to arrive around P36. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock to cover the high demand regime and high lead-time variability, I am setting L to 3 (based on sustained observation) and using the recent 19-period window (P16-P34) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-shift demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high demand regime (P16-P34) avg is 297 units/period. Substantial 'zombie' in-transit inventory detected: 1072 units from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19 are confirmed lost, leaving an active pipeline of 746 units as of P35.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 297 units/period (P16-P35). The 'In-transit' figure of 1818 units is heavily inflated by 'zombie' units: 1072 units from periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19 are confirmed/highly likely lost. Additionally, orders from P24 (56), P25 (22), P26 (already arrived), and P29 (27) are either arrived or overdue, while P33 (641) is still within the expected 3-period lead time window. Accounting for lost units (1072) and arrivals, the effective active pipeline is 746 units. Lead time for successful deliveries typically stabilizes at 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend covers demand for the lead time (3) plus the review period (1), I am setting mu_hat to cover 4 periods of demand (~1188 units) using a recent_N of 20 to capture the high-demand regime since P16.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~110 units to an average of ~297 units per period (P16-P36). Recent demand has been volatile, making a higher safety stock necessary. The supply chain is highly unreliable: 1072 units from orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 are confirmed/highly likely lost (leapfrogged by multiple later arrivals or >15 periods overdue). Although the system shows 1818 units in-transit, 1072 are 'zombie' units, meaning the active pipeline is only 746 units (from P33, which hasn't arrived yet). Lead time for successful deliveries typically clusters at 3 periods. I will use lead time L=3 and set mu_hat based on the last 21 samples (the high-demand regime) to ensure the OR backend generates orders sufficient to cover this new average and account for the significant pipeline loss.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high demand regime (P16-P36) average is 298 units/period. Active pipeline adjustment: Total in-transit (1818) includes 1072 'zombie' units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19), leaving an effective active pipeline of 746 units. Lead time for viable shipments remains centered at 3 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a sustained high-demand regime (Period 16 onwards) with an average demand of approximately 298 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 1818 units in-transit, but based on historical leapfrogging and excessive delays, 1072 of these are 'zombie units' (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) that are confirmed or highly likely lost. The effective active pipeline consists of orders from P24 onwards, totaling 746 units (56+22+29+27+641). Specifically, a large order of 641 units was placed in P33 and is expected to arrive within the range of P35-P37 given the typical 3-period lead time; however, no arrivals were recorded in P37 conclude. This suggests P38 will likely see these arrivals. I will use 'recent_N' with N=22 (covering the high-demand period from P16-P37) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR engine targets the current demand level. I will use 'explicit' lead time L=3 to account for the consistently observed physical lag of 3 periods, ensuring the base stock covers (3+1) periods of demand.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~110 to an average of ~293 units/period (P16-P38). Current inventory status is critical: on-hand is 0, and the in-transit field (1818 units) contains 1072 'zombie' units from older, confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). This leaves an effective active pipeline of 746 units. These active units primarily consist of the order from Period 33 (641 units) and others from Period 24-29. Given the consistent history of a 3-period lead time for successful deliveries, and the fact that we have been out of stock for many periods due to lost shipments, the priority is to maintain inventory levels based on the high demand regime. I set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the consistent actual lead time. mu_hat is set to the recent average demand of 293 * (1+3) = 1172. sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for the increased volatility (Standard Deviation ~40, so sqrt(4)*40 = 80).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 remains stable, with current period demand averaging 292 units/period (P16-P39). The lead time for successful deliveries remains approximately 3 periods. Total in-transit inventory (1818 units) is heavily distorted by confirmed 'zombie' units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19) totaling 1072 units that have been leapfrogged or are significantly overdue. Subtracting these from the total in-transit leaves an active pipeline of 746 units. These 746 units consist of orders from P24 (56), P25 (22), P29 (27), and P33 (641). Lead time for P24-P29 has now exceeded 10 periods, making them highly suspect, but P33 (641 units) is only 7 periods old and is the primary expected replenishment. Given the stockout state (on-hand = 0), setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the high-demand regime (last 24 periods) and assuming an explicit lead time of 3 periods to account for the consistent delivery delay observed for non-lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: High demand regime (P16-P39) confirmed at ~292 units/period. Active pipeline significantly decoupled from 'In-transit' due to 1072 units of confirmed lost 'zombie' stock (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from ~110 units to ~292 units per period. Evaluating the high-demand window (P16-P40, 25 samples), the mean is 292.0 and the standard deviation is 44.4. Lead time for successful deliveries remains centered at 3 periods, although significant supply chain disruptions occurred. Specifically, 1072 units are confirmed as 'zombie' stock (lost from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19) but remain in the system's in-transit count. The total in-transit is 1818, so the effective active pipeline is 746 units (1818 - 1072). These 746 units are from the order placed in Period 33, which is now at L=7. Since L=7 exceeds the typical 3-period lead time, there is a high risk this order is also delayed or lost. However, to avoid over-ordering before the Period 33 order is officially declared lost (using the 8-period rule), I will set L to 3 (observed lead time) and use the recent 25 samples for demand. This helps the OR backend compute a base stock that accounts for the high demand regime while being constrained by the active pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Effective active pipeline is 746 units (Total 1818 - 1072 'zombie' units). The Period 33 order of 641 units is currently 7 periods old and overdue, nearing the 'lost' threshold of 8 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high demand regime (P16-P41) average is approximately 293 units/period. On-hand inventory is 0. Total in-transit inventory is 1818 units, but 1072 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost 'zombie' units. Additionally, the order from Period 33 (641 units) is now 8 periods overdue and has been leapfrogged by no newer arrivals, suggesting it is also lost. Considering P33 lost (1072 + 641 = 1713), the active pipeline is effectively only 105 units (1818 - 1713). This explains why no arrivals have occurred for many periods despite high demand. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high demand regime (P16-P41) and an 'explicit' L of 3 to stabilize the backend. This setup will trigger a significant order to replenish the stock given the 0 on-hand and depleted active pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Period 33 order (641 units) is now confirmed lost after 9 periods of no arrival and leapfrogging logic. Total 'zombie' units in-transit is 1713. Active pipeline is only 105 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from ~110 units to ~293 units per period. Since Period 16, the average demand (P16-P42) is approximately 293.4 units, with a standard deviation of 45.4. We are currently facing a significant inventory crisis due to 'zombie' units\u2014orders that appear 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost. Total in-transit is 1818, but 1713 units are confirmed lost: P2(142), P6(107), P15(58), P17(178), P18(295), P19(292), and now P33(641). The P33 order is now 9 periods old and has been leapfrogged by the end of the game's cycle, confirming its loss. This leaves an effective active pipeline of 105 units (1818 - 1713). On-hand inventory is 0. With L=3 and a 4-period planning horizon (L+1), we require approximately 1172 units (293 * 4) to meet demand, whereas our active pipeline is only 105. I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect this high-demand regime and use L=3 based on consistent delivery history for successful orders. sigma_hat is set to capture the recent volatility. The OR backend will order the maximum allowed by the cap because our pipeline is vastly under-stocked.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed lost shipment Period 33 (641 units) after 9 periods of no arrival and leapfrogging. Total 'zombie' units in-transit: 1713. High demand regime (P16-P42) stable at ~293 units/period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime (starting Period 16) with an average demand of ~293 units/period and high volatility. Inventory management has been severely hampered by 'zombie' units in-transit: shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 33 (totaling 1713 units) are confirmed lost due to leapfrogging or exceeding a 9-period delay. The current 'In-transit' figure is 1818, but the effective active pipeline is only 105 units. With 0 units on-hand, we are experiencing persistent stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the high-demand regime characteristics since Period 16. I am setting L to 3 explicitly to reflect the most common lead time for successful deliveries, ensuring the OR backend targets a stock level sufficient for (L+1) = 4 periods of high demand to recover from the stockout and account for the lost pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: 'Zombie' in-transit inventory remains at 1713 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P33). Effective active pipeline is 105 units. High demand regime (P16-P43) average is 293 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the game is nearing its conclusion (Period 50). We are in a sustained high-demand regime that began at Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 293 units/period. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' shown is 1818 units, but based on historical 'leapfrogging' and arrival patterns, 1713 of these units are confirmed 'zombie' units (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P33). Consequently, the effective active pipeline is 105 units (referring to later orders), but there have been no arrivals since Period 28. Given that successful lead times center around 3 periods, but reliability is extremely low, I must set parameters to trigger a significant restock to cover the remaining 5 periods of the game. I will use 'explicit' for L to reflect the 3-period reality, and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the high-regime average (~293). To maximize reward in the final stretch while accounting for the high probability of shipment failure, I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Effective active pipeline is 105 units; total 'zombie' units (lost in transit) confirmed at 1713. High demand regime (P16-P44) remains stable at ~293 units/period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that started at Period 16, with demand averaging approximately 293 units per period. The inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0 and the official 'In-transit' count (1818) is heavily inflated by 'zombie' units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P33). Total confirmed lost units are 1713 (1072 + 641), which means the effective active pipeline is only 105 units (1818 - 1713). To restore service levels and reconcile the OR engine's view of inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the effective stockout. Since L is typically 3 periods and we need to cover (L+1) periods of demand, the target base stock is ~1172 units. With only 105 units in the active pipeline and 0 on-hand, the gap is ~1067 units. By setting mu_hat explicitly and using a calculated L, I ensure the backend orders enough to overcome the 'zombie' units which it incorrectly believes will arrive.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable at a high average of approximately 293 units per period. The primary challenge is the significant quantity of 'zombie' units in the 'In-transit' pipeline. Based on cross-period tracking and leapfrogging logic, we have confirmed that shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 33 (totaling 2354 units) are lost. Specifically, Period 33 (641 units) is now 14 periods old and has been leapfrogged by successful (though older) deliveries. Current 'In-transit' is 1818, but all these units are confirmed 'zombie' units from the mentioned lost periods (P17, P18, P19, P33). Consequently, the effective active pipeline is 0 units. With On-hand inventory at 0 and an active pipeline of 0, the backend needs to place a significant order to cover the (L+1) horizon. I am setting L=3 to reflect the consistent lead time of successful deliveries, and mu_hat to 1172 (which is (3+1) * 293) to restore the base stock. sigma_hat is set based on the recent volatility of the high-demand regime (P16-P46).

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Total 'zombie' units in-transit confirmed at 2354 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P33). Effective active pipeline is 0. High demand regime (P16-P46) average is 293 units/period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a high regime mean of ~293 units/period since Period 16. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1818 is extremely misleading because it is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (zombie stock). Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P33 (totaling 2354 units) are confirmed lost due to leapfrogging or extreme delays exceeding 9 periods. The active pipeline is technically 0. To trigger the OR backend to place an order that restores the inventory position, I will use an 'explicit' L to reflect the observed 3-period lead time and use 'recent_N' for demand (N=32, covering the high-demand regime since P16) to calculate a base stock that covers the lead time plus current review period. Since the engine subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock', and 1818 is less than the required inventory for 4 periods of demand at 293 units/period (~1172), I must ensure the parameters account for the fact that nearly all current in-transit units are non-existent.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Total 'zombie' units in-transit (confirmed lost) increased to 2354. However, the system's 'In-transit' status shows 1818, which implies some internal clearing of the oldest lost orders, but this 1818 still consists entirely of lost shipments (P17, P18, P19, P33). Effective active pipeline is 0.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. The game concludes after Period 50's demand resolution. Any order placed now in Period 49 with an expected lead time of 3 periods (the established operational lead time) will arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game's horizon. Even if we use the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order would arrive in Period 51, which is also past the conclusion. There is 0 on-hand inventory and the 'In-transit' balance of 1818 units consists entirely of 'zombie' units (confirmed lost shipments from Periods 17, 18, 19, and 33). Therefore, the effective active pipeline is 0. Since no new orders can arrive before the game ends, placing an order now would only incur potential ordering costs (if any) or simply result in units that never arrive to satisfy demand. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to 0 to ensure the OR backend does not place an unnecessary final order.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: No new orders placed as they cannot arrive before the game ends (P50). Remaining in-transit inventory (1818 units) confirmed as lost 'zombie' stock.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final period of the game. Based on the rules, any order placed now would arrive at earliest during Period 51 or 52, which is outside the game window. Since the game concludes at the end of Period 50, placing an order now would incur costs without providing any opportunity for sales. Historically, the supply chain has been highly unreliable with a lead time of 2-3 periods for successful deliveries and a high rate of lost shipments (zombie units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the remaining in-transit inventory of 1818 units is confirmed 'zombie' stock that has been lost. Consequently, the optimal strategy for the final period is to maintain zero orders.
