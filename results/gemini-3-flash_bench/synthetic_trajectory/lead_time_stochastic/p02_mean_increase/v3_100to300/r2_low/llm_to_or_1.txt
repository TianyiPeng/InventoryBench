Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Historically, the first 5 periods show a mean demand of 100.6 units (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) with a standard deviation of approximately 28.5. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since we have no inventory on-hand or in-transit, we need to establish a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior while excluding potential outliers like the 148 in Period 2 if they don't persist. This will set parameters based on the observed mean of ~100 per period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we started with 0 on-hand inventory and observed a demand of 134 for 'chips(Regular)'. Since our 'In-transit' is 147 (ordered in Period 1), and the promised lead time is 2 periods, we expect this arrival during Period 3 (visible in P4). History shows high initial demand volatility (P1: 134, vs user samples P1-5: 88, 148, 80, 84, 103). Given we have zero current on-hand inventory and a lead time of 2, we need to set parameters that cover demand for 3 periods (L+1). I will use the average of the provided historical samples (approx 100.6) and the observed Period 1 demand (134) to inform the forecast. Calculating the mean of all 6 known data points (88+148+80+84+103+134)/6 = 106.16. I'll use 'default' for mu_hat initially to capture all available history until a distinct regime change is confirmed. Sigma will also be set to default to handle the observed variance.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including those from the provided data set) is: 88, 148, 80, 84, 103. The average demand is approximately 100.6 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 147 units; per the 'Lead Time Definition', this order should arrive during Period 3 (Period N+L) and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit inventory is 300 (orders from P1 and P2). Since demand hasn't been met yet (sold=0 in P1 and P2 due to 0 starting inventory), we have significant backlogged demand or lost sales. To stabilize, I will use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility calculations. Given the volatility (range 80-148), N=5 captures the available history effectively.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Historical demand for the first 3 periods was 134, 79, and 124 (average ~112). The lead time is promised at 2 periods. Orders were placed in P1 (147 units) and P2 (153 units). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start state. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0 for chips(Regular). This suggests either a lead time delay or a lost shipment. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 300 units in transit (P1+P2 orders), we must ensure the backend accurately reflects the current demand regime. Given the discrepancy in arrival, I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the OR engine adjust if data persists, and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=3 to capture the early volatility while waiting for inventory to arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are reviewing the status of 'chips(Regular)'. The promised lead time is 2, but the only concluded order (placed in Period 1) arrived in Period 4, indicating an actual lead time of 3 periods (L=3). There is a significant amount in transit (190 units), which likely includes the order from Period 2 (153 units) and Period 4 (37 units). Demand has been relatively consistent but volatile, with samples: 88, 148, 80, 84, 103 (Mean: 100.6, Std Dev: 27.6). Given the lead time observation of 3, the backend needs to cover 1+L = 4 periods of demand. I will set L to 3 (explicitly) to reflect the observed reality and use recent_N for demand parameters based on all 5 samples available to stabilize the forecast.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed as 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 4), exceeding the promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3). The order from Period 2 (153 units) has not yet arrived as of Period 5 conclude, meaning it has already taken at least 3 periods. This confirms the lead time is longer than the promised 2. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has fluctuated between 79 and 137, with an average of approximately 112 over 5 periods. Because profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0). However, given the zero inventory and the confirmed lead-time delay (L=3), I will set L to 3 to ensure the pipeline covers more periods of demand. I will use the mean of all 5 samples (~112.2) to project demand over (1+L) periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as at least 3 periods (P1 order arrived P4; P2 order pending 3+ periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The inventory situation is critical as the on-hand stock is 0 and we have experienced significant stockouts. Reviewing the history: The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show a lead time of at least 3 periods (P1 arrived in P4). Order from P2 (placed in P2) has not arrived as of P6 conclude, meaning its lead time is >= 4 periods. This suggests an unreliable supply chain or a systematic lead time shift. Demand history (P1-P6): 134, 79, 124, 137, 87, 102. Average demand is approx 110.5. Since we are stockout-constrained, I need to adjust the OR parameters to account for the increased lead time (L=3 or 4) to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. Given that P2's order is still missing at the start of P7, I will treat L as 4 to be safe. mu_hat needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the average of all 6 samples (~110.5), mu_hat should be ~552.5. sigma_hat will be based on the standard deviation of all samples (~24.6) scaled by sqrt(5).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as at least 4 periods (P2 order placed in P2 still not arrived by P6 conclude). Average demand remains stable around 110 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we continue to see significant supply chain delays. The lead time is currently observed at 3 periods (P1 arrived P4, P4 arrived P7), but the order from P2 (placed 6 periods ago) and P3 (none placed) have not materialized, suggesting a high risk of lost shipments or extreme delays. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have missed substantial demand in periods 5 and 6. Historical demand from periods 1-7 (134, 79, 124, 137, 87, 102, 48) averages approximately 101.6 units per period. Despite the promised lead time of 2, the actual lead time is consistently 3 or more. I will set L to 3 to reflect the actual observed delay. Demand appears relatively stable but with high volatility; I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the most recent demand trends while forecasting for the (L+1) window. This approach aims to build a higher pipeline to compensate for the stockouts and delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 3 periods (P4 order arrived P7). High risk of lost shipments: Period 2 order (placed Period 2) is missing for 6 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-111.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the inventory standing is relatively healthy with 197 units on-hand and 233 in-transit. Analyzing lead times: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 4 arrived in 3, Period 5 arrived in 3, and Period 7 arrived in a surprising 1 period. The Period 2 order is officially considered lost as it is now 7 periods overdue. The average demand across all periods is approximately 100 units (avg: 99.6), and it appears relatively stable without clear seasonal shifts. Given the volatility in lead times (ranging from 1 to 3+ periods), I will set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to average observed arrivals, but I will adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the most recent demand variance. This conservatively accounts for the fact that while demand is stable, the supply chain is erratic, necessitating a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Supply chain inconsistency confirmed; lead times varied between 1 and 3 periods recently, while the Period 2 order is confirmed lost (missing 7+ periods). Average demand remains stable at ~100 units.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a stable demand regime despite some fluctuation, with a mean of approximately 94 units over the last 9 periods. The supply chain remains unpredictable: while the promised lead time is 2, observed lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods recently (P4 arrived in P7 [3], P5 arrived in P8 [3], P7 arrived in P8 [1]). The Period 2 order is officially considered lost after 7+ periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 151 with 233 units in-transit (from orders in P6 and P7). To account for the observed supply chain volatility and the risk of extended 3-period lead times, I will set L to 3. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=9) to capture the current demand distribution accurately while excluding the initial stock-out periods from the variance calculation if possible, though the full history is relatively short.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-33.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe on-hand inventory of 92 units and a pipeline of 233 units. Historical analysis confirms that the Period 2 order (153 units) is lost, as it is now 9 periods overdue. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent observed delay. Demand has softened recently: the average demand in the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is 68.2 units, compared to the overall average of 90.2. Specifically, the last three periods (P8-P10) averaged 63.6 units. Given the lost shipment and recent lower demand, I will set L to 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of arrival times. I will use the last 5 periods to estimate mu_hat to account for the recent cooling in demand, and use the last 10 periods for sigma_hat to capture the underlying volatility. Setting L=3 and using recent demand prevents over-ordering into a potentially descending demand curve while maintaining a buffer for lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Average demand has decreased from ~110 to ~68 units over the last 5 periods (P6-P10). Lead time variability persists between 1-3 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current observation shows on-hand inventory is 0. Demand history indicates a regime shift starting around Period 7, with demand dropping from a mean of ~110 to ~70 over the last 5 periods (Periods 7-11: 48, 86, 46, 59, 113; average = 70.4). The Period 2 order (153 units) remains missing and is likely lost, while 233 units remain 'In-transit' from recent decisions. Lead times have been highly variable, observed as 1 and 3 periods recently. Given the stockout in Period 11 (sold 92 of 113 demand), we need to maintain a higher base stock to recover service levels. I will set L to 3 to reflect the consistent upper range of observed lead times, protecting against supply delays. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the lower-demand regime while accounting for the recent spike (113) in Period 11.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand for Period 7-11 is ~70 units, down from early-game averages of ~110. Period 2 order is officially treated as lost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shifted significantly from a historical average of ~110 to a recent 5-period average of ~67 units. Lead times have been highly volatile, recorded as 1 and 3 periods recently, while the Period 2 order (153 units) is confirmed lost. Because on-hand is zero and a new order of 49 units was placed in Period 12 (expected around P14-P15), we must re-calibrate parameters. I am setting L=3 to account for the observed upper bound of lead time variability. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the lower demand regime (avg ~67), and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These settings aim to maintain a sufficient base stock (targeting ~268 units) to cover the likely 3-4 period lead-time window while acknowledging the lost pipeline units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are facing an out-of-stock situation with 0 units on-hand. The total 'In-transit' quantity is 298 units, which accounts for orders placed in P6 (80), P12 (49), and P13 (169 - note: the history shows P12 ordered 49 and P13 ordered 16; however, the in-transit balance is 298, suggesting significant pending quantities). Historically, the P2 order is lost. Recent lead times have stabilized around 2-3 periods (P7 order arrived in 1 period, P4/P5 arrived in 3). I will use L=3 to be safe given the current depletion. Demand analysis shows a shift: the mean demand for the last 7 periods (P7-P13) is approximately 78.7 units, compared to the initial ~110. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using L=3 (requiring coverage for 4 periods of demand). By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 7 periods (recent_N=7), we align the order logic with the current lower demand regime while accounting for the high lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Average demand for P7-P13 is ~79 units. Supply chain remains unreliable with lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3+ periods; P6 order (80 units) is now 8 periods overdue and potentially lost.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 308 in-transit. The demand regime has experienced a shift; while earlier periods averaged ~110, the last 8 periods (P7-P14) have averaged ~80.6 units per period, though recent demand (P11-P14) has spiked back up slightly (113, 68, 118, 104). The supply chain is highly unreliable: lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, and significant shipments are likely lost (P2 order and P6 order). Because P11-P14 demand shows a return to higher levels (avg ~100), I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods to capture this recent increase. I will use an explicit L of 3 to reflect the observed reliable maximum lead time and account for the pipeline risk. Sigma_hat is set to recent volatility to manage the demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime recovered: After a slump, demand for P11-P14 has returned to an average of ~100. supply chain remains high-risk with multiple likely lost orders (P2, P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we transition from a demand slump back to a higher demand regime. Recent demand (P11-P15) averages ~106 units per period, a significant recovery from the previous period's average of ~70. The supply chain remains highly unstable: we observed two potential lost orders (P2 and P6) and lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (most recently 3 periods for the P12 order). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 354 units in-transit. However, accounting for lost shipments (P2=153 units, P6=80 units), the 'effective' pipeline is closer to 121 units (354 - 233). To ensure we cover demand over the expected lead time plus the review period (L+1), I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and forecasting demand using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent recovery to ~100 units/period. This approach instructs the OR backend to target a base stock sufficient for the current demand levels while acknowledging the extended lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P11-P15 average demand is 105.8 units, returning to early-game levels. P6 order (80 units) is now 10 periods overdue and officially treated as lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU is facing a severe stockout following a massive demand spike of 368 units in Period 16, which significantly exceeds the historical average of ~100. Despite having 408 units in transit, the current on-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of the supply chain shows that the Period 2 and Period 6 orders are almost certainly lost (way beyond the observed 1-3 period lead time). Recent arrivals (P12 and P13 orders) arrived with a lead time of 3 periods. The 'in-transit' figure of 408 likely includes the lost orders (P2=153, P6=80), meaning 'true' pipeline inventory is closer to 175 units (P14, P15, P16 orders). To recover from the stockout and account for the high volatility and potential lead time of 3, I am selecting L=3, calculating mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent spike (Average 155.8), and setting a high sigma_hat using N=5 to reflect the extreme volatility (std=130+). This will push the OR backend to raise the base stock level significantly.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Demand volatility significantly increased following a 368-unit spike in Period 16; average demand for P12-P16 is ~156 units. Supply chain remains highly unreliable with lead times settling around 3 periods and multiple confirmed lost orders (P2, P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility, high-volume regime. The last two periods (P16, P17) saw spikes of 368 and 297 units, significantly higher than the previous average of ~100. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), the mean demand is 202.6. Lead times are extremely inconsistent, with recent arrivals occurring at L=1 (P16 order) or L=3 (P14 order). Despite 548 units in transit, we are currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. The Period 2 and Period 6 orders are confirmed lost. To manage this high demand and supply uncertainty, I will set L to 3 (the upper bound of recent successful deliveries) to ensure the OR engine targets enough inventory to cover the long-tail lead time. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent demand surge and high variance (std is approx 125), which will raise the base stock level and help mitigate potential stock-outs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 17: Average demand for P13-P17 increased to 202.6 units (from ~100) with high volatility. Supply chain remains unreliable with lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16, with a massive spike to 368 units followed by sustained high demand (297 and 251 units). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is approximately 228 units, a substantial increase from the previous baseline of ~100. The supply chain remains highly unstable; while some orders arrive with a lead time of 1 (P16 order), the standard recently has been 3 periods, and multiple orders (P2, P6) are confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is 811 units. However, given the supply chain's unreliability and the potential for shipments to be lost, I am setting L to 3 to reflect the most common actual lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent high-demand regime (avg ~228), and a similar window for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to meet this new demand level while acknowledging the extended lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Average demand for P14-P18 is 228.8 units, more than double the previous baseline. Supply chain lead time is consistently 3 periods for most successful deliveries, but with high variance (1 to 3) and significant risk of lost orders.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upwards shift starting around Period 16, with the 5-period average (P15-P19) currently sitting at 243.8 units. This is more than double the earlier baseline. Lead times remain unstable, with observed delivery times between 1 and 3 periods, although several orders (P2, P6) have been confirmed lost. The current in-transit pipeline (917 units) is substantial, but zero on-hand inventory and the recent high demand (P16: 368, P17: 297, P18: 251, P19: 177) necessitate aggressive inventory targets to avoid stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the high-demand shift and 'explicit' for L at 3 periods to account for the most common successful delivery time and ensure the pipeline calculation covers a sufficient window.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: P15-P19 average demand is 243.8 units, compared to the P1-P15 average of ~100 units. Supply chain remains high-risk with lead times of 1-3 periods and frequent lost orders.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 21. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 1093 units in-transit. A high-demand regime is firmly established (P15-P20), with the last five periods (P16-P20) averaging 289.8 units (368, 297, 251, 177, 356), a sharp increase from the previous baseline. The supply chain remains highly problematic: the Period 2 (153 units), Period 6 (80 units), and Period 15 (95 units) orders are missing and likely lost. Recent observed lead times for successful deliveries alternate between 1 and 3 periods (P16 order took 1, P14 order took 3). To account for the sustained higher floor and volatility in demand, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Given the recurring 3-period lead time for most successful deliveries and the frequency of lost orders (which effectively increases lead time from the perspective of inventory protection), I am setting L explicitly to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime: P16-P20 average demand is 289.8 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~100. Supply chain remains unreliable with frequent lost orders (P2, P6, P15) and effective lead times of 1-3 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained high-growth regime starting around Period 16, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) reaching 281.6 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~100. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable; while the promised lead time is 2, actual successful deliveries generally take 1 or 3 periods. Most critically, several orders appear lost: P15 (95 units) is now 6 periods overdue, and the in-transit balance is 1160 units despite an on-hand inventory of 0 and frequent stockouts. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio (1:1 implies a 50% critical fractile, but backorder costs are effectively lost sales), we must protect against these stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current high-demand regime and an 'explicit' lead time of 3 to reflect the frequent observed delays. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the heightened volatility (range 177 to 356).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P17-P21) average demand 281.6 units. Supply chain remains high-risk with multiple likely lost orders (P15 order is now 6+ periods overdue).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a sustained high-demand regime, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) being 277 units, which is significantly higher than the initial baseline. On-hand inventory is depleted (0 units), and there is a massive in-transit pipeline of 1,160 units. However, there is a recurring pattern of lost orders (P2, P6, P15) and highly variable lead times ranging from 1 to 3+ periods. Specifically, orders from P17, P18, P19, P20, and P21 (totaling 832 units) have not yet arrived. Given that the promised lead time is 2, most of these orders are now overdue or at the limit. I will set the lead time parameter explicitly to 3 to reflect the most frequent successful delivery delay, while using the recent demand average (N=5) to maintain a high base stock that compensates for the high risk of lost shipments and stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P18-P22) average demand: 277 units. Significant supply chain risk: order P15 (95 units) is now 7 periods overdue (definitely lost); orders P17-P20 are collectively overdue or at risk.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high-regime shift starting around Period 17. The recent data (P19-P23) shows an average demand of approximately 298.8 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline. In Period 24, on-hand inventory is 0. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable: orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 are currently overdue based on the typical 3-period lead time observed for successful deliveries. Specifically, the P15 order is now 8 periods overdue and definitively lost, and the lack of arrivals from P17-P19 (totaling 589 units) suggests further losses or severe delays. The 'In-transit' figure of 917 units includes these likely lost orders. To compensate for the high risk of stockouts in this high-demand environment and the likely loss of pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P19-P23) to capture the current high-demand mean (~299) and volatility. I am setting the lead time (L) to 3 to reflect the most common successful delivery time, despite the high variance and loss rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high level: P19-P23 average demand is 298.8 units. Supply chain crisis: Multiple orders (P15, P17, P18, P19) are significantly overdue or lost, totaling over 600 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stabilized in a high state, with a five-period average (P20-P24) of approximately 298.6 units. The supply chain is in a high-risk state with substantial 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Orders from Period 15 (95 units), Period 17 (220 units), Period 18 (263 units), and Period 19 (106 units) are significantly overdue (now 5-9 periods old) and are likely lost. Total 'ghost' inventory is approximately 684 units. To compensate for these likely losses while accounting for the high demand, I am setting L to 3 (the most common successful lead time) and using a 'recent_N' of 5 to capture the current high-demand mean (~299). By setting L to 3 (which implies a base stock covering 4 periods), the OR backend will calculate a base_stock of ~1200 units. Since current on-hand is 0 and total in-transit is 1196, but 684 of that in-transit is likely lost, the 'real' pipeline inventory is only ~512 units. The OR backend will trigger a significant order to bridge this gap, ensuring we can meet the high demand despite the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain crisis confirmed at Period 25: Orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 684 units) are officially treated as lost due to being 5+ periods overdue. Real pipeline inventory is significantly lower than the reported 1196 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a sustained high-demand regime. Average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P21-P25) is 306.2, which aligns with the shift observed since P16. The supply chain continues to be the primary challenge. Orders from P15 (95 units), P17 (220 units), P18 (263 units), and P19 (106 units) are now 6 to 10 periods overdue and must be considered lost. While the reported 'In-transit' is 1196, the 'ghost' inventory from these lost orders totals 684 units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 512 units (P20 and P21 orders arrived in P23; P24 order of 279 is active). With on-hand at 0 and a significant portion of the pipeline lost, we must aggressively increase mu_hat and \u03c3\u0302 to trigger replenishment and account for the high volatility (sigma). I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat (covering the high-demand period P19-P25) and sigma_hat to reflect this new reality. L is set to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect the consistent 3-period lead time for successful arrivals, which forces the OR engine to account for a longer lead-time-plus-review window.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain crisis confirmed: Orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 684 units) are effectively lost. True pipeline inventory is significantly lower than the reported volume. Demand is stable in a high regime averaging ~300 units/period since P20.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently high and volatile, with an average demand of approximately 300 units per period over the most recent 5-period window (P22-P26: 274, 360, 176, 394, 242). The supply chain is in a crisis state: orders from P15 (95), P17 (220), P18 (263), and P19 (106) totaling 684 units are severely overdue (lead times of 7-11 periods) and are definitively lost. The reported 'In-transit' inventory of 1196 is misleading; clearing these 684 lost units leaves a 'true' pipeline of 512 units (P20 and P21 arrived in P23; P24 order of 279 is still pending). In P27, we have 0 on-hand and a true pipeline of roughly 512 units. Given the high demand and lead time variability (settling around 3), I will set L to 3 and mu_hat to an explicit value of 1200 (4 periods * 300 units forecast). This forces the OR backend to place a significant order despite the inflated 'In-transit' count, which otherwise would prevent ordering due to the pipeline inventory cap calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a structural supply chain crisis. The recorded 'In-transit' inventory of 1200 units is heavily inflated by lost orders. Based on the history, orders from P15 (95), P17 (220), P18 (263), and P19 (106) totaling 684 units are severely overdue (8-12 periods) and must be treated as lost. Subtracting these from the 1200 in-transit leaves a 'real' pipeline of 516 units (comprised of orders from P20, P21, P24, and P27). However, even some of these are now at risk. Demand has stabilized in a high regime, with the last 5 periods (P23-P27) averaging 307 units. The OR backend's capped policy will under-order if it believes the pipeline is full of the 1200 units. To force the backend to place necessary orders, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a delivery target that accounts for the 684 lost units. I set L to 3 based on the most frequent successful delivery lead time. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*307 + 684 = 1912. This signals to the OR engine that it needs to cover current demand while overcoming the 'ghost' inventory deficit.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: Orders P15, P17, P18, P19 (684 units) are confirmed lost (10+ periods overdue). Real pipeline is reported-684. Demand regime remains high at ~305 units/period.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable with severe delays and likely lost orders. Orders from P15 (95), P17 (220), P18 (263), and P19 (106) totaling 684 units are treated as lost (10+ periods overdue). The reported in-transit of 1832 minus these lost units yields an effective pipeline of 1148 units. Demand is stable in a high regime, averaging 303.4 units over the last five periods (P24-P28: 176, 394, 242, 363, 331). With L set to 3, the target pipeline should cover (3+1) periods of demand, approximately 1214 units. Given the effective pipeline of 1148 and on-hand inventory of 0, a gap of ~66 units exists. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) and an explicit 'L' of 3 to account for the actual observed lead times of successful arrivals, while the OR engine's cap will naturally modulate the order size to prevent excessive holding costs given the high in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Systemic supply chain failure persists; orders P15, P17, P18, P19 (total 684 units) are confirmed as permanent losses. Effective pipeline is reported in-transit minus 684. High demand regime (avg ~300) sustained from P20-P28.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted and stabilized at a high level, with the average demand for the last 10 periods (P20-P29) being approximately 314 units. However, we are facing a massive supply chain failure. Total pipeline inventory is 1828, but 684 units from P15, P17, P18, and P19 are confirmed as permanent losses, and multiple other orders are significantly overdue. Specifically, orders from P16 (70), P20 (176), P21 (67), and P27 (4) have arrived, but P22 (0), P23 (0), P24 (279), P25 (0), and P26 (0) are currently in-transit with P24 being 6 periods old. The reported 'In-transit' of 1828 includes the 684 lost units, leaving 1144 units 'theoretical' pipeline. I select L=3 as the most frequent successful lead time. Mu_hat is set to roughly (1+3)*314 = 1256. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for high demand volatility. Since on-hand is 0 and pipeline is highly unreliable, I am using 'explicit' parameters to force the OR backend into placing an order that compensates for the massive lost inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed total supply chain 'ghost' inventory of 684 units (P15, P17, P18, P19) which must be manually subtracted from the system's pipeline for order calculations. Demand regime is stable at ~314 units/period.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P21-P30) has stabilized at an average of 301.7 units, significantly higher than the early game. The supply chain remains in a state of systemic failure; we have confirmed that orders from P15 (95 units), P17 (220 units), P18 (263 units), and P19 (106 units) are lost, totaling 684 units of 'ghost' inventory. While the In-transit figure is reported as 1196, the effective pipeline is only 512 units (1196 - 684). In Period 30, a large order of 632 units arrived, leaving us with 403 on-hand. We must maintain high inventory levels to compensate for the high risk of future order losses and the 3-period lead time. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the high demand regime and its variability, while adjusting for the ghost inventory in my logic, though the OR engine will see the 1196 figure. By setting mu_hat high, I force the OR engine to place necessary replenishment orders despite the inflated in-transit count.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed cumulative ghost inventory is 684 units (P15, P17, P18, P19). These units will never arrive and must be manually subtracted from the 'In-transit' total when evaluating stock-outs or replenishment needs. High demand regime (~300 units/period) is sustained.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a high level, averaging ~304 units over the last 12 periods (P20-P31). The primary challenge is the supply chain reliability and the calculation of 'true' pipeline inventory. As identified in previous carry-over insights, orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 684 units) have never arrived and are now at least 12 periods overdue, confirming they are lost. The system reports an 'In-transit' total of 1196 units. However, subtracting the 684 'ghost' units leaves a true pipeline of 512 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 168. Total effective inventory (168 + 512 = 680) is barely sufficient to cover the expected lead-time demand plus safety stock (L=2, meaning 3 periods of demand cover \u2248 912 units). Therefore, I must signal the OR backend to increase the base stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the current high-demand regime (~300 units/period) and stick to the promised lead time L=2 for the backend formula, acknowledging that while actual lead times vary, the backend's internal calculation works best with a consistent L when manual adjustments to true pipeline are accounted for via the parameters.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost orders P15, P17, P18, P19) remains 684 units. Effective pipeline is In-transit (1196) - 684 = 512 units. Demand remains stable in the high-regime range of 230-390 units (mean ~305).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 293 units over the last 15 periods (P18-P32). Recent periods show demand ranging from 229 to 394. The supply chain remains highly problematic. As established in prior periods, a total of 684 units from orders P15, P17, P18, and P19 are long overdue and confirmed lost. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 1196 units. Subtracting the ghost inventory (1196 - 684) leaves an effective pipeline of 512 units. Specifically, the P24 order (279 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is likely also lost, which would further reduce the effective pipeline to 233 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. To ensure availability and account for the significant pipeline depletion caused by lost orders, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I estimate demand (mu_hat) at ~300 units/period. For a lead time (L) of 3 (the observed reliable maximum), the target level (1+L) should be around 1200 units. Given the effective pipeline is likely only ~233-512 units, a substantial order is needed. I set L=3 and mu_hat=1200 (4 periods of 300) with a high sigma_hat of 250 to account for recent demand volatility and supply risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Order P24 (279 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is added to the 'ghost inventory' list (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24), bringing total confirmed losses/ghost inventory to 963 units. Effective pipeline is In-transit (1196) - 963 = 233 units.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable with a cumulative 'ghost inventory' of 963 units (P15, P17, P18, P19, and now P24 which is 9 periods overdue). The current reported 'In-transit' of 1200 units is misleading; the effective pipeline is only 237 units (1200 - 963). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains in a high-regime state, averaging 269 units over the last 5 periods (P29-P33), despite a slight softening from the peak of ~300. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this high demand while accounting for the lost pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate mu_hat as (L+1) * 270. With an inferred actual L of 3, mu_hat is set to 1080. This effectively signals to the backend that the current pipeline (which it thinks is 1200) is insufficient to cover the next 4 periods of demand, forcing an order. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the high volatility seen in this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Order P24 (279 units) is confirmed lost (9 periods overdue), bringing total ghost inventory to 963 units (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Effective pipeline is In-transit minus 963.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable in a high-demand phase (average ~300 units/period since P20). Recent demand (P30-P34) shows a slight dip (avg ~245), but given the systemic supply chain risk, I must maintain high base stock targets. The supply chain is in a state of failure: orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24 (totaling 963 units) are confirmed as permanent losses ('ghost inventory') because they are all 9+ periods overdue. The current In-transit is reported as 1200 units, but the effective pipeline inventory is actually 1200 - 963 = 237 units. To force the OR backend to ignore these 963 ghost units and place a replenishment order, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 (the typical successful lead time) and mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the ghost inventory. Target Base Stock = (1+L)*300 + 1.28*sqrt(1+L)*\u03c3. With L=3, base stock is ~1200. Since the system thinks In-transit is 1200, it would order 0. By setting mu_hat = 1200 + 963 = 2163, I effectively tell the backend that required stock is significantly higher, compensating for the missing 963 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed ghost inventory remains 963 units (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Effective pipeline is system In-transit minus 963. Demand remains in high regime, though slightly softer in the most recent 5 periods (avg 245).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, on-hand inventory is 0. The current In-transit total is 1851. Based on historical data, we must account for 'ghost inventory' (lost orders) to determine effective pipeline inventory. Confirmed lost orders are: P15 (95), P17 (220), P18 (263), P19 (106), and P24 (279), totaling 963 units. Effective pipeline = 1851 - 963 = 888 units. Demand has remained in a high regime since Period 16, though showing some variance; the average of the last 15 periods (P21-P35) is approximately 280 units/period. The lead time is highly volatile (1 to 3 periods), with recent arrivals confirming 2 periods, but risks of total loss remain high. I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against delivery delays and set mu_hat using the last 15 periods (N=15) to capture the sustained high demand while smoothing recent fluctuations. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=15 to account for the heightened volatility in this regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand over the lead period while accounting for the significant 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we face a stock-out (on-hand: 0). The high-demand regime continues with demand averaging 266 units over the last 5 periods (P32-P36). The system reports 1851 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms a massive 'ghost inventory' of 963 units from lost orders (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). The effective pipeline is actually 888 units (1851 - 963). While 888 units seem sufficient to cover the 3-period lead time window at current demand, the supply chain is extremely unreliable, and the carry-over history shows that relying on nominal pipeline figures leads to prolonged stock-outs. I will use an explicit L of 3 (the most frequent successful lead time) and maintain mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (N=15, covering the shift from P21 onwards) to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for both the demand level and the persistent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-37.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 274 units over the last 10 periods (P28-P37). The current on-hand inventory is 344 units. The reported 'In-transit' inventory of 1200 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' orders that are confirmed lost. Based on the history, orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24 (totaling 963 units) are significantly overdue (9+ periods) and will not arrive. Subtracting these from the current 1200 units reveals an effective pipeline of 237 units (likely the P28 order balance or recent smaller placements). Lead times for successful deliveries have settled at approximately 2 periods recently (P28, P30, P35 orders). To maintain a high service level in this regime while the OR backend likely overestimates pipeline inventory due to the 'ghost units', I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current average of ~274 and 'recent_N' for lead time to reflect the more stable 2-period performance, though I remain cautious of supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Confirmed total ghost inventory remains 963 units (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Effective pipeline is system In-transit minus 963. Demand regime for P28-P37 is stable at an average of 273.9 units/period.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-regime phase since Period 16, with the average demand over the last 10 periods (P29-P38) being approximately 285 units. In the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38), demand averaged 277 units. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a repeated pattern of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders). Cumulative confirmed lost orders total 963 units (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). The current system 'In-transit' is 1200 units. Subtracting the ghost inventory (1200 - 963) reveals an effective pipeline of only 237 units. Current On-hand inventory is 17 units. Total effective inventory (254 units) is insufficient to cover the lead time demand (L+1 periods) at the current rate of ~285 units/period. The observed lead time for the most recent delivery (P35 order arriving in P37) was 2 periods, but historical actuals vary between 1 and 3. I will use 'explicit' values to bypass the system's incorrect pipeline count. I set L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+L) * 285 = 855. To account for the 963 units of 'ghost' inventory that the OR engine incorrectly thinks is coming, I increase mu_hat by that amount to 1818. This forces the replenishment logic to ignore the ghost units and place a real order to cover immediate demand.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable in a high range, with an average of approximately 300 units over the last 10 periods (P30-P39 avg: 282). The supply chain remains highly unreliable; specifically, orders P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24 are confirmed lost, representing a total ghost inventory of 963 units. The current system-reported In-transit is 1801 units. Subtracting the ghost inventory (963) leaves an effective pipeline of 838 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and effective pipeline at 838, and a realized lead time typically around 3 periods, we must set parameters that ensure the target base stock covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1). I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the consistent 3-period delay for successful arrivals. mu_hat is set to 1200 (4 periods * 300/period) and sigma_hat to 120 (sqrt(4) * ~60) to maintain service levels in the face of persistent stockouts and high demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed total ghost inventory (lost shipments) is 963 units (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). High-demand regime (avg ~280-310) remains stable through P39. Supply chain lead time for successful arrivals is typically 2-3 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at a high level, with the average demand from Period 31 to 40 being approximately 269 units per period. The supply chain remains high-risk with a confirmed 'ghost inventory' of 963 units (orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24) which have never arrived and are now at least 16 periods overdue. The system reports an 'In-transit' total of 1200 units, but after subtracting the ghost inventory (1200 - 963), the actual effective pipeline is only 237 units. This effective pipeline plus current on-hand inventory (402) equals 639 units. Given the target base stock needs to cover a lead time of roughly 2-3 periods (approx 3 * 269 = 807 units), the current stock position is slightly under-protected. I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current stable high-demand regime, and use an explicit lead time of 2 (the most recent successful lead time was 1, but historically it averages 2-3) to ensure the OR backend orders enough to bridge the gap created by lost shipments.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level, with the average demand over the last 10 periods (P32-P41) being approximately 275.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently at 116 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1200 units, but 963 of these are confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24) as per carry-over insights. Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 1200 - 963 = 237 units. Total effective inventory (On-hand + Effective Pipeline) is 116 + 237 = 353 units. Given the high demand (~275 units/period) and a typical total coverage requirement (L+1 periods, where L is ~2-3), the current stock is insufficient. I will set the lead time to an explicit '3' to account for the frequent delays observed, and use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand average while providing enough safety stock via the OR backend's z-score calculation.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime, with the most recent 5-period average (P38-P42) being approximately 268 units. Supply chain reliability remains the primary challenge. We have confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) totaling 963 units (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). The current system-reported In-transit inventory is 1200 units. Subtracting the ghost inventory (1200 - 963) leaves an effective pipeline of only 237 units. With On-hand inventory at 0, the total effective inventory (237) is less than one period of expected demand (~268). Therefore, a replenishment order is necessary. I will set the lead time L to 2 (recent average for successful deliveries) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 804 (268 units/period * (L+1)) to ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock that covers the next three periods of demand, effectively triggering an order to bridge the gap created by lost shipments and current stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed total ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains 963 units. Effective pipeline is system In-transit (1200) minus 963 = 237 units. Demand regime remains stable with a 5-period average of 268.4 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we are managing a high-demand regime (avg ~280-310 units/period) with a severely compromised supply chain. Current on-hand inventory is 0. System 'In-transit' is 1200 units, but 963 of these are confirmed 'ghost units' (orders P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) which are over 10 periods overdue and will never arrive. The effective pipeline is therefore only 237 units (1200 - 963). Since the last successful arrival in Period 40, no new orders have been placed or arrived. To recover from the current stock-out and cover demand for the review period (1) plus lead time (L=2), we need to ensure the total inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline + new order) covers (L+1) periods of demand. Given recent demand stability (P39-P43 average is 246 units, though long-term high regime is ~300), I will use an explicit mu_hat to ensure we capture the demand requirement while accounting for the high 'ghost inventory' overhead in the system's calculation. The OR backend subtracts the full 1200 'In-transit' from the base_stock; to compensate for the 963 units that won't arrive, I will inflate mu_hat to force a replenishment order.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45, on-hand inventory is 0. The current In-transit inventory as reported by the system is 1850 units. Based on historical data, we have confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost orders) of 963 units (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Subtracting these from the current In-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 887 units. This effective pipeline primarily consists of order P44 (650 units) and orders from P39-P43 that might still arrive or are relatively recent. Demand has stabilized in a high-regime range; the last 10 periods (P35-P44) average approximately 264.8 units. Although the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times for successful deliveries have varied between 1 and 3. My objective is to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand. Using L=2 and a recent demand average of ~265 units/period, the base stock requirement is roughly 795 units. Since the effective pipeline (887) already exceeds this and there is a high risk of holding costs if all current shipments arrive simultaneously (given holding cost equals profit), I will set parameters to prevent excessive over-ordering while ensuring the OR engine accounts for the recent demand level and variability.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a high level, with a 10-period average (P36-P45) of approximately 265 units. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Known ghost inventory (lost orders) totals 963 units (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is the system's reported In-transit (1850) minus ghost inventory (963), which equals 887 units. Current On-hand inventory is 0. My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the expected lead time (approx 2-3 periods) plus the current period's demand. With L=2, the base stock targets (1+L) periods (~795 units). Since the effective pipeline (887) already exceeds this and there are only 5 periods remaining in the game (P46-P50), additional ordering risks high holding costs at the end of the game. I will set parameters to reflect the current high-demand mean (~265) and recent volatility, while assuming a lead time of 2, allowing the OR backend to reconcile the effective pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Confirmed total ghost inventory remains 963 units (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Effective pipeline is system In-transit minus 963. Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~265 units over the last 10 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant reliability issues. The 'In-transit' balance of 1850 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory' from previous lost orders (P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24), totaling 963 units. This brings the effective pipeline inventory to 887 units (1850 - 963). Demand has remained relatively stable in a high regime since Period 20, though showing slightly less volatility in the most recent 10-period window (P37-P46), averaging approximately 272 units per period. The Period 44 order of 650 units is currently 2-3 periods into its lead time and should arrive shortly given the observed 2-3 period lead time for successful deliveries. With 0 on-hand inventory and the game ending at Period 50, I will set mu_hat using the last 15 periods (N=15) to capture this stable but high-demand baseline (approx 260-270). The sigma_hat will also be set based on the same window to provide a safety buffer against any late-game demand spikes.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable in the high range (avg ~275 units). There is a significant inventory discrepancy due to a systemic supply chain failure where 963 units (from orders P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24) are confirmed lost/ghost inventory. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 1850. Subtracting the 963 units of ghost inventory leaves an effective pipeline of 887 units. Current inventory status is 0 on-hand. The most recent order was P44 (650 units), which should arrive imminently based on the 1-3 period lead time observed. Since this is Period 48 of 50, the focus shifts to ensuring demand coverage for the final 2-3 periods while minimizing ending inventory. I will set L to 1 to account for the frequent 1-2 period delivery patterns seen recently (e.g., P39 arrived in 1 period, P35 and P28 in 2 periods), and use the recent 10-period demand average (~265) to avoid over-ordering as the game concludes.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final decision period (Period 49). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized in a high-demand regime, with the last 5 periods (P44-P48) averaging 281.2 units and the last 10 periods (P39-P48) averaging 263.6 units. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. We have confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) totaling 963 units (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). The current 'In-transit' is reported as 1850 units. Subtracting the 963 units of ghost inventory leaves an effective pipeline of 887 units. These 887 units include the order from P44 (650 units), which is currently 5 periods overdue (placed P44, should have arrived by P46/P47). If the P44 order is also lost, the effective pipeline is significantly lower. However, since this is the last period, any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends (L=2 promised, next arrival at earliest in P51). Therefore, the primary goal is to ensure the OR backend does not under-order if it were to continue, while acknowledging the game's end. I will use the recent 10-period average for demand (~264) and standard deviation, and maintain the explicit lead time of 3 to reflect the true supply chain delay seen throughout the game, while the effective pipeline adjustment is handled by the OR engine's base-stock logic.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0 and system in-transit is 1850 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 963 units (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) are confirmed lost/ghost inventory. The order from Period 44 (650 units) is now 6 periods overdue (P44 ordered, 2 promised, 1-3 typical actual), suggesting it may also be lost, but I will maintain the existing ghost count of 963 until it is more certain. Effective pipeline is 1850 - 963 = 887 units. Demand has remained stable in a high regime; the last 10 periods (P40-P49) average 271.3 units. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized high-demand regime. Given the frequent delays observed (often 3 periods instead of 2), I set L to 3 to ensure the OR engine targets enough stock to cover the true replenishment cycle.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Order P44 (650 units) is now 6 periods overdue, flagged as high-risk for being added to ghost inventory. Cumulative ghost inventory remains 963 units. Demand remains stable at ~270 units/period (P40-P49 average).
