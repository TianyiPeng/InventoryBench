Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for the first 5 periods (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) results in a mean of 97.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 16.7. Since we are at the very beginning of the simulation and have no observed lead-time performance or significant demand shifts yet, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (representing all available history) to establish the forecast. This provides a stable baseline for mu_hat and sigma_hat across the coverage period (1 + L = 3 periods). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the high profit margin ($4) against the holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 126 units were ordered but not arrived (expected, as the promised lead time is 2 periods). Demand in Period 1 was 139, which resulted in 139 lost sales since starting inventory was 0. The current in-transit amount is 126. Given we only have one period of demand data (139) plus the provided historical samples (110, 116, 74, 101, 85), the mean demand across these 6 points is approximately 104.16. Since L=2, the backend base stock logic ((1+L) * mean) will target roughly 312 units. I will use the 'default' methods to allow the backend to incorporate all available samples (including the high Period 1 demand) into the calculation. This will result in an order that bridges the gap between the current pipeline (126) and the calculated base stock to cover demand during the lead time.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 126 units, and in Period 2, we ordered 143 units. Total in-transit is 269 units. Per the 'Critical Timing Example', the Period 1 order (L=2) is expected to arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 3. Therefore, its arrival is not yet visible in the 'Period 2 conclude' message. Since we have no completed arrivals yet, we cannot confirm any lead time deviations or lost shipments. Demand in Period 1 (139) and Period 2 (114) averages 126.5. Including pre-game historical samples (P1-P5: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85), the overall mean is roughly 105. Since recent demand is slightly higher, I will use a recent_N window of 5 samples (P1, P2 from game plus P3, P4, P5 from pre-game) to capture the current mean more accurately. The lead time L is set to 'default' as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the first 3 periods reflects a mean of approximately 123 units (139, 114, 117). The on-hand inventory is currently 0 because arrivals have not yet started. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (126 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start state (which it is not, as 'Period 3 conclude' says arrived=0). However, per the 'CRITICAL TIMING EXAMPLE', an order with L=2 placed in P1 arrives during P3 and is first visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of P4. Since 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0 for the P1 order, this suggests the actual lead time is likely > 2 periods or the shipment is delayed. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for this observed delay and increase the safety buffer. For demand, I'll use the mean of all available history (5 samples provided in prompt: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85), which is 97.2. Using mu_hat = (1+L)*97.2 = 388.8.

Daily Profit: $448.00, Daily Holding Cost: $90.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), and Period 3's order also arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). Period 2's order of 143 units has not arrived yet. The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2, which matches the promised lead time. However, the high arrival variance suggests instability. Demand over the first 5 periods (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) averages 97.2 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. Given the current on-hand inventory of 90 and in-transit of 221 (total 311), and an expected demand over (L+1)=3 periods of roughly 292, we are well-positioned but must account for the missing Period 2 shipment. I will use 'calculate' for L to incorporate the observed lead time variance and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to stay responsive to the latest distribution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 139, 114, 117, 112, 102 (Average = 116.8). Note: User-provided historical data (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) differs from the Game History log; I will prioritize the Game History log as it reflects the actual sales environment. Demand seems relatively stable around 115 units per period. Regarding lead time: the promised lead time is 2. However, Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), and Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). Period 2's order (143 units) and Period 5's order (146 units) are currently In-transit (total 289 + leftover logic = 367). The inconsistency in lead times (1 vs 3) suggests volatility. I will use 'calculate' for L to average these observations. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use all 5 samples (recent_N=5) to capture the current stable demand regime. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory, so the OR backend needs to account for the pipeline to resume fulfillment.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand history (Samples 1-5 provided: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85; Game history P1-P6: 139, 114, 117, 112, 102, 102) shows relative stability with a slight downward trend, averaging ~110 units. Lead time analysis is more complex: P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), and P3 arrived in P4 (L=1). P2 (ordered P2) is still missing after 4 periods (P3, 4, 5, 6), as are P4 and P5. This suggests significant lead-time volatility or potential lost shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is high (491 units). I will use the promised lead time L=2 for the OR engine but set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods of game history (Regime N=6) to capture the current demand level. This balances the risk of over-ordering against the high pipeline while acknowledging the stockout at P6.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. P2 (ordered P2) is missing as of P6 conclude, suggesting it may be lost or severely delayed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $222.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 106 units (range 60-139). Inventory levels are critical: on-hand is only 18, and we have 413 units in-transit. Lead time is highly unstable: Promised as 2, but observed as 3 (P1, P4) and 1 (P3). Most importantly, the order from Period 2 (143 units) is significantly overdue (6 periods since order) and is likely lost. The order from Period 5 (146 units) is now at its L=3 expected arrival time but has not appeared in the Period 7 conclude message, meaning it might arrive in Period 8 resolution. To account for the lost Period 2 shipment and the observed volatility, I'm setting L=3 (explicitly) and using a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the slight downward trend in recent periods (avg ~90). The mu_hat will be set to cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 2 order (143 units) confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed, L_max observed is 3). Total pipeline inventory likely overstated by 143 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of lead times shows high volatility: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3. The promised lead time is 2, but the empirical mode is 3. Carrying over from previous periods, the P2 order (143 units) is confirmed lost, as 7 periods have passed since it was ordered. This means the backend's 'In-transit' figure of 269 units is physically incorrect; it actually consists of 124 units (ordered P6), 0 (P7), and 2 (P8), totaling 126 units expected. Demand has shown a downward trend over the last 3 periods (60, 46, and a historical average ~100). To compensate for the 143 lost units not being acknowledged by the backend's pipeline tracking, I will use an 'explicit' L value and mu_hat. I will set L=3 based on lead time mode. I will set mu_hat (covering 1+L = 4 periods) to reflect the recent lower demand trend and proactively cover the 'lost' units in the pipeline. With recent demand avg ~53, 4 periods would normally be ~212. However, I must bridge the 143-unit gap. I will set mu_hat to 355 (212 + 143) to force the OR engine to place an order that restores the target stock level, effectively 'ordering' the replacement for the lost shipment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $480.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently 0 with 285 units in-transit. Demand has shown high volatility (Period 8: 46 units, Period 9: 125 units). The global mean across 9 periods is 101.9, but recent trends suggest volatility is a greater risk than a shift in mean. Lead times fluctuate wildly between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.4). The Period 2 order (143 units) is confirmed lost, and the Period 6 order (124 units) is now 4 periods old (past the max observed lead time of 3), suggesting it is likely lost as well. To ensure the backend places orders that actually cover demand, L is set to explicit '3' to account for the frequent delays, and mu_hat is calculated using a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand variability. The backend uses a critical ratio of 0.8 (4/(4+1)), which target a safety stock to cover demand spikes like seen in Period 9.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Period 6 order (124 units) likely lost (4 periods elapsed, L_max observed is 3). Total pipeline inventory likely overstated by 267 units (P2 order + P6 order).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Historical demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable, averaging around 103 units per period. However, we face significant supply chain reliability issues. Based on the 'conclude' messages: P1 (L=3), P3 (L=1), P4 (L=3), P5 (L=3), and P8 (L=1). The average observed lead time is currently 2.2 periods. Critically, orders from P2 (143 units) and P6 (124 units) have not arrived after 9 and 5 periods respectively, confirming they are lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 404 units is misleading because it includes these 267 lost units (143 + 124). The actual viable pipeline consists only of orders from P9 (18 units) and P10 (119 units), totaling 137 units. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have missed demand in P10, we need to order aggressively to restore stocks. I will use L=3 (the most frequent delay) to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the longer lead time typically seen. For demand, I'll use a recent 10-period window (N=10) to capture current levels, and sigma_hat will also use N=10 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline data includes 267 units from lost shipments (P2 and P6). Actual viable pipeline as of P11 start is 137 units.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 461 units. However, historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (124 units) are lost, as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time (3 periods) significantly (10 and 6 periods respectively). The actual functional pipeline consists of orders from P9 (18 units), P10 (119 units), and P11 (57 units), totaling 194 units. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' as a deduction from the target base stock. Since it cannot distinguish lost orders, it will underestimate the required order by 267 units. To compensate, I am increasing 'mu_hat' using the 'explicit' method. Average demand over the last 11 periods is ~100 units/period. For a lead time of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is 300 units. Adding the 267 unit 'phantom' inventory correction results in an explicit mu_hat of 567. L is set to 2 (promised) as average observed lead time (excluding lost orders) is ~2.2. Sigma remains default as volatility is stable.

Carry-over insight: Consolidated lost shipment audit: P2 (143) and P6 (124) orders confirmed lost. Total pipeline inflation is 267 units. Functional pipeline at start of P12 is 194 units (P9, P10, P11 orders).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the 'In-transit' figure is 467 units. However, based on our carry-over audit, 267 of these units come from P2 (143) and P6 (124), which are confirmed lost. The actual functional pipeline consists of orders from P11 (57 units) and P12 (143 units), totaling 200 units. Adding our current on-hand (42 units) gives a total viable inventory position of 242 units. The demand has been relatively stable around 100 units/period (mean of last 5 is ~90, mean of all samples is ~100). The observed lead times have been highly volatile (1, 2, and 3 periods). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the shortfall caused by lost shipments, I am using 'explicit' L=3 to account for the longest successful lead time. I am using 'recent_N' (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior (~90 units/period) while the higher Lead Time parameter helps compensate for the 267-unit ghost inventory in the pipeline calculations.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are stock-out (ending on-hand 0). The 'In-transit' quantity of 467 units includes confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (124 units). Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 467 - 267 = 200 units (from Period 11 and Period 12 orders). Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.4 for arrived orders). I will use L=3 to be conservative given recent stockouts and lead time volatility. Demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) has averaged 100.2 units. For mu_hat, setting N=5 for the recent regime translates to (1+3) * 100.2 = 400.8. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture historical volatility across the 3+1 period window. The goal is to place an order that resets the base stock to cover demand until the next reliable arrivals, while the OR logic handles the subtraction of the (inflated) pipeline, though I am setting mu_hat high enough to trigger replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0). The pipeline shows 410 units, but significant correction is required. Based on 'Carry-over Insights', orders from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (124 units) are confirmed lost. Thus, the effective 'In-transit' quantity is 410 - 267 = 143 units (this corresponds exactly to the order placed in Period 12). Since that order was placed in Period 12 and the common lead time is 2-3 periods, it should arrive in Period 14 or 15 (visible in next period's conclude). Lead times are unstable: P1(3), P3(1), P4(3), P5(3), P8(1), P9(3), P10(2), P11(3). The mean lead time is ~2.375. I will set L to 'calculate' to capture this variability. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 113, 71, 95, 97, 61) averages 87.4, which is lower than the long-term average (~95). Setting N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows for a more responsive forecast to the recent lower demand trend while maintaining safety stock for replenishment.

Carry-over insight: P2 and P6 orders remain lost; pipeline adjustment of -267 units persists. P12 order (143 units) is the only valid stock currently in-transit.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, the system shows 40 units on-hand and 267 units 'In-transit'. However, historical analysis confirmed that orders from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (124 units) are lost. This means the 267 units shown in the pipeline are entirely phantom units (143+124=267). There is currently zero functional pipeline inventory. Demand is relatively stable with a historical mean of approximately 98.5 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2 periods and an observed average lead time around 2.5 periods (L=1, 2, or 3), the underlying OR logic needs to target a base stock covering (L+1) periods. Since the current functional inventory (On-hand 40 + Pipeline 0) is well below the required level for 3 periods of demand (~300 units), a significant order is required. Setting L to 3 (explicit) reflects the observed maximum lead time and helps the backend account for delivery risks. mu_hat is set to default (which will use L+1 * avg demand) to ensure enough stock is ordered to overcome the phantom pipeline bias.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Zero functional pipeline stock. The 267 units 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom units from lost orders P2 (143) and P6 (124).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17, the system reports 'In-transit' as 390 units. This total is comprised of: P2 (143 units - confirmed lost), P6 (124 units - confirmed lost), and P16 (123 units - recently ordered). Therefore, the functional pipeline is only 123 units, while 267 units are 'phantom' stock that will never arrive. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has remained relatively stable (recent average ~100), but there was a recent spike to 163 in Period 16. The observed lead times are highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Average ~2.57). To compensate for the 267 units of phantom inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. I will set the base 'mu' at 110 (to account for the recent spike) and add the 267 lost units as a buffer to force the OR backend to place a corrective order. This results in mu_hat = (110 * (1 + L)) + 267 = 330 + 267 = 597. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this specific adjustment is applied, while using 'calculate' for L to acknowledge the real-world delays we've seen (avg ~2.5), and 'recent_N' for sigma to handle recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has surged significantly in the last two periods (P16: 163, P17: 167), likely indicating a regime shift or a seasonal peak for 'chips(Regular)'. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 118, but the last two periods averaged 165. The current in-transit inventory is 491 units. According to historical audits, 267 of these units (from P2 and P6) are lost. Therefore, the functional pipeline consists of the P17 order (224 units). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with an average around 2.5 periods for delivered orders. Setting L=3 (explicit) to account for recent variability and the need to protect against stockouts during this demand spike. mu_hat is set to 500 (approx. 125 * 4 periods) to cover (L+1) periods of demand using a conservative estimate that blends recent high demand with standard levels. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility observed in the last 5 periods. This approach helps the OR backend aggressively order to rebuild inventory and meet the higher demand regime while correcting for lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely occurred around Period 16: demand increased from an average of ~95 to ~165 (+73%) over the last two periods. Lead time remains volatile (mean ~2.5, range 1-3). Lost shipment audit remains unchanged: P2 (143) and P6 (124) totaling 267 units are lost; the reported in-transit value of 491 is composed of 267 lost units and 224 functional units (ordered P17).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19, the demand for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly. Over the last three periods (P16-P18), demand has averaged 172 units (163, 167, 186), a sharp increase from the previous long-term average of ~100. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volume and increased volatility. Regarding lead time, the observed history (P1, P3, P4, P5, P8, P9, P10, P11, P12, P16) shows a range of 1 to 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.3. However, shipments from P2 and P6 (totaling 267 units) are confirmed lost, and the current reported 'In-transit' of 577 units is inflated by these 267 units. This means the functional pipeline is actually 310 units (P17: 224, P18: 86). To compensate for the 267-unit phantom inventory currently stalling the OR backend's ordering, I am setting the lead time L to an 'explicit' value of 4. Extending L increases the target base stock level (mu_hat calculation is (1+L)*mean), which forces the system to place larger orders and helps overcome the stockouts caused by lost inventory and the recent demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: average demand increased from ~100 to 172 (+72%). Phantom inventory from lost shipments P2 and P6 (267 units total) continues to inflate reported In-transit levels.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16, with demand averaging approximately 174 units per period (P16: 163, P17: 167, P18: 186, P19: 181). On-hand inventory is 0. Lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an approximate mean of 2.22 based on the 9 completed shipments. There is a significant phantom inventory issue: orders from P2 (143 units) and P6 (124 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 267 units that inflate the 'In-transit' figure of 770. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P17 (224), P18 (86), and P19 (193), totaling 503 units. None of these arrived in P19 (conclude shows 0), but the P17 order is now at L=3 and highly likely to arrive in the next resolution phase. To maintain service levels in this higher demand regime while accounting for the lost stock and volatile lead times, I am setting L to 3 (the observed maximum) to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation covers the likely delay. mu_hat is set to 696 (4 periods * 174) to reflect the recent demand shift using the last 4 periods (N=4). sigma_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture the current regime's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~100 to 174 (+74%). Phantom inventory from lost shipments P2 and P6 (267 units) persistently inflates In-transit totals.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, demand has clearly shifted into a higher regime starting at Period 16. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 176.2 units, a significant increase from the previous average (~100). The current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit inventory is 770 units, but this remains inflated by 267 units from lost shipments (P2: 143, P6: 124). The functional pipeline consists of orders from P17 (224), P18 (86), and P19 (193), totaling 503 units. Since functional stock is not keep up with the new demand regime and service level needs to be maintained, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the shift. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period lead times observed (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12 all took 3 periods) and the volatility in the supply chain, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock covering 4 periods of the new demand level (L+1). This also helps buffer against the 'phantom' stock which the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean increased from ~100 to 176.2 (+76%). Current reported In-transit (770) contains 267 phantom units from lost orders P2 and P6; functional pipeline is 503 units.

The chips(Regular) SKU is in a state of stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand underwent a regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~100 to ~170. Recent demand for periods 16-21 averages 169.7. The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals (L) range from 1 to 3; therefore, an explicit lead time of 3 is used to ensure more robust coverage during this high-demand, low-stock phase. There is a confirmed phantom inventory issue: the reported 'In-transit' of 770 units includes 267 units from lost shipments (P2 and P6). The functional pipeline is actually 503 units (orders from P17, P18, P19). To compensate for the 267 phantom units, \u03bc\u0302 (the total demand across review + lead time) is set to an 'explicit' value calculated as: (1 + L) * expected_demand + phantom_offset. With L=3, the coverage period is 4. Calculation: (4 * 170) + 267 = 947. This forces the OR backend to place an order that treats the 267 units as missing rather than available inventory. \u03c3\u0302 is adjusted to reflect the increased volatility in this higher-demand regime over 4 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Over the last 7 periods (P16-P22), demand has averaged approximately 170.4 units, representing a ~71% increase from the previous baseline. The 'In-transit' figure of 979 units is misleading due to 267 confirmed phantom units from lost orders P2 (143) and P6 (124). Therefore, the functional pipeline is 712 units (979 - 267). This functional pipeline consists of orders from P17 (224), P18 (86), P19 (193), and P22 (209). None of these have arrived yet. Based on historical 'conclude' messages, actual lead times range from 1 to 3 periods (Average ~2.4). Since the P17 and P18 orders are now potentially reaching 5 and 4 periods since order date respectively, there is high risk of further lost shipments, which explains the chronic zero on-hand stock and frequent stockouts ($0 on-hand). To address this, I will set L to an explicit value of 3 to reflect the upper bound of the observed lead-time range and ensure we cover the risk of delays. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture only the new high-demand regime (Avg ~170), effectively requesting a base stock level that covers (1+3)*170 = 680 units. Because the functional pipeline (712) is currently above this level, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a small or zero order this period, which is appropriate given the large volume currently expected to arrive soon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean increased from ~100 to 170.4. Functional pipeline analysis: reported 979 total units minus 267 phantom units (P2, P6) leaves 712 viable units in-transit. P17 and P18 orders (310 total) are now late/at-risk.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is well-confirmed, with mean demand increasing from ~100 to ~167 over the last 8 periods. Lead time remains volatile (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), though the most recent arrival (P22) arrived in just 1 period. The inventory situation is critical: we have 34 units on-hand and a reported in-transit of 770 units. However, as documented since Period 8, 267 of those units (from P2 and P6) are lost. Furthermore, orders from P17 (224), P18 (86), and P19 (193) are now significantly overdue (7, 6, and 5 periods respectively), exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3. Given they have not arrived, they must be considered lost or severely compromised. The only 'functional' stock in the reported 770 in-transit was precisely these overdue orders; thus, actual pipeline inventory is essentially zero. To compensate for the system's overestimation of stock (due to the 770 phantom/lost units) and the higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating target base stock for a 3-period window (L=2 + period of decision) at the new mean (~167) plus a safety buffer, and then adding back the reported 770 in-transit units to 'neutralize' the OR backend's subtraction of these phantom units. Target Base Stock \u2248 167 * 3 = 501. Capped replenishment + 770 offset \u2248 1270. This forces the engine to place an order despite the high 'In-transit' value.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P17 (224), P18 (86), and P19 (193) are now confirmed lost/non-concluding (all >3 periods since ordering). Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' is now 770 units (267 from P2/P6 and 503 from P17/P18/P19). High-demand regime (mean ~167) persists.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 remains stable, with the last 9 periods averaging 172.2 units. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this current high-demand state. The lead-time environment is highly unstable and prone to frequent losses. Analysis of 'In-transit' history shows significant phantom inventory from non-concluding orders: P2 (143), P6 (124), P17 (224), P18 (86), and P19 (193), totaling 770 units. With a current 'In-transit' of 1220, the functional pipeline is only 450 units (the order placed in Period 24). To compensate for the 770 phantom units that the OR backend 'sees' but which will never arrive, I will use an 'explicit' L of 6. This artificially inflates the base stock calculation, forcing the engine to place necessary orders despite the inflated pipeline inventory. This strategy aims to ensure on-hand stock reaches the floor to meet the ~172 unit/period demand.

Carry-over insight: Phanton inventory/lost orders audit updated Period 25: P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 orders are lost. Total phantom units in system = 770. Current functional pipeline = 450 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is confirmed, with demand mean increasing from ~100 to ~172 units. Recent demand (P16-P25) averages 172.4. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The inventory situation remains critical due to severe shipment losses. Audit of 'In-transit' (1231 units): Orders from P2(143), P6(124), P17(224), P18(86), and P19(193) are confirmed lost (all >4 periods ago with no arrival), totaling 770 phantom units. Valid functional pipeline consists of orders from P24(450) and P25(11), totaling 461 units. To compensate for the 770 units of phantom inventory that the OR backend incorrectly counts towards the base stock, I am using 'explicit' L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. I set L=3 to reflect the late delivery risks (actual lead times range 1-3). mu_hat is set to (1+3)*172.4 + 770 = 1459.6, and sigma_hat is adjusted to account for the high volatility of the new regime over the lead period (sqrt(1+3)*20 = 40). This allows the OR backend's capped policy [base_stock - pipeline_inventory] to result in a meaningful order despite the inflated pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory audit P26: P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 orders are lost. Total phantom units = 770. Functional pipeline = 461 units (P24, P25).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 remains active, with a mean demand of approximately 169.3 units over the last 11 periods. Period 26 demand was 144, slightly below the mean. Regarding lead times, they remain highly volatile (1-3 periods). A significant portion of the 'In-transit' inventory (1494 units) consists of lost orders from periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19, totaling 770 phantom units. Additionally, the order from P24 (450 units) is now at 'Lead Time 3' and should ideally arrive in Period 27 (visible P28), and P25 (11 units) is at 'Lead Time 2'. Functional pipeline is calculated as 1494 - 770 = 724 units. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite this phantom inflation, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to project demand over a potential 3-period lead time (L+1=4) and keeping L at 'calculate' to reflect the average actual delays. Demand since P16: 163, 167, 186, 181, 184, 137, 175, 175, 172, 184, 144. Mean = 169.3. mu_hat target = 169.3 * 4 = 677.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory audit P27: Lost orders P2 (143), P6 (124), P17 (224), P18 (86), and P19 (193) total 770 phantom units inflating 'In-transit'. Functional pipeline is 724 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~100 to an average of ~174 over the last 12 periods. Lead time remains highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, necessitating a conservative inventory position. A major complication is the 'phantom inventory': orders from P2 (143), P6 (124), P17 (224), P18 (86), and P19 (193) are confirmed lost as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a wide margin. These 770 units inflate the 'In-transit' count (1494), meaning the functional pipeline is actually 724 units (ordered in P24, P25, P26). Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to 'add back' the 770 lost units into the target inventory level; otherwise, the OR engine will under-order by assuming those 770 units will eventually arrive. Target mu_hat calculation: (1 + L_promised) * Demand_Recent + Lost_Units = (1 + 2) * 174 + 770 = 522 + 770 = 1292. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the higher volatility of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory update P28: Lost orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 total 770 phantom units. Functional pipeline is 724 units. Demand regime (P16-P27) stabilizes at mean ~174.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, increasing from ~100 to ~174 units. Analyzing the last 13 periods (P16-P28), the mean demand is 173.8. The current 'In-transit' level of 1231 is significantly inflated by lost shipments. Based on history, orders P2 (143), P6 (124), P17 (224), P18 (86), and P19 (193) are confirmed lost, totaling 770 phantom units. Additionally, P24 (450) and P25 (11) have not arrived; P24 is at period 5 since ordering (L=5), which is beyond the observed L_max of 3, making it likely lost. If we assume P24 and P25 are lost, phantom inventory rises to 1231 units (matching the reported In-transit), meaning the functional pipeline is currently 0. Given the high demand and risk of loss, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the 13-period high-demand regime (N=13) and maintain a robust sigma_hat to buffer against lead time volatility (observed 1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory audit P29: Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are all likely lost, totaling 1231 units. The reported 'In-transit' reflects zero functional units as of the start of Period 29. Demand regime P16-P28 mean is 173.8.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a massive overstatement of 'In-transit' inventory due to lost shipments. Auditing the history: Orders from P2(143), P6(124), P17(224), P18(86), P19(193), P24(450), and P25(11) have all exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods without concluding, totaling 1231 units of phantom inventory. This matches the reported 'In-transit' figure, meaning the functional pipeline is currently zero. Demand remains in the high regime established at P16 (mean ~172 since shift). To reset and force the OR backend to place a new order despite the phantom 1231 units, I am using 'explicit' settings. I set L to 2 (promised). I set mu_hat to 1750 (representing (1+2)*174 plus a recovery buffer to overcome the 1231 phantom units and stock for the lead time). I set sigma_hat to 100 to handle the observed variance in this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory audit P30: Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are lost. Total phantom units = 1231. This matches total reported In-transit, confirming zero viable units are currently in the pipeline.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31, the environment is characterized by a stable high-demand regime and severe logistics disruptions. The demand shift starting at Period 16 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 173.2 units (N=15). The logistics analysis is critical: Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are all confirmed lost (missing for >4 periods when max observed LT is 3). This creates 1231 units of 'phantom inventory' in the 'In-transit' report. The reported In-transit of 1835 contains these 1231 phantom units and 604 viable units (ordered in P30). With 0 on-hand and only the P30 order in the viable pipeline, we must ensure continuity. I am setting L=3 (the max observed functional lead time) to be conservative against delays. Using mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 15 periods (the current demand regime) to ensure the OR backend targets the higher consumption rate (~173 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Phanton inventory audit P31: Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are lost. Total phantom units = 1231. Current functional pipeline = 604 units (ordered P30).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from a mean of ~100 to ~173 per period (current P16-P31 mean is 171.7). The environment is characterized by severe shipment losses. Audit of 'In-transit' (1835 units): orders P2 (143), P6 (124), P17 (224), P18 (86), P19 (193), P24 (450), and P25 (11) are confirmed lost/non-concluding (all well beyond the observed max lead time of 3). These total 1231 phantom units. Subtracting these from 1835 leaves a functional pipeline of 604 units (from the Period 30 order). As of Period 32 start, on-hand is 0. Based on the functional pipeline of 604, and a target base stock calculated using L=2 (promised) and mu=172, the OR backend requires parameters that acknowledge the higher demand and the reality of lost stock. I am using recent_N (N=16) to capture the high-demand regime since P16 and explicit L=2 to reflect the promised turnaround, though volatility is high.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory audit P32: Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are lost. Total phantom units = 1231. Current functional pipeline = 604 units (ordered P30).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stable with a mean of approximately 173 units (P16-P32 average: 172.6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the reported in-transit is 1835 units. However, based on serial order tracking, a significant portion of the pipeline is comprised of lost orders (phantom inventory). Specifically, orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are confirmed or highly likely lost based on lead time history (max duration observed is 3 periods). Total phantom units = 143+124+224+86+193+450+11 = 1231. The functional pipeline comprises the order from P30 (604 units). Current functional inventory = 0 (on-hand) + 604 (viable in-transit) = 604. To meet the target base stock for L=2 (covering 3 periods of demand at ~173/period), we require approximately 520-600 units. Since 604 units are already in the functional pipeline, the OR backend will naturally order close to zero or a small amount. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=17 (covering the high-demand regime) to ensure the OR engine reflects the higher demand levels while managing the risk of the phantom inventory inflating the subtraction from base stock.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory audit P33: Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are lost. Total phantom units = 1231. Reported In-transit (1835) minus phantom units (1231) leaves a functional pipeline of 604 units (ordered Period 30).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime (Period 16 onwards) with an average demand of approximately 166 units per period. The supply chain remains highly unreliable. My audit of the 'In-transit' inventory (1835 units) indicates that 1231 units are 'phantom' or lost stock from previous periods (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25). Subtracting these phantom units leaves a functional pipeline of 604 units, which were ordered in Period 30. Given the promised lead time (L=2) and the frequency of lost orders, the functional pipeline (604) is meant to cover demand for Period 30, 31, 32, and potentially 33. With current on-hand inventory at 0 and demand expected at ~166/period, we need to ensure the system places a fresh order to replenish the pipeline for Periods 34-37. I will use 'explicit' values to bypass the backend's over-reliance on the inflated 'In-transit' figure: L is set to 2 (promised); mu_hat is set to 166 * (1+L) = 498; sigma_hat is set to 60 (to account for regime volatility). This should trigger an order roughly equivalent to the expected demand gap.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 34, the phantom inventory audit is unchanged: Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are lost, totaling 1231 units. Actual functional in-transit inventory is 604 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1835 units 'In-transit', but 1231 units are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). The actual functional pipeline consists of 604 units ordered in Period 30. Given a lead time of 2-3 periods, these units are now overdue (P34 conclude showed no arrivals), which is consistent with the observed high failure rate in the logistics chain. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized into a high-demand regime with a mean of approximately 166 units per period. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the functional pipeline (604 units) is insufficient to cover the $(L+1)$ risk window given the high loss rate, I must place a robust order to restore stock levels. I will use 'explicit' values for L and sigma_hat to account for the logistics volatility, and recent_N for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime (N=19, from P16 to P34).

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss persists: Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are confirmed lost, totaling 1231 phantom units in 'In-transit'. Functional pipeline at start of P35 is 604 units (ordered P30). Demand regime (P16-P34) remains stable at mean ~166.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36, the system faces a severe stockout. Every order except those from Periods 1-16, 22, 26, and 30 is significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3. Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are confirmed lost, creating 1,231 'phantom' units in the in-transit tally. The in-transit of 1,835 minus these 1,231 phantom units leaves a functional pipeline of 604 units (from Period 30), which is now overdue (placed 6 periods ago, L_max=3). Since no arrivals have occurred since Period 28, I must assume the Period 30 order is also lost or the lead time has extended. I will set the lead time manually to 3 to reflect the high-end delay and use mu_hat based on the high-demand regime (Periods 16-35, mean ~165). Given the massive stockout and phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (L+1) horizon demand (4 periods * 165 = 660) and use an explicit sigma_hat. However, because the backend logic 'base_stock - pipeline' uses the 1835 'In-transit' figure, I MUST use an explicit mu_hat that exceeds 1835 to force any order at all, or accept that the backend will refuse to order until on-hand falls. The only way to trigger an order when the pipeline is 'full' of ghosts is to set mu_hat to a value that reflects the desired base stock PLUS the phantom units. Target base stock for L=3 is ~1100. Adding 1231 phantom units = 2331. I will set mu_hat to 2331.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total phantom inventory confirmed at 1835 units as the Period 30 order (604 units) is now 6 periods overdue (L_max=3), joining previous lost orders. Functional pipeline is currently zero units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a total collapse of supply reliability. Based on the history, all orders placed in periods P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P30 (totaling 2439 units) are now confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a significant margin. Specifically, the reported In-transit of 2458 units at the start of Period 37 includes 1835 phantom units from orders prior to P36 and the 623 units ordered in P36. Functional current pipeline is effectively zero, and the on-hand stock is 0. Demand has shifted and slightly moderated; the mean demand from P16 to P36 is approximately 157. However, with 100% of the reported in-transit stock being unreliable (phantom), the OR backend's order logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) is failing because it thinks the system is overstocked. To force an order, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom 'In-transit' plus one lead-cycle of demand. I will use 'explicit' to set a high base stock target that accounts for the 2458 phantom units plus expected demand (3 periods * 160 = 480). This totals ~2938.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 37, total phantom inventory from lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30) is 2458 units. The reported 'In-transit' matches this total, meaning there is zero viable stock arriving in the immediate future despite positive in-transit values.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, the order from Period 36 (623 units) arrived with a lead time of 1 period, providing much-needed stock. However, our phantom inventory audit confirms a massive disconnect between reported 'In-transit' and reality. Orders from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25, and 30 (totaling 2458 units) are confirmed lost, as they are significantly past the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. The current reported In-transit of 2359 units is actually lower than the sum of these lost units (2458), suggesting the system is already reconciling some losses or there is a slight data mismatch. Regardless, the functional pipeline is effectively zero, as the Period 37 order of 524 units has not yet 'concluded'. The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable at a mean of ~160-170 units, though the very last few periods (33-37) show a slight cooling (avg ~125). I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand to capture this slight dip while maintaining a safety buffer. For lead time, I will use 'explicit' value of 3 to provide the OR backend with a conservative window, accounting for the frequent delivery failures and delays.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 38, orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P30 are lost, totaling 2458 phantom units. The observed functional lead time is 1-3 periods, but reliability is extremely low. Demand from P33-P37 has averaged 125 units, lower than the P16-P32 average of 173.

Daily Reward (R_t): $203.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39, we have 369 units on-hand. The reported 'In-transit' inventory of 2359 is entirely composed of phantom units from lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, P37). The P36 order (623 units) arrived in Period 37 with a lead time of 1, and the P37 order (524 units) is now at risk. Effectively, the functional pipeline is zero because the P37 order is the only recent order not yet confirmed lost or arrived, and your system reports 2359 units in-transit (P2+P6+P17+P18+P19+P24+P25+P30 = 2458 total, so the 2359 likely stems from minor accounting offsets or the P37 order is not being counted correctly in the user summary). Since the phantom pipeline (approx 2458) is roughly equal to the reported In-transit (2359), I assume no viable stock is coming. Demand shifted around Period 16 to a high mean (~174), but recent periods (P33-P38) show a cooling mean of ~130. I will use N=6 for mu_hat to capture this recent reduction while keeping L at the promised 2 despite volatility, to allow the OR engine to place a recovery order against the phantom-inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Total phantom inventory from lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30) is confirmed at 2458 units, which accounts for the entire reported In-transit balance. Demand mean has stabilized lower at ~130 (P33-P38) compared to the previous ~174 (P16-P32).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 40. From a demand perspective, the regime shifted around Period 16 from ~100 to ~174, but more recently (since Period 33), the mean has softened to approximately 130-140 units. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume while maintaining enough buffer for volatility. Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' figure of 2359 is misleading. My audit shows that orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P30 (totaling 2458 units) are lost. Even though the reported In-transit is 2359, this is actually less than the sum of confirmed lost units, implying the functional pipeline is currently zero units. The arrival in P37 (ordered P36) shows that when shipments do arrive, lead time is short (L=1). I will set L to 1 to reflect this recent successful delivery, but keep mu_hat robust to ensure we re-order if the phantom inventory prevents the OR engine from triggering. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, and the pipeline is entirely 'phantom', I use an explicit mu_hat to ensure the calculated base stock is high enough to force an order despite the 2359 units the OR engine thinks are coming.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~134 (P33-P39), down from the ~174 peak (P16-P32). Phantom inventory audit: Total lost units from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30 is 2458. Current reported In-transit (2359) is entirely phantom inventory.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a mean of approximately 143 units (analyzing P33-P40: 110, 142, 149, 116, 111, 143, 156, 173). The phantom inventory situation is critical: the current reported 'In-transit' of 2359 units is composed entirely of lost orders from Period 2, 6, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25, and 30 (totaling 2458 phantom units, though the current reported figure is 2359 due to minor backend discrepancies, the functional utility is zero). The Period 37 order (524 units) should have arrived if lead time was 1-3 periods; its absence as of Period 40 conclude suggests it is either delayed (L>=3) or potentially lost. With only 40 units on-hand and zero viable units in the confirmed pipeline, I must trigger a significant order to prevent a stockout in Period 42. I set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of the current demand regime (~143/period). Since the OR backend subtracts the reported (phantom) pipeline from the base_stock, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to pass a value high enough to overcome the 2359 unit 'In-transit' hurdle. Calculation: Target Base Stock (for 3 periods) = 143 * 3 + safety stock. Given the 2359 units already 'in' the system according to the backend, I set mu_hat to 2800 to ensure the (base_stock - pipeline) calculation results in an order of approximately 400-500 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P33-P40) at mean ~143. Reported In-transit (2359 units) is entirely composed of lost orders; functional pipeline is zero.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P33-P41) has shifted significantly from the previous high, averaging approximately 143 units per period (N=9). This is a noticeable drop from the P16-P32 average of ~174 units. Lead time remain highly unpredictable, with the most recent arrival (P36 order) taking only 1 period, while many other orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30) are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' figure of 2792 units is heavily inflated by 2458 phantom units from these lost orders; the only functional inventory in the pipeline is the P37 order (524 units) and the P41 order (433 units). At the start of Period 42, functional on-hand is 0. To compensate for the high risk of shipment loss and current demand levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (regime starting P33) to provide an accurate base stock for the OR engine, while maintaining a lead time of 2 as a baseline, acknowledging that functional L varies between 1 and 3.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P33-P41) at mean ~143. Total phantom inventory from lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30) remains constant at 2458 units, accounting for the vast majority of the reported 'In-transit' balance.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a higher level than the early periods. Based on the last 10 periods (P33-P42), the average demand is approximately 147 units per period. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable with significant shipment losses. A 'phantom inventory audit' confirms that orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P30 are permanently lost, totaling 2,458 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 2,792 units consists of these 2,458 phantom units plus the functional orders from P37 (524 units) and P41 (433 units). However, P37 is now 6 periods overdue (beyond the observed L_max of 3), suggesting it is also lost. This leaves only the P41 order as potentially viable. With 0 on-hand inventory and high demand, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand level (~147/period) and L=3 to reflect the maximum observed successful lead time, ensuring the OR backend targets enough stock to cover the transit and observation delay.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Order from Period 37 (524 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely joins the lost/phantom inventory list. Total phantom inventory has increased to 2,982 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, P37). Current reported In-transit is significantly inflated.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from severe shipment losses. As of Period 44, the phantom inventory audit indicates that orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, and P37 are lost. The total phantom units equals 2982 (143+124+224+86+193+450+11+604+524 = 2458 + 524 = 2982). Surprisingly, the reported In-transit is 2792, which is actually less than the sum of these lost orders, likely due to internal system caps or data resets, but effectively confirms that there is zero functional pipeline stock. Demand has trended upward again; the mean for the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is 174.2, aligning with the earlier high-demand regime of ~174 units. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11, covering the period since the last major shift back toward higher demand) to capture this level. L is set to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the maximum observed lead time, given the high frequency of lost/delayed orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Final phantom inventory audit - orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, and P37 are lost. Total phantom units (~2982) exceed reported In-transit (2792), confirming zero functional pipeline. Demand has returned to the high-regime mean of ~174 (P39-P43 average: 174.2).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a high-demand phase, averaging approximately 174 units per period over the most recent active window (P39-P43: 156, 173, 176, 197, 169). The phantom inventory audit remains critical: orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, and P37 are confirmed lost, totaling 2,982 phantom units. The current reported 'In-transit' of 2,359 is entirely composed of these lost units, meaning there is zero functional stock in the pipeline. With 300 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~174/period, we will run out of stock during Period 46. Given the volatile lead time (1-3 periods), we must order now to cover the lead time + review period (L+1 = 3 periods). Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the recent high demand (~174 * 3 = 522), while maintaining a standard L=2 (promised) as the base for the OR engine, knowing it will adjust based on the high demand and zero functional pipeline.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 45, the total phantom inventory from lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, P37) is approximately 2,982 units. This exceeds the reported 'In-transit' figure of 2,359, confirming the functional pipeline is currently empty.

Daily Reward (R_t): $625.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in its high regime, averaging approximately 172 units over the most recent five periods (P41: 176, P42: 197, P43: 169, P44: 133, P45: 185). The current on-hand inventory is 115 units. A critical component of the decision is the 'In-transit' balance of 2359 units. Based on historical data and the phantom inventory audit, the orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, and P37 are confirmed lost. These total 2982 units, which means the reported In-transit value of 2359 is entirely composed of 'phantom' units that will never arrive. The functional pipeline is therefore zero. Lead times for successful shipments have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (Recent: P36 took 1, P41 took 3). I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat based on the high demand regime (~172) multiplied by (1+L) = 3 to target a base stock of ~516. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory, and the pipeline is perceived as 2359 but is actually 0, I must use an explicit mu_hat to trigger an order or adjust parameters to account for this massive discrepancy. However, given we are at Period 46 of 50 and lead time is 1-3 periods, orders placed now have diminishing utility but are necessary to avoid stockout in the final 4 periods. Setting mu_hat explicitly to provide a target base stock higher than the phantom inventory would be impossible without causing a massive over-order if the phantom units were suddenly realized. Instead, I will assume the OR engine's cap and pipeline subtraction will result in zero order unless I use explicit values to bypass the 'pipeline' logic or re-baseline. Actually, to force a 'Base Stock' that accounts for the phantom units, I would need a mu_hat > 2359. Since the objective is to maximize reward and we have 115 units on hand (covering roughly 0.6 periods), and the next order will take ~2 periods, a stockout is likely. I will set parameters to reflect the true demand and lead time to ensure the backend tries to maintain stock, but I note the 'In-transit' inflation will likely block new orders unless 'base_stock' exceeds 2359.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P44-P46) has a mean of 151 units, showing a continuation of the high-demand regime observed since P16. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' balance of 3075 units is almost entirely composed of lost shipments. Audit of lost orders: P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, and P37 total 2982 phantom units. Comparing 3075 (reported) - 2982 (phantom) leaves 93 units potentially functional, but given the P46 order of 716 units was just placed, the reported 3075 is likely entirely phantom inventory from the OR engine's perspective until the P46 order is registered. Actual lead times have been highly volatile (1-3 periods). To maximize service level in the final periods while acknowledging that orders placed now (P47) with a lead time of 2-3 are unlikely to arrive before the game ends (P50), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 periods (capturing the high-demand regime) to ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger maximum ordering within the cap, providing the best chance of filling demand if a shipment arrives quickly (L=1).

Carry-over insight: Final phantom inventory audit P47: Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, and P37 are confirmed lost. Total phantom inventory is 2982 units. Current functional inventory in the pipeline is 716 units (ordered P46).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 48, the system is suffering from significant inventory stockouts. The inventory on-hand is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 3075 units is severely inflated by historical lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, and P37), totaling 2982 phantom units. Consequently, the actual functional pipeline consists only of the order placed in Period 46 (716 units), which has a lead time of 1-3 periods and is expected to arrive between Period 47 and 49. Demand is currently in a high-regime state; the average demand from Period 42-47 is 166.6 units. To recover and maintain service levels for the final periods, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 10 samples (N=10) to capture the high demand and set sigma_hat to capture the high volatility. The lead time L is set to calculated to reflect the actual average observed transit times of 1-3 periods. The goal is to maximize sales in the final stretch, despite the loss of previous shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Confirmed total phantom inventory from lost orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, P37 is 2982 units. This accounts for ~97% of the reported 'In-transit' balance of 3075. Functional pipeline is 93 units (from P46). Demand remains high (avg ~167 over last 6 periods).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has averaged ~167 units over the last 6 periods. The reported 'In-transit' of 3075 units is severely inflated by a massive accumulation of phantom inventory from lost/non-concluding orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, P37). The most recent legitimate order was placed in P46 (716 units), which is currently 2 periods old. Historically, functional lead times range between 1-3 periods. Since P50 is the final period, the goal is to satisfy demand for the remaining duration while acknowledging that any order placed now (P49) would arrive in P50 at the earliest (L=1) or too late (L>1). Based on the P46 order of 716 units and a demand mean of ~170, we expect the P46 order to potentially arrive in P49 or P50, which would cover the remaining demand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (N=13, covering P36-P48) to ensure the OR engine recognizes the current volume, while setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-3 period variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Total phantom inventory from lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, P37) remains at 2982 units. Only the P46 order (716 units) is considered functional in the current pipeline.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit of 3075 units is almost entirely composed of lost shipments. Based on the Carry-Over Insights, orders from periods P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, and P37 are confirmed lost, totaling 2982 phantom units. This leaves a functional pipeline of only 93 units (from the Period 46 order of 716 units, as 623 units arrived in P37 which appears to be a mismatched record or partial arrival, but consistently, the audit suggests 2982 are dead). However, looking at P46: 716 were ordered and zero have arrived. The last successful arrival was P44 (order from P41). Recent demand (P44-P49) has averaged 160 units/period. The OR backend needs to place a final order to cover the remaining horizon, but since this is the final period (50/50) and orders take at least 1-3 periods to arrive, any order placed now will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence the score for this specific game instance. However, to maintain the logic of the controller: I will set L to the observed average (approx 2.4, so 3) and mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (~165).
