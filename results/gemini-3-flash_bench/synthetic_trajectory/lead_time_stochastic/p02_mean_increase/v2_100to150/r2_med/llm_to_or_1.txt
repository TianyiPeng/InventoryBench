Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical data or initial stock. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first five periods shows values: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85. The mean of these first 5 samples is 97.2, and the standard deviation is approximately 16.5. Since the lead time is L=2, the order + on-hand + in-transit needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. I will initialize parameters using the 'default' method which uses all available historical samples to set the base stock. This is appropriate as we have no specific calendar events or reasons to believe the regime has shifted yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The order placed in Period 1 (126 units) is currently in-transit. With a promised lead time of 2, we expect this to arrive in the 'Period 3 conclude' message (available at Period 4 decision). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 0 sales in Period 1 due to 156 demand exceeding 0 inventory. The historical mean demand across the first 5 samples is 97.2, but Period 1 actual demand was 156, and Period 2 (which we just saw in history) was 116. Given the high initial demand (156) compared to the long-term historical mean, I will use a conservative approach. I'll stick with default lead time (2) and default mu/sigma calculations initially, as there isn't enough evidence yet for a sustained regime shift beyond the seed data, but I will monitor for a potential 'stockout recovery' strategy if demand remains consistently above the historical average.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Orders placed in Period 1 (126 units) and Period 2 (155 units) are currently in-transit, totaling 281 units. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Periods 1 and 2. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 5 samples shows a mean of 97.2 (110, 116, 74, 101, 85). However, the demand experienced during the first two periods of the game (156, 117) suggests a slightly higher initial pace than the provided 5-period history. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand estimation to prioritize the observed game demand while acknowledging lead time. L is set to 'default' (2) as there is no evidence yet of lead-time drift or lost shipments.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 156, Period 2 was 117, and Period 3 was 90 (mean ~121). Promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed/lost. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for this observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), the mean of the first 3 samples is 121; with L=3, the coverage period is (1+L)=4, so mu_hat = 4 * 121 = 484. Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of the 3 samples (~33.1) scaled by sqrt(1+L), which is 2 * 33.1 = 66.2. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 367 in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3 totaling 126+155+86). Given the stockouts (sold=0 for 3 periods), we need to ensure the base stock is high enough to recover while accounting for the extended lead time.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is at least 3 periods (Period 1 order did not arrive by Period 3 conclude).

Daily Reward (R_t): $173.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the resolution of the earlier lead-time uncertainty. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), but the order from Period 2 is still missing, and the order from Period 3 arrived early (lead time = 1). This indicates high lead-time volatility (1 to 3+ periods). The promised lead time is 2. Demand remains relatively stable with samples: 156, 117, 90, 77 (mean ~110, though decreasing slightly). Period 5 demand was 85. With on-hand inventory at 135 and in-transit at 328, we are well-covered for the immediate future. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use recent_N for demand to capture the downward trend in the last 5 periods (avg ~98). Since we have seen lead times of 1 and 3, L=2 is a reasonable middle ground for the backend OR logic while we monitor the missing Period 2 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period, Period 2 remains in-transit (4+ periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $335.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the highly volatile lead time and demand patterns. Promised lead time is 2, but actual observations are 3 periods (P1) and 1 period (P3), while the P2 order (placed 4 periods ago) is missing and likely lost. The in-transit inventory is 328 units (P2: 155, P4: 173, P5: 0). Given the high probability that P2 is lost, the OR engine's pipeline calculation (which includes P2) will underestimate the needed order. Demand over the last 5 periods (156, 117, 90, 77, 94) shows a downward trend from an initial spike, averaging 106.8. To account for the missing P2 stock and ensure availability despite lead time variance, I am setting L to 3 (the max observed) and using the mean of the last 3 periods (approx 87) for mu_hat. mu_hat = (1+3)*87 = 348. sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility to maintain a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 2 order (155 units) likely lost after 4 periods (promised 2); lead time remains highly unstable (range 1-3 periods).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 with 0 units on-hand and 328 units in-transit. The demand history (Periods 1-6) shows a mean of approximately 107 units per period with a standard deviation of 29. Lead times have been highly erratic: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, but P2 (155 units) has not arrived after 5 periods and is now considered lost. P4 (173 units) was ordered in Period 4 and, with a promised lead time of 2, we should have seen it in Period 6 conclude; its absence suggests a lead time of at least 3 periods. To account for this instability and the stockout in Period 6, I am setting the lead time (L) to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend aims for a higher base stock. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level while ignoring the initial high demand outlier of 156 in Period 1.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Lost shipment confirmed for Period 2 (155 units) as it has not arrived after 5 periods. Lead time remains unstable, with recent shipments (P1, P4) showing a likely actual lead time of 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is stabilizing but remains fragile. On-hand inventory is 48 units following the arrival of the Period 4 order (173 units) and Period 7 demand (125 units). A lost shipment from Period 2 (155 units) is now confirmed. Lead time analysis: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P4 took 3 periods. The average observed lead time is 2.33 periods. Given the volatility and the 3-period lead time seen in 2 out of 3 successful deliveries, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers a longer pipeline. Demand over the last 7 periods averages ~109 units (156, 117, 90, 77, 94, 106, 125). I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this mean while accounting for the significant variability (std dev ~25). Setting L to 3 instead of the promised 2 helps the OR backend protect against the delays observed in P1 and P4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time mean shift: 2 out of 3 arrivals (P1, P4) took 3 periods, suggesting actual lead time is likely 3 despite 1 arrival (P3) taking 1 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) over the last 8 periods (156, 117, 90, 77, 94, 106, 125, 64) shows a mean around 103.6 units per period. The lead time remains highly unstable, with actual lead times observed as 3, 1, 3, and 1 periods. Specifically, Period 1 took 3, Period 3 took 1, Period 4 took 3, and Period 7 took 1. Averaging these four completions gives an actual lead time of 2.0. However, the Period 2 order (155 units) is confirmed lost after 7 periods. Due to the high variance in lead time (ranging from 1 to 3), I will set L to 'calculate' to allow the system to use the average observed lead time. For demand forecasting, the last 4 periods (94, 106, 125, 64) reflect the current regime better than the initial high spikes, so I use recent_N with N=4. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for both the demand mean (~97 in last 4) and the significant lead-time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains unstable but oscillates between 1 and 3 periods (Average: 2.0 based on P1, P3, P4, P7 arrivals). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 100-105 units after an initial peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $213.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the supply chain for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant lead-time instability. Historical lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 1, and 1 periods (Cycles: P1\u2192P4, P3\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P7\u2192P8, P8\u2192P9). The mean lead time of concluded orders is 1.8 periods, close to the promised 2. However, the Period 2 order (155 units) is confirmed lost, as it has not arrived after 8 periods. Demand remains relatively stable; the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) is 95.2 units, while the lifetime mean is 100.7. Given the high stockout risk seen in P6 due to lead-time variance and lost shipments, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand calculation to capture the current stabilization. I will set L to 2 (promised) using 'default' as the rolling average is settling near 2, but I will monitor the variance closely. The current on-hand (135) plus in-transit (185) totals 320 units, providing a healthy buffer against the next few periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time mean currently fluctuates around 2.0 (Recent: 3, 1, 3, 1, 1), but high variance (1-3 periods) and lost shipments (Period 2) necessitate a cautious pipeline inventory buffer. Demand mean has stabilized at 95-100 units.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is low (12 units) with 185 units in-transit (orders from Period 9 and 10). Reviewing history, the lead time is highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P7: 1, P8: 1). The average observed lead time is currently 1.8 periods. Period 2's order is confirmed lost. Demand has shown a moderate level of stability since Period 4, with recent periods (P7-P10) averaging 99.75 units (125, 64, 87, 123). Given the stockout risk due to lead time variance and low on-hand stock, I will use a period of 5 for demand estimation (covering the recent fluctuation) and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average lead time, which allows the OR backend to account for the current 1.8-period reality rather than the nominal 2-period promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (On-hand: 0) following a demand of 125 in Period 11. Reviewing the lead time history: Period 1 arrived in 3, Period 3 in 1, Period 4 in 3, Period 7 in 1, and Period 8 in 1. While the average lead time is roughly 1.8, the instability and the lost shipment in Period 2 suggest we should brace for potential 3-period delays. Demand analysis: From Period 1 to 11, demand has fluctuated but shows a consistent mean around 106 units (last 5 periods mean: 104.4). To recover from the stockout and cover the 'Pipeline + Lead Time' requirement during this high-volatility phase, I will set 'L' to 'explicit' at 2.0 (blending the 1-3 range) and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture the current 100+ unit regime. This configuration allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the current stockout and the incoming in-transit pipeline (329 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Mean demand has leveled at ~104 units over the last 5 periods (P7-P11). Lead time remains bifurcated between 1 and 3 periods, creating high inventory risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we had a stockout (sold only 30 units against 80 demand) because on-hand started at only 30. Currently, on-hand is 0. However, the pipeline is heavy with 326 units in-transit (P11: 144 units, P12: 27 units, plus unresolved earlier orders). Lead time remains erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P9 arrived in 3 periods). Demand has shown stability with a mean of approximately 104 over the last 6 periods (P7-P12). Given the stockout and the inconsistency in delivery, I need to ensure the OR backend accounts for the maximum likely lead time (L=3) to protect the service level, especially since profit ($4) significantly outweighs holding cost ($1). I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while setting L to an explicit 3 to handle the delivery delays observed (e.g., P9 took 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Mean demand has leveled at ~104 units over the last 6 periods (P7-P12). Lead time continues to be unstable, frequently hitting 3 periods (as seen with P9 arrival in P12).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows high lead time instability and frequent stockouts. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, following a period where demand (134) was entirely lost because no shipments arrived. Looking at history, lead times oscillate between 1 and 3 periods: P1(3), P3(1), P4(3), P7(1), P8(1), P9(3). The order from Period 11 (144 units) is now at Period 13 conclude (lead time 2 if it arrives next) and hasn't arrived yet. The order from Period 12 (27 units) is also in-transit. Because of the frequent lead time of 3 periods and the high cost of stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will set lead time L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum likely delay. Demand has stabilized over the last 7 periods (P7-P13) with a mean of approximately 105.4 units (S: 125, 64, 87, 123, 125, 80, 134). I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime while accounting for the high volatility seen in the demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Persistent lead time instability (bifurcated 1-3 periods) requires L=3 for safety. Demand mean stabilized at ~105 units over P7-P13.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 48 units. Demand from the most recent stable regime (Periods 7-14) averages 104.25 units per period. The lead time continues to be highly volatile, bifurcating between 1 and 3 periods (Period 11 arrived in 3 periods). Therefore, I am setting L=3 to account for the risk of a 3-period lead time. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level covering L+1 (4) periods of demand. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture the demand characteristics of the current stable regime (since Period 7) whilst ignoring the earlier peak and initial stockout noise. This approach balances the stockout risk due to lead-time instability against the demand profile of approximately 105 units/period.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of 105 units over the last 9 periods (P7-P15). However, lead time remains highly problematic, frequently hitting 3 periods (P11 and P12 both arrived in 3 periods). The order from Period 13 (123 units) is currently at its promised lead time of 2 periods and has not arrived yet; if it follows the recent 3-period trend, it will arrive in P16's resolution (visible in P17). With only 5 units on-hand and 386 units in-transit, there is a significant risk of stockouts if shipments do not arrive promptly. I will set L to 3 to reflect the actual worst-case arrival time observed recently, and mu_hat will be based on the stable demand of the last 9 periods (N=9) to cover a 4-period window (L+1). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the extended lead time and protects against the intermittent late arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consistently hitting 3 periods (confirmed by P11 and P12 arrivals), diverging from promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a persistent lead-time shift where shipments are more likely to arrive in 3 periods rather than the promised 2 (confirmed by P9, P11, P12, and P13 arrivals all taking 3 periods). Lead time remains bifurcated/unstable (1 vs 3), but setting L=3 is necessary for safety to prevent stockouts like those seen in P11-P13. Demand mean has stabilized at approximately 100 units over the last 10 periods (P7-P16 mean = 99.2). I will use L=3 and set mu_hat using the last 10 samples to reflect this stability, as earlier data included a high-demand launch phase. This configuration (Base Stock = (1+L)*Mean + z*std*sqrt(1+L)) ensures pipeline inventory covers the potential 4-period window from order to visibility.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consistently 3 periods over the last 4 observed arrivals (P9, P11, P12, P13). Demand mean stable at ~100 units following the initial launch period.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with 324 units in transit. Historical analysis reveals that lead times are unstable, frequently hitting 3 periods (as seen with orders from P9, P11, P12, P13, and P14), despite an occasional 1-period arrival (P16). To prevent stockouts and manage the risk of delayed arrivals, I am setting the lead time (L) parameter to an explicit value of 3. Demand has stabilized into a consistent regime; over the last 11 periods (P7-P17), the average demand is 100.7 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=11 to capture this stable mean while accounting for the extended lead time (L=3), resulting in a base stock calculated for 4 periods of demand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=11) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has solidified at 3 periods for 5 of the last 6 observed arrivals (P9, P11, P12, P13, P14), confirming L=3 is the reliable planning horizon. Demand mean is stable at ~101 units over the last 11 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are currently at an stockout (on-hand: 0) following a demand spike in Period 18 (152 units). The carry-over insights and historical arrival data confirm that the actual lead time is highly unstable, frequently hitting 3 periods (as seen with orders from Periods 1, 4, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14), with occasional 1-period arrivals (Periods 3, 7, 8, 16). Because lead time is frequently 3 periods, setting L=3 is necessary to ensure the pipeline inventory covers the longer planning horizon and avoids the stockouts seen in Periods 11-13 and Period 18. Demand has generally been stable around a mean of 100-105 units, but the sudden jump to 152 suggests a possible regime shift or outlier volatility. I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat (covering Periods 7 to 18) to capture the stable post-launch mean while reflecting the recent spike. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=12 to account for the increased variance seen in the last period. This strategy balances the high reward (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) by maintaining a higher base stock level to mitigate the risk posed by the unreliable 1-3 period lead time delivery.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 18 (152 units vs. 11-period avg of 101), requiring monitoring for a potential new regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently facing a major demand spike (Period 18: 152, Period 19: 238), totaling 390 units over two periods, compared to the previous stable average of 101. This suggests a significant regime shift, likely seasonal or promotion-driven. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 467 units in-transit. Lead times have historically fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent recently (P9, P11, P12, P13, P14 arrivals). Given the stockout situation (sold 0 in P18 and P19) and the surge in demand, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to reflect the observed reality and account for risk. For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent sharp uptrend in demand while tempering the impact of the extreme outlier of 238 to avoid massive over-ordering if the peak is short-lived. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 18: mean jumped from ~101 to ~195 (based on last 2 periods of 152 and 238).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 21. A major demand regime shift was noted starting Period 18, with demand samples of 152, 238, and 94. While the Period 20 demand (94) was lower than the previous two spikes, the mean over the last 3 periods (Period 18-20) is approximately 161, significantly higher than the previous long-term average of ~100. This suggests increased volatility or a sustained higher mean. Lead time (L) is set to 3 periods because most recent arrivals (6 of the last 8) have taken 3 periods, and there are currently 0 units on-hand with 745 units in-transit. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (target base stock covering 4 periods of demand) and sigma_hat (N=3) to account for the heightened volatility since Period 18.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 18 remains volatile: samples of 152, 238, 94 show a 3-period mean of ~161 (+60% vs. baseline). Lead time remains reliably 3 periods for safety planning.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 18. Recent demand samples (152, 238, 94, 136) show a much higher average (155) compared to the previous baseline of ~101. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and while there are 768 units in transit, no arrivals have occurred for the last 4 periods (P18-P21). History shows the lead time is bifurcated between 1 and 3 periods, but the recent absence of arrivals suggests we are facing the 3-period lead time scenario or potential delays. Based on the demand shift, I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher mean and volatility of the new regime. I maintain L=3 explicitly for the lead time to ensure the safety stock covers the longer end of the observed lead-time distribution, which is critical given we are currently out of stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand since Period 18 is ~155 (+53% vs baseline). Lead time remains unreliable with a significant risk of 3-period durations.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 18, with samples showing significant volatility (152, 238, 94, 136, 179). The mean demand over these last 5 periods is approximately 160 units, a substantial increase from the previous baseline of ~100. We are currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory, and 768 units are in-transit. Lead times remain highly unreliable, frequently hitting 3 periods (as seen in many recent arrivals), though no arrivals have concluded in the last 5 periods (P18-P22). Given the promised lead time is 2 but the actual observed lead time is often 3, I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers enough demand periods (L+1=4). I will use the recent_N method with N=5 for both demand and sigma to capture the characteristics of this new, more volatile regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $359.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 18. Since then (P18-P23), demand has been highly volatile with values [152, 238, 94, 136, 179, 132]. The mean of this 6-period regime is approximately 155.17 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~100. Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods, as seen with the Period 20 order arriving in Period 23. This instability, combined with the stockout history from P18-P22, necessitates a conservative L=3 to ensure the pipeline inventory covers enough demand. I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the characteristics of this new, higher-demand regime while maintaining L=3 for downside protection against late arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 18 maintains a higher mean of ~155 units with significant volatility (std dev ~50). Lead time remains bifurcated but necessitates planning for L=3 to avoid frequent stockouts observed in P18-P22.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 18, moving from a mean of ~102 to ~155 units. Over the last 7 periods (P18-P24), demand has been 152, 238, 94, 136, 179, 132, 131, resulting in a recent_7 mean of ~151.7 units. Lead time remains unstable (confirmed 1-3 periods, with P20 taking 3 and P21 taking 2). I will continue to set L=3 as the planning horizon to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the observed 3-period lead time spikes and the recent demand volatility (standard deviation remains high around 45-50). Setting mu_hat using recent_7 captures the higher demand floor while acknowledging the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting P18 persists with a mean of ~152 over 7 periods. Lead time remains unstable, with recent arrivals (P20, P21) taking 3 and 2 periods respectively, reinforcing the need for L=3 planning.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current inventory is 0 on-hand with 646 units in-transit. A significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 18, with the mean demand over the last 8 periods (P18-P25) being approximately 148 units (samples: 152, 238, 94, 136, 179, 132, 131, 125). Although demand in the last 3 periods has stabilized slightly lower (~129), the volatility remains high (CV ~0.26). Lead time continues to be unstable but frequently hits 3 periods (as seen with the Period 20 arrival in Period 23). Therefore, I am maintaining L=3 for safety. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the higher demand regime, and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 periods) accounts for both the increased demand level and the persistent lead time uncertainty to prevent the stockouts observed in recent periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 18, and since then (P18-P26), the mean demand for 'chips(Regular)' is approximately 147 units (samples: 152, 238, 94, 136, 179, 132, 131, 125, 139), which is significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~101 units. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this shift. Lead time remains highly unstable, with most recent arrivals (P20, P21) taking 3 and 2 periods respectively. Given the frequent stockouts observed when inventory fails to arrive on time and the high-profit margin ($4 vs $1 holding cost), planning for a 3-period lead time (L=3) is necessary to ensure a sufficient service level. I am setting L explicitly to 3 and adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 9 periods of demand to provide the OR engine with the most relevant current parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P18 remains elevated with a mean of ~147 units and moderate volatility. Lead time remains unstable (1-3 periods), requiring L=3 for safety. On-hand is currently 0, with a large pipeline waiting to arrive.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 18, and since then (P18-P27), the mean demand has settled at approximately 149.4 units per period (samples: 152, 238, 94, 136, 179, 132, 131, 125, 139, 169). The volatility in this regime is significant (std dev ~40). Lead time remains erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with recent arrivals (Period 20, 21) confirming a 2-3 period range. To prevent stockouts, especially since on-hand is currently 0 and there is a massive pipeline of 667 units (including large orders from periods where we tried to catch up), I will set L=3 as the planning horizon to ensure the base stock covers the maximum likely lead time. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat captures the entire current high-demand regime since P18.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P18 holds a mean of ~149 units (last 10 periods). Lead time remains highly unstable (1-3 periods), requiring L=3 for service level protection.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 18. Over the last 11 periods (P18-P28), demand has averaged 149.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 44 units. This is a substantial increase from the initial baseline of ~100 units. Lead time remains highly unstable, frequently bifurcating between 1 and 3 periods, with recent arrivals (P20 and P26) taking 3 and 2 periods respectively. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline contains 646 units, we are in a stockout recovery phase. To protect the service level against the persistent risk of 3-period lead times, I am setting L=3 (explicit). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to capture the high-demand regime since P18, and N=11 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this new period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 18, and since then, the mean demand has stabilized at approximately 149 units (based on the last 12 periods). Lead time remains the most significant challenge, oscillating unpredictably between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode of 3 for critical planning horizons. The logic for current parameters is as follows: 1) Scale L to 3 to account for the frequent 3-period observed lead times, preventing the OR backend from prematurely stopping orders based on a promised lead time of 2. 2) Set demand forecasting (mu_hat) to reflect the new regime since P18 (N=12). 3) Maintain a recent N for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in this new period. Currently, on-hand is 0, and despite a large pipeline (649 units), the delay in arrivals (e.g., P24, P25 orders) necessitates a high target base stock to ensure service levels once the bottleneck clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P18 remains stable at ~149 units with persistent high volatility. Lead time remains bifurcated between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a planning horizon of L=3 to mitigate stockout risks.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 649 units in-transit. Based on the historical demand and supply analysis: 1) Demand Regime: A clear shift occurred at Period 18. The mean demand from Period 18 to Period 30 is approximately 149.2 units. Recent demand remains strong (Period 29: 156, Period 30: 171). 2) Lead Time: Lead times remain highly unstable and bifurcated between 1 and 3 periods, with several recent orders taking 2-3 periods (P20 took 3, P21 took 2, P26 took 2). Given the recurrent stockouts (on-hand is 0), setting L=3 (explicit) is necessary to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient planning horizon. 3) Parameters: I am using recent_N (N=13, covering the P18-P30 regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated mean of ~149 and its associated volatility. This approach balances the need to replenish the empty stock while accounting for the significant pipeline already in place (649 units), which the OR backend will subtract from the calculated base stock.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 18, transitioning from a mean of ~101 to a higher mean of ~149 units with increased volatility. Since Period 18 (14 samples), the mean is 149.5 with a standard deviation of approximately 42.6. Despite an in-transit pipeline of 655 units, the on-hand inventory is currently 0, indicating that current deliveries are failing to match demand timing due to highly unstable lead times. Observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P26 took 2 periods, while others often take 3). To protect the service level and account for the high cost of stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I am setting L=3 to cover the common worst-case arrival. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*mean using the last 14 samples (N=14) to reflect the post-shift demand regime, and sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=14 to capture the current volatility.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 has established a higher mean, currently averaging approximately 149 units over the last 15 periods (P18-P32). Demand remains volatile (std dev ~42). The lead time remains highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Recent arrivals: P20 at 3, P21 at 2, P26 at 2, P31 at 1). Because actual lead time frequently hits 3 periods, I am maintaining L=3 for the base stock calculation to ensure sufficient pipeline inventory and minimize the persistent stockouts observed since Period 18. mu_hat is set using recent_N=15 to capture this elevated demand regime, and sigma_hat is set using recent_N=15 to account for recent high volatility.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently facing a stockout with 0 units on-hand. The demand regime starting around Period 18 has established a higher mean of approximately 149 units (P18-P33 average is 148.6), a significant increase from the initial baseline of ~100. Lead times remain highly volatile and bifurcated between 1 and 3 periods (Recent arrivals: P26 took 2, P31 took 1). To ensure a 95% service level in the face of this instability and the current pipeline of 649 units (orders from P24, P25, P29 are still in-transit), I am maintaining L=3 for safety. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=16, from P18 to P33) to capture the current high-demand regime. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=16 to account for the increased volatility since the regime shift.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 18 and has maintained an elevated mean of approximately 149 units (calculated from Period 18 to Period 34). Significant volatility (std dev ~42) persists. Lead time remains highly unstable, frequently reaching 3 periods, although some deliveries arrive faster. Since Period 28, multiple orders (P24: 68, P25: 111, P29: 3) have not yet concluded, contributing to the current 649 units in-transit. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Given the bifurcation of lead times (1-3 periods), I will set L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient horizon to protect against the frequent 3-period delays and the high demand volatility observed in the current regime. Setting mu_hat to recent_N (N=17, covering the entire new regime from P18-P34) captures the current higher demand level.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 18. Since Period 18 (18 samples), the mean demand is approximately 147.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and has been for several periods, leading to significant lost sales. There is a large pipeline of 649 units in-transit, but arrivals have been highly irregular. Recent arrivals show lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods (e.g., P31 arrived in 1 period, while earlier orders like P20 took 3). To ensure the backend base-stock calculation (mu_hat) accounts for the current demand level and the planning horizon (L+1), I will set L to 3 (the upper bound of recent observations) to provide a safety buffer against lead-time instability. I will use the recent 18 samples (since the regime shift) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend captures the higher volume and volatility of this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P18 remains stable at ~148 units with significant volatility (std dev ~40-50). Lead time is highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, requiring L=3 for continuity.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 148 units (Period 18-36 mean is 147.6). Despite the significant order volume in transit (649 units), on-hand inventory has been 0 for the last four periods due to lead-time instability (orders from P24, P25, P26, and P29 are overdue or within the 1-3 period window but haven't arrived). Given the bifurcated lead time (1-3 periods), I maintain L=3 as the planning horizon to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for sufficient pipeline safety. Stockouts have been frequent, so mu_hat is set to reflect the current elevated demand level (1+3 periods * 148 units) using a recent window of 19 samples (P18-P36). Sigma_hat is calculated similarly to capture the high volatility (std dev ~40-50). The OR backend's capped policy will moderate the final order if the pipeline is \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0639\u0644 over-saturated, but the high mu_hat ensures the service level is maintained once arrivals resume.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a regime shift around Period 18, increasing from a base of ~100 to an average of ~148 units (Period 18-37 mean: 147.2, std dev: 33.3). Lead time (L) remains highly unstable, bifurcating between 1 and 3 periods; historical data shows frequent 3-period arrivals, making L=3 the necessary planning horizon to ensure base stock covers the lead time plus the current period's demand (L+1). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline contains 649 units (from various un-concluded periods). Although the backend's 'cap' may restrict large orders, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 periods (the duration of the current high-demand regime) provides the most accurate estimation of mean and volatility. Using L=3 explicitly ensures the backend accounts for the observed supply chain delays rather than relying on the promised L=2.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 has remained stable with a mean of approximately 147 units and significant volatility. Currently, the system is experiencing a major stockout situation (on-hand is 0) despite a large in-transit pipeline of 649 units. This suggests multiple orders from previous periods (P24, P25, P29) are significantly delayed beyond their expected arrival times (likely stuck at the 3-period lead time mark or potentially lost). To protect against this instability and ensure the backend computes a sufficient base stock level to cover the (L+1) horizon once arrivals resume, I am maintaining L=3 based on the demonstrated upper bound of the bifurcated lead time (1-3 periods). I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the demand behavior since the Period 18 regime shift while smoothing out the high period-to-period variance.

Carry-over insight: Persistent stockout since P25 caused by highly irregular lead times (up to 3+ periods) and a demand mean of ~147 units. Pipeline total of 649 units is currently pending arrival.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly in Period 18 and has maintained a stable mean of approximately 147-149 units since that time. Specifically, calculating the mean of the samples from Period 18 to Period 39 (a 22-period window) yields a value of ~147.3 units with a standard deviation of ~35.7. Lead time remains the primary challenge; it is highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with several orders currently stuck in the pipeline (totaling 649 units). This instability has caused a persistent stockout since Period 25. Given the critical need to restore and maintain service levels against a 1-3 period lead time window, I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longest likely delay. I will use 'recent_N' with N=22 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime's mean and volatility while avoiding the influence of the lower-demand pre-Period 18 period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with on-hand at 0 and a massive pipeline of 649 units (orders from P24, P25, P26, and P29) that have failed to arrive within the typical 1-3 period window. Specifically, the P24 and P25 orders are now significantly overdue (15+ periods), suggesting potential lost shipments or a severe logistics breakdown. Demand has remained in a stable high-regime since Period 18, with a mean of approximately 147 units. Despite the huge pipeline, the persistent 'arrived=0' status for several consecutive periods indicates that the backend's default logic may not be ordering enough to compensate for these suspected 'ghost' units in the pipeline. To override this and force an order to restore availability, I am setting L=3 (the upper bound of observed lead times) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand: 147 * 4 = 588. Since the in-transit (649) exceeds this, the backend would normally order 0. However, because current on-hand is 0 and the pipeline is clearly unreliable, I will set mu_hat high enough to trigger a replenishment despite the pipeline inventory. I will also use a higher sigma_hat to reflect the high demand volatility (std dev ~50).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reliability failure: Orders from P24 and P25 (totalling 179 units) are now 15+ periods overdue and should be considered lost, despite remaining in in_transit status. Total active pipeline is likely significantly lower than the reported 649 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-volume regime since Period 18, with a mean demand of approximately 148 units (n=24 samples). The lead time remains highly problematic, characterized by extreme delays and lost shipments. As identified in Period 41, orders from Period 24 (68 units) and Period 25 (111 units) are over 16 periods overdue and must be considered lost, reducing the 'effective' pipeline. The current in-transit report of 935 units is likely inflated by these and other potentially lost historical orders. I will set L=3 as our planning horizon to protect against the frequent 3-period arrival peaks. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 24 to capture the stable but elevated demand since the P18 regime shift. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N of 24 to reflect the persistent high volatility (~45-50 units). Given the stockout since P25 (excluding tiny arrivals in P28 and P32), rebuilding the inventory position is critical, though we must be wary that the OR backend's order calculation uses the 'In-transit' figure, which includes those lost P24-P25 units. The P41 order of 286 units was a corrective measure; I will maintain parameters that support this recovery.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline integrity audit: Period 24 (68 units) and Period 25 (111 units) are definitively lost (16+ periods overdue). Effective pipeline is at least 179 units lower than system 'In-transit' display.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the system is in a persistent stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time for 'chips(Regular)' is highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with a significant risk of shipments being lost entirely (Period 2, 24, and 25 orders totaling 334 units are now considered lost). The 'In-transit' display of 935 units is misleading due to these losses; the effective pipeline is likely closer to 601 units. Demand since Period 18 has stabilized in a new regime with a mean of ~148 units and a standard deviation of ~40. To mitigate current stockout risks and account for lead time instability, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of typical actual lead times) and using a recent_N approach for demand (N=20 to capture the current regime since P18) and sigma to ensure adequate service levels once the pipeline arrives.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Audit P43: Total lost units across history reaching 334 (P2: 155, P24: 68, P25: 111). Effective pipeline is system in-transit minus 334. Demand regime remains stable at ~148 units since P18.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit pipeline of 935 units, but our audit confirms that 334 units are effectively lost (unlikely to arrive after 15+ periods). Specifically, Period 2 (155), Period 24 (68), and Period 25 (111) are overdue far beyond the practical limit. Subtracting these leaves an effective pipeline of 601 units. Demand has been stable around a mean of ~148 units since Period 18. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the lead time is highly unstable (oscillating between 1-3 periods), I will set L=3 as a conservative planning horizon to mitigate stockout risks. \u03bc\u0302 is set to (1+L) * 148 = 4 * 148 = 592. Since our effective pipeline (601) already covers this base stock requirement, and we recently placed a large order of 286 units in P41, the OR engine's base-stock logic will likely not trigger a new order this period, which is appropriate given the massive volume currently pending in the supply chain.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 conclude, we finally observed the arrival of the order placed in Period 41 (286 units) after a lead time of 3 periods. This ended a prolonged stockout and left us with 162 units on-hand. The demand regime since Period 18 remains stable with a mean of ~148 units and significant volatility. My previous audit confirmed that 334 units in the 'In-transit' bucket (from P2, P24, and P25) are lost, meaning the effective pipeline is 315 units (649 - 334), none of which are currently expected to arrive immediately as no orders were placed between P42 and P44. Given the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods, I set L=3. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*148 = 592 using the 'recent_N' method (N=27 to cover the regime since P18). sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' with N=27 to capture the observed high volatility (std dev ~45), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent another stockout during the final periods.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 is stable with a mean of ~148 units (Period 18 to Period 45 mean \u2248 148.5). Period 45 demand was 170. Lead time remains unstable (1-3 periods), but recent Period 41 order arrived in 3 periods at Period 44, confirming L=3 is the safest planning horizon. Current on-hand is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 649 units is misleading because at least 334 units (P2: 155, P24: 68, P25: 111) are confirmed lost after 20+ periods of non-arrival. The actual functional pipeline is approximately 315 units. To ensure availability given the 148 mean demand and L=3 (requiring 4 periods of coverage), the base stock target should be ~592 units (148 * 4). With ~315 units in the real pipeline and 0 on-hand, the OR backend needs parameters that reflect this gap. I will use a recent_N (N=28) for mu_hat to capture the post-P18 regime and explicit L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Audit P46: 334 units confirmed lost (P2, P24, P25); effective pipeline is 'In-transit' minus 334. Lead time P41 confirmed at 3 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in Period 47. Demand has been in a high-mean regime since Period 18, with an average of approximately 148 units/period. Lead times are highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a planning horizon of L=3 for safety. A pipeline audit confirms that orders from Period 2 (155 units), Period 24 (68 units), and Period 25 (111 units) are lost (total 334 units), meaning the effective 'In-transit' quantity is 315 (649 - 334). The order from Period 41 (286 units) arrived in Period 44 and was exhausted by Period 45. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Since we are entering the final 4 periods of the game (47, 48, 49, 50), and the actual lead time is likely 3 periods, an order placed now (P47) would arrive in Period 50. I will set L=3 and use a recent_N demand window of 29 periods (since P18) to capture the current regime. Given the stockout and the end-of-game proximity, the goal is to ensure inventory arrives for the final period while accounting for the effective pipeline.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 is stable with a mean of approximately 148 units, though volatility is high. The primary challenge is lead time instability and lost shipments. Total units confirmed as lost (unlikely to arrive) amount to 334 (P2: 155, P24: 68, P25: 111). The system 'In-transit' shows 649, but the effective pipeline is actually 315 (649 - 334). L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent maximum observed lead time, ensuring the base stock level (target) covers the 4-period risk horizon (L+1). mu_hat is calculated using the last 30 periods (N=30) to capture the higher demand regime since P18 while smoothing out the extreme variance. sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 30 periods to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the observed demand spikes and lead-time-induced stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 has remained stable at approximately 150 units per period (mean ~151, std dev ~40 over the last 30 periods). Lead time remains the primary challenge; although the promised lead time is 2, historical analysis shows frequent 3-period arrivals and significant lost shipments. Specifically, Period 24 (68 units) and Period 25 (111 units) are definitively lost (20+ periods overdue). The current 'In-transit' figure of 649 units is misleading because 179 of those units (P24+P25) will never arrive. Adjusting for these lost units, the effective pipeline is 470 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a target base stock intended to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand (~600 units), the effective pipeline of 470 units is insufficient. Setting L=3 (explicit) and mu_hat=600 (explicit) ensures the OR backend attempts to restore inventory levels to meet the elevated demand regime while accounting for the high-risk, 3-period lead time environment.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 18 and has remained stable with a mean of approximately 149 units (calculated from Period 18 to 49). The current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 650 units. However, based on the pipeline audits in Periods 41-43 and 46, we know that units from Period 2 (155 units), Period 24 (68 units), and Period 25 (111 units) are lost, totaling 334 units. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 650 - 334 = 316 units. The most recent order (P41) arrived with a lead time of 3 periods in P44. We continue to use L=3 for planning due to the frequent 3-period arrivals observed throughout the history. I will set the demand parameters to reflect the post-P18 regime (length 32 periods) and use L=3 to ensure the backend base-stock calculation accounts for the persistent lead time instability and protects the service level.

Carry-over insight: Effective in-transit inventory is 316 units (System In-transit 650 - 334 confirmed lost units from P2, P24, P25). Demand regime since P18 remains stable at ~149 units.
