Looking at the provided historical demand samples for the first 5 periods (110, 116, 74, 101, 85), the mean demand is approximately 97 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) is expected to arrive during Period 3 (Lead Time L=2). To ensure stock for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 periods), I need to cover demand until the next possible arrival. Since current on-hand and in-transit are both 0, and the demand is roughly 100/period, I will order enough to cover approximately 3 periods of demand plus a small buffer for variance, especially since I am starting with zero inventory.",

Therefore, I expect 320 units to arrive during Period 3 and become visible at the start of Period 4. Historical demand samples (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) suggest an average of roughly 97 units/period, but Period 1 actually saw 156 units, indicating a potentially higher demand regime or volatility. My goal is to cover (L+1) periods of demand, which is 3 periods (Period 2, 3, and 4). Total demand for 3 periods at ~156 units/period is 468 units. Currently, I have 0 on-hand and 320 in-transit (expected in P3). To bridge the gap and ensure availability for Period 4, I need roughly 468 - 320 = 148 units.
