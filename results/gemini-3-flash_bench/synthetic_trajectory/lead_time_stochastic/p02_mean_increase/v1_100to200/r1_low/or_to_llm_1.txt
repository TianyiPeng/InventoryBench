The OR baseline recommendation is 149 units, calculated using the promised lead time of 2 (target inventory for 1+L=3 periods) and the provided distribution. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning the OR agent aims for a target base-stock around the mean demand. Since demand in Period 1 was quite high (141), and the current on-hand balance is 0, we must place an order immediately to cover demand in Period 3 (when this order arrives).

Based on the lead-time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3 and become visible at the start of Period 4. No orders have arrived yet, which is consistent with a 2-period lead time. 2. Inventory Position: Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory is 292 (149 from P1 + 143 from P2). 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are [141, 118, 67, 94, 89]. Recent concluded demand was 91 (P1) and 130 (P2). The average demand is approximately 102 units. 4. Strategy & OR Reconcilation: The OR recommendation is very low (21 units) because it sees a large pipeline (292) relative to its calculated base stock for a 2-period lead time. However, with current on-hand at 0 and the first shipment not arriving until the end of this period, we have already missed all sales in P1 and P2. To ensure we don't stock out in Period 5 (when today's order arrives), we need to maintain the pipeline. Since the average demand is ~100 and lead time is 2, the pipeline should cover 3 periods (Period 3, 4, and 5) of demand (~300 units). With 292 already in transit, a small order is sufficient to maintain this levels.

Per the logic, the P1 order (149 units) is expected to arrive during P3's resolution and become visible in the P3 conclude message, which I see at the start of P4. However, the P3 conclude message still shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or shipments are delayed/lost. 2. Inventory analysis: On-hand is 0.

OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 4 units, likely because it assumes the 313 units in-transit will satisfy demand for the L+1 period. However, OR uses the promised lead time (2), whereas the actual lead time is clearly longer (3+). 5. Strategy: Because nothing arrived in P3 (where the P1 order was expected), I am facing a stockout. I need to maintain a pipeline that accounts for the longer lead time. However, 313 units are already in the pipeline. If I order more now, and the delay is just a shift to L=3, I will have an oversupply of high-holding-cost items ($1.0/unit). If the shipments are lost, I'm in trouble.

Subtracting these from the nominal pipeline leaves an effective pipeline of 750 units (550 from P25, 150 from P24, 50 from P9 [the P9 order is definitely lost as it is 16 periods overdue]). The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the inflated nominal pipeline and does not account for the demand spike or the high probability of delivery failure. While 550 units were ordered in Period 25 and 150 in Period 24, the high stockout risk and inconsistent lead times (often 3 periods or 'lost') necessitate placing an order now to maintain a buffer, especially since the product has zero on-hand inventory and a high stockout history.",

Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shifted to a higher regime, averaging approximately 177 units over the last 10 periods, compared to the initial historical mean of 105. Recent demand in Period 27 was 122, showing high variance but a sustained higher average.\n\nLead-time & Pipeline Analysis: The promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual performance is highly volatile and characterized by both batching (Period 23 saw 450 units arrive at once) and significant losses. Based on history, shipments P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 are confirmed as lost (totaling 648 units). Current in-transit is 1698. Subtracting known lost units (648), the effective pipeline is 1050 units. These effective units are from orders P24 (150), P25 (550), P26 (150), and P27 (180). Order P24 (placed Period 24) is now starting Period 28, meaning it is at L=4 and potentially part of a new delay or loss cycle.\n\nStrategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees a massive pipeline (1698) relative to demand. However, the supplier is extremely unreliable. We have had zero arrivals for the last 4 periods (P24-P27). Since Period 25 we ordered 550 units to catch up, but none have arrived yet. Because effective pipeline (1050) still covers roughly 6 periods of high-regime demand, and holding costs equal profit ($1.0), over-ordering is risky if a large batch arrives (like in P23). However, given the total lack of arrivals and zero stock, a small hedge is necessary to provide for future periods if current pipeline units are also lost.\n\nFinal Decision: Order 150 units. This maintains the recent ordering pace to counter-balance the high loss rate observed from this supplier, while avoiding a massive inventory spike if the P25 (550 units) order finally arrives.",

However, historical evidence from Period 4 to Period 44 shows chronic supplier unreliability and massive losses. Specifically, our logs confirm that orders P2 (143), P6 (75), P15 (60), P17 (120), P18 (120), P19 (150), P25 (550), P29 (150), P30 (150), and P33 (150) are lost, totaling 1,668 units that will never arrive. Furthermore, subsequent 'recent' orders (P42, P43, P44 totaling 750 units) are within the typical variability of the lead time (effectively 1-4 periods). The current demand regime has stabilized at a higher level, averaging approximately 195 units over the last 10 periods. With on-hand inventory at 112 units and demand exceeding 170-200 units per period, we face an immediate stockout risk if we don't maintain a consistent order flow. The effective pipeline (total in-transit minus confirmed losses) is roughly 1,150 units, which covers about 6 periods of demand at the current rate. I will maintain a steady order of 250 units to offset current high demand and hedge against the high probability of further shipment losses, ensuring we don't experience a total inventory collapse as seen in periods 18-22.",

Subtracting these from the nominal pipeline leaves an effective pipeline of approximately 900 units. Since we are at Period 47 of 50, we only need to cover demand for Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50. With 4 periods remaining and an average demand of 210, the total required supply is roughly 840 units.

Orders placed in P49 or P50 will almost certainly not arrive in time to resolve demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after P47. The nominal in-transit pipeline is 2768 units; however, historical analysis shows ~1668 units are likely lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33). This leaves an effective pipeline of ~1100 units. Specifically, orders P44, P45 (250 each), P47 (200), and P48's potential order are the only relevant units. Order P44 (placed P44) is due to arrive during P46 or P47 based on L=2/3, yet it hasn't appeared in the P47 conclude. It is highly likely to arrive in P48's arrival phase. Demand is currently in a high regime averaging ~205 units. To cover periods 48, 49, and 50 (approx 615 units), and accounting for the fact that P44 and P45 (500 units total) are imminent but not yet on hand, I will order a buffer to ensure we maximize sales in the final stretch.

However, based on extensive historical tracking, approximately 1,668 units in the pipeline are confirmed or likely lost (Orders P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33, among older ones). This leaves an effective pipeline of roughly 1,350 units. Orders from P44 (250), P45 (250), P47 (200), and P48 (250) are the most likely candidates for arrival in the final periods. Recent demand has been consistent in a high regime, averaging ~207 units over the last 10 periods. The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely due to the massive (though mostly invalid) nominal pipeline inventory. Given that this is the penultimate period (Period 49 of 50), any order placed now must arrive within 1 period (L=0 or L=1) to be sold in Period 50. Historical data shows lead times frequently fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. Ordering more now risks incurring high holding costs for units that arrive too late to be sold or sit idle after the game ends. However, because on-hand is zero and we have one final period of demand to satisfy, I will place a small safety order of 150 units to complement the expected arrivals from P47/P48, balancing the risk of a stockout in P50 against the penalty of ending with excess inventory.",

To ensure availability given the supplier's high lead-time volatility and the current 0 on-hand status, a replenishment order is necessary. While this is the final period of the game (total periods = 50), and orders placed now may not arrive in time to resolve demand within this period (as arrivals happen after the decision), I will place an order to cover potential immediate stockouts if the lead time were 0 (though promised is 2).
