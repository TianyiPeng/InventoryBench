Historical data for the first 5 periods (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) shows an average demand of approximately 102 units/period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the timeline, an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 and be visible/usable for demand in Period 4. Therefore, I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 with this order and future orders. Since I have 0 inventory and 0 in-transit, I need to order enough to meet immediate expected demand while acknowledging that the first arrival won't happen until Period 3.

The inventory status shows On-hand = 93 and In-transit = 400. Analyzing the pipeline: P14 order (100) and P15 order (50) are in transit. Previous insights indicate lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. Looking at the history, P13 had an order of 0. Based on the 3-period lead time logic, the P14 order (100) should arrive in P17. Current inventory (93) minus P16 demand (~100) leaves me near zero. However, the In-transit total of 400 seems to include older orders that have not concluded. Specifically: P14 (100) and P15 (50) account for 150 units. If In-transit is truly 400, there are 250 units unaccounted for from earlier periods. Given P6 (100) was confirmed lost, and P13 was 0, the remaining in-transit must be from very old periods or the system is tracking units differently. I must ensure I cover demand for the next 4 periods (Current + 3 lead time) = 400 units. Pipeline (On-hand 93 + 150 current clear orders) = 243. This suggests a deficit of 157 units. However, holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0), making overstocking extremely expensive. With 400 units technically 'in-transit' and 93 on hand, I risk high holding costs if the ghost units arrive.

P40 (150), P41 (150), and P42 (150) are the primary viable pipeline. If P37 is now also considered lost (it is 6 periods old), the viable pipeline is just P40, P41, P42 total 450 units.
