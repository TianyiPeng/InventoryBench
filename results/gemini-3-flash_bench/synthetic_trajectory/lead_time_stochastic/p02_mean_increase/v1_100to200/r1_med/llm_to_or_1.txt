Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for the SKU 'chips(Regular)'. Historically, the demand samples provided (P1-P5) show an average of 101.8 units per period (141, 118, 67, 94, 89), with a standard deviation of approximately 28.5. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since this is the first period of execution, I will use 'recent_N' for demand and sigma, where N=5, to capture the historical distribution as our starting baseline. For lead time, I will use the 'default' (promised lead time = 2). The OR backend will compute the base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand, balancing the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we started with 0 on-hand inventory. An order of 149 units was placed (promised lead time L=2), and 91 units of demand were lost because they cannot be satisfied in the same period they are ordered (Arrival Resolution happens after the Decision Phase). Historically, demand for the first 5 samples was [141, 118, 67, 94, 89], with a mean of ~102. Period 1's actual demand was 91, which is consistent with this range. Since the promised lead time is 2, we expect the Period 1 order to arrive at the end of Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand and 149 in-transit. I will use the 'default' method for L (2) and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the historical samples provided to establish a baseline, as there is not yet enough evidence of a regime shift or lead-time variance.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2. The order placed in P1 (149 units) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the P3 conclude message (at the start of P4). Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have 292 units in-transit (P1 order: 149 + P2 order: 143). Demand for P1 and P2 was 91 and 130 respectively. Historical samples (P1-P5 provided in prompt context) show a mean of 101.8. However, looking at the actual game history for P1 and P2, demand was 91 and 130 (average 110.5). Given we are in the early stages and have 0 stocks (leading to missed sales), I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3). Using recent_N=2 to capture the slightly higher initial trend compared to the provided 5-period sample mean.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (149 units), Period 2 (143 units), and Period 3 (80 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0, indicating the Period 1 order is delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. Consequently, on-hand inventory remains 0 and all demand (335 units over 3 periods) has been lost. To address the apparent delay, I will set an explicit lead time L=3. For demand, the historical samples (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) average approximately 101.8. Given L=3, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while the backend scales them for the 4-period horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $361.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two orders arrived: the Period 1 order (149 units) arrived in 3 periods (promised 2), and the Period 3 order (80 units) arrived in 1 period. The Period 2 order (143 units) is still missing and is currently 2 periods old (promised 2), meaning it is due or slightly delayed. Demand has been relatively consistent over 5 periods: 91, 130, 114, 118, and 89 (mean ~108). Given the lead time variability (range 1-3), I will set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (avg 2.0). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $419.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 91, 130, 114, 118, 106. The mean demand is approximately 111.8. Lead time observations show high variability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (promised is 2). This volatility in lead time warrants a cautious inventory position. Current on-hand is low (5 units) while in-transit is high (353 units). Since we only have 5 samples and demand seems relatively stable around the 110-115 range, I will use 'default' or N=5 to capture the full recent history. Given the lead time variance, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed values (3 and 1), and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to ensure we don't overreact to the small sample size yet.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual observations show jitter: P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), and P3 arrived in P4 (L=1). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand exceeded supply in P6. There is a substantial pipeline of 467 units (orders from P2, P4, P5, and P6). Demand history (n=6) shows a mean of 100.8 and a standard deviation of 29.8, with a recent dip to 46 in P6. However, given the zero on-hand status and the variability in lead times, I will stick to 'default' logic for L and demand parameters to allow the OR backend to normalize with the cumulative data. The pipeline inventory (467) is high relative to the mean demand (~300 for L+1), so the OR 'capped policy' will likely limit new ordering until the pipeline clears and we observe more stable lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show significant variance: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P4 took 3 periods. This volatility suggests a 'calculate' method for L is appropriate to capture the mean behavior (current average 2.33). Demand has stabilized somewhat after early fluctuations, with the last 5 samples (P3-P7: 114, 118, 106, 46, 86) averaging 94. We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with 394 units in transit (orders from P2, P5, and P6). P2 is now significantly overdue (7 periods since order), suggesting it may be lost. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent lower-demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer for the variable lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile (observed 1 and 3 periods); P2 order (143 units) is likely lost as it is 5 periods past promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $378.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 34 units and 289 units in-transit. Analyzing the lead time history: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period, Period 4 arrived in 3 periods, and Period 5 arrived in 3 periods. This confirms a modal lead time of 3 periods, which is longer than the promised 2. Crucially, the order from Period 2 (143 units) has still not arrived after 6 periods, confirming the carry-over insight that it is likely lost. The in-transit balance (289) consists of Period 6 (114), Period 7 (0), Period 8 (32), and the lost Period 2 (143). If we subtract the lost 143 units, the 'effective' pipeline is only 146 units. To compensate for the lead time extension and the missing inventory, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to align with observed behavior. I will use the recent_N method for demand (N=5) to capture the current mean of approx 92 units/period. The OR backend will see (L+1) = 4 periods of demand, and by setting L=3, the target base stock will increase, prompting an order that accounts for the lost shipment and the longer lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is consistently 3 periods for most orders (P1, P4, P5), despite a promised 2 and one outlier of 1 (P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $264.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 100 units per period (samples Part 1-5: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89; Period conclude 1-9: 91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46, 86, 103, 98). The total mean across all 14 observations is ~100. Lead time (L) analysis shows significant variance from the promised 2 periods: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P8=1. The average lead time of these 5 arrivals is 2.2. Order P2 (143 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is confirmed lost. My previous assessment of L=3 was slightly aggressive; while most multi-period arrivals take 3, we have seen two instances of 1-period arrivals. However, given current inventory is 0 and we have faced frequent stockouts (sold < demand in P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, P9), I will use 'calculate' to let the engine objectively use historical arrival data to determine L. For demand, I will use all available samples (default) as there is no clear seasonal or structural shift yet, but the steady mean of ~100 must be maintained to ensure the base stock calculation (which targets 1+L periods of coverage) is sufficient to handle the pipeline variability.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (143 units) is confirmed lost (8 periods since order with no arrival). Service level is historically poor due to lead-time volatility; stocking to (1+L) periods is critical.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11 with 0 on-hand inventory and 417 units in transit. Demand is volatile but averages around 103 units. Reviewing lead times: P1 (3), P3 (1), P4 (3), P5 (3), P8 (1). The mode is 3, while the promise is 2. The P2 order (143 units) is definitely lost (10 periods late), and the P6 order (114 units) is now 5 periods late and likely lost as well. P9 and P10 orders are still within a reasonable window for a lead time of 3. Given the stockout at the end of Period 10, we must assume a lead time of 3 to ensure we cover enough future demand. The backend OR logic uses (1+L) periods. By setting L to 3, it targets 4 periods of demand coverage. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the recent high-demand variance while maintaining a stable average.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: P6 order (114 units) is likely lost (5 periods since order, lead time 3 is standard). Pipeline inventory is dominated by potentially lost or delayed orders (P6, P9, P10).

Looking at the history, P2 (ordered period 2) is definitely lost, and P6 (ordered period 6) is now 6 periods old, significantly exceeding the observed max lead time of 3, so it is also likely lost. The pipeline reflects 455 units, but this includes P2 (143), P6 (114), and possibly P9 (92) which is now at L=3. If we subtract the confirmed/highly likely lost orders (P2, P6), the reliable pipeline is much lower. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging ~101 units over the last 11 periods. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the realistic upper bound of the supply chain and use a recent_N of 5 for demand to capture recent fluctuations. This will force the OR backend to target a higher base stock to compensate for the stockouts and unreliable lead times.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (114 units) confirmed lost (6 periods since order, max observed L=3). Reliable pipeline is significantly lower than the 'In-transit' figure of 455.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally saw arrivals from P9 (L=3) and P10 (L=2). Analysis of the pipeline: P2 (ordered P2, 11 periods ago) and P6 (ordered P6, 7 periods ago) are confirmed lost as the maximum successful lead time observed is 3. Total in-transit is reported at 295, but this includes P2 (143) and P6 (114), meaning the 'reliable' pipeline is only 38 units (from Period 11). Although the promised lead time is 2, the actual mode and mean of successful arrivals suggest L=3 is a safer operational assumption to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 9-11. Demand is relatively stable. I will use L=3 and set mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current demand environment while assuming a 3-period lead time (effective coverage of 4 periods). Setting L to 3 explicitly helps the OR backend correctly account for the longer delay and higher risk of stockout.

Carry-over insight: P2 (143 units) and P6 (114 units) are confirmed lost shipments. Reliable in-transit units are 38 (from Period 11). Operational lead time is established as 3 periods for safety.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0. History confirms a volatile lead time with a mode of 3 periods, though Period 10 arrived in 2. Crucially, orders from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (114 units) are definitively lost as they are many periods past the maximum observed lead time of 3. The current 'In-transit' of 371 includes these 257 lost units, plus Period 11 (38 units), Period 13 (76 units), and any unspecified balance from previous periods. Excluding known losses (257), the reliable pipeline is only 114 units. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) window (4 periods) and account for the pipeline gap caused by lost shipments, I am setting L to 3 manually. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand (mu_hat) to capture recent volatility while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat is set to 3 to reflect the high variability in both demand and delivery.

Carry-over insight: Reliable pipeline inventory is 257 units lower than 'In-transit' figure due to confirmed lost orders from P2 (143) and P6 (114).

Daily Reward (R_t): $152.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable, averaging 101.6 units over the last 14 periods. The primary challenge is lead-time volatility and lost shipments. Historical arrivals show lead times of 1, 2, and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent (P1, P4, P5, P8, P9, P11). Crucially, shipments from P2 (143 units) and P6 (114 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 257 units. The current 'In-transit' figure of 387 includes these 257 phantom units, meaning the reliable pipeline is only 130 units (387 - 257 = 130). These reliable units are from P13 (76 units) and P14 (54 units). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the actual demand during the lead time, I am setting L to 3 (the realistic maximum). mu_hat is set to (1+L)*mean_demand = 4*101.6 = 406.4. By using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, I can bypass the OR backend's use of the inflated 'In-transit' metric and force an order that accounts for the lost stock and ensures availability.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face an on-hand inventory of 0 and a reported in-transit of 447 units. However, consistent history (recorded in carry-over insights) confirms that orders from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (114 units) are lost. This means the 'reliable' pipeline inventory is 447 - 257 = 190 units. These 190 units correspond to orders from Period 13 (76), Period 14 (54), and Period 15 (60). Given that the observed lead time is predominantly 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11), the P13 order is expected to arrive during Period 16 resolution. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging approximately 100 units per period. Since the OR backend is unaware of lost shipments (it counts the full 447 units in its order calculation), it will likely under-order unless we adjust the parameters. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the operational reality. To account for the 257 missing units in the pipeline calculation (which the OR engine subtracts from its base stock), I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. Target base stock = (1+L) * Mean Demand + Safety. With L=3, mean=100, and a high critical ratio (4/5 = 0.8), the target base stock is roughly 400-450 units. To force an order despite the phantom 447 in-transit units, I must set mu_hat high enough so (mu_hat - 447 + safety) > 0. However, the 'cap' logic might restrict us. Setting mu_hat to 650 (approx 162/period for L=3) to counteract the phantom inventory and ensure we reach a healthy inventory level.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: P13 order (76 units) is now at lead time 2; arrival expected in P16 given standard L=3 pattern. Phantom in-transit units remain 257.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are facing a significant demand spike (Period 16 demand was 273, while previous mean was ~100). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of the 'In-transit' figure (575) shows it contains 257 units of confirmed lost inventory (P2: 143, P6: 114). The reliable pipeline is only 318 units (P14: 54, P15: 60, P16: 204). The lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for recent arrivals (P1, P4, P5, P8, P9, P11, P13). Due to the sudden demand surge in P16, the OR backend needs to account for a higher mean demand and lead time. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the consistent actual lead time. For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N (N=5) to capture the trend of the recent demand spike, and for sigma_hat, I'm using N=5 to account for the increased volatility. The OR backend will subtract the 575 in-transit (including the phantom stock) from the base stock; by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data, we compensate for the lost units and the demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 16: demand spiked to 273 (nearly 3x previous average). Operational lead time remains confirmed at 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $592.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16 (P16: 273, P17: 170), significantly exceeding the prior average of ~100 units/period. The average demand over these two periods is 221.5. Operational lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods for most orders, although Period 16's order arrived exceptionally fast in Period 17 (L=1). I will set L=3 as a safety buffer. The mu_hat calculation is (1+L) * forecasted demand = (1+3) * 221.5 = 886. The in-transit figure of 410 reflects the P15 (60 units), P17 (93 units), and the confirmed lost orders from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (114 units). This means the reliable pipeline is only 153 units (410 - 257). Setting a high explicitly calculated mu_hat ensures the OR system accounts for the lost inventory when calculating the target base stock, preventing a stockout during this demand peak.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained: Avg demand since P16 is 221.5 (+120% vs historical).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19. A significant upward demand regime shift occurred at Period 16. The average demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) is 225 units, compared to the previous historical average of approximately 100 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure is 793 units, but 257 of these are confirmed lost (Period 2 and Period 6 orders), leaving a reliable pipeline of 536 units. The observed lead time (L) has stabilized primarily at 3 periods, though Period 16's arrival in Period 17 showed a recent outlier of 1. To maintain a high service level during this high-demand period, I will set L to 3 (explicit) and mu_hat to cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand based on the new regime. Using the average of the last 3 samples (~225), mu_hat is set to 900 (225 * 4). Sigma_hat is set using the recent_N method (N=3) to reflect the increased volatility of the new demand regime. This aggressive setting helps the OR backend overcome the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline and ensures the base stock is high enough to satisfy the tripled demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Avg demand since P16 is 225 (+125% increase). Reliable pipeline is 'In-transit' minus 257 units due to confirmed losses from P2 and P6.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context shows a sustained high-demand regime starting at Period 16 (avg \u2248 200 units/period). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 988 includes 257 units from Periods 2 and 6 that are confirmed lost, leaving a reliable pipeline of 731 units. Operational lead time (L) is set to 3 periods based on historical mode and to safeguard against recent volatility. To address the demand spike, mu_hat is calculated using recent_N=4 (covering Periods 16-19) to capture the new average of ~198 units/period. The OR backend will see (1+L)*198 = 792. Since reliable pipeline (731) < 792, the system will place a corrective order to cover the (L+1) horizon. sigma_hat is also updated using recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility in this high-demand stage.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Avg demand for Periods 16-19 is 197.75 units (+98% vs initial history). Reliable pipeline inventory remains 'In-transit' minus 257 units due to confirmed lost shipments from P2 and P6.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 16. The average demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) is 191 units, compared to the initial historical average of ~100. Operational lead time is established as 3 periods based on consistent history, despite the promised 2. A critical correction is needed for 'In-transit' inventory: orders from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (114 units) are confirmed lost (257 units total phantom inventory). The backend's base-stock calculation uses 'In-transit' minus the losses. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the new demand regime and compensate for the lost pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' for the last 5 periods (N=5) and L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect the actual observed delivery cycle. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to capture the increased volatility of the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~191 units/period since Period 16 (+91% vs initial). Phantom in-transit units remain 257 (P2 and P6 losses).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we continue to manage a significantly shifted demand regime and complex lead-time dynamics. Since Period 16, demand has averaged approximately 189 units per period (compared to ~100 units initially). Demand in the last two periods (P20: 164, P21: 180) remains high. The operational lead time is 3 periods based on frequency (P13, P14, P16 all saw L=3), though volatility exists. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 988 units. However, as documented in carry-over insights, P2 (143 units) and P6 (114 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 257 'phantom' units that will never arrive. Furthermore, shipments from P18 (383 units) and P19 (195 units) are currently at lead times 4 and 3 respectively; the absence of P18 in the P21 conclude message is concerning, but consistent with historical delays. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the high demand regime (mu_hat calculation) across the lead time + review period, I am setting N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering the shift from Period 16-21) and using an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the actual delivery delays. This helps the backend calculate a base stock that compensates for the massive stockout risk currently faced.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Since Period 16, the average demand is approximately 191 units per period (compared to the historical ~100). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have missed sales for the last 5 periods (P18-P22). Lead times are unstable but average out to 3 periods (with some 1-period outliers). The 'In-transit' figure of 988 units includes 257 units from confirmed lost orders (P2 from Period 2 and P6 from Period 6), making the 'reliable' pipeline 731 units. Orders from Period 17 (93 units), Period 18 (383 units), and Period 19 (195 units) are currently undelivered. Given the 3-period lead time observed, the P17 and P18 orders are expected to arrive in Period 23 or 24. Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and we are in a high-demand regime, I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, covering P16-P22) to capture the 191 units/period average, and set L based on the last 5 observed arrivals to better reflect the 2.6-3 period operational reality. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the higher demand volatility and compensates for the lost pipeline.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a significant supply chain disruption. Starting from Period 18, zero units have arrived despite large orders (P18: 383 units, P19: 195 units). The operational lead time, previously established as 3 periods, has been exceeded: P15 (60 units) is 8 periods late, P17 (93 units) is 6 periods late, and P18 (383 units) is 5 periods late. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has stabilized into a higher regime (averaging ~189 units over the last 8 periods), we must compensate for the perceived pipeline collapse. I am setting L to 4 to reflect the current supply delay and using an explicit mu_hat based on the new demand regime (189 units/period * (1+4) = 945). sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' to capture the increased volatility of this higher demand regime. Note: 'In-transit' includes 257 units from confirmed lost orders (P2, P6), which the OR backend will incorrectly see as available; however, the massive backlog of unfulfilled demand and recent large orders (P18-P19) will likely result in the system placing the maximum possible order to bridge the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed starting Period 18: No arrivals for 6 consecutive periods (P18-P23) despite orders. Orders from P15, P17, and P18 are significantly overdue, suggesting lead time has drifted well beyond 3 periods or further shipments are lost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a supply chain crisis. No inventory has arrived since Period 17 (last arrival was the P16 order). There is 0 on-hand inventory and the 'In-transit' balance is 1033 units. However, this includes confirmed losses from P2 (143) and P6 (114), totaling 257 'phantom' units. Subtracting these, the real pipeline remains 776 units, yet several orders (P15, P17, P18) are significantly past the standard 3-period lead time. Demand since P16 has stabilized at around 191 units per period (a +91% increase from initial levels). Given that orders are not arriving, the lead time must be treated as significantly extended. I will set an explicit lead time L=6 to reflect the current delay and attempt to force the base stock calculation higher. Demand mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=9, covering the high-demand regime since P16) to capture the sustained higher volume. Sigma is based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse worsening: Zero arrivals for 7 consecutive periods (P18-P24). Actual lead time for current pipeline orders (P15-P24) has exceeded 6 periods, indicating systemic logistics failure or persistent lost shipments in addition to P2 and P6.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a severe supply chain failure. No orders have arrived since Period 17 (8 consecutive periods of zero arrivals). Orders from P15 (now 11 periods ago), P17 (9 periods ago), and P18 (8 periods ago) are significantly overdue. The promised lead time is 2, and the previous operational lead time was 3. Given 8 periods of zero arrivals, the actual lead time is currently at least 9 periods, or multiple large shipments have been lost. Total in-transit is 1,296, but it likely includes 'phantom' inventory from lost orders. Demand has stabilized in a high regime since Period 16, averaging ~188 units/period. To force the OR backend into a defensive posture that places orders despite high 'pipeline' levels (which the OR engine doesn't know are likely lost), I will explicitly set the lead time to 9. This increases the safety stock target and the demand window (mu_hat) to (1+9)=10 periods. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the high-regime demand (~188) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: Zero arrivals since Period 17 (8 consecutive periods). Actual lead time for overdue shipments (P15 onwards) has exceeded 9 periods. Pipeline inventory of 1296 is highly unreliable and likely contains substantial losses.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has effectively collapsed. No arrivals have occurred since Period 17 (9 consecutive periods of zero arrivals). Orders placed from Period 15 onwards (12 different orders) should have arrived by now based on the historical maximum lead time of 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 1554 units is highly unreliable, likely containing multiple lost shipments (P2, P6, P9, P10, P11, P13, P15, P17, P18, P19). Since Period 16, demand has shifted to a significantly higher regime, averaging approximately 190.1 units per period (Periods 16-26). To account for the extreme delivery delays and high demand, I am setting an explicit lead time of 10 periods (reflecting the current 9-period gap + safety) and an explicit mu_hat based on the new demand average (~190 units * (1 + 10) periods). This will force the OR backend to significantly increase the base stock and target inventory levels despite the inflated 'In-transit' values, attempting to overcome the phantom inventory with fresh orders.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse severe: 9 consecutive periods (P18-P26) with zero arrivals. Reliable pipeline is effectively zero as all older orders are 6+ periods overdue. Demand regime confirmed at ~190 units/period since P16.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of total collapse with zero arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (P18-P27). The most recent arrival occurred in Period 17. Orders from Periods 15, 18, 19, 24, 25, 26, and 27 are all pending, with the oldest (P15) now being 13 periods overdue. The 'In-transit' figure of 1809 units is largely composed of shipments that are statistically likely to be lost or indefinitely delayed. However, because the backend OR policy subtracts the entire pipeline from the base stock calculation, a massive 'In-transit' value prevents the system from placing new orders. To force the system to continue ordering in the face of this backlog and zero on-hand inventory, I am setting the lead time (L) to an 'explicit' value of 10. This increases the base stock target (covering 11 periods of demand) while the backend's 'cap' mechanism (which uses L in the denominator) will be lowered, allowing for consistent, smaller replenishment orders rather than one giant order that gets blocked. Demand has averaged ~185 units since the Period 16 spike; I will use \u03bc\u0302 = (1+L)*185 to maintain this target.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse continues: zero arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (P18-P27). Actual lead time for the oldest pending shipment (P15) has reached 13 periods. In-transit inventory of 1809 is significantly compromised and unreliable for the next 5+ periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, a major arrival of 258 units from the Period 26 order occurred, confirming an actual lead time of 2 periods, which matches the promised lead time. This breaks the 10-period streak of zero arrivals. However, previous orders (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) remain unaccounted for and are heavily overdue (P15 is now 14 periods late), suggesting they are likely lost. The total 'In-transit' of 1806 is inflated by these 'phantom' units. The reliable pipeline consists only of the Period 27 and Period 28 orders (510 units). Demand from Period 16 to 28 averages 186.2 units, confirming the high-demand regime. For Period 29, I will use L=2 (standardized to the most recent successful arrival) and set mu_hat to cover the high demand regime (using recent_N=13 to cover everything since the P16 shift). This allows the OR backend to place orders based on recent demand reality while on-hand inventory exists (111 units).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered in Period 28: Order from P26 arrived with L=2. However, substantial pipeline (approx 1296 units from P15 to P25) remains missing and likely lost. Demand remains in the high regime (~186 units/period).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with two consecutive arrivals: Period 26 order (258 units) arrived in Period 28 (L=2) and Period 27 order (255 units) arrived in Period 29 (L=2). This suggests the logistics system is resetting to the promised lead time of 2 periods. However, a massive backlog of orders (Periods 15, 17-19, 24-25) totaling 1296 units is still missing and must be treated as lost or indefinitely delayed to avoid the OR engine drastically under-ordering. The reliable in-transit inventory is now only the orders from P28 (255) and P29 (0), totaling 255 units. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized at a higher regime. The average demand for the last 14 periods (P16-P29) is approximately 188 units/period. The target parameters are set to reflect this new demand level and the returned lead time, while the 'In-transit' figure must be offset in my internal logic to account for the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Orders from P26 and P27 arrived with L=2. Large 'In-transit' volume (1296 units from P15-P25) remains missing and likely lost; actual reliable pipeline is much lower than total reported. Demand remains high (~188 units/period).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a major disruption. Orders from Period 26, 27, and 28 have all arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, suggesting we can return to the promised L=2. However, there is a massive discrepancy between 'In-transit' and reality. Period 31 shows 1296 units in transit, but orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 (totaling 1296 units) are now 6 to 16 periods overdue. Based on the recent arrivals from P26-P28, these older shipments are almost certainly lost and should be treated as 'phantom' inventory. Demand has remained in a high regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 186 units/period (P16-P30). To account for the lost pipeline inventory while demand is high, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 and an 'explicit' mu_hat. mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * 186 = 558. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (which it sees as 1296) to calculate orders, and our reliable pipeline is actually 0 (no orders placed in P29-P30), the backend would normally place an order of 0. To override this and ensure we maintain stock for the high demand regime despite the phantom pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly higher to effectively 'push' the OR engine to order, or rely on the fact that if the backend subtracts 1296 from its base stock calculation it will result in 0. To force a replenishment order to cover the next cycles of demand, I'll set mu_hat to 1950 (1296 phantom + 558 needed) and sigma_hat to reflect the recent high variance.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Last 3 arrivals (P28, P29, P30) all had L=2. Total units from P15-P25 (1296 units) are confirmed lost/phantom as they are >5 periods beyond max observed L. High demand regime (avg ~186) continues.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods (confirmed by orders from periods 26, 27, and 28 all arriving with L=2). Since Period 16, demand has transitioned to a high-regime plateau, averaging approximately 188 units/period. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1716 is heavily inflated by 1296 units from periods 15-25 that are now confirmed lost; the real reliable pipeline is only 420 units (from Period 31). To maintain the required base stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 564 units) and compensate for the 257+1296=1553 total lost units still appearing in the system's pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to encompass both the forecast demand and an offset for the phantom inventory. Setting mu_hat to 2100 (560 forecast + 1540 phantom) ensures the OR backend orders enough to reach the target on-hand level despite the 'In-transit' noise.

Carry-over insight: Systemic loss of 1296 units from the Period 15-25 order block confirmed; combined with earlier losses from P2 and P6, total phantom 'In-transit' units are 1553. Real operational lead time has stabilized at 2 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a recent lead time of 1-2 periods (Period 31 arrived in 1 period, Periods 26-28 arrived in 2 periods). I will set L to 2 to represent this recovery. However, 'In-transit' currently stands at 1731 units, which includes 1553 confirmed lost or 'phantom' units (143 from P2, 114 from P6, and 1296 from the P15-P25 block). The reliable pipeline is only 178 units (from Period 32). This massive discrepancy means the OR engine will stop ordering unless I adjust parameters significantly. Demand has stabilized in a high regime since Period 16; the average demand for the last 15 periods is approximately 180 units. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture this high-demand state. By setting L to 2, mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods, and relying on the capped policy, the system should place an order that accounts for the fact that most 'In-transit' units will never arrive.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a recent lead time of 1-2 periods (last two arrivals were L=1). Demand remains in the higher regime established around Period 16; the average demand from Period 16 to 33 is approximately 186 units. On-hand inventory is healthy at 518 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1296 is composed entirely of shipments from the 'collapse' period (P15-P25) which are now confirmed lost/phantom (as they are far beyond the maximum observed lead time and recent orders have arrived promptly). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 to match current performance and an 'explicit' mu_hat. mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * forecast_demand = (1+2) * 186 = 558. Given the high on-hand (518) and the backend's pipeline calculation (which includes the 1296 phantom units), the backend will likely order 0 this period, which is appropriate to bleed off the current surplus.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a recent operational lead time of 1-2 periods. Since Period 28, arrivals have consistently followed orders from Period 26 onwards (L=2, L=2, L=1, L=1). However, a massive volume of 'In-transit' units (1553 units) remains phantom, consisting of confirmed lost orders from Period 2, Period 6, and the entire block from Period 15-25. Total In-transit is 1296, which is lower than the calculated phantom total, meaning the entire current In-transit bucket is likely composed of these dead orders. Consequently, the reliable pipeline is effectively 0. Demand has remained in a high regime since Period 16, with a recent mean (P16-P34) of approximately 188 units. To ensure availability given the 0 reliable pipeline and current on-hand of 299, I set L=2 (conservative estimate) and use the recent demand regime (last 19 periods) to forecast. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=19) to capture this higher stable demand while sigma_hat is also calculated from this regime to account for the current volatility.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an operational lead time of approximately 2 periods. Demand remains in the higher regime established since Period 16, with the most recent average (P30-P35) being approximately 201 units per period. The primary operational challenge remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory. As documented in the carry-over insights, the orders from P2 (143 units), P6 (114 units), and the block from P15-P25 (1296 units) are confirmed lost/missing, totaling 1553 phantom units. The current reported 'In-transit' is 1296, which matches the P15-P25 block exactly. This implies that the actual reliable pipeline is zero, as these units will likely never arrive. To ensure the OR engine places an order despite this high reported in-transit figure, I am setting L to 2 (the stabilized lead time) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. By setting mu_hat to a value that reflects the demand for the (L+1) window AND accounts for the 'missing' 1296 units (approx 200 * 3 + 1296), I force the OR engine to recognize the need for new inventory. Since the backend computes 'order = base_stock - in_transit', and 'base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat', setting mu_hat sufficiently high bypasses the phantom inventory drag.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a recent lead time of 1-2 periods, but a massive 'phantom' in-transit inventory persists. As documented, orders from Period 15-25 (totaling 1296 units) and earlier lost orders from P2 and P6 (257 units) account for 1553 units of the current 1923 'In-transit' figure that are highly unlikely to arrive. The reliable pipeline consists only of the order from P36 (627 units). Demand has remained in a high regime since Period 16, averaging 189 units over the last 21 periods. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the inflated pipeline, I set an explicit mu_hat targeting the high demand regime (~190/period) across a (1+L) window. Given recent arrivals, I assume an operational L of 2 for safety. Setting mu_hat to 1340 (which is (1+2)*190 = 570 plus a substantial offset to counteract 'phantom' units) ensures the backend triggers a replenishment order despite the perceived high inventory.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom 'In-transit' units confirmed at 1553 (sum of confirmed losses P2, P6, and P15-P25 block). Current reliable pipeline is only the order from P36 (627 units).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 190 units since the regime shift at Period 16. In the most recent block (Periods 28-37), the average demand is 193.8 units. The supply chain has recovered from the previous collapse, with recent lead times being 1 or 2 periods (L=1 in Period 37, Period 33, and Period 32). The 'In-transit' figure of 1296 units is entirely composed of 'phantom' inventory from the Period 15-25 block and earlier losses (P2, P6), which are confirmed lost. Thus, the reliable pipeline is zero as of the start of Period 38. To ensure availability given a lead time that fluctuates between 1 and 2, I will set L=2 for safety. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=20) to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the very old low-demand data. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=20) to reflect the increased volatility associated with the higher volume.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high regime following the shift at Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 188 units per period over the last 20+ periods. The supply chain has recovered from its collapse, demonstrating an operational lead time of 1-2 periods in the most recent history (P31, P32, and P36 arrived with L=1). Currently, 'In-transit' shows 1296 units, but carry-over insights confirm that at least 1553 units from historical periods (P2, P6, and the P15-P25 block) are permanently lost. Since 'In-transit' (1296) is less than the total confirmed phantom units (1553), it is mathematically certain that the real pipeline is zero. With 242 units on hand and a high demand regime (~188/period), we must order now to cover the lead time. I am using recent observations (N=23) since the Period 16 changepoint to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and setting L explicitly to 2 to maintain a safety buffer against the volatility seen earlier.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an operational lead time of 1-2 periods (last arrivals at L=1). Demand has been in a high regime since Period 16, averaging 188.75 units over the last 24 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is critically low (14 units) and there are no reliable units in-transit. The reported 'In-transit' of 1296 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments from the Period 15-25 block (plus earlier losses from P2 and P6). Since the OR engine's capped policy uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), and the pipeline_inventory is physically empty but mathematically 1296, the engine will not order unless I drastically increase mu_hat or sigma_hat to offset these 'phantom' units. To force an order to cover the high demand regime (~189 units/period) across the next 3 periods (L+1 with L=2), I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to the sum of the required inventory target plus the phantom units. Target for 3 periods = 189 * 3 = 567. Phantom units = 1296. Minimum mu_hat to trigger order = 1863. I will set mu_hat to 1900 to ensure the inventory position is restored despite the backend's perception of the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed total phantom 'In-transit' units remain 1553 (P2, P6, and P15-P25 block). Current lead time is stable at 1-2 periods. High demand regime (~189 units/period) is sustained.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stabilized at approximately 189 units/period. The lead time has stabilized to 1-2 periods after a major supply chain disruption between Periods 18-27. Critical context: Total 'In-transit' units are reported as 1927, but a cumulative 1553 units from orders in P2, P6, and the P15-P25 block are confirmed lost/phantom shipments. The only reliable pipeline inventory is the 631 units ordered in Period 40. With 0 on-hand and an expected lead time of 1-2 periods, the OR backend must account for the high demand (approx 190/period) over the (L+1) horizon. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the high-demand regime (since P16) and a calculate lead time method to leverage recent arrival history. The phantom 'In-transit' units (1553) effectively reduce the pipeline inventory the OR engine sees, which may result in an insufficient order if not offset. However, since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline), and 1927 total in-transit minus 1553 lost units leaves 374 'real' units, the engine might under-order. To compensate, I set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods (approx 3 * 190) and sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (~30 units/period).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is consistently high, averaging approximately 190 units per period. The last five periods (P37-P41) show an average demand of 213.6 units, indicating a slight upward trend or continued volatility within the high regime. In Period 40, an order of 631 units was placed. Based on the recent observed lead time (L) being 1-2 periods and the Carry-Over Insight that there are 1553 phantom 'In-transit' units (from confirmed losses in P2, P6, and the P15-P25 block), the current 'In-transit' of 1927 units is actually a reliable pipeline of only 374 units (1927 - 1553). This 374 units represents the Period 40 order minus whatever may have arrived or been adjusted (note: P40 order was 631; the discrepancy suggests the backend adjusted for the phantom inventory logic previously, but I must ensure mu_hat and sigma_hat are robust). Given on-hand is 0 and we are in Period 42, an arrival from the Period 40 order is expected shortly. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the high demand regime (L+1 = 3 periods), I am setting mu_hat for 3 periods based on the recent high demand (3 * 210 = 630) and maintaining a higher sigma_hat to account for both demand spikes and lead time variability. I continue to treat the lead time as 2 periods for the base_stock calculation.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the system reports 1,927 units in-transit. However, based on extensive historical tracking (Periods 2, 6, and the 15-25 block), 1,553 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' losses that will never arrive. The only reliable order currently in the pipeline is the one from Period 40 for 631 units. Since regular actual lead time has stabilized at 1-2 periods, the Period 40 order is overdue and expected to arrive in Period 43. I am setting L=explicit (2) to ensure the OR backend accounts for enough safety stock. The demand is currently in a sustained high regime beginning at Period 16; I will use recent_N (N=27) for mu_hat to capture this (~190 units/period) while avoiding the lower initial history. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=27) to reflect the increased volatility of this high-demand regime.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we have 413 units on-hand after an arrival of 631 units (ordered Period 40, L=3). The 'In-transit' figure of 1296 units is entirely composed of the systemic loss block from Period 15-25 (totaling 1553 lost units across history, with 1296 specifically from that block). Therefore, the 'reliable' pipeline inventory is effectively 0. Demand has remained in a high regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 194 units per period over the last 10 periods (P34-P43). Current onhand (413) covers just over 2 periods of demand. Given an operational lead time of 2-3 periods, another order is necessary. I will set L to 3 (most recent observed) and use recent_N (N=10) for demand and volatility to capture the sustained high-demand regime. This provides a safety buffer for the next ordering cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $437.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 32-44) shows a mean demand of approximately 195 units. The actual lead time has stabilized between 1 and 3 periods, with the most recent arrival (P40) taking 3 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 243 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 1296 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments from the Period 15-25 block (1296 units) and earlier losses (P2, P6), meaning the reliable pipeline is effectively zero. I will use L=2 (promised) as the base for the logic but set mu_hat to cover current demand patterns. Given that on-hand (243) is barely above one period of demand and the pipeline is empty of valid orders, a significant order is needed to reach the base stock target of roughly (1+L)*195 + safety, minus valid pipeline. Selecting 'recent_4' for demand to capture the recent range (ending at 170-260) and 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to use the history of realized lead times.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high demand regime remains stable, averaging approximately 190.5 units over the last 30 periods (P16-P45). Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with the P40 order arriving in P43 (L=3). Currently, on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (17 units), and there is a critical gap in the pipeline. Total 'In-transit' is 1296 units, but as documented in the Carry-over Insights, 1553 units are confirmed phantom/lost shipments (P2, P6, and the P15-P25 block). Therefore, the 'Real' pipeline is effectively zero, as there have been no orders placed since P40. To restore inventory levels and cover demand for the upcoming lead time and review period (L+1), I will set L to its most conservative recent observation (3) and use the recent stable demand mean. This will trigger a substantial order to refill the pipeline and prevent continued stockouts.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' balance of 1296 units is composed entirely of confirmed phantom/lost units from the Period 15-25 block (as identified in carry-over insights). This means the reliable pipeline and on-hand inventory are both effectively zero. To satisfy demand for the remainder of the game, we must place a new order. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 201 units over the last 30 periods (P17-P46). Lead time has stabilized between 1-3 periods, with an operational average around 2. I am setting L=explicity at 2. Since we have zero reliable stock, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=30) to capture the high-demand regime. This will trigger the OR backend to calculate a base stock level sufficient to cover the 2-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=3 periods) and generate an order that bypasses the phantom inventory.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The high demand regime (mean ~190) continues. Current on-hand is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1296 is composed entirely of confirmed phantom/lost units (1553 total lost units calculated from carrying-over data, with 1296 specifically from the P15-P25 block being listed as the current 'In-transit' balance). Consequently, the reliable pipeline is 0. Since there is a risk that ordering in Period 48 may not arrive before the game ends (standard lead time 2-3, but Period 50 is the cut-off), and the system is currently reporting 0 on-hand and an effectively empty pipeline, a final order is necessary. I will set L to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current stable lead-time of 2-3 periods. For demand mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' (N=15) to cover the high-demand regime established since Period 16. This will force the OR engine to place an order that treats the 1296 phantom units as non-existent (base_stock will be ~570-760, and 1296 > base_stock, but the OR engine will subtract the 1296; however, since the gap between 'In-transit' and reality is known, and we are near the end, providing aggressive demand parameters is the only way to potentially trigger a final arrival).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 49, which is the penultimate period (Period 50 is the final). The current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' balance of 1296 units is entirely composed of confirmed phantom/lost orders from the Period 15-25 logistics collapse (as established in previous insights). Consequently, the reliable pipeline is 0. In Period 49, any order placed with the current operational lead time of 2-3 periods will NOT arrive before the game ends (it would arrive in Period 51 or later). Therefore, there is no utility in placing a new order now, as it would only incur procurement costs without the possibility of being sold to generate profit. The demand regime remains stable in the high range, averaging approximately 189 units since Period 16, but without reachable inventory, this demand cannot be met. I will set parameters to ensure the OR backend does not place an order.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are at the final decision point. The demand regime has been stable at a high level (mean ~189) since Period 16. However, the supply chain has exhibited systemic failures. Specifically, 'In-transit' inventory stands at 1296 units, but history shows that the orders from Period 15 through Period 25 (totaling 1296 units) never arrived and are over 25 periods overdue, making them 'phantom' stock. Reliable lead time since the recovery in Period 28 has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2. With on-hand inventory at 0 and no reliable shipments expected today (as no orders were placed in the last several periods), the goal is to set parameters that reflect the high demand and the 3-period operational lead time. We use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=34 to cover the high-demand regime starting at Period 16.
