Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 141, 118, 67, 94, and 89 (average ~101.8). The OR recommendation is 149 units, based on these historical samples and a base-stock policy. Currently, there is 0 inventory on-hand and 0 in-transit. Since the lead time is 2, an order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 4. We need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 with existing stock (which is 0) and demand for Period 4 with this new order. However, since we start at 0, we are guaranteed to stock out in Periods 1, 2, and 3. My priority is to establish a pipeline. The OR recommendation of 149 is slightly higher than the historical average, which provides a safety buffer for when the units finally arrive.

Period 4 should see the arrival of 149 units, and Period 5 should see 143 units.\n\n2. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline (In-transit) is 292 (149 + 143).

The order placed in Period 1 (149 units) should have arrived during Period 3 and been visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. \n2. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory is 351 units (149 from P1, 143 from P2, 59 from P3). Demand has been consistently higher than 0 (91, 130, 114), but sales are 0 because no inventory has arrived yet. \n3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are 141, 118, 67, 94, 89 (mean ~102). Recent demand in the game history (91, 130, 114) averages ~112. \n4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends only 2 units. This is because the OR calculation (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 - pipeline) sees a massive pipeline of 351 units against an expected demand over the lead time (1+2 periods) of roughly 336 units. \n5. Strategy: Since the Period 1 order is already overdue for a L=2 lead time, I must assume a longer lead time (L=3+). If L=3, the P1 order should arrive during Period 4 and be available for sale.

However, history reveals inconsistency: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (lead status: 3), but the Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (lead status: 1). This suggests the supplier may batch orders or lead times are volatile. Average actual lead time is currently (3+1)/2 = 2. \n2. Inventory State: Current on-hand is 90 units. In-transit consists of orders from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 4 (40 units). The Period 2 order (143 units) is now at Period 5, which is lead time 3; based on the P1 experience, it is highly likely to arrive in the Period 5 resolution phase.\n3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand is [91, 130, 114, 118], with an average of roughly 113. Period 5 demand is already resolved in the history (89), but for decision-making purposes for Period 6+, the mean remains around 110-115.\n4. Strategy: The OR recommends 82. Pipeline inventory (90 on-hand + 183 in-transit = 273) is high. Total demand over (L+1) periods (3 periods) is approx 345. However, since the P2 order of 143 is expected to arrive immediately, the inventory position is relatively healthy.

Current In-transit (401) seems to cover this, but if P6 (88 units) is also lost, the effective pipeline is only 170 units (from P9).

We have 501 units in-transit (P9: 170, P11: 100, plus potentially older/lost units like P10 which was 0). 3. **OR Baseline**: OR recommends 0 because it sees 501 units in transit, which theoretically covers 5 periods of demand. 4. **Strategy**: I cannot rely on the 'In-transit' figure because of the track record of lost shipments (P2, P6). However, ordering more when 500 units are theoretically in the pipe risked high holding costs if they all arrive at once.

The rolling average of the last 5 periods (excluding the outlier jump) was ~100, but the new regime suggests a mean closer to 180-200. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the full historical mean which is heavily diluted by early low demand (~100). Given the new demand spike (avg ~220 over the last 2 periods) and the 3-period lead time, the total inventory needed to cover 4 periods (L+1) is approximately 800 units.

The pipeline contains large orders from P18 (200), P19 (200), P20 (150), and P21 (150). Based on LT=3, the P18 order should arrive in Period 21 (visible P22) or Period 22 (visible P23). Since 'arrived=0' in the P21 conclude message, we expect P18 to arrive during Period 22. To maintain a base stock that covers the 3-period lead time plus the review period (4 periods total) at the new demand mean of ~190 (Total needed ~760), we must account for the fact that the pipeline is heavily backloaded.

Given our inferred lead time of 3 periods, P18, P19, and P20 are significantly overdue, suggesting a massive delivery cluster or further shipment losses. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely driven by the massive pipeline of 1,332 units which, if it actually arrived, would cover nearly 7 periods of high demand.

This indicates a 'bottleneck' release where multiple periods of inventory arrive at once. Notably, orders P18 (200 units) and P19 (200 units) are still missing; given their age (6 and 5 periods respectively) and the history of lost shipments (P2, P6), they are highly likely lost. Demand Analysis: A regime shift was confirmed at Period 16, with demand increasing from ~100 to ~180-200 units. Recent demand (P23) was 187. Inventory Analysis: We have 263 units on-hand.

Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it sees the massive (but likely phantom) pipeline of 1032 units. However, with demand at ~190/period, our current 263 on-hand covers approx 1.4 periods.

We have confirmed 631 units in permanent losses (P2, P6, P18, P19). The current in-transit inventory of 1602 units is highly deceptive because it includes these losses and several clusters of overlapping orders. Specifically, orders from P24-P25 (360 units) are currently overdue if we assume a lead time of 1-3 periods, suggesting potential further losses. However, P26 (180 units) just arrived at LT=2. This provides some hope for the subsequent pipeline (P27, P28). Currently, we have 33 units on-hand. The OR recommendation of 0 is likely driven by the massive 'In-transit' figure, which the OR agent cannot distinguish as lost. To maintain a safety buffer against the high risk of further shipment losses and to satisfy the current demand regime (~190 units/period), I will ignore the OR's 0 recommendation and place an order of 180 units to keep the pipeline moving, matching the recent replenishment pace.",

The functional pipeline consists of orders from P37 (180), P39 (185), and potentially P17 etc. (though P17-P36 excluding known losses are largely accounted for by arrivals). Looking at recent history, P38 (180 units) arrived in P39 (LT=1). P37 (180 units) was ordered in P37 and should have arrived by P39 (LT=2), but since P39 conclude only shows arrival of P38, P37 is either slightly delayed (LT=3) or a new potential loss. \n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0. Expected functional pipeline is P37 (180) and P39 (185). If P37 arrives in P40, we have 180 units to meet ~200 demand. If it is lost, we have 0. \n4. **OR Recommendation Override**: The OR baseline suggests 0 units because it views the raw 'In-transit' figure of 1967 as huge relative to demand. However, 991 of those are definitely lost, and much of the remaining 'in-transit' logic in the system appears to be lagging or referencing older unfulfilled orders that likely won't arrive. \n5. **Strategy**: To maintain service levels in the face of frequent shipment losses and the ~200 unit demand regime, I must continue ordering to cover the lead time.

The current functional pipeline after accounting for the Period 44 arrival (P41) consists of orders from P42 (190), P43 (190), and P44 (195).

The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it misinterprets the massive 'in-transit' figure without discounting the 1,171 lost units. My analysis of the effective pipeline: On-hand (20) + P42 (190) + P43 (190) + P44 (195) = 595 units. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1) at a mean demand of ~200, we need approximately 600 units.

Specifically, the functional pipeline includes P44 (195), P45 (210), and P46 (210), totaling 615 units expected over the next 1-3 periods. Although the OR recommendation suggests 0 units, this is skewed by the inflated 'In-transit' figure which does not account for the 1171 lost units.
