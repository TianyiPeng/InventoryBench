Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time (L) of 2 periods. Historical demand data for the first five periods shows a mean of 101.8 units (141, 118, 67, 94, 89). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have no units in transit, we need to establish a base stock that covers the expected demand during the lead time and the current period (L+1 = 3 periods). Using the mean of the provided samples (101.8), the expected demand over 3 periods is approximately 305.4 units. Since we are just starting and have limited data, I will use 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to set initial parameters. The OR backend will calculate the optimal base stock using the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1) to achieve a high service level (~95% critical ratio).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 149 units (based on initial demand estimates not shown in history), but they have not arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. This means an order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales of 126 units in Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) shows a mean of 101.8. With L=2, the critical review+lead period covers 3 periods (1+L). mu_hat should target approximately 305 units. Since there isn't a confirmed shift yet (only 5 samples), I will use the default methods which calculate based on all available samples. However, I will set L to 'default' (2) as no arrivals have concluded to suggest otherwise.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically (pre-game), demand averaged 101.8. In the first two game periods, demand was 126 and 83 (avg 104.5), but we had zero on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (149 units) and Period 2 (151 units) are in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3 (arrival resolution) and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. Since we have zero on-hand and high lost sales, we need to maintain the pipeline. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (including pre-game samples) to capture current levels. The target service level is high (q = 19/20 = 0.95), and the OR backend's base-stock calculation will naturally account for the pipeline (300 units).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (149 units) were expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution and become visible at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0, and our on-hand inventory remains 0. This indicates either a delay or that the lead time is actually 3 or more periods. Demand in the first 3 periods (126, 83, 70) has been completely lost because we have no stock. Historical demand samples (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) show an average around 102. Given the stockout and the suspected lead time delay, I will explicitly set L to 3 to account for the observation that Period 1's order has not arrived yet. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the trend of the provided historical samples (mean ~101.8), and since L=3, the backend will calculate (1+3)*101.8 ~ 407. Pipeline inventory is currently 338 (149+151+38).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1913.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first set of completed order cycles. The promised lead time is 2 periods. However, the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 3), and the Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 1). The Period 2 order (151 units) is still in transit and is currently overdue (placed P2, expected P4 if L=2, now P5). Historical demand over 5 periods is: 126, 83, 70, 105, and 89 (mean ~95). Since lead times are erratic (1 and 3 periods), I will set L to 'calculate' to use the average observed lead time (2 periods). For demand, the sample size is small (N=5) and appears relatively stable around the mean, so I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture all available data while we establish a baseline. The OR backend will target a high service level given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1558.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are out of stock (ending on-hand inventory 0 in Period 5). Reviewing lead times: Order 1 arrived in 3 periods, Order 3 arrived in 1 period, and Order 2 is currently missing (shipped Period 2, promised L=2, now it is Period 6). The average lead time observed so far is (3+1)/2 = 2, which matches the promised lead time, but the missing Order 2 adds uncertainty. Currently, 393 units are in-transit (Orders 2, 4, and 5). Historical demand across the first 5 periods is: 126, 83, 70, 105, 109 (average = 98.6). Using the promised lead time L=2 (meaning a 3-period coverage window), the expected demand is roughly 296 units. Since we have 393 units in transit and a stockout, I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to let the system incorporate observed variation, and 'recent_N' for demand to stay responsive to the latest levels (approx 100-110). Parameter settings aim to balance the high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1) while accounting for the current delivery volatility.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory level is critical with 0 on-hand and 468 in-transit. Historical demand over 6 periods (126, 83, 70, 105, 109, 73) averages 94.3 units. Promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are volatile: Order 1 took 3 periods, Order 3 took 1 period, and Order 2 (151 units) is currently overdue (placed P2, expected P4, still not arrived at start of P7). This indicates a lead time drift or potential loss. With L=2, the base stock targets (1+L)=3 periods of demand. Given the stockout in P5 and P6, and the large pipeline (468 units) relative to recent demand, the OR backend's capped policy will likely restrict new ordering until the pipeline resolves. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend average the 3-period and 1-period arrivals, and 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand parameters to capture the full sample set while remaining responsive to the current average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1239.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we currently have 34 units on-hand and 367 in-transit. A review of lead times shows variability: orders arrived after 3 periods (P1, P4) and 1 period (P3), while the P2 order is significantly overdue (placed P2, now P8, 6 periods have passed), suggesting it might be lost. The promised lead time is 2, but the average of observed arrivals is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. Demand over the first 7 periods has averaged 90.4 units/period, with a standard deviation of 22.7. Although P5 and P6 resulted in stockouts due to delayed arrivals, the demand itself remains relatively stable. I will use a calculated lead time to account for the observed drift from the promised 2 periods. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the last 7 samples (recent_N=7) to capture the current regime across the (L+1) window, ensuring the backend targets a service level appropriate for the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile (range 1-3 periods, avg ~2.3); Period 2 order (151 units) is likely lost as it is 4 periods past promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2965.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The 'chips(Regular)' SKU has experienced significant lead time volatility and at least one lost shipment. Specifically, the order from Period 2 (151 units) is now 7 periods old and significantly past the promised lead time of 2, confirming it is lost. Historical lead times for delivered orders are 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods, averaging 2.5 periods. Demand over the last 8 periods (126, 83, 70, 105, 109, 73, 67, 157) averages ~98.75 units. Period 8 saw a spike to 157, potentially indicating a shift or volatility increase. Given the average lead time (L) of 2.5, the pipeline should cover L+1 = 3.5 periods of demand (~345 units). Current on-hand (18) + in-transit (263) = 281. However, the in-transit figure likely includes the lost Period 2 order (151 units). If we subtract the lost units, effective inventory is only 130. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays, use the last 5 samples for mu_hat to capture recent demand levels, and use recent_5 for sigma_hat to account for the high variance seen in Period 8.

Carry-over insight: Period 2 order (151 units) confirmed lost (Period 9); Lead time remains unstable (avg 2.5, mode 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1045.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Reviewing the history: demand averages approximately 100 units per period (Mean of all samples = 99.8, Mean of last 5 = 102.6). The stockout at the end of Period 9 (0 on-hand) was caused by volatile lead times and a lost shipment from Period 2. Observed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 periods. My carry-over insight confirms the Period 2 order (151 units) is lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 388 includes 151 units that will never arrive. The effective pipeline is actually 237 units (388 - 151). To compensate for the 0 on-hand inventory and the lead time volatility (averaging 2.2 observed), I will set lead time to 3 to be safe. I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=5 to capture the current demand cluster while ignoring the early period noise.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand across 10 periods averages 98.7 units (Sum=987), with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. Lead times have been highly volatile (1, 1, 3, 3, 3 periods), averaging 2.2 periods. The order from Period 2 (151 units) is definitively lost. Currently, we have 529 units in-transit (from Periods 6, 9, and 10). To account for the observed lead-time instability and the '0' on-hand status, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend targets a pipeline that covers the current period plus the 3-period lead time. mu_hat is set to roughly (1+3) * 100 = 400 using the recent_N method (N=10) to capture the overall mean, and sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to buffer against the moderately high demand volatility.

Current status shows 0 on-hand inventory and 529 units in-transit. Historic lead times are highly variable: {3, 1, 3, 3, 1} with an average of 2.2 periods. The order from Period 2 (151 units) is officially confirmed lost. Orders from Period 6 (75 units), Period 9 (162 units), and Period 10 (141 units) are still in transit. Given the promised lead time of 2 but an average observed lead time of 2.2, I will set L to 3 to be conservative and avoid stockouts, as we have been at 0 inventory for several periods. Demand has been relatively stable with a mean of ~98.5 over 11 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) for mu_hat to capture recent demand dynamics while the inventory recovers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1377.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received 303 units (from orders in P9 and P10), leaving us with 219 units on-hand. The current in-transit inventory is 226 units, but history shows that the order from Period 2 (151 units) is lost. After adjusting for the lost shipment, the true pipeline inventory is 75 units (order from P6). The lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Average: 2.33, Mode: 3). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 95 units per period. Since we are at the start of Period 13, we must cover demand for the lead time and the current period (L+1). With L effectively 3, we need to cover 4 periods. Forecasted demand (4 * 95 = 380) is partially covered by on-hand (219) and reliable in-transit (75), totaling 294. However, the OR backend logic manages the base stock level (mu_hat + safety stock). I will set L to 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of the actual lead time and use recent demand history (last 8 periods) to capture the current mean while ignoring early initialization noise. This ensures the backend calculates a sufficient base stock to buffer against lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline correction: Period 2 order (151 units) confirmed lost; true pipeline consists only of Period 6 (75 units) and subsequent placements. Lead time mode is 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $661.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, looking at the history of 'chips(Regular)', the lead time remains unstable, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods (average ~2.3, mode 3). The promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 2 (151 units) is definitively lost. The remaining pipeline includes Period 6 (75 units, now 8 periods overdue and likely lost), Period 13 (39 units), and previous orders from Period 9/10 that arrived in Period 12. Current on-hand is 175. However, since the Period 6 order is almost certainly lost, the effective 'In-transit' is much lower than the reported 265. Demand has cooled recently (44 units in P13) following a period of higher volatility. Given the 3-period lead time mode, I will set L to 3. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering P9-P13) to capture the current lower demand trend (~84 units/period) across the (L+1)=4 period window. Sigma_hat is set to the same period to account for recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Period 6 order (75 units) is 8 periods since placement and likely lost; lead time mode remains 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2725.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 30 units. The 'In-transit' total of 265 units consists of orders from Periods 6 (75 units) and 13 (39 units), plus orders from periods 14 and 15 (though the prompt shows 265 total which likely includes recent zero-order cycles or system noise). Crucially, the order from Period 6 (75 units) is now 9 periods old; given the promised lead time is 2 and the observed maximum is 3, this shipment is confirmed lost. Subtracting the lost 75 units from the 265 'In-transit' leaves a true pipeline of 190. Historical demand is relatively stable, with a mean of ~102 units over the last 14 periods. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent for successful arrivals (mode=3). I will set L to 3 to reflect the actual delay observed for the majority of shipments, and use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand mean of ~96 while accounting for recent volatility. This conservative lead time and recent demand window will help the OR backend maintain a safety stock that buffers against intermittent losses and the 3-period arrival cycle.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Period 6 order (75 units) confirmed lost (9 periods since placement). Adjusted true pipeline inventory is 114 units (265 - 75 - 76 unidentified/system units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $570.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a recent mean shift; the average demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 104.4, while the full history average is approximately 100. Lead time remains unstable, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods, and the mode is 3. Two orders (P2 for 151 units and P6 for 75 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 226 units. The current system reported 'In-transit' of 419 includes these lost units. Therefore, the 'true' pipeline inventory is 419 - 226 = 193 units. This 193 consist of the unidentified 76 units and orders from P13 (39 units), P15 (154 units) [Wait, 39 + 154 = 193]. This aligns. Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and we are currently stocked out, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the consistent upper-bound lead time and use N=5 for demand mean and volatility to capture the recent higher demand (104.4/period) versus earlier periods. This configuration will signal the backend to increase the base stock level to cover the longer lead time and higher demand while acknowledging the reduced true pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $741.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 14-16) has shown a significant upward trend, with an average of 161.7 units/period compared to the long-term historical mean of approximately 105. Period 16 demand was 185, resulting in a stockout. Lead times remain unstable but lean towards 3 periods (observed for orders from Periods 1, 4, 5, 9, and 13). Effectively, I am setting L=3 to account for this reality. Because demand has spiked recently, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this heightened volatility and volume, ensuring the base stock level targets are sufficient to prevent future stockouts while acknowledging the currently high in-transit inventory (530 units). Note: Orders from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (75 units) were previously confirmed lost and are factored out of my mental pipeline model, though the 'In-transit' figure of 530 units still likely includes some noise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: avg demand increased to ~162 (+54% from previous levels); Lead time mode confirmed at 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2850.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling all 150 units that arrived in Period 17 (from Period 16 order). The demand regime has shifted upwards starting Period 14, with the last four demand points being 145, 155, 185, and 162 (mean ~161.75). Lead times remain highly volatile: Period 13 arrived in 3 periods, Period 16 arrived in 1 period, and the Period 15 order (154 units) is still in transit (now 3 periods since placement). The current 'in-transit' of 566 includes Period 15 (154), Period 17 (186), and the new Period 18 order. However, historical evidence confirms two lost shipments (Period 2: 151 units, Period 6: 75 units). Subtracting these from the reported in-transit (566 - 226 = 340) aligns with our tracked active pipeline (Period 15+17). I'm setting L to 3 (explicit) because, despite the recent 1-period arrival, the lead time mode and conservative planning for the current demand spike favor a 3-period window. Mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the elevated demand regime (~162/period).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout in Period 18. Demand has shifted significantly since Period 14, with the last 5 periods (P14-P18) averaging 170.4 units (145, 155, 185, 162, 205), compared to the earlier historical mean of ~100. Lead times satisfy our 'mode of 3' assumption, with arrivals from P13 arriving in P16 (LT 3) and P16 arriving in P17 (LT 1 - an anomaly). The promised LT is 2, but actual observed LT is often 3. The 'In-transit' of 703 units is high, but historical carry-over suggests approximately 226 units (P2/151 + P6/75) are effectively lost and should be ignored, leaving a likely real pipeline consisting of P15 (154), P17 (186), and P18 (137). To ensure coverage over the review and lead period (L+1), I am setting L explicitly to 3 (higher than promised) and mu_hat to a value reflecting the recent 5-period demand regime (~170/period * 4 periods = 680). Given the rising volatility (P18 demand reached 205), sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period standard deviation scaled for the lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~170 units/period (based on P14-P18); previous pipeline adjustments for lost units (P2, P6) remain critical for effective inventory positioning.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 14, now averaging ~170 units per period (P14-P19 demand: 145, 155, 185, 162, 205, 203). Current on-hand is 0, and we have suffered stockouts in P18 and P19 due to late arrivals. Lead times are highly variable but currently cluster around a mode of 3 (observed lead times: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1). Using explicit L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the current 4-period risk cycle (L+1). mu_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture the elevated demand average of ~175 units (implying a target base stock coverage for ~700 units over L+1). Pipeline inventory is high (762), but we must maintain pressure on the OR engine to account for the actual observed throughput and the volatility in arrivals to prevent further stockouts during this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~175 units/period (P14-P19 average: 175.8); Lead time remains erratic with a mode of 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 21. Demand has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 14, increasing from a mean of ~100 to an average of ~175 units (Periods 14-20 average is 178.4). Inventory is currently zero, with a large in-transit pipeline of 788 units. However, history (Carry-over insights) confirms that orders from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (75 units) were lost. Deducting these (226 units), the active pipeline is likely closer to 562 units. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent mode. To stabilize the inventory position against the current high demand, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to focus on the high-demand regime (Periods 14-20). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to capture the increased volatility of this new regime. This configuration allows the OR backend to target a base-stock level that covers 4 periods (L+1) of the current high demand while accounting for realized lead time risks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~178 units/period (P14-P20 average: 178.4). Active pipeline check: total in-transit 788 contains confirm lost units from P2 (151) and P6 (75); true effective pipeline is ~562 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally at Period 14, moving from an average of ~105 to ~186. The last 3 periods have seen demand exceed 200 units (P19: 203, P20: 194, P21: 244). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports In-transit as 794 units, but based on carry-over insights, orders from P2 (151) and P6 (75) are confirmed lost, and several other orders (P15, P17, P18) are experiencing extended lead times. The effective pipeline is significantly lower than reported. Lead time is erratic with a mode of 3 periods. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the frequent delays, and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=8 (capturing the high-demand regime P14-P21 where mean demand is ~186.5). The OR backend uses a high service level (q=0.95), which is appropriate given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1). Setting mu_hat using the recent higher demand ensures the base stock calculation targets the new volume, while the explicit L=3 provides the necessary safety buffer for the delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 has intensified; average demand for P19-P21 is ~213 units, significantly higher than the P14-P18 average of ~170. Shipping delays are persistent, with orders from P15 (154 units) and P17 (186 units) now reaching 6 and 4 periods since placement respectively without arrival, suggesting a further potential increase in actual lead time or additional lost shipments.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime, with demand averaging ~202 units over the last 5 periods (P18-P22). Inventory levels are critically low (on-hand = 0), and there is a significant discrepancy in the pipeline. The reported 'In-transit' of 853 includes lost orders from P2 (151 units) and P6 (75 units), and likely additional lost or severely delayed orders from P15 (154 units, 8 periods since placement) and P17 (186 units, 6 periods since placement). Effective pipeline is estimated at ~287 units (853 - 151 - 75 - 154 - 186), though the OR backend will see the full 853. To force the OR backend to order despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting L to 4 to reflect the persistent delays (mode is now 3-4 periods) and using an explicit mu_hat reflecting the high-demand state (202 units/period * (1+4) = 1010). Using a higher explicit sigma_hat of 120 accounts for the high volatility and stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P15 (154 units) and P17 (186 units) are now likely lost or severely delayed (8 and 6 periods since placement respectively). Current demand regime (P18-P22) has stabilized at ~202 units/period, significantly higher than earlier phases.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime, averaging ~202 units/period (P18-P23: 205, 203, 194, 244, 183, 184). Previous carry-over insights indicate significant pipeline corruption: orders from P2 (151), P6 (75), P15 (154), and P17 (186) are almost certainly lost, totaling 566 units of 'ghost' inventory in the reported 1053 units in-transit. The effective pipeline is thus only 487 units. Actual lead times remain volatile but cluster around a mode of 3 periods (observed P20 at 3, P21 at 2, P22 at 1). To compensate for the high stockout risk and the lost pipeline inventory, I am setting L to 3 (the observed mode) and using an explicit mu_hat reflecting (1+L=4) periods of demand at the current 202-unit average (808 total). Sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=10) to capture the increased volatility in the current high-demand regime. This combination should force the OR backend to place larger orders to bypass the 'ghost' inventory and meet the higher demand ceiling.

Carry-over insight: P24: Confirmed loss of P15 (154 units) and P17 (186 units); total confirmed lost units in pipeline (P2, P6, P15, P17) is 566. Demand remains stable in high regime (~200+ units/period).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the stock-out situation continues with on-hand inventory at 0. The demand regime from Period 14 onwards has stabilized at a significantly higher level (~186 units/period overall, with P19-P24 specifically averaging ~197 units/period). The lead time remains highly erratic and unreliable, with recent arrivals showing a range of 1 to 3 periods, and multiple historical orders (P2, P6, P15, P17) confirmed as lost. Total confirmed lost units in the current 'In-transit' figure of 1053 units (sum of P2: 151, P6: 75, P15: 154, P17: 186) amount to 566 units. This means the 'effective' pipeline is only 487 units. To compensate for this ghost inventory and the high demand regime, I am using an explicit mu_hat based on the recent high-demand average of ~200 units/period (multiplied by L+1) and an explicit L of 3 to reflect the consistent upper range of observed lead times. This will force the backend to place more aggressive orders to bridge the inventory gap created by lost shipments and increased demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~197 units/period (P19-P24 average); Total confirmed lost units in pipeline reached 566 (P2, P6, P15, P17).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level starting from Period 14. The average demand from Period 19 to Period 25 is approximately 199.7 units per period. I am using recent_7 to capture this current high-demand state for mu_hat. For volatility (sigma_hat), I am also using recent_7 to reflect the variance in this specific regime. Lead time remains erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical average, though in practice, I am monitoring specifically for lost shipments. Note: The in-transit inventory of 762 includes 566 units confirmed lost (Periods 2, 6, 15, and 17), making the effective pipeline only 196 units. The OR backend's base-stock calculation will naturally command a large order because 'effective' pipeline is low compared to the demand forecast (mu_hat), which is necessary to recover from stockouts and account for the high loss rate in the delivery chain.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has stabilized at a significantly higher level than the initial phase. For Periods 14-26, the average demand is approximately 184 units. Specifically, the last 8 periods (P19-P26) average 194.5 units, indicating a sustained high-demand environment. Lead times remain highly erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with several confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17). Total lost units identified are 566 (151+75+154+186). The 'In-transit' of 762 includes these 566 ghost units, leaving only 196 units of 'true' pipeline. With current on-hand inventory at 0 and demand averaging ~195, I must set parameters to trigger a large enough order to cover the (L+1) period window despite the inflated pipeline. I am using a recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the high-regime demand and setting L to an explicit 3 to account for the frequent delay and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'Ghost' units in pipeline: 566 units from Periods 2, 6, 15, and 17 are lost. High-demand regime since P14 stabilized at an average of ~184-195 units/period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has stabilized at a significantly higher level compared to the start. For the range P23-P27, average demand is approximately 190 units/period (227+147+221+170+184 / 5). I will use N=8 to capture this sustained high demand regime (P20-P27 avg ~196). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 872 includes confirmed lost/ghost units from Periods 2, 6, 15, and 17 (151 + 75 + 154 + 186 = 566 units). Subtracting these results in a true pipeline of 306 units (consisting of orders from P18, P19, and P27). Observed lead times are volatile but hover around a mode of 3 periods (e.g., P20 arrived P23, P4 arrived P7, P13 arrived P16). To account for the 'ghost' units in the pipeline and the actual lead time of 3, I am setting L to 3 and using 'recent_N' for demand to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the contemporary high-demand state (~196 units/period). This setting will command the OR backend to target a pipeline that covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~784 units). With a true pipeline of 306 and 0 on-hand, this should trigger an order of approximately 478 units (capped by the OR engine's internal safety logic).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has stabilized at a significantly higher level, with an average of ~193 units (P14-P28). Period 27-28 demand (227, 184) continues this trend. Pipeline inventory currently shows 892 units, but this includes 566 confirmed 'ghost' units from lost orders (P2: 151, P6: 75, P15: 154, P17: 186). Removing these, the effective pipeline is only 326 units (892 - 566). On-hand inventory is 0. With an average demand of ~193 and an effective lead time mode of 3 periods, we need to cover (3+1) periods of demand, requiring approximately 772 units. Currently, only 326 units are effectively in-transit. Therefore, setting L to 3 and using the high-demand regime (last 15 samples) correctly calculates the base stock needed. I'm using N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated demand volatility since the shift at P14.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has stabilized at a high level, with the average demand for the most recent period (P14-P29) being approximately 190.5 units/period. The current 'In-transit' figure of 782 units contains 566 confirmed 'Ghost' units from Period 2 (151), Period 6 (75), Period 15 (154), and Period 17 (186). These units are lost and will not arrive. Subtracting these from the total in-transit yields an effective pipeline of 216 units (consisting of Period 18: 137, Period 19: 59, and Period 28: 20). Since current on-hand is 0 and the effective pipeline is only 216 units (barely covering one period of demand), a significant order is needed. I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=16) to capture the high-demand regime since P14. Lead time calculation is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average (mean ~2.3 periods).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has stabilized at a significantly higher level compared to the start. For the last 12 periods (P19-P30), average demand is approximately 201 units/period, with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 29). The system currently shows an 'In-transit' of 762 units. However, based on confirmed insights, 566 units are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P2: 151, P6: 75, P15: 154, P17: 186). The 'true' pipeline inventory is 196 units (762 - 566), which are likely from recent orders (though recent order amounts were small). On-hand inventory is 0. Lead times for successfully delivered orders recently have been 2 periods (P27, P28), though the historical average and mode suggest 3 periods. To ensure we capture the demand in this high-growth phase while the OR backend calculates base stock based on current pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*201 and sigma_hat to reflect high volatility. Using L=3 to be safe given the history of delays and losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P19-P30 average stabilized at 201 units/period with high volatility (standard deviation ~29). Ghost pipeline units remain at 566; effective pipeline is current In-transit minus 566.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime starting from Period 14. For the most recent 12 periods (P20-P31), the average demand is approximately 204.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 26.5. Lead times remain erratic, typically ranging from 1 to 3 periods (mode 3). Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 900 units remains contaminated by 566 units confirmed lost from Periods 2, 6, 15, and 17. The effective pipeline is therefore only 334 units (900 - 566). Since the current on-hand inventory is 0, the total effective system inventory (0 + 334) is far below the target for a 3-period lead time (L=3 requires covering demand for L+1=4 periods, approximately 818 units). I am setting L=3 to reflect the consistent upper-bound lead time and using recent statistics (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will force the OR engine to place a large order to bridge the gap between effective pipeline and required safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P20-P31 stabilized at ~204 units/period. Effective pipeline calculation must subtract 566 units (confirmed lost P2, P6, P15, P17) from total In-transit.

While Period 32 showed a slight dip to 161, the overall trend remains elevated. Lead times continue to be highly irregular, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a mode of 2-3 periods recently. A critical operational constraint is the presence of 566 'ghost' units in the pipeline (orders from P2, P6, P15, and P17) which have been confirmed lost over time. Current in-transit inventory is 766, making the true effective pipeline only 200 units (766 - 566). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the next few periods' demand is roughly 200 units each, the current 200-unit pipeline is insufficient to cover the lead time (L) plus review period (1). I will set L to 3 (the upper end of the observed lead time range) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for systemic delays. mu_hat is set to 816 ((1+3) * 204) to reflect the current high-demand regime, and sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility in the high-demand phase to maintain a high service level given the profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P20-P32 average is 204.3 units/period; effective pipeline inventory must always be calculated by subtracting 566 lost units from recorded In-transit.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has consistently averaged ~204 units/period (P20-P33 average is 204.3). Current Period 33 demand was 188. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 917 units. Critical adjustment: As established in carry-over insights, 566 units in the pipeline (from P2, P6, P15, P17) are confirmed lost/ghost units. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 917 - 566 = 351 units. Actual lead times have been highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods or settling at 1-2. I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock covers the demand during the uncertain delivery window. Given the high profitability ($19) vs holding cost ($1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level. \u03bc_hat is set to (1+L)*204 = 816 to align with the sustained high-demand regime observed over the last 14 periods. \u03c3_hat is derived from the recent volatility (standard deviation ~29), scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 14, with the recent average (P19-P34) approximately 203.4 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and the recorded in-transit is 917 units. However, consistent history shows that 566 units are 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2: 151, P6: 75, P15: 154, P17: 186). Additionally, the order from P18 (137 units) and P19 (59 units) have now reached 16 and 15 periods without arrival respectively; given the actual lead time mode of 2-3 periods, these 196 units are also almost certainly lost. This brings total confirmed/suspected lost units to 762 (566 + 196). The effective pipeline is therefore 917 - 762 = 155 units (the P33 order). With the promised lead time of 2 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (mode 2-3). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=16 to capture the high-regime demand (P19-P34) which averages ~203 units/period. The OR backend will use these values to target a base stock covering lead time + current period, netting out the (corrected) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of P18 (137 units) and P19 (59 units) shipments; cumulative lost pipeline 'ghost' units now total 762. High-demand regime since P19 averages 203.4 units/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 19 has averaged approximately 203.4 units/period with significant volatility. The most critical factor is the reconciliation of the pipeline inventory. The system reports 917 units in-transit, but historical evidence from 'Carry-over Insights' confirms that 762 units are 'ghost' units from lost/missing shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). This leaves an effective pipeline of only 155 units (the order from P33). With 0 on-hand inventory and current demand sustained above 200, the inventory position is severely depleted. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=16 (covering the stable high-demand regime from P19 to P34) to capture the current average of ~203. Since the OR backend uses 'effective pipeline = total in-transit - current order', it will calculate a much higher stock level than reality because it doesn't know about the 762 lost units. To counteract this 'ghost' inventory bloat and force the system to order, I am setting L to 3 (recent average mode) and using an explicit mu_hat. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 917 perceived in-transit units, the base_stock calculation must exceed 917. However, the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend often limits the order size based on mean demand. I will set mu_hat explicitly to the forecasted demand over (L+1) = 4 periods, which is roughly 203 * 4 = 812. Due to the high risk of stockouts and the pipeline discrepancy, I am providing a high sigma_hat to increase the base stock safety margin.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is sustained, with recent average demand (P19-P36) approximately 206 units per period. Lead times remain erratic, varying between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.0 for successful arrivals), but the significant issue is the large volume of 'ghost' inventory in the recorded in-transit total. Cumulative confirmed losses (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) total 762 units. Current In-transit is 917 units, but after subtracting 762 ghost units, the true effective pipeline is only 155 units (the P33 order). With On-hand at 0, the current true position is very low relative to the high-demand regime. To recover and maintain service levels, I will use an explicit mu_hat to reflect the ~206 demand level and an explicit L of 3 to account for the upper range of lead time delays. The OR backend needs to recognize that the majority of current 'pipeline' inventory won't arrive, so by setting a higher target stock level (L=3, high mu_hat), it will trigger the necessary replenishment orders despite the inflated In-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost units in pipeline confirmed at 762 (Orders: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). High-demand regime (P19-P36) average is 206.5 units/period.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly spiked, with Period 37 recording a demand of 369, far above the previous high-regime average of ~206. The average demand from P34-P37 is 264.25 units/period. The pipeline inventory of 923 is heavily contaminated with 762 confirmed 'ghost' units (lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19), leaving an effective pipeline of only 161 units (P33 order of 155 and P37 order of 6). Given on-hand inventory is 0 and the current lead time is erratic (averaging ~2-3 periods), I must aggressively lift parameters to account for the recent demand surge and the depleted effective pipeline. I am using an explicit mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (~264) multiplied by (1+L) where L=2, totaling 792. Using N=5 for sigma_hat captures the recent extreme volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Period 37 demand reached 369. New demand average (P34-P37) is 264.25 units/period (+28% from previous high regime). Cumulative ghost units remain at 762.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a significantly higher regime. While the average demand between P19-P36 was around 206, the recent 5-period average (P34-P38) has spiked to 254.2 units, driven by a massive outlier of 369 in P37. This suggests a new surge or high-volatility phase. Lead times remain erratic, with the mode being 3 periods, although recent arrivals occurred in 1-2 periods. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 993 is heavily inflated by 762 'ghost' units from confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The true effective pipeline is only 231 units (993 - 762). To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to cover the (L+1) window (approx 4 periods) at the new demand level (~1000 total demand), I will use 'explicit' values. I set L=3 as the planning horizon, mu_hat to 1017 (254.2 * 4 periods), and sigma_hat to 134 to account for the increased variance seen in the recent surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: P34-P38 average is 254.2 units/period (+23% from P19-P36 regime). Cumulative 'ghost' units in pipeline remains 762 (Orders: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19), making the effective pipeline substantially lower than recorded in-transit.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that surged around Period 37. The average demand for the last five periods (P35-P39) is 263.4 units, confirming a shift from the previous ~200 units/period average. The lead time remains highly volatile, frequently oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with many shipments lost. Total in-transit is 1168, but we must subtract 762 'ghost' units (confirmed lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19), leaving an effective pipeline of 406 units. Given the high stockout frequency and recent demand surge, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*265 to account for the new regime and volatile lead times. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for the high variance (e.g., P37 demand was 369). L=3 is used as an 'explicit' value to protect against the frequent 3-period arrival delays and ensure the base stock covers a sufficient horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at P37: average demand increased to ~263 units (+28%) from the previous ~205 level. Cumulative ghost units in pipeline remain at 762.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 37. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P37-P40) is approximately 256.5 units, compared to the previous regime of ~205. Specifically, P37-P40 demands were 369, 214, 271, and 172. While P40 was lower, the overall trend supports a higher mu_hat to prevent stockouts. Lead time remains erratic but has shown recent 1-period arrivals (P38, P39); however, the mode remains closer to 2-3 throughout the game history. The most critical factor is the 'ghost' inventory: the system shows 1079 units in-transit, but 762 units from periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19 are confirmed lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is only 317 units (1079 - 762). Since the OR backend uses in-transit logic to decrement orders, I must use 'explicit' values for L and mu_hat to ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger an order despite the inflated 'ghost' pipeline. I will set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat to cover (1+L)*257 \u2248 771 units, plus a safety buffer via sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (std dev ~80 in recent periods).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we are dealing with a significant demand shift and high quantity of 'ghost' units in the pipeline. Historical data shows a clear regime change at Period 37, with demand increasing from ~205 to approximately 242 units per period (average of P37-P41: 238). The current reported 'In-transit' of 1079 includes 762 confirmed lost units (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 317 units (1079 - 762), which comprises orders from Period 33 (155 units), Period 40 (156 units), and Period 37 (6 units). Since current On-hand is 0, we are under-stocked. To compensate for the 'ghost' units and the increased demand level, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the (L+1) horizon based on the new mean (~242). I will assume a lead time of 3 (the mode/worst-case observed) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high delivery uncertainty and recent demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at P37 confirmed: Mean increased to ~242 units/period (P37-P41 avg). Cumulative 'ghost' inventory remains 762 units; effective pipeline is In-transit minus 762.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is currently in a high regime that shifted around Period 37, with more recent stabilization over Periods 40-42 averaging ~170 units. However, looking at the Period 37-41 window, the average is ~242. Given the stockout in Period 42 and the high historic volatility in this regime, I will use recent_N with N=6 for demand (P37-P42) to capture the elevated level while reflecting the recent lower samples. Lead time is volatile but has recently shown a mode of 2 periods (P39/P40), though history suggests preparing for 3. On-hand is 0. The In-transit count of 1247 is heavily inflated by 762 'ghost' units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) that are confirmed lost. Effective pipeline is 1247 - 762 = 485 units. By using recent_N for mu and sigma (N=6), and L=calculate, the OR backend will target a base stock that accounts for the current high-demand variance while the 485 units are used to satisfy the backlog and upcoming cycles.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost units in pipeline confirmed at 762 (Orders: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) as of P42. Effective pipeline inventory calculation must manually subtract 762 from reported In-transit.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift around Period 37, but recent data (P40-P43) suggests a cooling or return to a mid-range regime, averaging approximately 169.5 units per period. The cumulative 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) remains at 762 units. With a reported In-transit of 1091, the effective pipeline is actually only 329 units (1091 - 762). Since there is 0 on-hand inventory, we are currently under-stocked relative to the observed demand of ~170 units and the likely lead time of 2-3 periods. I will use an N=7 to capture the most recent demand stabilization (P37-P43) while smoothing the Period 37 spike. Lead time remains erratic but averages around 2, so the backend default is appropriate, provided my mu_hat captures enough coverage for the review + lead time period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime appears to have moderated from the P37-P39 peak of ~260 to a lower stabilization of ~170 units/period (P40-P43 average: 169.5). Cumulative ghost units in pipeline remain at 762.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shown high volatility recently, with a surge in Period 37-39 followed by a moderation to approximately 170 units (P40-P43 average) and a recent spike to 241 in Period 44. The true average for the current regime (P40-P44) is approximately 183 units. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this post-surge stabilization. For sigma_hat, I'm using N=11 (P34-P44) to capture the higher volatility seen in the last two weeks (std ~58). Pipeline inventory management remains critical: 762 units in the 'In-transit' total are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The current In-transit is 1091, so the effective pipeline is 1091 - 762 = 329 units. Since the lead time mode is 3 periods and current on-hand is 0, the OR backend's capped policy will calculate an order based on (1+L) periods of demand. Given effective pipeline (329) vs. expected 3-period demand (~550), an order will be triggered to bridge the gap and restore service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3192.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P40-P45) has a mean of approximately 185.5 units, which is lower than the P37-P39 peak (~263) but higher than the initial periods. The lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with recent orders from P40 and P42 taking 3 periods to arrive. The In-transit inventory of 923 units includes 762 confirmed 'ghost' units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) that will never arrive. The effective pipeline is therefore 923 - 762 = 161 units. To maintain service levels for this SKU (Profit=$19, Holding=$1), I am setting L=3 to account for the erratic but frequent longer lead times. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the most recent stabilized demand level (avg ~185.5) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect the current volatility. By using L=3, the OR backend targets a base stock covering 4 periods of demand, which helps buffer against both the high loss rate and late arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at ~185.5 units/period (P40-P45). Effective pipeline continues to require subtracting 762 ghost units from In-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized after the P37-P39 peak. Calculating the average demand from Period 40 to 46 gives approximately 176 units per period (172, 164, 175, 167, 241, 194, 149), which aligns with the carry-over insight of ~170-185 units. Lead times remain volatile, with recent arrivals showing 1 to 3 periods; I will continue to assume an effective lead time (L) of 3 to provide a buffer against this uncertainty. The current system reported In-transit is 953 units. However, there are 762 confirmed 'ghost' units (lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 953 - 762 = 191 units. With 0 on-hand, we only have 191 units coming to cover the next (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. At ~176 units/period, we need ~704 units in the pipeline. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+3)*176 = 704 and use a recent_N sigma calculation (last 7 periods) to capture the current volatility.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, we face zero on-hand inventory and a recorded In-transit of 953 units. However, consistent history (Carry-over insights) confirms that 762 units in the pipeline are 'ghost' units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The effective pipeline is therefore only 191 units (953 - 762). Demand has stabilized in a regime (P40-P47) averaging ~184.6 units per period, following the P37-P39 peak. Lead times are volatile but recent arrivals (P43, P45) show a mode of 3 periods. To ensure coverage during the final 3 periods of the game (P48, P49, P50), and accounting for the 191 units actually in transit, I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods of the current moderated regime (N=8) and L to the observed mode (3 periods). The OR engine will subtract the 'inflated' pipeline of 953, but my explicit mu_hat would be bypassed by the cap. Instead, I will use methods that allow the backend to use recent metrics, while acknowledging that the game is ending. No large orders are needed as current effective pipeline nearly covers remaining demand, but the OR engine needs to see the correct regime parameters.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are nearing the end of the simulation. The primary challenge remains the reconciliation of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. We have confirmed 762 units as lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). With a reported In-transit of 953, the actual effective pipeline is only 191 units (953 - 762). Current demand has stabilized in the 180-200 range (avg P40-P48 is ~187). Lead times are highly variable but currently averaging 2-3 periods. To ensure we capture remaining demand in the final two periods while accounting for the significant 'ghost' inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent evidence (P40-P48) to reflect the stabilized demand. I'm using an explicit lead time L=3 to reflect the consistent delays. Setting these parameters will guide the OR backend to place an order that bridges the gap between the 191 effective units and the forecasted demand for the remaining periods.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we face 0 on-hand inventory and a recorded In-transit of 953 units. Critically, as documented over multiple periods, our 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) totals 762 units. This means the effective pipeline is only 191 units (953 - 762). Demand has transitioned from the P37-P39 peak (~260) to a more stable regime; the average of the last 10 periods (P40-P49) is 188.4 units. Although the promised lead time is 2, arrivals like P40 and P42 occurred with a lead time of 3, keeping our estimated L at 3 periods to ensure a 4-period coverage (L+1). To correct for the 762 ghost units being treated as 'real' by the OR backend, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for 4 periods of demand (4 * 188.4 = 753.6) and then add the 762 lost units to it (753.6 + 762 = 1515.6) so that the backend's subtraction (Base Stock - 953) results in an order that actually reaches the intended target. Sigma is set based on the recent volatility of this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P40-P49 has stabilized at an average of 188.4 units/period. Effective pipeline remains In-transit minus 762 ghost units.
