Based on the provided historical demand samples (Periods 1-5), the average demand is approximately 102 units per period (141+118+67+94+89 / 5). The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 and be available for the start of Period 4. I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (the periods until the next possible arrival). Current on-hand is 0. Expected total demand over the lead-time window (L+1 = 3 periods) is roughly 306 units (102 * 3). However, I also need to account for demand variance and ensure a safety stock since I am starting with zero inventory. I will place an initial order to cover the immediate pipeline needs and establish inventory. Given the distribution (max 141, min 67), I will target a slightly higher buffer to avoid stockouts in the first cycles.",

In Period 1, the actual demand was 126, which is consistent with this range. We started with 0 inventory, ordered 320 units in Period 1 (targeting roughly 3 periods of demand), and ended Period 1 with 0 inventory and 0 sales because the order has a 2-period lead time. According to the timeline, the 320 units ordered in Period 1 will arrive during Period 3 (Period 1 + 2 Lead Time) and become visible in Period 4. For our Period 2 decision, we must cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods). Total expected demand for Periods 2, 3, and 4 is ~306 units (102 * 3). We currently have 320 units in-transit. To ensure a safety stock and account for potential demand spikes (like Period 1's 126), I will place a small supplemental order. Since current in-transit (320) nearly covers the 3-period window (306), I will order 100 units to build a safety buffer and prepare for Period 5 demand, as the Period 1 order only covers up to Period 4.",

Pre-game data showed P1=141, P2=118, P3=67, P4=94, P5=89. There is a slight discrepancy between pre-game data and game history for P1-P3, so I will prioritize game history for the most recent trends. Demand seems to be averaging around 90-100 units. c) Lead time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order placed in P1 (320 units) should arrive during P3's arrival phase and be visible in P4's start. Looking at P3 conclude message, arrived=0. However, the logic states P1 order arrives in P1+2=P3, and visibility is at P3+1=P4. This is Period 4, so I should see it in the status 'arrived' for Period 3 conclude. Since arrived=0 in P3 conclude, the P1 order is either late (3 periods instead of 2) or lost. d) Inventory: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 470 (P1: 320, P2: 100, P3: 50). e) Strategy: Stockouts have occurred in P1-P3 (sold=0). I have a massive pipeline (470 units).

System 'In-transit' is 580, but subtracting the 220 lost units gives an effective pipeline of 360 units (Orders from P11: 160, P12: 100, P13: 100). Pipeline check: On-hand (112) + Effective In-transit (360) = 472 units. At a forecast of 100/period, this covers 4.7 periods of demand. Given the max observed lead time is 3 periods, we need to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand (approx 400 units) plus safety stock. Our current 472 units are sufficient to cover expected demand and account for shipment volatility without incurring excessive holding costs.

Since I cannot influence Period 50's arrivals with a Period 50 order (minimum lead time is 1), the order amount chosen here is largely symbolic for total reward unless the game continues. However, to maintain safety stock against the constant risk of shipment loss and recover from the stockout, I will order enough to cover three periods of demand (~600 units) minus the likely' live' pipeline (500 units).",
  "carry_over_insight": "Orders from Period 44 (250 units) and Period 45 (200 units) are now likely lost (elapsed time 6 and 5 periods respectively, vs max observed LT of 3). Total confirmed ghost inventory likely increased to 2,840 units.",
