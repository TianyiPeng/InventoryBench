Demand outlook: Historical mean demand is approximately 102 units/period. Over a 3-period window (L+1), we need approximately 306 units. 4.

Current demand appears stable with a slight downward trend from the initial peek. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 92. Given the high pipeline relative to demand (151 units in-transit vs. ~95 demand per period) and the fact that we have 127 units on-hand (over a full period of buffer), ordering the OR recommended amount of 92 units is prudent to maintain a steady flow, despite the lead-time volatility.

{
  "rationale": "1. Lead-time Analysis: Historical actual lead times have been 1 period (P3, P7, P8) and 3 periods (P1, P5). Order from P2 (151 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Order from P6 (109 units) is now overdue (4 periods elapsed), though it might still arrive late like P1/P5. \n2. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline shows 466 units. Let's verify the pipeline composition: P6 (109 units, overdue), P7 (100 units, arrived already per P8 conclude? No, P7 arrived at P8. P8 arrived at P9. The history shows 'In-transit: 466'. Let's re-calculate: P6 (109) + P9 (206) + P10 order. Wait, the system shows 466 units currently in transit BEFORE my P10 decision. This means P6 (109), P7 (100 - wait, P7 arrived), P8 (50 - wait, P8 arrived), P9 (206) in transit? 109 + 206 = 315. There is an unexplained 151 units in 'In-transit' which matches the lost P2 order. Therefore, effective pipeline is only 315 (P6 and P9).\n3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P8: 157, P9: 107) and historical samples suggest an average around 102. \n4. Strategy: I need to cover demand for Period 10, 11, and 12 (L+1). Total needed ~ 306 units. I have 0 on-hand. Reliable pipeline is P6 (109, if not lost) and P9 (206). Total = 315. \n5. Adjustment: The OR recommendation is 0 because it includes the 'ghost' 151 units from P2 in its pipeline calculation. If I exclude the lost 151 units, the pipeline is sufficient (315 vs 306 target). However, because P6 is overdue and P9 won't arrive until P11 or P12, I risk a stockout in P10. Since I cannot get inventory for P10 today (min lead time is 1), I will order a small amount to buffer against further losses or P9 delays.",

Lead Time & Demand: Actual lead time is volatile (1-3 periods). Historical demand averages ~98 units/period. Strategy: With 0 on-hand, we are currently stocking out. The P9 order (206 units) was placed 3 periods ago and should arrive during the current Period 12 (observed at start of P13). OR recommends 0 because it doesn't discount the 260 units of lost shipments in the 'pipeline'.

Therefore, the reliable Total Inventory Position (OH + actual In-transit) is 237 + 150 = 387 units. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand remains relatively stable. Recent demand (P12: 84, P11: 94, P10: 90) suggests an average around 90-100 units. 4. Strategy: With a Total Inventory Position of 387 units and a Max Lead Time of 3, we are covered for approximately 4 periods (Current + 3 LT). At 100 units/period, we need ~400 units. The current 387 units are sufficient for the immediate lead time covering. The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the inflated system 'In-transit' figure of 410 (which OR thinks is real).

The most recent period (P13) saw a drop to 44, but we must maintain coverage for the L+1 window (3 periods).
