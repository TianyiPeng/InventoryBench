Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is provided (141, 118, 67, 94, 89), averaging 101.8 units. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The OR backend needs parameters to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, we want to maintain a high service level. Since this is the initial decision phase and we have a small sample size (n=5), I will use the available historical data to set the forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the mean (101.8) and standard deviation (approx 28.9) of the provided samples. \u03bc_hat will be (1+2)*101.8 = 305.4 and \u03c3_hat will be sqrt(1+2)*28.9 = 50.1. I'll let the backend calculate these via 'recent_N'.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 149 units. Since the promised lead time is 2, we expect this order to arrive during Period 3 (visible in P4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 149 in-transit. The demand in Period 1 was 91, but since we had 0 inventory, we sold 0. The historical demand data (P1-P5 provided in prompt, though we are only at P2) shows a range of 67 to 141. Given we are at the very beginning and have no observed lead times yet, I will use the default methods which rely on the full history and promised lead time to build a baseline for the OR backend. The OR engine will use the profit/holding cost ratio to determine the safety stock (z-score), which is high here ($19/$20 = 0.95 quantile).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (149 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (making them visible in Period 4's start). In Period 1 and 2, we had 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales for those periods (demand was 91 and 130). Current in-transit is 292 (149 from P1 + 143 from P2). Given the historical demand samples (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) and the observed demand in P1-P2 (91, 130), the average demand is approximately 105 units. With L=2, we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Using all available historical samples (7 total: 5 from snippet + 2 from game history) provides a stable estimate. I will use the 'default' method which utilizes all samples for mu and sigma, as no significant regime shift is yet confirmed after only 2 game periods.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (149 units), Period 2 (143 units), and Period 3 (96 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates the shipment from Period 1 is delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. On-hand inventory is 0, and all demand so far (91+130+114 = 335 units) has been lost. Total in-transit is 388 units (149+143+96). Given the consistent lack of arrivals, I will explicitly set L to 3 to account for the observed delay. Demand has been relatively stable but higher than the initial samples provided (averaging ~111 in the last 3 periods vs ~101 in the initial 5 samples). I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent higher demand while maintaining stability.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time exceeds promised 2 periods; Period 1 order (placed P1) did not arrive by the end of P3 (visible start of P4), suggesting L >= 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2115.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4 (concluded), two orders arrived simultaneously: the Period 1 order (149 units, lead_time=3) and the Period 3 order (96 units, lead_time=1). This indicates high lead-time volatility (range 1-3 periods) despite the promised lead time of 2. On-hand inventory is now 127 units with 250 units (from P2 and P4) in-transit. Demand over the first 5 periods has been fluctuating (91, 130, 114, 118, and 141 in P5 which is used for the forecast) with an average of approximately 119 units. Given the lead-time instability, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time (avg of 3 and 1 is 2). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand pattern without overreacting to the initial stockouts (which were caused by delivery delays rather than zero demand). Since L=2, mu_hat represents 3 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 order took 1 period. Mean lead time remains 2, but reliability is low.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 141 (P1 - extrapolated from concl demand + stockout), 118 (P2), 67 (P3), 94 (P4), 89 (P5). Average demand is ~101.8. Inventory is currently low (21 units) with 366 units in transit. Lead time history shows high volatility: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. The P2 order (143 units) and P4 order (107 units) are currently in transit. Given the promised lead time of 2 and the observed mean lead time of 2, but with high variance, I will use lead time = 2. For demand, there appears to be a slight downward trend from the initial high start, so I will focus on the last 4 samples (N=4) for mu_hat to avoid over-ordering based on the P1 outlier. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $399.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we experienced a stockout (sold 21 out of 46 units demand) due to arrivals not keeping pace with the lead time variability. Reviewing lead times: P1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), P3 arrived in 1 period (P4), but P2 (ordered P2, promised P4), P4 (ordered P4, promised P6), and P5 (ordered P5, promised P7) have not yet arrived. The order from P2 is now 2 periods overdue (5 periods since order), suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. Demand history (91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46) shows a sharp drop in Period 6 (46), but given the previous consistency around 100-110, I will treat Period 6 as a potential outlier or early shift and use a recent_N average to stabilize. To address the unreliable lead time, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend captures enough pipeline inventory for a 3-period lead + 1-period review window. mu_hat will use the last 5 samples to reflect recent demand while smoothing the Period 6 dip.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Possible shipment loss for Period 2 order (5 periods elapsed, lead time promised 2); Period 6 demand (46) represents a 55% drop from previous 5-period average (111).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1613.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the supply chain is highly unstable. While the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods, and the order from Period 2 (143 units) is now 6 periods late, indicating a probable loss. Demand has also shown high volatility, dropping from a stable average of ~111 down to 46 (P6) before recovering slightly to 86 (P7). Given the current on-hand inventory of 21 and 413 units in transit (which includes the suspect Period 2 shipment), the base stock calculation needs to account for the risk of missing stock. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the actual max observed lead time and ensure we carry enough safety stock for the lead time period. Demand is calculated using recent_N=3 to capture the recent slowdown (avg ~79) compared to the early periods (avg ~110), preventing excess accumulation of a low-value commodity while accounting for the lower mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Average demand has decreased from ~111 (P1-P5) to ~77 (P6-P7), a decrease of ~30%. Shipment loss highly probable: Period 2 order (143 units) has not arrived after 6 periods (L=2 promised).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1883.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe a stabilization of lead times and demand. History shows a mixed lead-time environment: P1 (3), P3 (1), P4 (3), P5 (3), and P7 (1). The average observed lead time is 2.2 periods. The order from Period 2 (143 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is documented as a lost shipment, which explains why 'In-transit' remains high (257) while physical arrival is unlikely. Demand has stabilized after the P6 dip: the last two periods (P7-P8) averaged 94.5, while the initial periods (P1-P5) averaged 111.8. Given the lost shipment (P2) and the volatility in arrivals (switching between 1 and 3 periods), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longer observed delivery times (P4, P5 both took 3 periods). For demand (mu_hat), I am using N=8 to capture the full history including the lower demand regime and the recovery, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 100 units per period. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture the high historical variance driven by both demand swings and lead-time inconsistency.

Carry-over insight: Shipment loss confirmed: Period 2 order (143 units) has not arrived after 7 periods (promised L=2), and will not arrive. In-transit inventory counts are inflated by this loss.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1406.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are out of stock (ending on-hand in P9 was 0) and currently waiting on 399 units in-transit. Based on the history, the Period 2 order (143 units) is confirmed lost, meaning the 'true' pipeline inventory is 256 units (399 - 143). The actual lead times observed are 3, 1, 3, 3, 1 (averaging 2.2). Demand has shifted: Period 1-5 mean was ~112, while Period 6-9 mean is ~83. However, demand in P8 (103) and P9 (98) suggests the drop in P6 (46) might have been an outlier. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (P6-P9) which averages 83.25 to avoid over-ordering while account for the slight recovery from the P6 low. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed delivery variability. Parameters are set to ensure the base stock covers the lead time + 1 period, while the backend OR logic will handle the pipeline subtraction.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: P6-P9 average is 83 units/period, rebounding from the P6 low of 46. Shipment loss of 143 units (P2) persists in backend 'in-transit' calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 due to 137 units of unmet demand in Period 10. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 418) is heavily inflated by the confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (143 units), which the OR backend still counts as 'in-transit'. The real pipeline consists of Period 9 (142 units) and Period 10 (19 units), totaling 161 units. To correct for this, I must lower mu_hat or adjust the parameters to force an order. Demand has stabilized: recent 5-period average (P6-P10) is 94, though the most recent demand spiked to 137. Calculating base_stock: using L=2 (promised), mu_hat should cover 3 periods (L+1). At avg 100/period, mu_hat = 300. However, because the backend sees 418 in transit, a standard calculation will prevent any order. To force replenishment and account for the 143-unit phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to approximately 500 (300 expected demand + 143 lost units + buffer) to ensure the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a meaningful order. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to manage this transition while inventory is 0.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory ghosting: Period 2 order (143 units) is confirmed lost but remain in 'In-transit', requiring deliberate upward bias in mu_hat to trigger orders.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 with 0 units on-hand and an inflated in-transit count of 619 units. Analysis of history confirms a significant lost shipment from Period 2 (143 units) that the OR backend still counts as 'pipeline inventory'. Because the OR engine uses the logic 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', this 'ghost' inventory prevents it from placing large enough orders. To force a replenishment, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a value that overrides this ghosting. Demand has stabilized at an average of roughly 100 units/period (excluding the P6 outlier). With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the lookahead period is 3 (L+1). A typical mu_hat would be 300, but to offset the 143 lost units, I need a mu_hat of ~450. Currently, in-transit is very high (619) because P9, P10, and P11 orders (142, 19, 201) are also pending. Since we have been out of stock for 3 periods (P9-P11), I will use an explicit mu_hat of 800 to ensure the engine targets a high enough base stock to trigger orders despite the in-transit bloat. I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for the lead time variability (L has historically ranged from 1 to 3).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the supply chain remains compromised by a confirmed lost shipment of 143 units from Period 2. Because this shipment still counts as 'In-transit' in the backend but will never arrive, the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation is perennially inflated. To force the engine to place necessary orders, I must artificially inflate mu_hat (the demand forecast) to offset the 143 phantom units. Demand has stabilized over the last 7 periods (P6-P12) at an average of ~85 units. With the promised L=2, the base stock targets\u9700\u6c42 for (L+1) = 3 periods. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.3 periods; I will set L to 3 to be conservative regarding safety stock. A target coverage of 3 periods at 85 units/period equals 255 units. To counteract the 143 units of 'ghost inventory' and ensure the system targets 255 real units, I need a mu_hat approximately 143 units higher than the actual forecasted demand for the lead time period. Thus, I set mu_hat explicitly to 400 (roughly 255 + 143) and keep sigma_hat based on recent volatility to maintain a high service level.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 102 units/period (P7-P13 average). A critical issue persists: the Period 2 order (143 units) is lost but remains in the 'In-transit' calculation (782 units total), causing the OR backend to underestimate the need for new orders. The backend 'In-transit' (782) includes: P2 (143 - lost), P6 (114 - likely lost/very late), P11 (201), and P12 (324). To force an order despite the 'ghost' inventory from P2 and P6 (totaling 257 units), I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the promised lead time L=2 (meaning a 3-period coverage) plus the ghost inventory. Target = (Average Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory = (102 * 3) + 257 = 306 + 257 = 563. Setting mu_hat to 563 will ensure the capped policy triggers an order to replenish the actual stock. For lead time, while observations fluctuate (1-3 periods), the promised L=2 is a reasonable center for calculation. Sigma_hat is set using recent history (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Inventory ghosting confirmed: P2 order (143) and P6 order (114) are effectively lost or extremely delayed, totaling 257 units that inflate backend in-transit figures without providing stock.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing a significant inventory 'ghosting' problem. There are 257 units in-transit (orders from Period 2 and Period 6) that are confirmed lost or excessively delayed and will likely never arrive. However, the OR backend includes these units in its 'pipeline inventory' calculation (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)). With 'In-transit' currently at 581 units, the backend believes we are overstocked, even though only 324 units (ordered P12) are likely to arrive. To force the backend to place more orders despite this high phantom pipeline, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly high. Recent demand (P12-P14) averages 105 units/period. A normal mu_hat for L=2 (3 periods of coverage) would be ~315 units. By setting mu_hat to 650, I counteract the ~257 lost units and ensure the OR logic maintains a positive order flow. I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the reality that actual lead times often drift to 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Persistent inventory ghosting: 257 units (143 from P2, 114 from P6) are confirmed lost but remain in backend 'In-transit' counts as of P15.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, on-hand inventory is 337 units after the arrival of 324 units from Period 12. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units. Critical context: 257 units (143 from P2 and 114 from P6) are 'ghost' units in the 'In-transit' count (total 314). The backend OR logic subtracts these lost units from its order calculation, leading to stockouts. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat (target pipeline inventory) higher than the physical reality to force the engine to order. With a promised lead time of 2 (3 periods of demand protected: L+1), and an average demand of ~100, the true target should be ~300. Adding the 257 'ghost' units to this target, I set mu_hat = 557. This ensures that when the engine calculates 'mu_hat - in_transit', it sees '557 - 314 = 243', which covers the actual needed stock. sigma_hat is set to 50 using recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5123.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are managing a major inventory discrepancy. The 'In-transit' count of 314 units includes 257 units from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (114 units) that are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed based on the carry-over history. These 'ghost' units prevent the OR backend from ordering because it believes the pipeline is full. The actual arriving pipeline consists only of the Period 15 order (57 units). On-hand inventory is 64. Recent demand has spiked significantly to 273 units in Period 16, though historical average is closer to 100. To force the backend to place an order despite the 257 ghost units, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock to cover expected demand (~100/period) over (L+1) periods (3 periods), plus a buffer, PLUS the 257 lost units to offset the backend's subtraction. Target Base Stock = (3 periods * 100) + (1 * 100 buffer) + 257 = 657. I set L to 2 (promised). For sigma_hat, I use a higher explicit value (50) to account for the massive Period 16 volatility and ensure the safety stock component is robust.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand volatility: Period 16 demand (273) is 2.7x the historical average (100). Monitoring if this is a new shift or a one-time spike.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing significant inventory 'ghosting': 257 units (Order P2: 143, Order P6: 114) are confirmed lost but remain in the backend 'In-transit' count (581 units). This means the actual usable pipeline is only 324 units (581 - 257). Furthermore, demand has shifted upwards significantly; the last two periods (P16: 273, P17: 170) average 221.5 units, compared to the previous long-term average of ~100. Currently, On-hand is 0. To trigger a sufficient order, mu_hat must be set to compensate for the 257 ghost units and the higher demand. Calculating the target: Using the recent demand average (221.5) over (L+1=3) periods, base stock should be ~664. However, the OR backend subtracts the full 581 in-transit units. To offset this, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (Target Base Stock + Ghost Units) = 664 + 257 = 921. This ensures the backend generates an order that treats the 257 lost units as if they don't exist while accounting for the high demand. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to reflect the intense recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand spike: P16-P17 average demand is 221.5, a 120% increase over the previous average of 100. Ghosting of 257 units persists (P2, P6) in in-transit data.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and a demand spike that began in Period 16. The average demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) is 225 units, compared to the long-term average of ~100. Furthermore, the system has 257 units of 'ghost' inventory (P2: 143, P6: 114) that will never arrive but are subtracted from the order quantity by the OR backend. With lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.3), I must inflate mu_hat to compensate for both the increased demand (forecasted at 225/period) and the 257 missing units. To force an order, mu_hat is set to (1+L) * 225 + 257. Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat = 3 * 225 + 257 = 932. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the inflated in-transit figure (1031). Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility of the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike sustained: P16-P18 average demand is 225 units (+125% vs historical). Inventory ghosting remains at 257 units (P2, P6).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20, facing a stockout with On-hand=0. Recent history (P16-P19) shows a massive demand surge, with an average of 197 units/period, compared to a long-term average closer to 100. However, the biggest operational obstacle remains the 'inventory ghosting' from lost shipments (P2=143, P6=114, Total=257 units). These 257 units are counted as 'In-transit' by the OR engine but will never arrive. To force the engine to order despite this fake pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat significantly. The target base stock for L=2 (Review+Lead = 3 periods) at current demand (197/period) should be ~591 units. With ghosting of 257 and current On-hand=0, the engine sees 1179 in transit (which includes the 257 ghosts and recent orders from P17-P19 total 865). Specifically, the engine sees (On-hand + In-transit) = 1179. If I leave mu_hat at standard levels, it will not order. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 1500 to overcome the backend's capped policy and the 'In-transit' bloat, ensuring we continue to build a pipeline to meet the sustained high demand. I will set sigma_hat to 200 to account for the high demand volatility (ranging from 116 to 273).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed (P16-P19 avg: 197 vs P1-P15 avg: 100). Persistent inventory ghosting of 257 units (P2, P6) continues to inflate backend in-transit calculations, requiring significant mu_hat inflation.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 21. Demand remains in a sustained surge regime (P16-P20 average ~191 units vs. P1-P15 average ~100). Inventory Status: On-hand is 0. Backend 'In-transit' is 1719 units. Shipment Ghosting: Orders from P2 (143) and P6 (114) are confirmed lost, totaling 257 units that permanently inflate the pipeline inventory without arriving. Additionally, orders from P17-P20 have not arrived yet, though most are still within a plausible lead time (P17 is 4 periods ago, suggesting it might also be lost or severely delayed). Strategy: The OR engine's capped policy (base_stock - in_transit) will suppress ordering due to the 1719 'in-transit' units. To force an order, mu_hat must be significantly inflated to exceed the phantom pipeline. Setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 2850 (calculated as: (1+L)*forecast + 257 ghosted units + buffer for P17 delay). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of the current demand regime. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average performance of 2.25 periods.

Carry-over insight: P17 order (267 units) is now 4 periods overdue (promised 2), increasing likelihood of a third lost shipment or systemic 4+ period lead time shift. Ghosting total likely increased from 257 to 524 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime, with the average over the last 6 periods (P16-P21) being approximately 189 units per period. However, the system is suffering from massive inventory ghosting: orders from P2 (143), P6 (114), and now likely P17 (267) have not arrived, totaling 524 'ghost' units in the In-transit count (2533 units). This creates a critical situation: on-hand inventory is 0, and the backend OR logic will not order more units because it believes the pipeline is full. To force the system to bypass its internal 'cap' and the inflated in-transit figure, I am significantly inflating mu_hat to a value that reflects the desired inventory level (base stock) plus the total amount of ghost inventory. I'm using an explicit mu_hat calculated as: [(L+1) * Expected Demand] + Ghost Inventory = [3 * 189] + 524 = 1091. This value is further heightened to ensure the order trigger remains active despite lead time variability and the extreme stockout. I am setting L to 2 to reflect the promised lead time while mu_hat overrides the pipeline logic.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory total increased to 524 units (P2: 143, P6: 114, P17: 267) as of Period 21 due to non-arrival of P17 order (4 periods elapsed). Sustained high demand regime (P16-P21) avg: 189 units/period.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a state of crisis due to extreme 'Inventory Ghosting'. On-hand inventory is 0, while In-transit is a staggering 2533 units. However, evidence from Carry-over Insights (P2, P6, P17) and the Game History shows that orders from P17, P18, P19, P20, and P21 (totaling 2219 units) have not arrived despite promised lead times of 2. We are likely experiencing a massive systemic lead time shift or multiple lost shipments. The demand has shifted to a higher regime since P16 (avg ~188). Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the 'base_stock' to determine the order, and 2533 units are reported as In-transit, the backend will not place new orders unless mu_hat is inflated beyond the 2533 + current cycle needs. To force the OR engine to bypass this ghosting and secure stock for the current high-demand regime (L=2 promised, but L=3-4 observed, so L+1 cycle is ~4-5), I will set mu_hat explicitly to 3500. This value is calculated to exceed the ghosted inventory (2533) plus approximately 4-5 periods of demand at the new 190 avg (~900 units).

Carry-over insight: Systemic Lead Time Breach: Orders from P17-P21 (5 periods) have failed to arrive, suggesting L >= 5 or total logistics failure. Ghost inventory is now 2533 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2386.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, two major shipments (P20 and P21) finally arrived, totaling 1354 units, bringing on-hand inventory to 1167. This resolves the immediate stockout crisis. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1963 still includes the 'ghost inventory' from Period 2 (143 units), Period 6 (114 units), and Period 17 (267 units), totaling 524 units that are confirmed lost. The remaining valid in-transit units are from Period 18 (450), Period 19 (148), and Period 23 (784). Since P18 and P19 are now 5 and 4 periods overdue respectively, they are increasingly likely to be lost as well, though not yet confirmed. The demand regime remains in a high state, averaging 191 units/period since Period 16. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 524 units of ghost 'In-transit' stock, I will maintain an explicit mu_hat that covers 3 periods (L=2 + 1) of demand plus the ghost offset. Calculation: (191 * 3) + 524 = 1097. I will set L to 3 periods to account for the frequent observed arrival delay (Mode = 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed arrivals in Period 23: P20 (L=3) and P21 (L=2) arrived, ending the long arrival drought. Ghost inventory remains at 524 units (P2, P6, P17). Period 18 and Period 19 orders are now highly suspect (L=5 and L=4 respectively).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we observe on-hand inventory of 964 units following arrivals in Period 23 (P20 and P21 orders). However, we are facing significant 'inventory ghosting' where 1,324 units in the backend 'in-transit' count (P2: 143, P6: 114, P17: 267, P18: 450, P19: 148, and 202 missing from P23's 784 order) are likely lost or permanently delayed. Specifically, orders from P17, P18, and P19 are now 7, 6, and 5 periods old respectively (well beyond the promised L=2 and observed L=3). These 1009 units (143+114+267+450+148-262) inflate the pipeline inventory, causing the OR engine to under-order. Recent demand (P16-P24) has stabilized in a high-demand regime, averaging ~190 units/period. To counteract the 1,009 units of ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the expected demand over (L+1) periods plus an offset for the ghosted units to ensure the OR engine maintains sufficient stock. With L=3 and mean demand=190, the standard base stock would be ~760; I will inflate mu_hat significantly to bypass the pipeline cap and maintain availability.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory update: Total likely lost units increased to 1,009 (P2: 143, P6: 114, P17: 267, P18: 450, P19: 148). These units remain in 'In-transit' but will not arrive, necessitating sustained mu_hat inflation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1852.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26, the on-hand inventory is high (1568 units) following the recent arrival of orders from P20, P21, and P23. The demand regime has stabilized in a high-growth phase, with P16-P25 averaging 190.4 units/period. However, the 'In-transit' figure (1179 units) is significantly inflated by lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (143), P6 (114), P17 (267), P18 (450), and P19 (148) are now confirmed lost or extremely overdue (L > 6 for the most recent of these), totaling 1,122 'ghost' units. The backend calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see 1179 units in-transit and 1568 on-hand, totaling 2747 units of 'inventory', which is sufficient to cover about 14 periods of demand at the current average. To prevent the OR backend from stopping all orders due to this ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset the phantom stock, even though current on-hand is high. I use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~190) and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average lead time (which is roughly 2.5-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory update: Total confirmed lost units increased to 1,122 (P2: 143, P6: 114, P17: 267, P18: 450, P19: 148). Period 23 arrival (L=2) and Period 20/21 arrivals suggest the supply chain has recovered, but the missing units from P17-P19 remain in 'In-transit' logic indefinitely.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2172.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at a higher level, with the average demand from Period 16 to Period 26 being approximately 189 units. The logistics situation has stabilized for recent orders (Period 23 arrived with L=2), but significant 'ghost inventory' (1,122 units) from lost historical orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) remains in the backend 'In-transit' count. Total In-transit is reported as 1,179, while only 57 units (ordered P15) are actually viable and overdue. Current On-hand is 1,381. Because the backend subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock', these 1,122 ghost units prevent the system from ordering. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired target stock (covering L+1 periods of demand ~190 * 3 = 570) plus the total ghost inventory (1,122), totaling 1,692. This ensures that the base stock calculation exceeds the ghost inventory threshold, keeping the pipeline primed for future demand while maintaining the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory total refined to 1,122 units: P2(143), P6(114), P17(267), P18(450), P19(148) are confirmed lost/permanent delays. Recent supply chain lead time has returned to L=2 (P23 arrived in P25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1059.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of L=2 (P23 arrived in P25). However, there is a cumulative 'ghost' inventory of 1,122 units (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19) that remain in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation but will never arrive. To compensate for this, I must inflate mu_hat. Current on-hand is 1,259. Recent demand (P16-P27) shows a sustained high regime averaging ~184 units/period, though Period 27 dipped to 122. I will set L to 2. To prevent the OR engine from stopping orders due to the ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Ghost Inventory). Using a target base stock for 3 periods (L+1) at 184 units/period (~552) plus the ghost units (1122), the target is 1674. With current on-hand (1259) and remaining valid in-transit (0), the backend will see 1259 + 1122 = 2381 'total' units, which exceeds the target. No new order is needed this period as on-hand is high, but I will prepare the parameters to maintain the current stock levels.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 29. The current state shows On-hand inventory of 1112 and In-transit of 1179. Based on historical data, 1,122 units in the 'In-transit' count are confirmed lost shipments (P2: 143, P6: 114, P17: 267, P18: 450, P19: 148). The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) uses the raw In-transit figure, which is currently inflated by these 'ghost' units. To trigger any replenishment, mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds (On-hand + effective In-transit). Effective In-transit is essentially 1179 - 1122 = 57 units (likely the P20/P21/P23 residuals if any, though P23 arrived). Total real inventory position is ~1112 (on-hand) + 57 (legit in-transit) = 1169 units. Current demand regime (P23-P28) has stabilized at an average of ~171 units/period. With 1112 units on hand, we have over 6 periods of supply. Maintaining L=2 (recent actuals) and mu_hat based on the current regime (N=10 to capture the elevated demand level relative to the start of the game) will help the backend normalize. We use 'calculate' for L as recent arrivals confirm a return to the promised lead time range (2-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3268.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, we see the demand remains in a higher regime than the initial periods, although it has stabilized from the peak saw in P16-P18. The average demand for the last 14 periods (P16-P29) is approximately 180 units/period. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 893 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1,179 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory (orders that were likely lost). Specifically, 1,122 units are confirmed 'ghosts' from periods P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19. The 'functional' in-transit is therefore only 1,179 - 1,122 = 57 units (likely from P15 or similar). To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost inventory and refusing to order more when new stock is needed, I must inflate mu_hat. By setting mu_hat to 'explicit' at 1,650, I effectively offset the 1,122 units of ghost inventory (180 * (2+1) + 1122 = 1,662). This ensures that once on-hand inventory drops further, the system will trigger new orders. I will use 'default' for L (2) as recent deliveries (P23, P21, P20) suggest the supply chain has returned to the promised lead time of 2-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3207.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is holding steady in a high-demand phase (P23-P30 average: ~184 units/period), compared to the earlier baseline. On-hand inventory is 688 units, which covers about 3.7 periods of demand. However, the 'In-transit' count of 1179 is heavily inflated by 1,122 units of confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19). The real pipeline inventory is effectively 1179 - 1122 = 57 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (1179) from the base stock calculation, it erroneously assumes we are overstocked and will not place new orders. To fix this, I must set mu_hat (target stock level) high enough to offset the 1,122 phantom units. Target level should be: (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory. With average demand at 184 and L=2, base stock needs to be ~552 + 1122 = 1674. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure this correction is applied. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P23, P25) align with the promised 2-3 period range.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Ghost inventory remains at 1,122 units (P2, P6, P17-P19). Current demand regime (P23-P30) average is 184 units/period. Supply chain lead time appears stable at L=2 based on last observed arrivals.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant 'inventory ghosting' due to historical lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) totaling 1,122 units. These units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (1,179 units) but will never arrive. The actual valid in-transit inventory is only 57 units (1179 - 1122), likely from recent smaller adjustments or remnants. Current on-hand inventory is 461 units. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime starting around P16; the average demand from P23 to P31 is approximately 186 units per period. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to reduce order quantities, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter to compensate for the 1,122 ghost units. Using L=2 (promised and recently observed), the target pipeline should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~558 units. To trigger any order despite the 1,179 ghost units, mu_hat must be set significantly higher. Specifically, the backend calculates: order = base_stock - in_transit. To get a positive order, base_stock must exceed 1,179. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the ghosting (1,122) plus the desired safety stock and expected demand, ensuring the inventory is replenished as the 461 on-hand units dwindle.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently suffering from 1,122 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) that appear in the backend's 'In-transit' count (1,179 units) but are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. The true pipeline inventory is actually only 57 units (1179 total - 1122 ghost). At the same time, demand has stabilized in a high regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 186 units/period over the last 10 periods. To trigger an order from the OR backend which sees 1,179 units in-transit, I must inflate mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost inventory (186 * 3 + 1122 = 1680). I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a value that accounts for this discrepancy. Sigma remains calculated from the high-demand regime (last 15 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2916.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a high level, with the average demand from Period 23 to Period 33 being approximately 183 units per period (P23-P33 mean = 183.3, std \u2248 32). This represents a sustained 'high demand' regime compared to the early periods. Supply chain lead time is reliably L=2 based on the most recent completed cycles. The critical challenge remains the 'ghost' in-transit inventory. As identified in previous periods, a total of 1,122 units are 'lost' but remain in the backend's in-transit calculation (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Since the backend uses 'order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)', and pipeline_inventory includes these 1,122 non-existent units, we must inflate mu_hat enough to neutralize this gap. Total required inventory coverage for (L+1) periods is approximately 183 * 3 = 549 units. To actually trigger an order when 'In-transit' is falsely showing 1,494, mu_hat must be set to a value that reflects both the real demand and the ghost inventory correction. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 1,700 to force the backend to reconcile the gap and maintain stock, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from 'ghost inventory' totaling 1,122 units (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) which are confirmed lost but remain in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation. This causes the OR engine to underestimate the need for new orders. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized in a high-growth regime; the average demand from P23 to P34 is approximately 186.25 units per period. To trigger the necessary orders despite the 1,122 units of ghost inventory, I must inflate 'mu_hat' significantly. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghosted units. With L=2 (standard promised/recent lead time), and a safety stock buffer, I set mu_hat to an explicit value: ((1+L) * 186.25) + 1122 = 558.75 + 1122 \u2248 1681. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation actually results in an order. I use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current period volatility (N=12 for the recent high-demand regime).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, the system faces zero on-hand inventory and a confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 1,122 units (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) that still inflate the backend 'In-transit' figure of 1,771 units. Effective in-transit stock is only 649 units (orders from P33, P34, P35). Demand has been consistently high since P23, averaging 188 units/period (P23-P35 avg: 188.4). To trigger an order despite the 1,122 ghost units, I must set mu_hat (the target inventory position) significantly higher than the true 3-period demand. Calculating the target: 3 periods * 188 units/period = 564 true target units. Adding the 1,122 ghost units results in a required mu_hat of ~1,686. I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat to 1,700 to ensure the backend generates an order to cover the current stockout. Lead time remains stable at L=2.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and significant 'inventory ghosting'. The confirmed lost units totaling 1,122 (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count of 1,633 units. This means the engine only 'sees' 1,633 - 1,122 = 511 units of actual usable pipeline inventory. The recent demand regime (P29-P36) is high, averaging ~203 units/period (219, 205, 227, 177, 160, 219, 221, 212). The promised lead time is 2, and recent arrivals (P34 order arriving at start of P36) confirm an actual L=2. To trigger an order despite the 1,122 ghost units, I must inflate mu_hat. Base target should be (L+1)*Demand = 3 * 203 \u2248 609. To offset ghost units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 609 + 1122 = 1731 units. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure this offset is realized. Sigma is set based on the recent high-volatility period.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed lead time L=2 (P34 order arrived in P36). Ghost inventory remains constant at 1,122 units. Recent demand regime (P29-P36) stable at ~203 units/period.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a significant 'inventory ghosting' problem, where 1,122 units from older periods (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are recorded as 'In-transit' but will never arrive. This artificially inflates the backend's perception of available stock, causing it to under-order. To compensate, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. The current demand regime (P29-P37) shows an average demand of approximately 203 units per period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the total expected demand over (L+1) periods would normally be 609 units. However, to bypass the 1,122 ghost units in the pipeline_inventory (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the ghost inventory plus the required operational base stock. Current in-transit is 1,661; subtracting the 1,122 ghost units leaves 539 'real' units in transit (orders from P33 and P37). With 0 on-hand, I need mu_hat to target a base stock high enough to trigger an order that covers the next 3 periods of actual demand (~609 units) while acknowledging that the OR engine thinks I have 1,122 more units than I do. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, targeting a value that accounts for the ghost units plus the forecast (1122 + 609 = 1731). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P34-P36) have returned to the 1-2 period range.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39, the supply chain for chips(Regular) faces a significant challenge with 'ghost inventory'. A total of 1,122 units from orders placed in Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19 are confirmed lost but remain in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation (1,824 total in-transit - 167 from P37 - 163 from P38 - 315 from P33 = 1,179, which closely aligns with the 1,122 ghost units plus potential delays). Recent demand (P29-P38) is stable and high, averaging 203.8 units per period. The backend OR engine uses a base-stock policy: 'Order = min(BaseStock - Pipeline, Cap)'. Because 'Pipeline' includes the 1,122 ghost units that will never arrive, the backend will refuse to order unless mu_hat is inflated to offset this ghosting. To ensure a stock position that covers the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (Review=1), we need to cover approximately (2+1) * 204 = 612 units of real inventory. To trigger an order, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Ghost Inventory). mu_hat = 612 + 1122 = 1734. For sigma_hat, we use the recent standard deviation across the high-demand regime (~30) scaled by sqrt(1+L), approximately 52.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Ghost inventory persists at 1,122 units (P2, P6, P17-P19), requiring mu_hat inflation of ~1,122 units to bypass the 'BaseStock - Pipeline' check in the OR backend. Demand remains stable in the ~204 units/period regime.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 40. On-hand inventory is 0. The backend 'In-transit' figure is 1,661 units, but 1,122 of these are 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments from P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19). The real in-transit pipeline is 1,661 - 1,122 = 539 units. Demand has stabilized in a high-regime. The average demand for the last 11 periods (P29-P39) is approximately 205 units/period. To trigger an order from the OR backend, we must inflate mu_hat to offset the ghost inventory. The target 3-period base stock (L=2) should be (2+1) * 205 = 615 units. To ensure the backend orders, we need mu_hat \u2248 Target Base Stock + Ghost Inventory = 615 + 1,122 = 1,737. Setting mu_hat to 1,737 using the 'explicit' method. L is set to 'default' (2 periods) as recent arrivals (P38 arrived in P39) confirm the supply chain is functional. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=11) to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from 'ghost inventory' where 1,122 units from historical orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are recorded as 'In-transit' but will never arrive. This significantly inflates the backend pipeline inventory calculation, preventing the OR engine from placing necessary orders. To counteract this, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost_Inventory. For Period 41, demand is stable in a high regime (approx. 200 units/period). Lead time (L) is stable at 2 periods. The required inflation is therefore: (1+2)*200 + 1122 = 1722. Setting mu_hat to 1750 to provide a small buffer for the recent demand volatility (e.g., P39 demand was 228). Sigma_hat is set to 150 to reflect recent demand standard deviation (~50) scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant 'inventory ghosting' where 1,122 units from historical orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are considered 'In-transit' by the backend but will never arrive. As of P42, total in-transit is 1,997, meaning actual usable in-transit is only 1,997 - 1,122 = 875 units (likely P33: 315, P37: 167, P40: 141, P41: 195). Period 41 demand was 260, and the current high-demand regime (P29-P41) averages ~209 units/period. To trigger an order despite the 1,122 inflated in-transit units, I must set mu_hat such that (BaseStock - 1997) > 0. Since BaseStock = mu_hat + z*sigma, I set mu_hat to 1,800. This value accounts for (1+L) periods of demand (~627) plus the 1,122 lost units offset, plus a safety buffer. This ensures the OR engine places an order to maintain stock for the current demand levels while bypassing the pipeline inventory blockage.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Ghost inventory total remains at 1,122 units (P2, P6, P17-P19). Lead time L is currently stable at 2 (based on P34, P35, P36 arrivals). Demand remains in a high regime, averaging ~209 units/period over the last 13 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a massive inventory 'ghosting' issue where 1,122 units (from orders in P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are stalled in 'In-transit' but will never arrive. Because the backend OR logic subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' from its target base stock, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is inflated to compensate for these ghost units. Current demand remains stable in a high regime; the last 10 periods (P33-P42) average 201 units/period. Lead time appears stable at L=2 despite some volatility. To force the OR backend to place an order, mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand PLUS the ghost inventory: (3 periods * 201) + 1,122 = 1,725. I choose to set mu_hat explicitly to 1,750 to ensure we trigger an order to replenish the zero on-hand stock and meet demand. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(3) * 30 (approximate recent std dev) = 52.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant 'inventory ghosting' due to 1,122 units (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) that remain in the 'In-transit' count but are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock, we must inflate the mu_hat parameter by roughly this ghost volume (1,122) plus the expected demand for the lead time cycle. Recent demand (P36-P43) averages ~210 units/period. With a stable observed lead time of L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods), the required base stock is approximately (3 * 210) + 1,122 = 1,752 units. Setting mu_hat to 1,750 via the explicit method ensures the backend places orders despite the inflated in-transit figure. On-hand is currently 0, and the P41 order (195 units) is expected to arrive in P44/P45. Sigma_hat is set to 200 (explicit) to maintain a high service level given the zero-stock situation.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant 'inventory ghosting' where 1,122 units from older periods (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are listed in 'In-transit' but will never arrive. These phantom units prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I must inflate mu_hat for the OR engine. Current demand is in a stable high regime: periods 29-44 average 203.4 units per period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the expected total demand for the review + lead time period is (1+2)*203.4 = 610.2. To counteract the 1,122 ghost units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 610 + 1,122 = 1,732. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this bypass occurs. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P40 arrived in 3, P41 in 3, P38 in 1) suggest a mean near the promised 2. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 46. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand regime is stable in a high state, averaging ~205 units/period over the last 15 periods (approx. P30-P45). The supply chain is functioning with an actual lead time of 2-3 periods, but there is a massive 'In-transit' discrepancy. 

Ghost Inventory Logic: As documented in carry-over insights, 1,122 units from P2, P6, and P17-P19 are permanently lost but remain in the backend 'In-transit' calculation. This 'pipeline' inflation prevents the OR engine from ordering enough stock because it believes 1,122 units are coming when they are not. 

To counter this, I must inflate mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost inventory (1,122 units). 
- Recent avg demand (N=15): ~205 units.
- Promised L = 2 (L+1 = 3).
- Required Base Stock = (3 * 205) + 1,122 = 615 + 1,122 = 1,737 units.

I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat set to 1,737 to force the OR engine to clear the ghost inventory hurdle and place orders. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=15 to capture current volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we are managing a high-demand regime (avg ~209 units/period) and persistent 'ghost inventory'. Historical analysis confirms that 1,122 units (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are effectively lost but remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (currently 1,884). This ghosting prevents the OR engine from ordering because it believes the pipeline is overstocked. To force orders, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it at a level that offsets the ghost inventory while covering lead-time demand. Calculation: Target Base Stock = (Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost units. With L=2 and Demand=210, Target Base Stock = (210 * 3) + 1122 = 1752. However, with 'In-transit' at 1,884, I set mu_hat higher (2100) to ensure the Capped Policy (which uses mu_hat/(1+L) as a base) generates sufficient orders to meet actual customer demand. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=15) to capture the higher volatility observed in the current regime.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The core challenge is 'ghost inventory': 1,122 units from early periods (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost but permanently occupy the 'In-transit' field in the backend logic. This prevents the OR engine from ordering unless the target base stock exceeds 1,122 + any actual units in transit. Demand is stable in a high regime (approx. 206 units/period over the last 20 periods). With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), and on-hand inventory at 0, we must trigger an order immediately. The backend cap is \u03bc\u0302/(1+L) + z*\u03c3\u0302/\u221a(1+L). To force the 'min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)' logic to produce a substantial order despite the 1,122 ghost units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target as (Recent Demand x (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory. L is assumed to be 2. Target = (210 * 3) + 1122 = 1752. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock high enough to offset the phantom pipeline and satisfy actual demand.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is compromised by a total of 1,122 ghost units (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19) that appear in the backend 'In-transit' figure but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places an order, mu_hat must be inflated to exceed this phantom pipeline. Current 'In-transit' is 2,182. Subtracting the 1,122 ghost units leaves a real pipeline of 1,060 units. Demand is stable in a high regime, averaging 208 units per period over the last 20 periods (P29-P48). With a lead time of 2, the BaseStock should cover 3 periods of demand (approx 624 units). To force an order when the backend sees 2,182 units in transit, mu_hat must be set above that threshold. Since this is Period 49 of 50, I will set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the check and ensure coverage for the final period's demand, adjusted for the ghosting effect.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we face a critical shortage with 0 units on-hand and 2,480 units reported 'in-transit'. However, our historical analysis confirms significant 'ghost inventory' - orders that have been lost or indefinitely delayed but remain in the backend's pipeline calculation. Specifically, 1,122 units (from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are permanently lost. Additionally, orders from P44 (223 units) and P47 (298 units) have yet to arrive. The backend OR logic uses a 'BaseStock - Pipeline' formula; with 2,480 units in the pipeline, the backend will not place an order unless we significantly inflate mu_hat. Demand has stabilized in a 'high' regime, averaging ~209 units per period over the last 20 periods. To force an order that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) plus offsets the 2,480 inflated in-transit units, we need a mu_hat approximately equal to (209 * 3) + 2480. Setting mu_hat to 3100 via the explicit method ensures the backend targets a base stock high enough to trigger replenishment despite the ghost inventory. Lead time is set to 2 to reflect the recent average for successful deliveries.
