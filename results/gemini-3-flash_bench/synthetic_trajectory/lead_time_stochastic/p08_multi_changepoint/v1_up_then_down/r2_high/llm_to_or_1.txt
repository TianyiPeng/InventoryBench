Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Current on-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. The historical demand data provided (Periods 1-5: 130, 122, 106, 108, 71) suggests a mean demand of approximately 107.4 and a standard deviation of 22.8. However, there is a noticeable downward trend, specifically in Period 5 (71). Given the promised lead time (L) is 2, the pipeline needs to cover 3 periods (L+1). To avoid overstocking while addressing the recent drop, I will use all available history (N=5) to calculate mean and variance. This provides a balance between the early high demand and the recent low demand. Since this is the first operational period and we have no observed arrivals yet, I'll stick to the default lead time method.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 145 units with a promised lead time of 2. As expected (Scenario A), 'Period 1 conclude' shows 0 units arrived because the order only arrives during Period 3 (L=2) and becomes visible in the 'Period 2 conclude' message read at the start of Period 3. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 118 units of demand were lost in Period 1. Historical demand for periods 1-5 (prior) and the actual Period 1 demand (118) suggest a relatively stable mean around 109. I will use the default method for lead time (referencing the promised 2 periods) and recent_N for demand forecasting to capture the most relevant recent data (N=6 including the new Period 1 data point). This ensures our base stock level target (mu_hat + z*sigma) accounts for the lead time + review period (1+L=3 periods of demand).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (145 units) and Period 2 (144 units) are currently in-transit. Following the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 4 start message. As of now, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Periods 1 and 2. The historical demand samples (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) show a mean of ~107. Since we are in the early stages and have no confirmed lead time deviations yet, I will use 'default' for L. For demand forecasting, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent trend while maintaining a stable base for the OR backend's service level calculation.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the first three periods has been 118, 35, and 140. Note that sales were 0 because on-hand inventory was 0, but total demand is recorded. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (145 units), Period 2 (144 units), and Period 3 (72 units). According to the sequence: an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 2 should arrive during Period 3's resolution phase and be visible in Period 3's conclude message (read at the start of Period 4). However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests a potential lead time delay or shift. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and the Period 1 order (145 units) is now 'overdue' based on the promised L=2, I will set L to 3 explicitly for this transition to reflect the lag. For demand forecasting, the average demand of the first three periods is approximately 97.6. mu_hat should cover (L+1) periods, so with L=3, we need to cover 4 periods of demand. (4 * 97.6 = 390.4). I will use explicit values to account for the current stockout and the observed arrival delay.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we have 187 units on hand and 328 units in transit. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), and Period 3's order also arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. Demand has been highly volatile: 118, 35, 140, 30 (mean ~80). However, sales were restricted in early periods due to zero inventory. Calculating demand mean from all 4 concluded periods is 80.75. Since inventory is now available (187 units) and pipeline is high (328), we need to set stable parameters. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend use the average of 2. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' to incorporate all available samples, as there is no clear sustained regime shift yet, only high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2433.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 118, 35, 140, 30, and 131. The mean demand is approximately 91 units per period, but the volatility is high (std dev ~53). Lead time analysis: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (actual L=3), and Period 3 order also arrived in Period 4 (actual L=1). The average observed lead time is 2, matching the promised lead time, but with significant jitter. Currently, we have 56 units on-hand and 329 in-transit (orders from P2, P4, and P5). Since 329 units are already in the pipeline and the mean demand is around 91, our pipeline inventory is likely sufficient for the next several periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the full available history and 'default' for lead time (L=2) and volatility (sigma_hat) to maintain a stable safety stock buffer given the lead time variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1064.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7, the on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand is volatile: Periods 1-6 show values of 118, 35, 140, 30, 131, and 73 (mean \u2248 88). Lead times are unstable: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period, compared to the promised 2 periods. Order P2 (144 units) and P4 (184 units) are still in transit (328 units total in pipeline; the system shows 331, likely including the small orders from P5/P6). Given the stockout in Period 6 and the lead time variance, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed 1 and 3 period lead times. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the full recent history of demand (avg ~88) to stabilize the base stock target, as recent demand shows no clear regime shift but high variance.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 80 units on hand and 315 units in transit (from orders in Period 2, 5, 6, and 7). Historical demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility: P1-P7 demand values are 118, 35, 140, 30, 131, 73, 104. The average demand is approximately 90.1 units per period. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have been 3, 1, and 3 periods, suggesting an average lead time of 2.33. The order from Period 2 (144 units) is significantly overdue (6 periods elapsed), which likely indicates a lost shipment. Subtracting these 144 potentially lost units from the 315 in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 171 units. To ensure availability given the lead time volatility and the possible lost shipment, I will use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect historical reality and 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the full recent demand variation. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to ensure a conservative safety stock buffer given the demand swings and shipment unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed (observed 1, 3, 3); Period 2 order (144 units) likely lost as it is 4 periods past promised lead time.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 185 units on-hand and 234 in-transit (orders from P6: 2 units, P8: 88 units, and the likely lost P2: 144 units). The order from Period 2 (144 units) is now 6 periods late against a promised lead time of 2, confirming it is lost; the OR backend's 'pipeline' check will incorrectly count these units, leading to under-ordering if not corrected. Lead times are highly volatile, switching between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.2). Demand mean over periods 1-8 is 86.8. To compensate for the lost 144 units in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly high for one period to force an order that covers the inventory gap. Calculating base_stock as (1+L)*mu + z*sigma: With L=2.2 (approx 3), mu=87, sigma=39, and z=1.96 (95% service level), base_stock should be ~500. Current reliable pipeline is 90 units + 185 on-hand = 275. I need a mu_hat that forces the backend to see the shortfall.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 2 order (144 units) confirmed lost (6 periods late). Actual lead time alternates between 1 and 3 (avg 2.2).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 160 units with 283 units in transit. Historical demand over the first 9 periods averages 90.3 units, but recent demand (Periods 7-9) averages 93.7. My lead time analysis shows high variability: observed lead times are 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1. The Period 2 order (144 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is confirmed lost. Because the lead time alternates between 1 and 3, using a calculated average (approx 2.0 based on successful arrivals) is appropriate, but I will monitor the pipeline carefully. Since demand has been relatively stable without clear seasonal shifts in the provided samples (118, 35, 140, 30, 131, 73, 104, 64, 113), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture the most current distribution while smoothing out the outlier Period 4 (30 units). The backend OR will set the base stock to cover (L+1) periods, which at L=2 covers 3 periods of demand (~280 units). Given 160 on hand and 283 in transit, the pipeline is heavy, so the OR's inventory-position-based logic will likely result in a small or zero order this period to avoid excessive holding costs.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the demand remains relatively stable with an average of approximately 105 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 6-10). The primary challenge is lead-time volatility: we have observed lead times of 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, and 1. The average observed lead time is 2.0, matching the promised 2, but the variance is high and the Period 2 order (144 units) is confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 57 and in-transit is 302 (from orders in P6, P9, and P10). We expect the P9 order (137 units) to potentially arrive in P11 or P12. Given the lost shipment from P2 and the alternating lead times, I will set L to 2.2 explicitly to account for the risk of longer delivery times. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand mean (~105), and sigma_hat is set to 50 explicitly to buffer against the combination of lead-time variance and demand fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1083.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory after experiencing a stockout in Period 11 (sold 57, demand 96). The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility with no clear seasonal trend, averaging approximately 92.5 units per period over the last 11 periods. Lead times are highly unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2), with one confirmed lost shipment from Period 2. The pipeline currently contains 172 units (ordered Periods 9, 10, and 11: 137 + 19 + 16). Given the lead time is often 3 periods, we expect the Period 9 order (137 units) to arrive during Period 12 and be visible in Period 13. To mitigate the current stockout and account for lead time variance, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers the longer end of the lead time distribution. I will use the last 5 periods of demand to capture the recent mean of ~102 units, reflecting a slightly higher recent consumption than the lifetime average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains volatile but stable (avg 92-102); Lead time continues to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, requiring a conservative L estimate for safety.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 96 with 290 units in transit (ordered in P11 and P12). Historical lead times for chips(Regular) show significant volatility, oscillating between 1, 2, and 3 periods (average ~2.2). One order from Period 2 is confirmed lost. The promised lead time is 2, but given the frequent 3-period arrivals, I will use an explicit L of 2.5 to buffer against the 'late' side of the oscillation. Demand has stabilized over the last 10 periods (P3-P12) with a mean of approximately 92.4 units per period. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable but moderately high-variance regime, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected lead time plus the review period (L+1), adjusted for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which favors higher service levels.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, our on-hand inventory is low (35 units) with 330 units in transit. Historical demand analysis shows a relatively stable but volatile mean. The last 10 periods (P4-P13) average 83.5 units, while the most recent 5 periods (P9-P13) average 86.6 units. Lead times have been highly inconsistent, oscillating between 1, 2, and 3 periods (Recent observed: 3, 1, 1, 3, 2). The Period 2 order (144 units) is definitively lost. Given the lead time volatility (average ~2.0), I am setting L to 2.2 explicitly to represent the observed drift and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high probability of a 3-period arrival. mu_hat will use recent_N=10 to capture the current demand regime (avg ~84), which translates to a forecast of (1+2.2)*84 = 268.8. sigma_hat will use the recent volatility from the last 10 periods to protect against stockouts during shipment delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $969.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Inventory: On-hand is 0, and we experienced a stockout in Period 14 (demand 83, sold 51). In-transit inventory stands at 314 units (from orders in P12, P13, and P14). Lead Time Analysis: Observed lead times are 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3. The average is approximately 2.125, but the variability is high (oscillating between 1 and 3). I am choosing to use a conservative lead time (L=3) to account for this variability and mitigate stockout risk. Demand Analysis: Recent demand samples (P10-P14) are 103, 96, 60, 61, 83. The mean of these 5 samples is 80.6. Using N=5 for the demand forecast captures the most recent regime. The combination of L=3 and recent demand statistics aims to rebuild inventory while accounting for the inconsistent delivery schedule.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1792.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 90-100 units per period (last 5 periods mean: ~80, but impacted by stockouts; full sample mean: ~93). I will use a recent N=10 window to capture the current demand regime. Lead times remain highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Period 12 arrived in 3, Period 11 arrived in 3, whereas earlier orders saw 1 and 2). Given this inconsistency and the historical loss of the large Period 2 order, setting L to an explicit value of 3 is necessary to ensure the pipeline inventory covers the potential for long delivery times. Pipeline inventory is currently 260 units (orders from P13, P15, and the new P16 order). With an average demand of ~93 and L=3, the (L+1) target is ~372 units. The OR backend will order to bridge the gap between (On-hand + In-transit) and this target, adjusted for risk (z-score for 95% service level).

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility continues: Period 11, 12, and 14 arrivals confirm a sustained shift towards 3-period lead times (actuals: 3, 3, 3 for last three recorded arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1368.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 due to a demand spike in Period 16 (178 units, significantly higher than the previous avg of ~92-102). Historical data suggests a demand regime shift or high-impact volatility. Carry-over insights confirm that the last four shipments (ordered Periods 9, 11, 12, and 13) all arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, establishing a consistent shift away from the promised lead time of 2. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for this. Given the recent demand spike and the stockout, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) for demand mean (mu_hat) to capture the recent upward movement in demand. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the increased risk. The in-transit inventory is 335, but with on-hand at 0 and a lead time of 3, the parameters must ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~4 x 100+ units) to recover service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/spike detected at Period 16: demand surged to 178 from an average of ~95. Lead time is now firmly established at 3 periods based on the last four consecutive arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2185.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand was 168, confirming a sharp increase in the demand regime starting from Period 16 (178 units). The average demand over the last two periods is 173, compared to the previous average of ~95. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 396 units in-transit. Arrivals have been erratic: although the Period 16 order arrived in 1 period, previous arrivals (Periods 11, 12, 13) all took 3 periods. To be conservative and avoid stockouts during this high-demand spike, I am setting the lead time (L) to 3. For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=2 to focus exclusively on this new demand regime (178 and 168). For sigma_hat, I am using an explicit high value to account for the volatility seen during the transition between regimes and to maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: average demand increased from ~95 to 173 (+82%). Lead time remains volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods; using L=3 for safety.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The average demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) is approximately 167 units, compared to the previous average of ~95. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 594 units in transit. Lead times continue to be highly volatile, specifically alternating between 1 and 3 periods (the P16 order arrived in 1 period, while the P18 conclude shows no arrival, and the P14/P15 orders are potentially late or following the 3-period pattern). I will set L to 3 to ensure the safety stock calculation covers the longest observed regular lead time. For mu_hat, I'm using N=3 to capture the recent demand surge (P16: 178, P17: 168, P18: 155), and sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the higher volume and the delivery uncertainty.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 16 onwards) shows a significant spike with an average demand of approximately 144 units (178, 168, 155, 114) versus the previous average of ~95. Although Period 19 dipped to 114, I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this new elevated phase. Lead times remain highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (observed lead times for orders from P13, P16 were 3 and 1 respectively). Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing a stockout, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend generates a high enough base stock to cover demand over a potentially long lead time. This conservative lead time setting helps protect against the 'oscillating' delivery pattern seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: average demand for Periods 16-19 is ~154 units, representing a sustained increase from previous levels.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is now firmly confirmed, with average demand over the last five periods (P16-P20) being approximately 152 units, compared to the previous average of ~95. Lead time continues to exhibit significant volatility, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (with P17-P19 orders yet to arrive, further suggesting a lead time of at least 3 for those shipments). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 708 units in transit (P17, P18, P19, and P20 orders); however, the immediate stockout since Period 18 necessitating a high service level. To stabilize the supply chain against the new high-demand regime and lead time volatility, I am setting L=3 to ensure sufficient pipeline stock. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher mean demand (~152), and sigma_hat is set using N=5 to capture the increased variance in this new regime.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 0, and we have experienced no arrivals for 4 consecutive periods (P18-P21). Current demand remains in the high regime (avg ~148 for P16-P21). There are 708 units in transit, which includes orders from P17 (176 units), P18 (198), P19 (112), P20 (2), and P21 (0). Based on recent history, the actual lead time fluctuates primarily between 1 and 3 periods. The P17 order (ordered P17) is now at its L=4 transition point, making it highly likely to arrive in P22. To ensure we recover from the stockout and handle the sustained higher demand mean, I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent longer lead times observed in periods 12-16. mu_hat will use recent_N=6 to capture the new demand regime (Periods 16-21) which is significantly higher (~148) compared to the previous baseline (~95). sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained stockout since Period 18 due to delivery delays (P18-P21 saw zero arrivals). Demand regime avg 148 confirmed over last 6 periods.

The system is currently in a critical stockout state (on-hand inventory = 0) spanning desde Period 18, primarily due to a delivery cluster failure where zero units arrived between Periods 18 and 22.

Demand has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 to approximately 150 units per period. Lead times are extremely volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, though the lack of arrivals suggests current actual lead times are exceeding the promised 2 periods for the bulk of in-transit stock. Given the high pipeline and the imminent arrival of delayed orders, I am setting L=3 to ensure the backend base stock covers the extended lead time, and using recent_N=7 for mu_hat (N=7 covers periods 16-22) to capture the new demand average of ~150 units. I am not placing new orders (OR backend will cap is pipeline exceeds base_stock) but ensuring parameters reflect the new demand reality to recover safety stock once arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Sustained arrival gap: No units arrived between Period 18 and Period 22 (5 periods), despite 488 units being in-transit since P18. This confirms a severe lead time break beyond the promised 2.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is emerging from a severe 5-period arrival gap (Periods 18-22). At Period 23, a small order (2 units from Period 20) arrived, which confirms the supply chain is still functioning but highly unreliable. There are 706 units in-transit (orders from P17, P18, and P19 dominate this), which are now overdue or at the limit of the observed 3-period lead time. However, the last 'stable' lead time observed was 3, and the 'arrived=2' from P20 confirms a 3-period delay. Demand has shifted to a higher regime (~148 units/period) starting around P16. Because of the enormous in-transit inventory (706 units) relative to the high-demand regime (148 units * 4 periods = 592 units needed), the OR cap will likely prevent ordering more units. I will set L=3 to account for the frequent delays, mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime (Period 16 onwards, N=8), and sigma_hat to the same recent period to capture the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Supply chain recovery began with Period 20 order arriving in Period 23 (LT=3). Pipeline remains heavily congested with 706 units in-transit, mostly from the P17-P19 ordering spree. Demand regime average remains stable at ~148 units since P16.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a significant disruption. Specifically, orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 486 units) are now 5-7 periods overdue, while a small order from Period 20 arrived in Period 23 (LT=3). Pipeline inventory is very high at 706 units, but since it's not arriving, the SKU has been stocked out since Period 18 (except for 2 units in Period 23). The demand regime remains stable in its 'high' phase, averaging approximately 144 units since Period 16. Because the OR backend subtracts the pipeline (706) from the base stock, and the pipeline is significantly larger than any reasonable base stock calculation, the backend will continue to order 0 units if L is set to a standard value. I will maintain L=3 and use a 9-period mu_hat (N=9, covering the high-demand regime since P16) to ensure the system is ready to stop ordering once the logjam clears, but also to recognize a higher demand mean. No new orders are expected or desired given the 706 units already in transit.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain congestion continues: Orders from P17-P19 (486 units) are now severely delayed (5-7 periods), while P20 order arrived with LT=3, indicating non-FIFO delivery or selective loss.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe supply chain disruption. Demand has stabilized at a higher regime (average ~148 units/period since Period 16), but arrivals have almost entirely stopped despite 706 units being in-transit. Crucially, the order from Period 20 arrived in Period 23 (LT=3), but older orders from Period 17 (176 units), Period 18 (198 units), and Period 19 (112 units) are now 6-8 periods late. Given the Carry-over Insights (specifically the lost Period 2 order), there is a high probability that these older chunks of the pipeline are lost or indefinitely delayed. However, the OR backend's 'cap' logic is based on pipeline inventory; if I report 706 units in-transit, it will place zero orders. To force an order to meet current demand (since on-hand is 0), I must adjust the parameters. I will use L=3 based on the most recent successful arrival (P20). I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect the current regime (~148 * (1+3) = 592) and sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent volatility. By setting L to 'explicit' and mu_hat to 'explicit', I am signaling the current demand level, though the OR backend will still subtract the 706 in-transit units. Since I cannot 'delete' the in-transit units from the backend's view, my goal is to maintain the most accurate statistical parameters possible while the environment resolves.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline blockage/loss confirmed for P17-P19 orders (486 units): currently 6-8 periods late while newer orders (P20) arrived with LT=3. Significant risk of permanent stockout if pipeline inventory is not reconciled.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is currently in a state of severe disruption. A large block of pipeline inventory (486 units ordered in P17-P19) is now 8-10 periods late and likely lost, as a later order (P20) arrived in P23 with a 3-period lead time. Despite an 'In-transit' figure of 706 units, 486 of these are unreliable. The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 to approximately 150 units per period. With current on-hand inventory at 0 and sustained stockouts, we must re-establish a stable supply flow. I will set the lead time L to 3 (explicit) to account for observed volatility and the likelihood of the longer delivery path. For demand (mu_hat), I am using the last 11 samples (Period 16-26) which capture the high-demand regime (avg ~150). For sigma_hat, I will use the same window to reflect the higher variance in this regime. By using 'explicit' for L and 'recent_N' for demand, I'm forcing the OR backend to acknowledge the increased lead time and higher demand level, potentially triggering a larger order to bypass the 'lost' pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory from Periods 17-19 (486 units) is now 8-10 periods overdue and confirmed as lost/blocked; future planning must treat these as non-existent. Demand regime remains stable at ~150 units/period since Period 16.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical stockout state (on-hand: 0). Recent demand history (P16-P27) shows a stable regime averaging ~150 units/period (mean=149.3). In-transit inventory stands at 706 units; however, 486 of these units (orders from P17, P18, P19) are now 9-11 periods overdue and are confirmed lost or indefinitely blocked based on the 'Carry-over Insights'. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (706) from the base stock. To compensate for the 486 'ghost' units in the pipeline and force an order that addresses the current stockout and the reliable lead time (L=3), I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target base_stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus a safety buffer, but must also neutralize the phantom pipeline units. Target base_stock = (150 * 4) + (buffer) + 486. Calculated target: 600 + 100 + 486 \u2248 1186. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 1186 and a conservative L=3. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to maintain a high service level given the high profit margin and recent demand volatility.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a state of severe supply chain disruption. A large block of inventory (486 units from P17-P19) is now 10-12 periods overdue and is confirmed as lost based on the 'Carry-over Insights' and the fact that a later order (P20) has already arrived. The current in-transit figure of 1209 includes these 486 lost units and the 503 units ordered in Period 28. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock to resume sales, I must manually adjust the lead time/stock parameters to account for the lost pipeline and the stabilized demand regime. The demand average since Period 16 has stabilized at approximately 150 units per period. I will set L to 3 (recent consistent lead time for successful arrivals) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the Period 16-28 regime) to reflect the higher demand level (~150). However, because the backend subtracts 'Pipeline Inventory' (which it sees as 1209 but should be 1209 - 486 = 723), I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force a high enough base stock to trigger an order despite the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. I need to cover (L+1) periods of demand (4 * 150 = 600) plus a safety buffer, while effectively neutralizing the 486 lost units. Base Stock = mu_hat + safety. If I want the engine to order ~150-200 units, I need a target base stock of ~1400 (723 actual pipeline + 600 demand + buffer).

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Verified 486 units from P17-P19 remain 'in-transit' but are confirmed lost; they have not arrived for 10+ periods while newer orders have. Pipeline inventory reconciliation is required to force ordering.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stable at a high level (mean \u2248 150). However, the inventory situation is critical. There is a total 'in-transit' of 1214 units. Based on historical data, 486 units from Periods 17-19 (176+198+112) are now 10+ periods late and are confirmed lost/blocked. Subtracting these from the 1214 in-transit units leaves an effective pipeline of 728 units (primarily from P28: 503 units and P29: 5 units, plus other un-arrived older units). Since the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline), the presence of the 486 'ghost' units in the pipeline prevents the system from ordering enough to meet the new demand level (150/period). To reconcile this, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that effectively offsets these lost units. Target base stock for L=3 is approximately 150 * (3+1) = 600 plus a safety buffer. However, because the backend will subtract the full 1214 units of pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the necessary ordering or maintain stock once arrivals begin. I use L = 3 (recent lead times) and mu_hat = 1200 to ensure the backend recognizes a target inventory level that accounts for the pipeline bloat caused by lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed pipeline reconciliation required. Total 'in-transit' of 1214 units includes 486 units from P17-P19 now 11+ periods late; these are functionally lost and do not contribute to supply.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the environment is characterized by a stable demand regime (averaging ~150 units since Period 16) and a severely fractured supply chain. Total in-transit inventory is reported as 768 units, but 486 units from the Period 17-19 ordering cycle (176 units from P17, 198 units from P18, and 112 units from P19) are now 11-13 periods overdue and confirmed lost. These 'ghost' units inflate the pipeline, preventing the OR backend from ordering necessary stock. To reconcile this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. By setting mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units (150 * 4 + 486 = 1086), I effectively force the backend to bypass the 486-unit pipeline blockage. I am setting L=3 based on the most frequent observed actual lead time and recent volatility to provide a safety buffer. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the higher volatility seen in the current demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1362.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards at Period 16, with an average of approximately 147 units since then (P16-P31). Period 31 demand was slightly lower at 88, but the general level remains elevated compared to the pre-P16 era. Inventory on-hand is currently 310 units, following the arrival of a large batch (503 units) from Period 28. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 768 is misleading. As documented in carry-over insights, 486 units from Periods 17-19 are confirmed lost (now 13+ periods late), and the historical data shows that later orders (like the P20 and P28 orders) arrived while these remained missing. Removing the 486 lost units from the pipeline leaves only 282 valid units in-transit (orders from P29 and P30). Lead time recently showed a 2-period arrival (P28), but history suggests volatility between 1 and 3. I will continue using L=3 to ensure the safety stock covers the high-demand regime and potential delivery delays. By using 'explicit' L=3 and mu_hat based on the recent 14-period average (~147 units), I ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the actual demand and the functional pipeline, overcoming the backend's ignorance of the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Functional pipeline audit - total in-transit (768) minus confirmed lost P17-P19 units (486) equals 282 units actually arriving. L and mu_hat must compensate for the backend's overestimation of available stock.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at an average of approximately 146 units per period. The supply chain remains heavily compromised by the loss of orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 486 units), which have not arrived despite being 14+ periods overdue. The OR engine continuously sees these 486 units in the 'In-transit' bucket (current total is 768), leading it to believe the pipeline is full and preventing new orders. To counteract this, I must artificially inflate the demand parameter (mu_hat) so the logic 'base_stock - pipeline' allows for new purchasing. Given on-hand is 166 and we need to cover demand for (L+1) periods (approx 4 periods), we need a base stock around 600. Current real pipeline is 768 - 486 = 282. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to compensate for the phantom 486 units plus estimated demand. Since the OR backend uses mu_hat as (1+L) * forecast, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that targets a total coverage of approximately 1000 units (486 ghost units + 500-600 buffer) to ensure the engine keeps ordering despite the 'In-transit' blockage.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total 'In-transit' inventory of 768 is misleading; 486 units (from P17-P19) are confirmed lost/blocked. Effective pipeline is only 282 units. Parameters must be adjusted to bypass this 486-unit blockage in the backend's inventory balancing logic.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stabilized at a mean of approximately 145-150 units per period. The supply chain has a significant issue: 486 units from the P17-P19 ordering spree are functionally lost (14-16 periods overdue and bypassed by newer arrivals), but they still count as 'In-transit' in the system view (Total In-transit: 1025). This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders. To force the base-stock logic to ignore these 486 units and order for the actual demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period lead time (L=3, so 4 periods of coverage) as 150 units * 4 = 600 units. To bypass the 486 lost units, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter. Required mu_hat \u2248 (Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory) = 600 + 486 = 1086. Setting mu_hat to 1100 and sigma_hat to 120 (reflecting recent demand volatility) to ensure the system places orders to maintain stock despite the pipeline blockage.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Strategic inflation of mu_hat (1100) implemented to bypass 486 units of confirmed lost 'In-transit' inventory from P17-P19 that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its inventory position calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $437.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a critical logic block: the OR backend's inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) includes 486 units from Periods 17-19 that are 15+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. With On-hand = 0 and In-transit = 1275, the backend calculates a 'real' stock of 1275, but the 'functional' in-transit is only 789 (1275 - 486). To force the backend to place an order in Period 35, mu_hat must be set higher than the perceived inventory position. Average demand since the Period 16 shift is ~146 units. With an estimated Lead Time (L) of 3, the backend targets (L+1) * demand = 584 units. Since 1275 > 584, it will not order. I am setting mu_hat to 1400 (explicitly) to exceed the ghost inventory and ensure a replenishment order is triggered to prevent extended stockouts. L is set to 3 based on recent historical arrival times (P28 arrived in 2 periods, but P16/P20 arrived in 1 and 3 periods respectively; 3 is the safer buffer).

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Ghost inventory of 486 units (P17-P19) persists in 'In-transit', necessitating a mu_hat floor of >1300 to trigger any new orders.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to struggle with 'ghost inventory' \u2013 486 units from periods 17-19 that are over 15 periods late and definitively lost, yet still counted in the 'In-transit' total (1506). To force the OR backend to place new orders, mu_hat must be set high enough so that (mu_hat + safety_stock) exceeds the current perceived pipeline inventory. With 0 on-hand and 1506 in-transit (of which only ~1020 are 'real' pending arrivals from P28 onwards), the goal is to target a base stock level that ignores the lost 486 units. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized at an average of ~150 units. With L=3 (most frequent actual lead time), a 4-period demand window (L+1) requires ~600 units. To bypass the 486-unit blockage while maintaining a healthy stock level for the current demand regime, I am setting mu_hat to 1350. This value, when processed by the backend's capped policy, should trigger an order of approximately 150-250 units, which aligns with recent demand patterns and compensates for the missing units without creating an excessive surplus if some delayed units finally arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Ghost inventory of 486 units (P17-P19) still persists in 'In-transit' totals. Continued strategic inflation of mu_hat (>1300) is required to bypass this blockage and maintain active ordering until the 50-period limit.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted by 486 units of ghost inventory (from Periods 17-19) that appear in 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost. The OR backend uses 'on-hand + in-transit' to calculate orders; currently, it sees 156 (on-hand) + 1256 (in-transit) = 1412 units. Of that in-transit, 486 units are lost and 770 units are valid (mostly from P33 and P35). To trigger a new order and cover demand through Period 40 (given L=3), the base stock must exceed this inflated inventory position. Average demand since P16 is ~145 units. Setting L=3 and L+1 mu_hat = 1500 (approx 4 * 375) explicitly bypasses the 486-unit blockage and ensures the system places an order to bridge the gap before the game ends at Period 50.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost inventory of 486 units (P17-P19) persists; mu_hat inflation >1450 is necessary to maintain pipeline flow against backend inventory calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1433.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable around 140-150 units per period since Period 16. The primary challenge is the 'ghost inventory' of 486 units (from Periods 17-19) which the OR backend treats as live pipeline stock, but which are confirmed lost/blocked (18+ periods late). To force the backend to place new orders, I must maintain an artificially high mu_hat that exceeds (On-hand + 'In-transit'). Current On-hand is 296 and total In-transit is 1205 (including the 486 lost units and recent orders). To ensure replenishment, mu_hat must be set to a level that accounts for the 150/period demand and essentially ignores the 486 ghost units. I will set mu_hat to 1600. L is set to 2 to match the recent reliable arrivals from P34 and P35, which were delivered with lead_time=2.

Carry-over insight: Strategic mu_hat inflation (>1500) remains necessary to bypass 486 units of ghost inventory (P17-P19) and maintain stock levels for the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1204.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, the system shows 221 units on-hand and 1411 units 'in-transit'. However, 486 units (from Periods 17-19) are confirmed lost/ghost inventory, and 257 units from Period 33 are now significantly overdue (6 periods), bringing the likely functional pipeline to 668 units (1411 - 486 - 257). The OR backend calculates orders based on the full 1411 'in-transit' figure. To maintain stock for the final 11 periods, I must continue to strategically inflate 'mu_hat' to bypass this ghost inventory. Demand since Period 30 has softened slightly from the P16-P29 peak (averaging ~121 units/period), but remains higher than early periods. I will set mu_hat at 1650 to ensure the base_stock calculation exceeds the inflated pipeline total, triggering replenishment. L is kept at 3 for a conservative safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Period 33 order (257 units) is now 6 periods late and potentially lost or significantly delayed, adding to the pipeline congestion/ghost inventory alongside the 486 units from P17-P19.

Daily Reward (R_t): $933.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, our on-hand inventory is 359 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1359 is misleading. It contains 486 units from Periods 17-19 and 257 units from Period 33 that are significantly overdue (11+ and 6 periods respectively) and should be considered 'ghost inventory' that won't arrive. The effective pipeline consists only of the Period 37 order (180 units) and the Period 40 order we are about to place. To bypass the backend's internal logic which subtracts the full 1359 in-transit units from the base stock, I must set mu_hat to a value that accounts for the ghost inventory plus desired coverage. Current demand has softened slightly in the last 4 periods (avg ~77 vs previous 150), but to ensure the backend places an order and maintains stock for the final 10 periods, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 2100. This value is calculated as: (Desired Base Stock for L=2) + (Ghost Inventory 486 + 257) \u2248 (150 * 3 + 486 + 257) \u2248 1200, but I am buffering higher to 2100 to force continuous replenishment against the massive 'In-transit' blockage. L is set to explicit 2 to reflect recent successful arrivals from P34, P35, and P38.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Effective pipeline remains blocked by 743 units of ghost inventory (P17-P19: 486; P33: 257). Demand has softened to ~77 units/period over the last 4 periods, but mu_hat must remain highly inflated (>2000) to trigger orders against the false in-transit total.

Daily Reward (R_t): $987.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory position is currently distorted by 'ghost inventory'. Specifically, 486 units from periods 17-19 and 257 units from period 33 (total 743 units) are over 7 periods late and highly likely lost or blocked, yet they remain in the 'In-transit' total of 1661 units. The OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock to calculate orders. With on-hand at 438 and reported in-transit at 1661, the backend sees an inventory position of 2099 units. Realistically, only approximately 918 units (1661 - 743) are likely to arrive. Additionally, demand has softened from ~150 to ~75 over the last 5 periods. To ensure a new order is placed in Period 41 to cover late-game demand (periods 42-45), I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the backend's perceived 2099 units. Setting mu_hat to 2600 (approx 2100 + 500 for safety) forces the backend to recognize a deficit and order, despite the ghost units. I will use L=3 to account for historical lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Ghost inventory total updated to 743 units (P17-P19: 486; P33: 257). Demand has shifted down significantly to an average of ~77 units over the last 5 periods (P36-P40). Strategic mu_hat inflation >2200 is required to bypass ghost stock.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we are dealing with a significant 'ghost inventory' issue where the OR backend's inventory balancing logic is blocked by 743 units of confirmed lost or severely delayed stock (486 from P17-P19, and now 257 from P33/P34 which are significantly overdue). The current 'In-transit' total visible to the backend is 2200 units, but a large portion of this is non-functional. Recent demand (P36-P41) has softened to an average of ~85 units/period compared to the previous high of 150. However, because the game ends at Period 50 and the lead time remains volatile (recently 1-2 periods, but historically up to 3), we must maintain an inflated mu_hat to ensure the backend continues to place orders despite the false high pipeline. To bypass the 2200 'In-transit' units and the 330 on-hand units, the target base stock (mu_hat) must exceed ~2530 to trigger any order. I will use 'explicit' for all parameters to force this override. A mu_hat of 2600 provides a safety margin for the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Ghost inventory total remains at 743 units (P17-P19: 486; P33/P34: 257). Demand has softened to ~85 units/period recently. Strategic mu_hat inflation >2550 is required to bypass the 2200 units currently clogging the backend's 'In-transit' logic.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant inventory discrepancy. The reported In-transit inventory is 2517 units, but a large portion of this is composed of 'ghost inventory' from historical supplier failures (P17-P19: 486 units; P33/34: 257 units) and more recent erratic arrivals. Specifically, orders from P41 (539 units) and P42 (317 units) are still in their expected lead time window. However, current on-hand inventory is 235 units, and demand has moderated recently to an average of ~90 units over the last 7 periods (P36-P42). To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the massive (and largely false) pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat at a level that exceeds the sum of on-hand inventory and the in-transit units the backend thinks are available. With 235 on-hand and 2517 in-transit, the backend sees a total of 2752 units. To trigger any order for the remaining 8 periods, mu_hat must be set significantly higher than 2752. I am setting mu_hat to 3100 to force replenishment and maintain stock through Period 50, while keeping L at 3 periods for safety.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost inventory/pipeline blockage persists. Total reported In-transit of 2517 includes confirmed lost units (743 units) and significantly delayed older orders. Demand has stabilized at ~90 units/period. Strategic inflation of mu_hat >2800 is required to bypass the backend's inventory balancing logic.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant 'ghost inventory' issues where orders from Period 17-19 (486 units) and Period 33 (257 units) are functionally lost but remain in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation. As of Period 44, the reported 'In-transit' is 2456 units, but 743 of these are confirmed ghost units. Additionally, recent orders from P41 (539 units) and P42 (317 units) are still within a plausible lead-time window. Current on-hand is 617, which is healthy for the softened demand (avg ~90 units/period over the last 8 periods). However, to prevent the backend from stopping orders due to the inflated 2456-unit pipeline, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. Since we are nearing the end of the game (Period 44 of 50), I will target a safety stock level that ensures coverage for the remaining 6 periods while accounting for the ~743 units of ghost stock. A mu_hat of 3200 is set to bypass the backend's inventory balancing logic and ensure the pipeline remains active for the final stretch.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Ghost inventory (functionally lost) remains at 743 units (P17-P19: 486; P33: 257). Strategic mu_hat inflation >3000 is required to bypass the backend's 'In-transit' logic and maintain inventory flow for the remaining 6 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 50. The inventory situation is critical due to 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. The backend reports an In-transit total of 2168 units. However, based on consistent tracking, at least 743 units are functionally lost (P17-P19: 486 units; P33: 257 units). There is also a significant delay in the P34-P35 orders. Current on-hand inventory is 1094 units, which is healthy for the remaining 5 periods, but with a reported 2168 units in-transit, the OR backend's inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is ~3262 units. To prevent the backend from stopping orders entirely while we still have 5 periods left, I must maintain a highly inflated mu_hat. Recent demand has stabilized at a lower level (~80-90 units/period), but my parameter setting is driven by the need to bypass the 'In-transit' accounting error. I will set mu_hat to 3500 via the explicit method to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the false pipeline total, maintaining a safety buffer for the final stretch. L is set to 3 to reflect the current sustained lead time delay.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Ghost inventory (lost but appearing in In-transit) persists at 743 units minimum (P17-P19 & P33). Strategic mu_hat inflation >3500 is required to maintain order flow against the backend's inflated inventory position as we enter the final 5 periods of the game.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 of 50. The game is nearing its conclusion. Current inventory status is high with 1751 units on-hand and 1766 units in-transit. Demand has significantly cooled in the final stretch, averaging ~72 units over the last 5 periods (P41-P45), down from previous 'high' regimes. Our primary objective is to maximize reward (Profit - Holding Cost). Given the high on-hand inventory (covering approximately 24 periods of current demand) and the limited remaining duration (5 periods), we must stop ordering to avoid excessive holding costs. The backend's 'In-transit' figure is still inflated by 'ghost inventory' (743 units confirmed lost from P17-P19 and P33), but even excluding those, there are over 1000 units of legitimate inventory arriving soon. To prevent the OR backend from placing any further orders, I will set mu_hat to a very low value (reflecting the actual current demand regime) and use the 'default' L, allowing the high existing inventory to satisfy all remaining demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41: Average demand decreased from ~150 to ~72 (-52%) for the final game phase. Inventory on-hand (1751) is sufficient for all remaining periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-751.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 1701 units. Recent demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 74 units/period over the last 6 periods (P41-P46). Given there are only 4 periods remaining (47, 48, 49, 50), the total projected demand for the rest of the game is approximately 300 units (75 * 4). With 1701 units on hand, we are significantly overstocked. Any further orders will only increase holding costs without contributing to profit, as current stock is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method based on the current lower demand regime (N=6), and rely on the OR backend's inventory balancing to prevent any further orders (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)). Since on-hand + in-transit is > 3000 units, the system will naturally order 0 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-341.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 48 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 1633 units. Historical demand since Period 41 has significantly decreased, averaging approximately 73 units per period (P41-P47: 108, 95, 74, 62, 55, 50, 68). With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), the total expected demand is roughly 220 units. Since current on-hand inventory (1633) far exceeds any possible demand and even covers the high-demand regime levels (~150/period), no further orders are required. The strategy for the remaining periods is to maximize profit by minimizing further holding costs and avoiding new arrivals. Lead time and sigma parameters are kept at default as the high inventory levels render the specific base-stock calculation moot\u2014the priority is preventing the OR engine from triggering new orders despite the 'ghost' in-transit inventory remaining in the system.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period of the game. The current on-hand inventory is 1551 units. Over the last 8 periods (since Period 41), demand has significantly softened, averaging approximately 74 units per period. With only one period of demand remaining after this decision (Period 50), the current stock is more than sufficient to cover any foreseeable demand without further ordering. The ghost inventory (743 units) and the large actual in-transit volume (1766 units) are no longer relevant to the decision, as the primary goal is now to minimize holding costs by not adding any further inventory to the system. Setting mu_hat and ordering to zero ensures we maximize profit from remaining sales while minimizing the holding cost penalty for the final period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-91.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision phase of the game. The current on-hand inventory is 1478 units, which is significantly higher than any conceivable demand for the remaining execution phase of this period. Since the goal is to maximize total reward (Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory), and we have more than enough stock to satisfy the final period's demand, any additional order would only increase holding costs without increasing sales. Recent demand (P46-P49) has averaged approximately 68 units per period, while our on-hand inventory is nearly 22 times that amount. Therefore, I am setting all parameters to essentially zero out any further ordering.
