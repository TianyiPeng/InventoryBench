Therefore, I will likely face stockouts in Period 2 and Period 3 as well.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Historical demand samples (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) show an average of approximately 107 units. Period 1 actual demand was 107, which aligns with this mean. \n4. **OR Recommendation Evaluation**: The OR recommendation is 141 units. The OR base-stock calculation aims to cover demand during the lead time (L=2) plus the review period (1), totaling 3 periods (3 * 107 = 321 units base stock). With 145 in-transit, 321 - 145 = 176 units (raw). The capped recommendation of 141 is safer given the volatility.\n5. **Adjustment**: I will follow the OR recommendation of 141 units.

OR Recommendation: OR suggests 0 units because the pipeline (410) far exceeds the base stock level calculated for a 2-period lead time. \n5. Strategy: Even if the lead time is 3 periods (L=3), we need to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. 4 * 117 = 468 units. With 410 in transit, we are slightly under-covered for the long term. However, since the first arrival hasn't occurred yet and we are stocking out (sold=0 for 3 periods), I will place a moderate order to bridge the gap and account for the longer-than-promised lead time, while staying cautious of the high pipeline.

Current in-transit is 241 (consisting of the Period 2 order of 141 and the Period 4 order of 100). Total pipeline + on-hand = 418 units. 3. Demand outlook: The 5-period average is approx 107 units. Total inventory covers nearly 4 periods of demand. 4. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because the base-stock level is satisfied by the current heavy pipeline.

The average realized demand over the last 5 periods is 113.8 units/period. The current demand trend is somewhat stable despite a dip in Period 5's snapshot data; the conclude message shows 125 units sold in P5.\n3. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 52. Pipeline is 241 (P2: 141, P4: 100). \n4. Decision Logic: The OR recommendation of 102 units assumes a lead time of 2. If P2 is lost, our pipeline is effectively only 100 units (P4). If P2 arrives, we will be overstocked. However, with a profit of $19 vs. holding cost of $1, the cost of a stockout is much higher than the cost of holding inventory.

Demand Analysis: Demand has spiked significantly in P16 (178) and P17 (222), possibly indicating a holiday or event shift. The current empirical mean used by the OR is likely too low to cover this new regime. 4. Inventory Position: Currently 0 units on-hand. We expect 50 units (P15) to arrive for Period 18 demand. With demand trending at 150-200, we are facing a massive stockout. 5. Action: OR recommends 0 because it thinks the pipeline (443) is huge.

Additionally, the Period 15 order (50 units) is now 2 periods overdue relative to the observed 3-period lead time, suggesting it is also lost. This brings the effective lost inventory to 293 units.

The last four periods (P16-P19) show demands of 178, 222, 146, 155 (Average: 175). 4. **Strategy**: With 0 on-hand and an expected arrival of 150 units in Period 20 (P17 order), we face a stockout risk if demand remains at 200.

P15 (50) is also likely lost (5 periods elapsed). Total lost pipeline = 293 units. 3. **Effective Inventory**: Total In-transit is 993. Effective In-transit = 993 - 293 (lost) = 700 units. On-hand is 0. 4. **Demand Analysis**: A regime shift occurred at P16, with demand averaging ~160-170 units (P16: 178, P17: 222, P18: 146, P19: 155, P21: 172). 5. **Inventory Strategy**: The effective pipeline (700 units) covers roughly 4 periods of demand at the current high rate (~170/period). Since the lead time is volatile and arrivals are currently stalled (zero arrivals for 4 periods despite high in-transit), the OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically correct based on the raw in-transit number. However, given the zero on-hand status and the stockout since P18, we must ensure the pipeline is healthy. 700 units in 'live' pipeline is a substantial amount if they arrive soon. If they don't, the machine is failing regardless.

To ensure availability for upcoming periods and bridge the current stockout, I must place an order. Based on a 2-period lead time and average demand of ~86, the target base stock (\u03bc * (L+1) + safety) should be approximately 300-350 units.
