There is a noticeable downward trend from Period 1 (130) to Period 5 (71), which may indicate a regime shift or a post-event cooldown. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 will arrive in P3 (visible in P4 start). d) Inventory & Pipeline: Currently 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. e) Decision Logic: To satisfy demand for the next 3 periods (L+1 = 2+1 = 3), I need to cover Periods 1, 2, and 3. Average demand is ~107, so 107 * 3 = 321. Since initial stock is 0 and there are no in-transit units, I will place a substantial order to establish inventory and account for the 2-period lead time.

The current situation is a stock-out (on-hand: 0) following a demand spike of 181 in P27. Analyzing the pipeline: In-transit is 1500 units. However, identifying lost shipments is crucial. Orders from P18 (350), P19 (350), P24 (200), and P25 (150) are overdue. P18 and P19 are confirmed lost (9+ periods elapsed). P24 and P25 are highly suspect (3-4 periods elapsed with no arrival, while the max observed LT is 3). Total confirmed/likely lost = 350+350+200+150 = 1050 units. Effective pipeline is 1500 - 1050 = 450 units (P27: 150, P28: previous orders). Given the high demand and the high risk of shipment loss (over 50% of recent orders lost), a significant order is required to maintain service levels. Targeting (L+1) exposure + safety stock: (3+1) * 160 + 200 = 840 units. Effective pipeline (450) leaves a deficit of 390 units. I will order 350 to hedge against the stock-out while managing holding cost risk if the unreliable supplier delivers multiple batches simultaneously.",

The current on-hand inventory is 427 units, which covers more than 4 periods of this new demand regime. Regarding the pipeline, total in-transit is 2600. Based on previous insights, 2100 units from older periods (P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33) are confirmed or likely lost. This leaves an effective in-transit balance of 500 units (from P37, P40). Although supplier reliability is poor, the current on-hand stock is significantly high relative to the softened demand (holding costs are $1/unit while profit is $19). To avoid excessive holding costs in the final 10 periods while accounting for a 2-period lead time and potential losses, I will maintain a lean ordering strategy. Since on-hand inventory alone covers nearly half the remaining game time, I will place a small order of 50 units to maintain a consistent inflow without overstocking.",

Supplier reliability is notoriously poor, with a historical loss rate of approximately 50%+ of order volume; specifically, orders from P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, and P33 (totaling 2,100 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost. The current In-transit balance is 2,650 units, but 2,100 of these are the aforementioned lost orders, leaving an effective pipeline of 550 units (orders from P40: 50, P41: 50, plus any residual late-arriving non-lost stock). On-hand inventory is 343 units, which provides roughly 4 periods of coverage at the current demand rate (~88/period). Given the 2-period promised lead time and 1-3 period actual lead time, current inventory and effective pipeline (343 + 550 = 893) are sufficient to cover expected demand (~440 units) over the next 5 periods with a significant safety buffer.

Additionally, the order from P37 (150 units) is now 6 periods overdue and should be considered lost, bringing the cumulative lost total to 2250 units. The effective pipeline consists of orders from P40, P41, and P42 (50 units each), totaling 150 units. Therefore, the effective total inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) is 277 + 150 = 427 units. With a target stock level of approximately 3-4 periods of demand (approx 350 units) to account for the erratic lead time (1-3 periods), the current position of 427 units is sufficient.

The current demand mean (P36-P43) is approximately 82 units. Supplier reliability remains the primary challenge; orders arriving usually take 1-3 periods, but many orders (totaling 2250 units: P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37) are confirmed or likely lost. Current In-transit is 2700 units, but after subtracting the identified lost units (2250), the effective pipeline is only 450 units (Orders from P38-P43 have partially arrived or are still within the typical 3-period delivery window). On-hand inventory is 266. With an expected demand of ~85 units/period and a 3-period max lead time plus the decision period (L+1=4), I need ~340 units to cover the loop. Total current effective position (266 on-hand + 450 pipeline) = 716 units. This is well above the requirement for the current regime. However, given the extreme historical unreliability (50%+ loss rate), I will maintain a small safety order of 50 units to offset potential future losses without incurring excessive holding costs, as we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 50).",
