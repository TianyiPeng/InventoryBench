Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical context beyond the provided 5-period demand samples (130, 122, 106, 108, 71). The mean of these samples is 107.4, but the most recent period (Period 5) showed a significant drop to 71. Given the promised lead time (L=2), the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture the full recent distribution for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as we don't have enough evidence yet to confirm a sustained regime shift to the lower demand seen in Period 5. The L parameter will remain at the promised default of 2.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 145 units were ordered. Since the promised lead time is 2, we should not have expected any arrivals yet (arrived=0 is normal). The demand in Period 1 was 107, but because we started with 0 on-hand inventory, sales were 0. We have 145 units in-transit. Based on the historical demand (130, 122, 106, 108, 71), the mean is approximately 107. Since we are only at Period 2, there is not yet enough evidence of a regime shift or a lead time discrepancy. I will use the default settings which utilize all historical data to estimate the base stock, ensuring the pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is sufficient to cover (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. For the first two periods, we had no on-hand inventory to satisfy demand (107 in P1, 149 in P2), resulting in lost sales. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (145 units) are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 (this period). Currently, we have 286 units in transit (145 from P1, 141 from P2). The available demand samples for chips(Regular) are [130, 122, 106, 108, 71] (pre-game) and [107, 149] (actuals), averaging ~120. I will use the default lead time (L=2) as there is no evidence yet of deviation. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma to capture the most relevant recent variability while the pipeline refills.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The demand history (107, 149, 96, 130, 122, 106, 108, 71) shows an average demand of approximately 111 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (145 units) should arrive during the current period (Period 4) and be visible in Period 5. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 404 units (from P1, P2, and P3). Because we have zero stock and have missed sales in P1-P3, the priority is to stabilize the pipeline. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture recent levels while tracking the lead time closely. Since no arrivals have occurred yet, L remains at the default (2). Choosing N=3 for demand and volatility to stay responsive to the latest trends.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1577.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival of orders from P1 (lead time 3) and P3 (lead time 1), while the P2 order remains outstanding. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance (1 and 3 periods). The demand over the first 4 periods (107, 149, 96, 92) averages 111 units. The sample data provided in the prompt (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) suggests a declining trend or a different distribution; I will prioritize the historical Demand Data provided in the prompt for \u03bc\u0302. Period 5 demand is 71, showing a significant drop compared to the previous average. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture this recent cooling while maintaining enough history to avoid overreacting to one low data point. For Lead Time, I'll use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variances (1 and 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2329.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we have 46 units on hand and 320 in-transit. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), and Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). Period 2's order (141 units) and Period 4's order (28 units) are still in-transit. Given the promised lead time is 2, the average observed lead time is 2 ((3+1)/2). Inventory dropped significantly in Period 5 because no orders arrived. Demand has been relatively stable: 107, 149, 96, 92, 125 (Mean \u2248 114). I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time to reflect the observed variance and 'recent_N' (N=5) for demand and sigma to capture the current regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering (L+1) periods of demand while accounting for the high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $874.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout in Period 6 where 101 demand was met with only 46 units. Since we are in the early stages (Period 7), demand analysis shows a relatively stable mean. Sampling the 6 historical demand points (107, 149, 96, 92, 125, 101) yields an average of ~112 units per period. Lead time has shown variance: P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), and P3 arrived in P4 (L=1). The P2 order (141 units) and P4 order (28 units) are still in-transit, along with P5 (151) and P6 (153). The total in-transit is 473. Given the stockout and the inconsistency in early lead times (Promised=2), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture recent trends and keep L at default (2) to allow the OR backend to stabilize while monitoring if the P2 order is actually lost or just delayed. mu_hat will be estimated at (1+L)*mean.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean demand of approximately 110.75 units across 8 periods (including samples). Lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 in 1, and Period 4 in 3. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 445 units in-transit (orders from Period 2, 5, and 6). Demand has slightly softened recently (P5-P7 avg: 111 vs P1-P4 avg: 111), suggesting no major regime shift yet. However, we are currently OOS due to lead-time variability. I will use the promised lead time of 2 as the baseline L (default), use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand mean, and default for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock against the observed lead-time volatility and stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1569.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized lower than the initial historical samples. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is approximately 102 units, compared to the initial samples which averaged 107.4. More critically, the actual lead time is consistently deviating from the promised 2 periods. We have observed lead times of 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods. Excluding the outlier of 1 period, the mode and most recent lead times are 3 periods. This indicates a systemic delay or higher variance in logistics. I will set L to 3 to reflect this reality, which increases the protection interval (L+1) to 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) captures the current demand mean of ~102 better than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consistently observed as 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, P8) despite promised 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1235.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals (P4, P7, P8) consistently show a lead time of 3 periods (with one outlier in P4). Order arrivals are lagging, leading to a stockout in Period 9 and zero on-hand inventory entering Period 10. To address this, I am setting L to 3 explicitly. Historical demand over the last 9 periods has been relatively stable, averaging 104.5 units per period. I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this baseline volatility while accounting for the extended L+1 (4-period) commitment window. Current pipeline inventory is 394 (sum of orders from P2, P6, P10), which the OR engine will subtract from the calculated base stock. By adjusting L to 3, the backend will target a base stock covering four periods of demand (P10, P11, P12, P13).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 490 units in-transit. Historical data confirms the actual lead time (L) is consistently 3 periods (P1 arrived P4, P4 arrived P7, P5 arrived P8), despite the promised 2 periods. The order from Period 6 (153 units) is currently 5 periods out (overdue), suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. Subsequent orders from Period 9 (100 units) and Period 10 (96 units) are still within the observed 3-period lead time window. Current demand is volatile but averages around 108 units (excluding the early-period outliers). To compensate for the lead time extension and the missing Period 6 shipment, I am setting L explicitly to 3. I will use the last 5 periods of demand to capture the recent mean of ~101 units, ensuring the (L+1) planning horizon (4 periods) is covered. mu_hat will be set via recent_N (N=5) to reflect this mean, and sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to account for recent demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Shipment from Period 6 (153 units) is overdue by 2 periods (now at T+5), possibly lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for chips(Regular) averages approximately 107 units per period based on all available samples. Historical lead times have been erratic: 3, 1, 3, 3 periods. The carry-over insights confirm that the actual lead time is likely 3 periods (not the promised 2). Crucially, the order from Period 6 (153 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods since ordering) and is likely lost. If we assume it is lost, our 'effective' pipeline is reduced. In-transit is reported at 490 units; however, 153 units (P6) are likely lost, leaving 337 units (P9: 100, P10: 96, P12: yet to be determined). Since we are currently stock-out and demand is stable around 107 per period, we must set parameters that allow the OR backend to order sufficiently. Setting L=3 (explicit) aligns with observed reality. For mu_hat, we use the long-term mean (~107) across the review + lead time window (1 + 3 = 4 periods), totaling 428. For sigma_hat, we use the standard deviation (~22.5) scaled by sqrt(1+L), resulting in approximately 45.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Shipment from Period 6 (153 units) remains unarrived at T+6, strengthening the conclusion that it is lost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data shows a fairly stable demand environment with an average demand of approximately 107 units per period. The observed lead time has consistently been 3 periods (appearing in Period 4, 7, 8, 12), contradicting the promised 2 periods. Currently, one shipment from Period 6 (153 units) is significantly overdue (T+7) and is likely lost. The system's 'In-transit' count includes this lost shipment (307 units = P6's 153 + P12's 13 + P13's projected order). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering because of this phantom inventory, I will set 'L' to an explicit value of 3 and provide an explicit 'mu_hat' that covers (L+1) periods of demand, while effectively ignoring the lost 153 units in the pipeline calculation. Given current on-hand of 92 and excluding the lost 153 units, my actual pipeline is much lower. I will set mu_hat based on an average demand per period of ~110 units over (3+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Shipment from Period 6 (153 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed vs. expected 3). Pipeline inventory should be adjusted manually.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) over periods 9-13 shows a mean of approximately 100.4 units (76, 136, 123, 104, 63). Period 13 shows a lower demand of 63, but given the historical range (71-149), I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture this variability. The actual lead time \u2018L\u2019 has stabilized at approximately 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, P8, P9, and P12), which is longer than the promised 2 periods. The shipment from Period 6 (153 units) is confirmed lost, leaving 'In-transit' physically at 411 units (orders from P12: 13, P13: 104, and the ghost P6: 153 is still in the system count but lost). By setting L to 'explicit' value 3, I force the OR engine to account for the longer turnaround. mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current demand environment (~100 units/period). sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time is consistently 3 periods based on historical arrivals (P4, P7, P8, P12). The promised lead time is 2, so I set L=3 to match reality. Demand has been relatively stable with a slight downward trend in the last few periods (averaging ~93 units over P12-P14 vs the overall mean of ~108). In-transit inventory is listed as 474 units. However, we have confirmed that the Period 6 order of 153 units is lost. The OR backend's internal pipeline calculation includes this lost shipment, which will cause it to under-order. To compensate, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock (assuming L=3, so 4 periods of demand) using the recent mean of ~100. Base stock calculation: (1+L)*mu + z*sigma*sqrt(1+L). With mu=100 and sigma~25, target is approx 500-530. However, the backend sees 474 in-transit. To force an order that accounts for the 153-unit deficit, I must inflate mu_hat. Setting mu_hat to 650 ensures the base stock (approx 650 + safety) significantly exceeds the 474 'phantom' pipeline, triggering a necessary replenishment to cover the current stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $247.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains relatively stable, with an average of approximately 105 units per period over the last 10 periods. The actual lead time has consistently trended towards 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, P8, P9, P12, and P15). We have a significant 'In-transit' quantity of 672 units, but this includes a shipment of 153 units from Period 6 which is confirmed lost as per carry-over insights. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 519 units (672 - 153). Since we are currently at zero on-hand inventory and have faced stockouts in P14 and P15 due to the mismatch between lead time and order timing, I am setting L to 3 to reflect the actual delay. For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N=10 to capture the current demand level (~105/period * (1+3) = 420). Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to account for recent volatility. The OR backend will subtract the (inflated) pipeline of 672 from the base stock; by setting L=3, the target base stock will be higher, helping to compensate for the lost units still residing in the backend's pipeline calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1976.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) shows a notable increase, with Period 16 reaching 178 units compared to the long-term average of ~110. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 0). We are tracking a total in-transit of 568 units, which includes orders from Period 14 (63 units), Period 15 (211 units), Period 16 (0 units), and the phantom 'lost' order from Period 6 (153 units). Previous insights confirm the Period 6 order is lost; since the backend OR engine doesn't know this, I must adjust parameters to compensate for this 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Lead times are consistently observed at 3 periods (not the promised 2). To ensure we meet the rising demand and recover from stockouts, I am setting L=3 and using mu_hat to cover (1+3) periods. I will use a recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the recent spike (averaging ~107 over last 5, but weighted higher by the recent 178), and I'll use explicit mu_hat to manually inflate the target stock level to account for the 153-unit 'void' in the pipeline left by the lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected: Period 16 demand (178) is 60% above the historical mean.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Period 16: 178, Period 17: 222) confirms a significant upward regime shift compared to the long-term historical mean (~100-110). I am adopting the last 2 periods as the new demand baseline to ensure the base stock levels react quickly to this higher volume. Regarding lead time, historical 'conclude' messages (P4, P7, P8, P12, P15, P16, P17) consistently show an actual lead time of 3 periods, despite the promised 2. I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the inventory policy accounts for the (L+1) exposure window. Additionally, a shipment of 153 units from Period 6 is confirmed lost; while the OR backend can't manually subtract this, increasing the mu_hat and keeping L at the actual longer lead time will trigger larger orders to compensate for the inventory deficit and meet the higher service level required by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-17 mean increased to 200 (+80% vs previous baseline). Lead time remains stable at 3 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. The demand values for the last three periods (P16: 178, P17: 222, P18: 146) result in an average of approximately 182, which is significantly higher (+65%) than the earlier baseline (approx 110). I am selecting recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volume and increased volatility. Regarding lead time, while the promised L=2, historical arrivals (P4, P7, P8, P9, P12, P15, P16, P17) consistently show an actual lead time of 3 periods (with rare exceptions). I am setting L explicitly to 3 to reflect this reality and ensure the OR backend builds enough safety stock to cover the actual lead time plus the current period (L+1=4 periods). Additionally, the order from Period 6 (153 units) is confirmed lost, but since the OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit), and the system still reports 998 units in transit (which includes the lost P6 order and recent large orders from P15, P17, P18), the inventory position is high. By setting L=3, I ensure the target stock level accounts for the delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 16-18 average demand is ~182 (+65% vs previous baseline).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is approximately 175 units (178, 222, 146, 155), which is significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~110. The actual lead time is consistently 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 998 units in-transit. These in-transit units include orders from P15 (211), P17 (224), P18 (269), P20 (0), and the lost order from P6 (153). Accounting for the lost P6 order, the 'true' pipeline is 845 units. The OR backend uses the formula base_stock = (1+L) * mu_hat + z * sigma_hat * sqrt(1+L). With L=3 and mu_hat based on the recent 4 periods, we target a base stock covering four periods of the current high demand (~700 units). Since the valid pipeline (845) exceeds the necessary base stock, the system will likely place a zero or minimal order this period, which is appropriate given the massive volume currently in transit scheduled to arrive in P18, P20, and P21.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16, with the average demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) being approximately 159.8 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~110. Although P20 showed a dip (98), the preceding periods (178, 222, 146, 155) indicate a sustained higher level. Inventory is currently critical: on-hand is 0 and we have experienced multiple stockouts. The lead time is consistently 3 periods based on historical concludes (P12, P15, P16, P17 all showed L=3). We have 998 units in-transit, which includes orders from P15 (211), P17 (224), P18 (269), and the lost P6 shipment (153). Adjusting for the lost P6 order, true pipeline inventory is 845 units. Given L=3, the orders from P15 and P17 should arrive in P18/19 and P20/21, but based on the status, they are still in transit. I will use 'explicit' for L=3 and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the new regime while smoothing the recent P20 dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains elevated: Period 16-20 mean is ~160 (+45% vs original baseline). Stockouts persist due to lead time lag and recent demand volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted to a higher regime starting around Period 16. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is approximately 161.8, compared to the original baseline of ~100. Stockouts have been persistent due to this demand spike and a consistent lead time of 3 periods (which is longer than the promised 2). In Period 22, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 998 units in-transit. These in-transit units represent the orders from Period 15 (211), Period 17 (224), and Period 18 (269), plus older lost/unaccounted units. Note: The 153 units from Period 6 are confirmed lost. Total reliable pipeline = 211 (P15) + 224 (P17) + 269 (P18) = 704 units. The OR backend will see 'In-transit: 998', but since 153 units are lost and others are delayed, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 and an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the new mean (162) over the L+1 window to ensure sufficient ordering. mu_hat = (1+3) * 162 = 648. Since the system calculates 'base_stock - pipeline', and there are 998 visible units in transit, the backend might not order. However, I want to ensure the mean is high enough to trigger a replenishment as the old orders arrive and clear the pipeline. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~162 units/period (Periods 16-21). Lead time remains consistently 3 periods.

The lead time is consistently 3 periods rather than the promised 2. Stockouts have been persistent (Periods 18-22) because large orders placed in Period 17 (224 units), Period 18 (269 units), and Period 15 (211 units) are still in the pipeline. We specifically expect the Period 15 order (211 units) to conclude in Period 23 (visible in P24), and subsequent large orders to follow. With 998 units in-transit (excluding the confirmed lost P6 order), our pipeline is extremely full (covering ~6 periods of the new demand regime). I will set L=3 via 'explicit' to align with the observed history, and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=7 to capture the demand shift starting at P16) to ensure the target base stock reflects the higher demand level. No additional orders are likely needed this period given the massive pipeline inventory relative to the 162/period demand.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a prolonged stockout state (on-hand: 0) due to a lead time lag and a sustained demand regime shift. Since Period 16, demand has stabilized at a higher level (mean ~162 units/period) compared to the initial baseline. The actual lead time has consistently been 3 periods, not the promised 2. A major shipment from Period 6 (153 units) was confirmed lost, affecting pipeline calculations. Large orders placed in Periods 15 (211), 17 (224), and 18 (269) are overdue or in-transit. Applying explicit methods for L and mu_hat to account for the actual L=3 and the recent higher demand regime (N=8, covering the shift since P16). This ensures the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand over the true lead time plus the review period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe stockout crisis. Since Period 18, zero units have arrived because shipments from Periods 15, 17, and 18 are significantly delayed. Specifically, the Period 15 order (211 units) is now at T+10 (expected 3), the Period 17 order (224 units) is at T+8, and the Period 18 order (269 units) is at T+7. Given that the Period 6 order was previously lost, there is a high probability that some or all of these 'in-transit' units are lost. Total in-transit is 998, but the shelf remains empty. Demand has stabilized at a higher regime (~155 units/period) since Period 16. I will set lead time to 4 (explicit) to account for the current systemic delays. For demand, I will use the last 9 periods (P16-P24) to capture the elevated average of ~156 units. The OR backend will see 998 in-transit; if those orders are indeed lost, the OR will under-order. However, without definitive 'lost' confirmation for the newer orders, I must use recent averages and an extended lead time to force the base stock upward.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment delays or losses identified: Orders from P15, P17, and P18 (700+ units total) have not arrived after 7-10 periods, well beyond the actual observed lead time of 3. Demand regime since P16 remains stable at ~155 units/period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently experiencing a critical failure. On-hand inventory is at 0, and despite an 'In-transit' balance of 998 units, no shipments have arrived since Period 17 (9 periods ago). Historically, lead time evolved from 2 to 3 periods, but several orders are now confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed: P6 (153), P15 (211), P17 (224), and P18 (269) total 857 units that are well beyond the 3-period lead time. Subtracting these from the 998 in-transit units reveals an effective pipeline of only 141 units (potentially from an unlogged order or residual calculation). The demand regime shifted around Period 16; the average demand from P16 to P25 is approximately 152 units per period. Considering the stockouts, this is likely an underestimate of true demand. To recover from this state, I will set L to 3 (the last stable observed lead time) and use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the current demand regime (152 units/period over 1+3 periods = 608 units) plus a buffer for the lost pipeline. Since the backend subtracts pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger new orders despite the 'ghost' in-transit units. Setting mu_hat to 1200 effectively signals that the current 998 units in transit are insufficient/unreliable to cover the lead-time demand.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: No arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (P18-P26). Pipeline inventory of 998 units is likely 85%+ lost/obsolete shipments. Demand regime remains stable at ~152 units/period (P16-P25) despite persistent stockouts.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain situation is critical. No shipments have arrived since Period 17 (10 consecutive periods without arrivals), confirming a massive supply chain failure. The current in-transit inventory of 1318 units includes shipments from Period 15 (211 units), Period 17 (224 units), Period 18 (269 units), and Period 26 (320 units). Based on history, the shipments from P15, P17, and P18 (704 units) are severely overdue (9-12 periods elapsed vs. observed L=3) and are functionally lost. This causes a massive phantom pipeline inventory that prevents the OR backend from ordering. Since the start of the regime shift in Period 16, demand has averaged ~152 units/period. To trigger replenishment despite the phantom inventory, I will set L=4 (slightly higher than the previous observed lead time of 3 to account for current delays) and use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I am setting mu_hat = (1+4) * 152 = 760 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+4) * 35 = 78. However, because the system sees 1318 units 'in-transit', even a high mu_hat may not trigger an order. I am placing a large order in the previous period (P26) and will continue to hold parameters high to force the OR engine to overcome the phantom pipeline bias once those units are aged out or the cap allows for it.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse continues: No arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (P18-P27). Cumulative in-transit units from P15, P17, and P18 (704 units total) are definitively lost/obsolete. This phantom inventory is blocking new orders. New demand regime since P16 is stabilized at ~152 units/period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely compromised with no units arriving for 11 consecutive periods (P18-P28). The pipeline inventory of 1318 units is largely composed of lost shipments from P15, P17, and P18 (totaling 704 units), which have now exceeded their expected lead time by over 10 periods. The OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline from the base stock calculation; because the pipeline (1318) is far greater than the expected demand over the lead period, the backend will not place new orders unless L and mu_hat are adjusted to override this phantom inventory. To force an order despite the 1318 phantom units, I am setting L to 10 (explicit) and mu_hat to 1600 (explicit). This ensures the base stock (approx. (1+L)*demand) exceeds the pipeline, triggering a purchase. Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 152 units/period since Period 16. Setting L=10 and mu_hat=1600 targets a base stock that can bypass the pipeline blockage and account for the extreme supply uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse reaching critical threshold: 11 periods without arrivals (P18-P28). 100% of pipeline inventory from before P26 (998 units) is confirmed lost/obsolete. Demand remains stable at ~152 units/period (P16-P27). External intervention via explicit parameter inflation is now required to bypass OR backend logic which perceives the lost units as available supply.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3920.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, a major breakthrough occurred: an arrival of 320 units from the Period 26 order (lead time = 2). This confirms that new orders are successfully bypassing the supply chain collapse that affected orders from Periods 15, 17, and 18. However, those older orders (totaling 704 units) are now 11-14 periods old and must be considered lost. The current in-transit (1199) is composed of these 704 'phantom' units and 495 'active' units (from P28-P29). The demand regime since P16 is stabilized at approximately 152 units/period, but recent volatility (P28 demand=212) suggests a higher buffer is needed. To force the OR backend to place orders despite the 704 phantom in-transit units, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*152 + 704 to offset the lost pipeline inventory and ensure the base stock calculation triggers necessary ordering. L is set to the promised 2 periods as the most recent arrival showed the system recovered to this speed.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Period 26 order arrived in Period 28 (LT=2). Orders from P15, P17, and P18 (704 units) are confirmed lost and constitute 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the order from Period 26 arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, confirming that the supply chain has resumed operations, though 704 units (ordered in P15, P17, P18) are now definitively lost ('phantom' inventory). These lost units currently inflate the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' view, preventing it from placing necessary new orders. At Period 30, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at a higher regime (~155 units/period) since Period 16. To counteract the ~704 units of phantom inventory and ensure the OR backend places an order to cover the (L+1) horizon, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1450. This is calculated as: ((Expected Demand 155 * (3+1) horizon) + 704 phantom offset) + a small safety buffer. I will use L=3 for the base stock calculation as it remains the most frequent actual lead time, despite the recent P26 arrival of 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2339.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with two consecutive orders (P26, P28) arriving with a lead time of 2 periods, though historical variance suggests L=3 is a safer planning horizon. There are 704 units (ordered P15, P17, P18) that are definitively lost, creating 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Current 'In-transit' is 1364, but 704 of those are lost, meaning actual pipeline is 660 (P30 order of 366 + others). Demand has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 155 units/period. To account for the 704 lost units that the OR backend still thinks are in-transit, I am inflating mu_hat. Calculations: Base mu_hat for L=3 is (1+3) * 155 = 620. Adding the 704 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1324. This forces the backend to place an order despite the high phantom pipeline inventory. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=15 to capture the volatility of the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply chain recovery: Last two arrivals (P28, P30) showed LT=2. Demand regime remains stable at ~155 units/period since P16. Phantom inventory of 704 lost units (from P15, P17, P18) still persists in the system's pipeline view.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at approximately 154 units per period (N=16 observations). The lead time has recovered to 2 periods (observed for P26 and P28 orders). However, a 'phantom inventory' problem persists: 704 units from orders placed in P15, P17, and P18 are confirmed lost (now T+14 to T+17) but still appear in the 'In-transit' total of 1364. To the backend OR logic, current pipeline inventory = 1364. Of this, 704 units are lost, leaving 660 units of REAL pipeline (P30 order of 366 + P32 order). Since the OR engine calculates base_stock - pipeline_inventory, it will under-order or not order at all if it thinks the 704 units are coming. To force the OR backend to place an order that covers the 2+1 = 3 period demand window (approx 462 units) despite the phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat = (Expected 3-period demand) + (Phantom Inventory) = (154 * 3) + 704 = 462 + 704 = 1166. This cancels out the ghost units in the backend's subtraction, allowing it to order for actual needs. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the volatility of this stabilized high-demand regime.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at approximately 155-160 units per period. The supply chain has recovered with a lead time (L) of 2 periods (as seen in P28 and P30 arrivals). However, the system is suffering from a massive 'phantom inventory' issue: 704 units ordered in Periods 15, 17, and 18 are confirmed lost but are still counted as 'In-transit' (pipeline inventory) by the OR backend. With a total In-transit of 1364 and the Period 30 order of 366 yet to arrive, the remaining 998 units (1364 - 366) are almost entirely lost/obsolete. Because the OR backend subtracts this phantom pipeline from the base_stock calculation, it will stop ordering. To force the system to order, I must explicitly inflate the mu_hat parameter to cover both the real demand and offset the phantom inventory. Estimated total demand for L+1 periods is ~480 (160 * 3). The phantom inventory is ~998. Therefore, mu_hat must be set to at least 1478 (480 + 998) to trigger a meaningful order. I will set mu_hat to 1500 and L to 2.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with recent lead times of 2 periods (observed in P28 and P30). However, a 'phantom inventory' of 704 units (from P15, P17, P18) still exists in the system's pipeline view, which blocks new orders because the OR engine believes these units are coming. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the base stock level beyond the phantom inventory. The demand regime since P16 has stabilized at ~155 units/period. For a lead time (L) of 2, the review+lead period is 3 periods (L+1). Target inventory = (3 periods * 155 units) + (safety stock for volatility) + (phantom inventory). 155 * 3 = 465. Safety stock ~150. Phantom = 704. Total explicit mu_hat = 465 + 150 + 704 = 1319. This ensures the backend places an order despite the 704 dead units. I'll maintain explicit sigma_hat to reflect the higher regime's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Overriding 'phantom inventory' of 704 units (P15, P17, P18) by using explicit mu_hat inflation to ensure the OR engine maintains orders for the current demand regime (~155 units/period).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a recovery phase, but significant 'phantom' inventory (704 units from P15, P17, P18) still exists in the pipeline calculations. This inventory is confirmed lost, but the OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will prevent ordering if it sees this as available stock. To counter this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. Since P16, demand has stabilized at ~155 units/period. With an observed actual lead time of 2-3 periods, I need to cover (L+1) periods. Using L=3 for safety, (3+1) * 155 = 620. To bypass the 704 units of phantom inventory, I must inflate mu_hat to at least 1324 (704 + 620) to trigger an order of approximately 620 units. This ensures we maintain a cycle that actually results in product reaching our shelves despite the data noise.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2-3 periods, but a significant hurdle remains: 704 units ordered in Periods 15, 17, and 18 are confirmed lost. The OR backend still counts these as 'in-transit', preventing new orders from being placed because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock to cover the current demand regime (~155 units/period) over the lead time (L=3) plus the current period (L+1=4), which is 155 * 4 = 620. To force the backend to place an order despite the 704-unit 'phantom' inventory, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom inventory plus the desired safety stock. I set mu_hat to 1350 (approx 620 + 704 + buffer) to trigger the replenishment of real physical stock. This is a temporary inflation to counteract the systemic accounting error of lost shipments.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face severe disruptions. As of Period 37, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory of 1587 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory' (704 units from P15, P17, P18) and more recent orders (P26 onwards) that have not arrived as expected. Although the promised lead time is 2, and recent successful arrivals (P28, P30) also showed LT=2, there is a current drought of arrivals for 6 consecutive periods (P31-P36). This suggests either another supply chain collapse or a lead time shift. The demand regime since P16 remains stable at approximately 155 units/period, despite the P36 outlier (46 units). To bypass the OR engine's refusal to order (due to the high phantom pipeline), I will continue using 'explicit' mu_hat inflation. I estimate demand for (L+1) periods (where L=3 for safety) to be approx 620 units. To offset 704 phantom units, I must add this to the 620 target, totaling 1324 units. This ensures the OR logic perceives a need despite the fake pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Persistent arrival drought (P31-P36) suggests lead time has shifted back to 3+ periods or further shipments are lost. Phantom inventory remains at 704 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing another significant disruption. No orders have arrived since Period 30 (8 periods ago), despite an observed actual lead time of 2-3 periods during the recovery phase (P28-P30). The 'In-transit' inventory currently sits at 1587 units, which includes 704 units confirmed lost from the P15-P18 window and now likely includes the order from P30 (366 units) and P33 (223 units). Demand has slightly softened in the last two periods (46, 95) but the medium-term average since Period 16 remains ~150 units/period. The OR engine will not place new orders because it sees 1587 units in the pipeline against a zero on-hand balance. To force the engine to order and account for the high probability that most of the pipeline is lost or heavily delayed, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat = 1500, which is over 3x the standard (1+L)*demand calculation. This inflation is designed to exceed the 'phantom' pipeline inventory and trigger a replenishment order to prevent indefinite stockouts as we enter the final stages of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Second major supply chain failure. No arrivals for 7 consecutive periods (P31-P37). Total phantom pipeline inventory likely exceeds 1200 units (704 units from P15-18 plus likely P30-P33 orders).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of severe disruption. There have been no arrivals for 8 consecutive periods (P31-P38). The 'In-transit' inventory of 1661 units is largely comprised of lost shipments from two distinct failure events: the first involving P15, P17, and P18 (704 units), and the second starting from P30 (366 units) and P33 (223 units). Currently, 1293 units (704+366+223) are almost certainly lost or significantly overdue, while the remainder (74 units ordered P38) is within a normal lead time window. The OR backend perceives this total 1661 units as available supply, which blocks new orders. To circumvent this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the necessary pipeline coverage for a lead time of 3 (L=3, so L+1=4 periods) using the sustained demand regime of ~150 units/period. Target Inventory = (150 * 4) + safety stock. Given the stockout severity and potential for lost units, I am setting mu_hat to 1600. This value is high enough that even after the backend subtracts the 1661 'phantom' units, the calculated order will effectively trigger the 'cap' logic, placing a risk-managed maximum order to replenish on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Second major shipment failure confirmed: 8 periods without arrivals (P31-P38). Total phantom inventory is now estimated at ~1300 units (704 from P15/17/18 plus P30/33). Lead time has regressed to 4+ periods or shipments are lost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing repeated failures. We are currently facing a massive 'phantom inventory' issue where the OR backend sees 1,671 units in-transit, but historical evidence suggests the vast majority of these (specifically orders from P15, P17, P18 totaling 704 units, and potentially orders from P30 and P33 totaling 589 units) are lost or indefinitely delayed. Only the small orders from P38 (arrived in P39 with LT=1) and P39 are currently reliable. The actual demand regime has stabilized at ~145 units/period over the last 10 periods (P30-P39), despite recent volatility. To force the OR backend to place new orders despite the 1,671 'in-transit' units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover 4 periods of demand (L=3 + 1) at 150 units/period (600 units) PLUS the phantom inventory amount (~1300 units) to neutralize the pipeline deduction, totaling 1900. I set L=1 based on the most recent successful delivery (P38 order), though I anticipate volatility.

Carry-over insight: Second major shipment failure confirmed: Arrived units in P39 (ordered P38) show a transient LT=1, but cumulative phantom inventory is now estimated at ~1293 units (P15/17/18=704; P30/33=589). These units are recorded in-transit but are effectively lost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing extreme volatility. After a long arrival drought, small orders from P38 and P39 arrived with a lead time of 1 period. However, massive 'phantom' inventory remains in the pipeline: P15 (211), P17 (224), P18 (269), P30 (366), and P33 (223) total 1,293 units. These 1,293 units are almost certainly lost but still count against the OR backend's order logic. To force the system to order despite this 1,293-unit phantom pipeline, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. Demand since Period 16 has averaged ~152 units/period, but recent periods (P36-P40) show a slight cooling to ~89 units/period. I will target a demand forecast of 150 units/period to cover potential recovery, multiplied by (1+L). With L=3 (most stable historical actual), the required target stock is ~600 units. To bypass the 1,293-unit phantom inventory, I set mu_hat to 1,900 (Phantom 1293 + Safety 600) to ensure the backend generates a replenishment order of approximately 600 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Phantom pipeline inventory is confirmed at 1,293 units (P15/17/18/30/33). These orders are in-transit but effectively lost. All ordering logic must now use explicit parameter inflation of +1300 units to bypass this block. Recent 5-period demand mean dropped to 89 (P36-P40) but long-term regime remains ~150.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive phantom inventory, estimated at 1,293 units (from orders in P15, P17, P18, P30, and P33). These units are recorded as 'In-transit' but have not arrived for 8-26 periods, far exceeding the recent actual lead time of 1-2 periods. To bypass the OR backend's logic, which subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base stock, I must use 'explicit' inflation. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=3 (to be safe despite recent LT=1) and a conservative recent demand mean of 100 units/period (P36-P41 avg ~96), the target base stock at 95% service level is ~550 units. To achieve an order close to 200-300 units while 2,046 units are 'in-transit', I set mu_hat explicitly to 2,500. This compensates for the ~1,300 lost units plus the recently placed orders (P40, P41) to ensure we maintain a flow of stock.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised by phantom inventory and high variability. Currently, 2,650 units are 'in-transit', but history shows that orders from P15, P17, P18, P30, and P33 (totaling ~1,300 units) are definitively lost. Lead times have also fluctuated wildly, with recent arrivals at LT=1 but long droughts suggesting a realistic LT of 3. Demand has dropped from its P16-P35 high (~155) to a recent 5-period average of ~89 (P38-P42). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 2,650 'phantom' in-transit units, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat inflation. The target base stock must exceed the phantom inventory. Setting mu_hat to 3500 and L to 3 (actual) ensures the system calculates a base stock high enough to trigger new orders, while sigma_hat is set to 200 to account for the extreme supply volatility and demand regime uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand regime has notably softened; the last 5 periods (P38-P42) average ~91 units, compared to the previous ~155. Phantom inventory has escalated to ~1,300+ units, necessitating continued explicit parameter inflation to ensure replenishment.

We have confirmed 1,293 units as lost (Periods 15, 17, 18, 30, 33), and while more units have likely been lost recently, 1,293 is our conservative floor for phantom pipeline inventory. Demand has clearly softened from a previous high of ~155 to a recent 5-period average (P39-P43) of 80.8 units per period. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the 3,360 units it sees 'in-transit', I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for the current regime (~81 units/period, LT=3) plus the 1,293 lost units. Target base stock = (1+3)*81 + 1.25*sqrt(4)*20 \u2248 324 + 50 = 374. Total mu_hat = 374 + 1293 = 1667. This forces the system to recognize the need for new stock by accounting for the units that will never arrive. L is set to 3 based on the most recent confirmed arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has shifted downwards: P39-P43 average is ~81 units/period. Phantom inventory remains significantly high at 1,293 units, requiring base stock inflation.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show instability with a confirmed 'phantom pipeline' of 1,293 units (from P15, P17, P18, P30, and P33) which are recorded as 'in-transit' but are effectively lost. The backend OR logic subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base stock, preventing necessary replenishment orders. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the target base stock by approximately 1,300 units plus the safety stock needed for the current demand regime. The demand regime has softened recently, with the last 5 periods (P40-P44) averaging ~80 units, down from the previous ~155. I will set L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and target a base stock that covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~320 units) plus the 1,293 unit buffer to bypass the phantom inventory, totaling ~1,613 units. Sigma is set based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient service levels despite the supply chain noise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 40-44 average demand decreased to ~80 units (-48% vs previous high-demand regime). Phantom inventory remains at 1,293 units, requiring continuous base stock inflation to trigger orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, major shipments from Period 42 (604 units) and Period 43 (1040 units) arrived, effectively clearing most of the supply chain backlog and bringing On-hand inventory to 1,852 units. This inventory level is massive relative to the current demand regime (mean ~80-90 units). The 'phantom inventory' issue (estimated at 1,293 units) is now moot because the On-hand inventory itself exceeds the required base stock. Demand has clearly shifted downwards; the average demand over the last 10 periods (P36-P45) is ~89.6, while the last 5 periods (P41-P45) average ~80.2 units. Lead times for the most recent arrivals were 2 and 3 periods, suggesting L should be set at the default/promised 2 to avoid over-ordering. Given the significant overstock (1,852 on-hand vs. a targeted base stock of ~320), I will set parameters to stop further ordering to minimize holding costs for the remaining 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has shifted downwards significantly: P41-P45 average is ~80 units/period. Supply chain has cleared leading to significant overstock (1852 units on-hand), exceeding demand for the remainder of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-792.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has fully recovered and cleared the backlog. As of Period 47, there are 1,799 units on-hand and 1,587 units in-transit. The current demand regime has stabilized at a lower level, averaging ~78 units over the last five periods (P42-P46). Given there are only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), the total expected demand is approximately 312 units. The current on-hand inventory (1,799) is more than five times the remaining game demand. Therefore, any further orders would only increase holding costs without contributing to additional sales. I am setting the parameters to ensure the OR backend places zero additional orders by using the default lead time (2) and a very low mu_hat (recent_N=5) to reflect the current softened demand while knowing the existing stock is already excessive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-179.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of extreme overstock (on-hand: 1718 units) due to the simultaneous arrival of several large orders (P42 and P43) that were placed during a period of perceived shipment failure and higher demand. Current demand has stabilized at a much lower regime, averaging approximately 75 units over the last 5 periods (P43-P47). With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50) and a total expected demand of roughly 225-250 units, the existing on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. The goal now is to minimize holding costs by preventing any further orders. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to 0 to ensure the base stock calculation remains below the current on-hand + in-transit levels, effectively stopping all new procurement for the remainder of the game.

Carry-over insight: Significant overstock established P45-P47; on-hand inventory (1718) exceeds total remaining game demand (~250 units). All procurement stopped.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-118.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. The current on-hand inventory is 1638 units, while the recent demand (last 10 periods) has averaged approximately 80-90 units per period. With only two periods remaining (P49 and P50), the total expected demand is less than 200 units. The on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs and reduce total reward, as there is no possibility of selling the additional units. Therefore, all ordering must remain halted. The parameters are maintained at values that will result in a zero order (e.g., using a very small N for demand and lead time to keep the base stock calculation below the high on-hand levels).

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the final period (Period 50) of the simulation. The current on-hand inventory is 1,549 units, which is far more than enough to cover the demand for the final period (historically ~80-100 units). There is also a significant pipeline inventory of 1,587 units (mostly phantom or late arrivals from previous supply chain disruptions). Any additional orders would only increase holding costs without contributing to satisfied demand. Therefore, I am setting parameters to ensure no new orders are generated by the OR engine. I will use 'explicit' methods with zero or minimum values to lock the order quantity at zero.
