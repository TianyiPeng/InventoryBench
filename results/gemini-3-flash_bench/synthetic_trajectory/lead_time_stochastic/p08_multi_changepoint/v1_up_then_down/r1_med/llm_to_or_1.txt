Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, we need to establish an initial order based on available historical demand. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 5 periods (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) shows an average of 107.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 22.8. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods), I will use the 'default' methods which will calculate the forecast and safety stock based on all available historical samples. This ensures the backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std to set the base stock level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and ordered 145 units based on initial demand signals. However, since the promised lead time is 2 periods, those units have not arrived yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), resulting in 107 units of lost sales. We now have 145 units in-transit. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a slight downward trend (130, 122, 106, 108, 71, though the Period 1 game history shows 107). Given the early stage and the 2-period lead time, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand levels while accounting for the lead time (L=2). This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (1+L).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 and Period 2 are in transit (145 + 131 = 276 units). Per the game mechanism, the Period 1 order (L=2) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message next period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 where demand was 107 and 149 respectively. Demand samples are 130, 122, 106, 108, and 71 (based on the provided sample list, though history shows actual demand for P1=107 and P2=149). The mean demand across available samples is approximately 114. With L=2, the pipeline needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). L is set to default (2). mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent demand levels, and sigma_hat is set to default to handle volatility until a stable regime is confirmed.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period_4. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders from Period 1 (145 units), Period 2 (131 units), and Period 3 (85 units) are currently in-transit (total 361). In-transit reconcile: Since L=2, the order from Period 1 should arrive DURING Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start message. However, the history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 3 conclude, which is actually expected because the order from Period 1 arrives at the end of Period 1+2=3, so we only see it at the start of Period 4 (which we are currently in). We expect the Period 1 order to have arrived by now, but we won't see it confirmed until the Period 4 conclude message. Demand has been fluctuating (107, 149, 96) around an average of 117. With on-hand at 0 and significant backlogs occurring (sold=0 for all periods so far due to no inventory), we must maintain the pipeline. I will stick to L=2 and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=3 to capture the early volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $230.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history for chips(Regular): promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times have been inconsistent (Period 1 order took 3 periods; Period 3 order took 1 period). Total historical demand samples are 130, 122, 106, 108, 71 (mean ~107.4, std ~22.8). The demand in Period 5 dropped significantly to 71, suggesting a downward trend or shift. Current inventory (On-hand 138 + In-transit 163 = 301) is quite high relative to recent demand averages (~107/period). Given the lead time volatility, I will stick to the promised 'default' L (2) for the backend calculation but use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) with N=4 to weigh the recent downward trend more heavily than the initial high samples, while still maintaining a reasonable buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $487.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is low (13 units) after selling 125 units in Period 5. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows fluctuation with a mean around 114 (Samples: 130, 122, 106, 108, 71 from instructions; though game history shows 107, 149, 96, 92, 125). Looking at the game history specifically, the mean demand over the first 5 periods is 113.8. Lead times have shown significant variability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (averaging 2). Currently, there are 234 units in-transit (from orders in P2, P4, and P5). Since the promised lead time is 2, but we've seen it drift to 3, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the observed average. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full history of the game's actual demand (avg ~114). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the observed volatility in these samples.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 6 where only 13 units of demand were met. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 109.5 units. Lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period, suggesting a high variance around the promised lead time of 2. Currently, we have 387 units in-transit (from orders in P2, P4, P5, and P6). The orders from P2 (131 units) are now overdue (promised L=2, now at P7), which may indicate a lost shipment or significant delay. To stabilize, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to capture the latest behavior (N=5) and stick to 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to average the observed shifts. mu_hat will use recent_N (N=5) to target the current demand level of ~113 units across the lookback plus lead period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $128.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout after demand (107) significantly exceeded the arrival of Period 4's order (32). Analysis of lead times reveals high volatility: observed lead times include 3, 1, and 3 periods, suggesting the 'promised' 2-period lead time is unreliable. The total demand history (Periods 1-7 plus seeded samples) shows a stable mean around 108 units per period without a clear seasonal shift yet. Currently, we have 459 units in transit (orders from P2, P5, P6, P7). Specifically, the P2 order (131 units) is now 6 periods since ordering, suggesting it might be lost or severely delayed. To protect against lead-time variability and potential lost shipments, I will set L to 3 (the maximum observed) to increase the pipeline safety stock. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior while smoothing out noise, which reflects the current average demand of approximately 108.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed lead times of 1 and 3 periods deviate from promised 2. Shipment from Period 2 (131 units) is likely lost or severely delayed (6 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $255.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 89. Demand over the last 8 periods has averaged ~109 units (min 86, max 149), showing a relatively stable but variable pattern. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show significant variability (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P7: 1). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (131 units) is now 7 periods old and has not arrived; it is highly likely lost and should be discounted from pipeline inventory to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering. The current 'In-transit' count is 303, but removing the lost P2 order leaves an effective pipeline of 172 units (Orders from P6, P8). To compensate for the lead time instability and the lost shipment, I am using an explicit lead time of 3 to provide a larger safety buffer. For demand, I'm using recent_N=5 (Periods 4-8) to capture the current mean of ~102 units while maintaining sensitivity to fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Shipment from Period 2 (131 units) confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed, promised 2). Effective pipeline adjusted to 172 units. Lead time remains volatile (ranging 1-3 periods).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a steady demand pattern (avg ~104) but continues to face significant lead-time volatility (1 to 3 periods). The shipment from Period 2 (131 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is officially treated as lost. Current on-hand inventory is 32 units. The 'In-transit' figure is 327, composed of orders from Period 6 (153), Period 9 (43), and the likely lost Period 2 (131). Excluding the lost shipment, the effective pipeline is 196 units. To account for the lead-time instability where orders frequently arrive in 3 periods instead of 2, I am explicitly setting L=2.5 to increase the safety buffer. For demand, I'm using recent_N=5 (periods 5-9) to capture the current mean of 99 units, while sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters ensure the base stock calculation covers 3.5 periods of demand (L+1), compensating for the missing Period 2 stock and guarding against further delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility remains high: observed sequence (3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1). Loss of Period 2 shipment (131 units) confirmed after 8 periods of non-arrival.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the system has zero on-hand inventory and 345 units in-transit. Based on historical 'conclude' messages, we identify that the shipment from Period 2 (131 units) is permanently lost (passed 9 periods against a promised 2). The remaining active pipeline consists of orders from P6 (153), P9 (43), and P10 (18), plus the automatic replenishment from P11. Lead times have been highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (sequence: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1). Calculating the average of these observed lead times (3+1+3+3+1+1)/6 = 2.0 exactly, though the variance is high. Demand has been relatively stable but showed a spike in P10 (136). I will use a 5-period window for demand forecasting to capture recent fluctuations (avg ~96.8) and keep L at 3 periods to safely account for the upper bound of the observed lead-time volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets enough stock to cover the actual delay risk.

Analyzing the delivery history, the shipment from Period 2 (131 units) is now 10 periods old and effectively lost, which I've factored into previous insights. The observed lead times have been highly volatile: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1 (averaging 2.0). However, the last two orders (Period 10 and 11) have not arrived yet. Since the promised lead time is 2, a Period 10 order would arrive during Period 12 and be visible in Period 13. Demand remains relatively stable, fluctuating around a mean of ~110. I will keep L at 2 (promised) as the average holds, but I'll use a recent window (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current variability (average demand 105.4 over last 5 periods) and sigma_hat to account for recent stockout risks. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1), helping to recover from the current stockout as soon as shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Lead time volatility is extreme, but the historical average is exactly 2.0 periods based on successful arrivals (3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1). Demand is stable but recent stockouts (P10, P11) highlight the impact of arrival clustering.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling 61 units (demand was 104). The lead time remains highly variable but averages 2.0 periods (latest arrivals: P9 at LT=3, P10 at LT=2). The shipment from Period 2 (131 units) is permanently lost after 11 periods. The actual pipeline inventory consists of the orders from Period 6 (153), Period 11 (99), and Period 12 (0), totaling 252 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 383 includes the lost 131 units, so I must adjust for this. Demand is stable; the average of all 12 periods is ~109 units (total 1306/12). To prevent stockouts caused by lead-time variance, I will use 'calculate' for L (which averages the actuals) and use all available demand data (default) to ensure a robust base stock that covers the expected lead time plus the review period (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Accurate pipeline inventory is 252 units (In-transit 383 - 131 lost from Period 2). Mean demand across 12 periods remains stable at approx 109 units/period.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been consistent with a mean of approximately 107.5 units across 13 periods (recent samples: 104, 63). We are experiencing stockouts due to lead time volatility. The lead time sequence is (3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2). The Period 2 order (131 units) is unequivocally lost (12 periods elapsed), meaning the true pipeline inventory is 432 - 131 = 301 units. To ensure the backend calculates a robust base stock that accounts for the current 0 on-hand status and the 201 units (99 from P11, 49 from P13, 53 from P14) we expect to arrive soon, I will continue using the calculated lead time (mean is approx 2.0) and stable demand averages. I am using recent_N for demand to capture the slight downward trend in the last few cycles (avg ~96 over last 4 periods) while maintaining enough buffer for volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe demand stability for chips(Regular) with a mean of ~105 units/period. The shipment from Period 2 (131 units) is definitively lost (13 periods elapsed vs promised 2), requiring us to adjust the effective pipeline inventory. Reported 'In-transit' is 333, but 131 is lost, so effective pipeline is 202. Current on-hand is 12. Total effective inventory is 214 units. The OR backend uses the promised lead time of 2 (3 periods of demand coverage: L+1). Expected demand for 3 periods is ~315 units. Since 214 < 315, an order is necessary. Lead time observations (3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3) average exactly 2.125, which is close to the promised 2. Stockouts in Periods 10-13 were caused by lead-time clustering and the lost shipment, not a demand shift. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to capture the slight drift and 'recent_N' for demand (N=14) to exclude the provided initialization samples (P_1 to P_5) which differ slightly from the game history mean.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline correction: Subtract 131 units (Period 2 loss) from all future 'In-transit' reports to calculate effective inventory. Lead time remains unstable (range 1-3 periods), but average is approximately 2.1.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 16. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit inventory is 407 units, but this includes the 131 units ordered in Period 2 which are confirmed lost (14 periods elapsed). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 276 units (407 - 131). The lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.1 periods. Demand has remained relatively stable since the start of the game, with a long-term mean of approx 104 units and a standard deviation around 20-22. I will set L to 2 (promised) as the average lead time is near this value. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the stable demand regime while smoothing out recent stockout periods. I'll use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to capture recent volatility. The OR engine will use these parameters to achieve a service level q = 0.8 (4/(4+1)), while accounting for the manual pipeline adjustment via the Carry-over insight.

Daily Reward (R_t): $196.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has recently spiked significantly, reaching 178 in Period 16, while the previous 15-period average was approximately 105. This suggests a potential regime shift or seasonal peak. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 358 units includes the long-lost 131 units from Period 2 (15 periods overdue), meaning the effective pipeline is only 227 units (consisting of orders from Period 15 and 16). Given the stockouts in Periods 15 and 16, and the recent demand jump, I am increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture this upward movement (shifting the mean from ~105 to ~123 forecast for 1+L periods). Lead time remains volatile (mean ~2.1 periods), so I will use an explicit L of 2 to align with the promised lead time while mu_hat/sigma_hat handle the volume requirements.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 16: Period 16 demand (178) is 70% higher than historical average. Effective pipeline remains (In-transit - 131) due to confirmed loss of Period 2 shipment.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16 (P16: 178, P17: 222). The average demand over these two periods is 200 units, a 100% increase over the previous 15-period average (approx. 104 units). On-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced stockouts. Total 'In-transit' is 439, but we must subtract the 131 units from the Period 2 order, which is confirmed lost (16 periods elapsed), leaving an effective pipeline of 308 units. Lead times are volatile but average 2.1 periods. To address the demand spike and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=2 to focus exclusively on the 200 units/period regime. L is set to 'explicit' at 2 to ensure the backend covers (L+1)=3 periods of increased demand. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at 40 (scaled for 3 periods) to account for the heightened volatility observed during this regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift: Starting Period 16, demand increased ~100% (avg 200 vs previous 104). Effective pipeline continues to require -131 unit subtraction (Period 2 loss).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 178, 222, and 146, averaging approximately 182 units/period, which is a ~75% increase over the previous historical average (approx. 104). The lead time remains highly variable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with an observed average around 2.1 periods. The shipment from Period 2 (131 units) is unequivocally lost, meaning the effective pipeline inventory is the reported 'In-transit' of 634 units minus the 131 lost units, totaling 503 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 due to recent stockouts, we must set parameters to cover this higher demand level and build safety stock against lead time uncertainty. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the new demand regime and 'explicit' for L to account for the risk of 3-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand from Period 16-18 is 182 units (+75% vs baseline).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is in the middle of a significant demand regime shift that began in Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (P16-P19), demand has surged from a historical mean of ~105 to 175.25. Additionally, on-hand inventory is currently 0, largely due to arrivals being concentrated at the maximum lead time (3 periods) or lost entirely. The Period 2 order (131 units) is officially confirmed lost after 18 periods, meaning the effective pipeline is (634 - 131) = 503 units. Given the high demand and the risk of lead time stretching to 3 periods, I am setting L=3 to ensure the backend calculates base stock for a 4-period window (L+1). mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture only the new high-demand regime (avg ~175), while sigma_hat uses historical variance (N=19) to account for potential volatility during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-19 mean demand is 175.25 units (+70% vs baseline). Lost shipment Period 2 (131 units) remains a fixed deduction from reported In-transit inventory.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The demand from Period 16-20 has averaged 159.8 units/period, compared to the pre-shift average of approximately 104. Although Period 20 showed a dip to 98, the overall trend requires a higher base stock to avoid the recurring stockouts (on-hand is currently 0). Regarding inventory, the reported 'In-transit' of 766 units includes a shipment of 131 units from Period 2 that is confirmed lost (20 periods have elapsed). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 635 units (766 - 131). Lead time remains volatile but averages 2.1 periods. To address the demand shift while accounting for the lost units in the pipeline calculation, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=5 to capture the new regime) and an explicit lead time of 2 to match the promised average, while relying on the OR backend's service level logic to buffer the volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-20 confirms a higher mean (approx 160) than periods 1-15 (approx 104). Lost Period 2 shipment (131 units) still accounts for a discrepancy in 'In-transit' accounting.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and a reported in-transit of 766 units. However, as documented since Period 8, 131 units from Period 2 are lost, making the effective pipeline 635 units. The demand from Period 16\u201321 (178, 222, 146, 155, 98, 172) shows a significant regime shift compared to the early game. The mean of these 6 samples is approximately 161.8, contrasted with the baseline mean (~109). We have experienced recurrent stockouts due to arrival clustering; while the average lead time is roughly 2.1, the observed range is 1 to 3 periods. To account for the higher demand mean and volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 42.5 in this new regime), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the ~162 units/period demand. For lead time, 'calculate' is used as the volatility remains centered near the promised 2 periods (avg 2.1), and explicitly increasing L might lead to excessive holding costs given the already large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-21 confirms a higher sustained mean (approx 162) and higher volatility (Std Dev approx 42.5) compared to periods 1-15.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a new high-mean regime starting at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from P16 to P22 (178, 222, 146, 155, 98, 172, 146), the mean is 160 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 38. The inventory situation is critical as the product has been stocked out since Period 19. The reported 'In-transit' of 766 units includes a 131-unit order from Period 2 that is confirmed lost (20 periods overdue); thus, the effective pipeline is 635 units. The actual lead time has historically fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.1). Despite the large pipeline, the backend needs to target a base stock covering (L+1) periods of demand at the new regime level to ensure service levels once the clustered orders arrive. I am setting L=3 (explicit) to account for recent arrival delays and potentially lost shipments, while using N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime since Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-22 confirms a sustained higher mean (approx 160) compared to periods 1-15 (approx 104). Lost Period 2 shipment (131 units) persists as a discrepancy in the 'In-transit' accounting, requiring a -131 adjustment for effective pipeline calculations.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted starting at Period 16, moving from a mean of approximately 104 units (Periods 1-15) to a mean of approximately 160 units (Periods 16-23). I am using recent_N=8 to capture this specific regime for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. In-transit inventory reflects a persistent ghost value of 131 units from a shipment lost in Period 2; therefore, the effective pipeline is (634 - 131) = 503 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead times have been volatile (averaging approx 2.2 for valid arrivals recently), but using L=default (2) with the higher demand forecast in recent_N should provide sufficient buffer against the 3-period lead times observed frequently in the history.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the primary challenge is managing a significant pipeline while accounting for a confirmed lost shipment. The 'In-transit' count is 634 units, but historically, 131 units from Period 2 are lost, making the effective pipeline 503 units. Demand analysis shows a clear regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to P16, mean demand was ~104; from P16 to P24, the mean demand is ~156 units per period. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture this higher mean (approx 156 * 3 = 468). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=9) to reflect the increased volatility observed during this higher demand period (Std Dev ~34). Lead time (L) remains volatile but averages near the promised 2 periods; I am using the 'calculate' method to utilize all successful delivery data. With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 503, the OR backend will decide if more units are needed to cover the (L+1) horizon based on the service level target q=0.8 (P=4, H=1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16 persistent: Mean demand P16-P24 is ~156 units (+50% vs baseline).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16 from a base of ~104 to a higher mean. Analyzing Period 16-25, the mean demand is 146.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 35.8. However, recent periods 23-25 show a slight cooling (164, 124, 112). I will focus on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the higher mean while acknowledging the recent dip. Lead time remains volatile (averaging 2.3 for successful arrivals, but with long gaps); recent arrivals suggest a realized L around 3. The 'In-transit' of 635 includes the lost 131 units from Period 2, making the effective pipeline 504 units. With On-hand at 0, the OR backend needs to cover at least (L+1) periods of demand. Setting L=3 (explicit) and mu_hat based on the last 10 samples (recent_N=10) ensures the base stock targets approx 600-700 units (4 * ~147), which minus the effective pipeline of 504, will trigger necessary replenishment orders.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we are managing a continued zero-inventory situation. Historical analysis shows a lost shipment from Period 2 (131 units) that still artificially inflates the 'In-transit' figure; the effective pipeline is actually 536 units (667 - 131). The demand regime shift that began in Period 16 remains sustained. From Period 16 to 26, the mean demand is 160.8 units per period, significantly higher than the initial baseline (approx. 104). The observed lead times (L) have averaged 2.18 across all successful arrivals (excluding the lost P2 order). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=11 to capture this higher demand regime (P16-P26) and sigma_hat using the same window to address the increased volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the slightly higher-than-promised actual lead time average. Setting these parameters ensures the base stock target (mu + z*sigma) properly accounts for the current demand environment while the OR backend manages the pipeline inventory (corrected by the internal logic based on order sizes).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 667 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the order from Period 2 (131 units) is confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 536 units (667 - 131). Since Period 16, a sustained demand regime shift has occurred. The average demand for the last 12 periods (P16-P27) is approximately 154 units per period, compared to the original baseline of ~104. Lead times remain volatile (1-3 periods), with recent arrivals occurring at the upper bound (lead time 3). Setting mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L+1 with L=2) at the higher demand rate (154 * 3 = 462). Given the effective pipeline (536) already exceeds this requirement, the OR backend will naturally temper ordering to avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against stockouts caused by arrival clustering and lead-time variability. Using recent_N=12 to isolate the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P16-P27) average is 154 units/period, roughly 50% higher than periods 1-15. Lost Period 2 shipment (131 units) remains a persistent accounting discrepancy in reported 'In-transit' figures.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. Analyzing the recent 13 periods (P16-P28), the mean demand is approximately 158.6 units, with a standard deviation of 33.7. This is significantly higher than the baseline mean of ~104. Lead time continues to exhibit volatility (range 1-3 periods), but the average remains near the promised 2 periods (mean ~2.3 for the most recent successful arrivals). We face a critical stockout situation (on-hand = 0). The 'In-transit' figure of 635 must be adjusted by -131 units due to the confirmed loss of the Period 2 shipment, making the effective pipeline 504 units. To stabilize service levels amidst this higher demand and supply clustering, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (regime length) and keeping lead time at the default promised value, as the backend's base-stock calculation will adjust for the observed volatility within the OR logic.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is sustained. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 29 is 162.5 units per period, a ~55% increase over the initial baseline (~105). Lead time remains volatile (ranging 1-3 periods), but the historical average of successful deliveries remains near the promised 2 periods. A critical correction is required for the pipeline inventory: the order from Period 2 (131 units) is confirmed lost after 27 periods of non-arrival; therefore, the effective In-transit inventory is 504 units (635 reported - 131 lost). We are currently experiencing stockouts due to arrival clustering and the lead time of previous large orders (Periods 17 and 18). To stabilize the service level for the new demand regime, I am using recent_N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift behavior specifically. For L, I use 'calculate' to incorporate the observed lead time variability into the backend's base-stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16: Mean demand P16-P29 is 162.5 units (+55% shift). Effective In-transit inventory requires a constant -131 unit correction due to the lost Period 2 shipment.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted starting at Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 30, the mean is approximately 157.07 units with a standard deviation of approximately 34.6. This is significantly higher than the baseline periods 1-15 (mean approx 104). The 'In-transit' figure of 647 units includes a 131-unit order from Period 2 that has never arrived (29 periods elapsed) and is confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 516 units (647 - 131). With 0 on-hand inventory, the effective total inventory is 516. Since the target base stock (calculated as [1+L]*mean + z*sigma*sqrt(1+L)) at L=2 and mean=157 exceeds this effective pipeline, I will set mu_hat to the recent mean (N=15) and sigma_hat to the recent standard deviation to ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment order that accounts for the lost stock and the higher demand regime.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16, increasing from an average of ~104 to ~163 units per period. The lost shipment from Period 2 (131 units) remains in the 'In-transit' accounting (647 total), resulting in an effective pipeline of 516 units. Observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with a long-term average near 2.2 for successful deliveries. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and recent demand (P16-P31) shows sustained higher volume and volatility (std dev ~35). Given the effective pipeline (516) and the demand shift, parameters are set to cover the newer average and volatility. I'll use recent_N for mu_hat (N=16, matching the regime shift) and sigma_hat to capture this increased demand level and variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16: Mean demand P16-P31 is 156.4 units (+50% shift). Effective In-transit inventory requires a constant -131 unit correction due to the lost Period 2 shipment.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift at Period 16. Since Period 16, the demand mean has stabilized at approximately 156 units per period, compared to the initial baseline of ~104. For parameter selection, I am using N=17 (from Period 16 to Period 32) to capture this higher mean. The lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, though the promised lead time is 2. The pipeline inventory continues to be inflated by 131 units due to an order from Period 2 that never arrived and is considered lost; therefore, the effective pipeline is (In-transit: 647 - 131 = 516). Despite a large pipeline, current on-hand inventory is 0. By setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=17), I ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current regime. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N captures the elevated volatility observed in the current period (std dev ~31). The OR backend's inventory balancing will account for the lead time and pipeline, but since the pipeline is already substantial (516 effective units), the stock-out risk should be addressed as those units arrive.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift confirmed (P16-P32): Mean demand increased to 156.4 units (+50% shift). Persistent accounting discrepancy: Effective In-transit inventory must always be calculated as (Reported In-transit - 131) due to the lost shipment from Period 2.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from a mean of ~104 to ~156 units/period. Over the last 18 periods (P16-P33), the mean demand is 156.4 with a standard deviation of approximately 32.5. We are currently facing a significant stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' report of 647 units includes a phantom 131 units from a lost Period 2 shipment, making the effective pipeline 516 units. Given the volatility in lead times (1-3 periods, average ~2.1) and the recent arrival gaps, I will use recent_N for both demand and volatility based on the current regime (N=18). For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the higher observed historical variability while aiming for the promised 2-period baseline, though the OR backend will use the effective lead time for base stock calculation. These parameters aim to restore stock levels to meet the new higher demand mean while accounting for pipeline discrepancies.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is well-established, with mean demand from P16 to P34 averaging approximately 155.1 units per period, compared to the pre-P16 baseline of ~104. Currently, the system is in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. There is a massive technical 'In-transit' balance of 647 units, but 131 units from the Period 2 order are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 516 units. The lack of arrivals between Period 29 and 34 (despite orders placed in P25, P26, and P30) indicates significant lead time extension or clustering. To prevent persistent stockouts under the new demand regime and to account for the accounting discrepancy of the lost shipment, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the last 19 periods (the new regime) and 'calculate' for lead time to capture the observed variability (average approx 2.2). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to capture the increased volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 35, the effective pipeline inventory is (Reported In-transit - 131) due to the lost shipment from Period 2. The demand regime from Period 16-34 is sustained with a mean of ~155 units (+50% vs baseline).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36, we are in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The mean demand for the last 20 periods (P16-P35) is approximately 157 units, which is a 50%+ increase from the initial baseline (approx. 104 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the reported in-transit quantity is 647 units. However, as established in prior insights, 131 units from the Period 2 order were lost, making the effective pipeline 516 units (647 - 131). The recently observed demand volatility is also higher, requiring more robust safety stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture this high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). Given the history of lead time variability (range 1-3, avg ~2.1), using the default lead time (2) or calculated lead time is appropriate, as the pipeline calculation must account for the clustering of arrivals seen in recent periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to operate under two primary constraints: a sustained demand regime shift that began in Period 16 and a persistent accounting discrepancy from a lost shipment in Period 2. Since Period 16, mean demand has stabilized around 155 units (excluding a notable dip in Period 36). Using Period 16-36 (21 samples) provides a robust mu forecast of approximately 150 units. The effective pipeline inventory is 516 units (In-transit 647 - 131 lost), meaning we are currently in an over-ordered state relative to immediate demand. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the large volume of units yet to arrive (even after adjusting for the loss), the goal is to stabilize the pipeline without adding unnecessary holding cost. We use recent_N (N=21) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-regime volatility and mean, while maintaining the 'calculate' method for Lead Time to average out the observed 1-3 period variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand regime (P16-P36) mean remains ~150 units/period despite a single-period dip in P36. The accounting correction (-131 units from reported In-transit) remains necessary due to the lost Period 2 order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift at Period 16. Mean demand from P16 to P37 is approximately 149.3 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~104. Volatility has also increased during this period (Std Dev ~41). A significant inventory accounting discrepancy persists: the order from Period 2 (131 units) is definitively lost after 36 periods. Consequently, the 'effective' pipeline is the reported In-transit (647) minus the lost units (131), totaling 516 units. Lead times are volatile (range 1-3) but average near the promised 2.0. With On-hand inventory at 0 and current pipeline coverage (516 / 149.3 \u2248 3.4 periods), we are entering a zone where the backend's capped policy will moderate ordering. I will use recent_N (N=22) to capture the post-shift regime (P16-P37) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default 'calculate' for L to leverage the full arrival history.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Lost shipment from Period 2 (131 units) remains in reported In-transit; all effective inventory calculations must subtract 131 from the In-transit figure. Demand regime P16-P37 mean is ~149 units (+43% vs baseline).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we face an critical stockout situation (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure of 647 units includes a 131-unit lost shipment from Period 2, making the effective pipeline 516 units. However, no shipments have arrived since Period 28, indicating extreme delays or further losses in the supply chain beyond the promised 2-period lead time. Demand since Period 16 has undergone a regime shift; excluding the recent three-period dip (P36-P38), the mean sits around 150-160 units. Including the recent dip (P16-P38), the mean is 147 units. Given the high stockout risk and the failure of recent orders to arrive, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the observed supply chain sluggishness and a recent_N (N=23, covering P16-P38) for demand to reflect the current higher consumption regime. This will signal the OR backend to set a higher base stock to recover from the stockout and bridge the extended lead time gap.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain interruption confirmed: No units have arrived between Period 29 and Period 38 despite continuous demand. Effective pipeline calculation must consistently subtract 131 units (Period 2 loss) from the reported In-transit value. Demand regime P16-P38 mean 147 units (+41% vs P1-P15).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe disruption where no units have arrived since Period 28, despite multiple orders being placed and demand continuing. The reported In-transit of 661 includes a lost shipment of 131 from Period 2, leaving 530 units that are theoretically in the pipeline but effectively stuck. As we are in Period 40/50, these delayed units represent a significant holding cost risk if they all arrive at once, but the immediate problem is a total lack of inventory to meet demand. The demand regime shifted at Period 16; however, recent demand (P36-P39) has cooled slightly (avg ~86). For Period 40, I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=24, covering the regime since P16) to capture the higher baseline while acknowledging the recent dip. I will continue to treat lead time as 'explicit' at 3 to account for the ongoing arrival delays, effectively signaling the OR backend that we need higher coverage due to supply volatility. No order was placed for many periods to avoid over-ordering during the stall, but a small reconciliation order was placed in P39. Given the massive pipeline relative to current demand and the risk of a bulk arrival, no additional order is desired right now.

Carry-over insight: Extended supply chain stall: No arrivals since Period 28. Pipeline inventory (minus 131 unit P2 loss) is 530 units, which is over 3x the current mean demand, presenting extreme risk of holding cost spikes if the logjam clears. Recent demand (P36-P39) has trended lower (~85 units/period) compared to the P16-P35 average (~155).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially resumed as an order placed in Period 39 arrived in Period 40 (lead time 1). However, a massive backlog exists in the pipeline (reported In-transit 647). After accounting for the lost Period 2 order (-131 units), the effective In-transit is 516 units. The demand regime remains in a lower state compared to the P16-P35 peak, with recent demand averaging approximately 89 units over the last 5 periods (P36-P40). Given the massive pipeline of 516 units (covering over 5 periods of recent demand) and the risk of extreme holding costs if the logjam clears, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat based on recent lower demand (N=5) and allow the pipeline to satisfy future demand.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain resumed in Period 40 (P39 order arrived, LT=1), but a massive backlog of 516 effective units remains In-transit. Demand has stabilized at a lower level (avg ~89 units/period) since Period 36.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain shows signs of recovery after a long stall, with an arrival in Period 40 (Lead Time = 1). However, there is a massive backlog in the pipeline. The reported 'In-transit' is 647 units. After subtracting the confirmed lost Period 2 shipment (131 units), the effective pipeline is 516 units. Demand since Period 36 has stabilized at a lower level, averaging approximately 89 units per period (P36-P41: 46, 95, 111, 93, 100, 84). Given the effective pipeline of 516 units and a demand of ~89/period, we have over 5 periods of supply already in transit. Ordering more now would create an extreme risk of excessive holding costs once the logjam fully clears. I will set parameters to prevent new orders by reflecting the current lower demand regime (N=6) and using the default lead time. The OR engine's base-stock calculation will see the 516 pipeline units as far exceeding the required base stock, resulting in a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain resumed Period 40 (LT=1). Demand regime since Period 36 has shifted lower to an average of ~89 units/period. Effective pipeline remains (Reported In-transit - 131) due to the lost Period 2 order.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain resumed in Period 40 with a lead time of 1, but significant inventory remains in-transit. The reported In-transit is 647 units; after subtracting the 131 units from the lost Period 2 order, the effective pipeline is 516 units. The demand regime has shifted lower since Period 36, averaging approximately 85 units per period (P36-P42: 46, 95, 111, 93, 100, 84, 66). With an effective pipeline of 516 units and a current demand of ~85, we have over 6 periods of supply already in-transit. To avoid massive holding costs when the remaining backlog arrives, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent lower-demand regime (N=7) and set the lead time estimate to the recent observation of 1 period. No new order will be triggered because the pipeline significantly exceeds the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 36: Mean demand decreased to ~85 units/period. Effective pipeline remains (Reported In-transit - 131) due to the lost Period 2 order.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has experienced a significant and prolonged disruption. No arrivals occurred between Period 29 and 39 (except for a small order from P39 arriving in P40). The reported 'In-transit' of 647 units includes a 131-unit lost shipment from Period 2, making the effective pipeline 516 units. The demand regime has shifted lower since Period 36, averaging approximately 81 units per period (P36-P43: 46, 95, 111, 93, 100, 84, 66, 61). Given the massive effective pipeline (516 units) relative to the current demand (~81 units/period), the pipeline inventory covers more than 6 periods of demand. Placing any further orders now would exacerbate holding cost risks when the supply logjam eventually clears. I am setting parameters to ensure no new orders are generated by maintaining mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent demand regime (N=8) while acknowledging the high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 36: Mean demand has decreased to ~81 units/period. The massive backlog of orders placed during earlier high-demand periods (effective pipeline ~516 units) creates a high risk of holding costs once deliveries resume.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for Period 45 remains extremely critical. We have 0 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' figure of 647. After correcting for the lost Period 2 shipment (131 units), the effective pipeline is 516 units. The demand regime has shifted lower since Period 36, averaging approximately 83 units per period (P36-P44: 46, 95, 111, 93, 100, 84, 66, 61, 90). The effective pipeline of 516 units already covers over 6 periods of this current demand (516 / 83 \u2248 6.2). Ordering more would exacerbate the risk of massive holding costs if the supply chain logjam (no arrivals except for a small P39 order since P28) clears and hits the warehouse at once. Therefore, I am maintaining mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 9-period regime (N=9) to reflect the recent lower demand, while keeping the order quantity at zero by utilizing the default lead time (L=2) and allowing the existing pipeline to meet the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 36 remains lower: Mean demand (P36-P44) is approx 83 units/period. The effective pipeline (Reported In-transit - 131) stands at 516 units, significantly exceeding current cycle stock requirements.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to present significant challenges. While a single shipment arrived in Period 40 (lead time 1), the system has not seen any of the older, larger backlog orders arrive. The current 'In-transit' report of 647 units includes a 131-unit lost order from Period 2, making the effective pipeline 516 units. The demand regime since Period 36 has stabilized at a significantly lower average of approximately 85 units per period. Given that the effective pipeline (516 units) already covers over 6 periods of current demand, and we are at Period 46 of 50, placing any additional orders is highly risky. The primary objective now is to satisfy remaining demand using the existing pipeline to avoid massive end-of-game holding costs or left-over inventory. I will maintain parameters that result in zero new orders by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the lower recent demand (N=10) and relying on the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 36 confirmed lower: Mean demand (P36-P45) is 84.6 units/period (~45% decrease from the P16-P35 peak). Effective pipeline (In-transit - 131) is 516 units, sufficient for the remainder of the game.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 47. Game ends at Period 50. Total remaining periods: 4 (47, 48, 49, 50). In-transit inventory is 647 units. Adjusting for the confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (-131 units), the effective pipeline is 516 units. The current demand regime (since Period 36) has averaged approx 85 units/period. Over the remaining 4 periods, total expected demand is roughly 340 units (85 * 4), while the effective pipeline is 516 units. Therefore, the pipeline already covers all expected demand through the end of the game with a significant surplus (~176 units). Ordering more would only increase the risk of high holding costs if the supply chain 'logjam' clears and the backlog arrives. Consequently, I am setting parameters to ensure the OR backend places no further orders.

Carry-over insight: Remaining game duration (Periods 47-50) is fully covered by the effective pipeline of 516 units (Reported In-transit 647 - 131 lost). No further orders are required to satisfy expected demand through to the game end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of a 50-period game. The current observation shows On-hand inventory is 0 and In-transit is 647. As established in multiple previous periods, there is a 131-unit accounting error in the 'In-transit' figure due to a lost shipment from Period 2. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 516 units (647 - 131). The mean demand in the current regime (since Period 36) is approximately 80-85 units per period. With only 3 decision periods remaining (48, 49, 50), the total expected demand through the end of the game is approximately 255 units (85 units * 3 periods). The 516 units currently in the pipeline are more than double the required amount to satisfy all remaining demand and safety stock needs. Ordering more units at this stage would only increase the risk of substantial holding costs if the supply chain logjam clears before the game ends. Therefore, I am setting parameters to ensure no new orders are placed (Base Stock < Effective Pipeline).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of a 50-period game. The primary objective is to maximize reward, which at this stage involves satisfying remaining demand while eliminating the risk of ending with excess inventory (holding costs). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' is 647 units, but based on confirmed history (Carry-over Period 8 onwards), 131 units from Period 2 are lost. This results in an effective pipeline of 516 units (647 - 131). The recent demand regime (P36-P48) has stabilized around a mean of 84 units per period. With only 2 periods of demand remaining (P49 and P50), the total expected demand is approximately 168 units. The effective pipeline of 516 units is more than sufficient to cover this demand, even accounting for high variance or lead time fluctuations. Ordering more now would only increase the terminal holding cost risk. Therefore, I am setting parameters to ensure zero new orders are placed by utilizing the 'explicit' method to set mu_hat and sigma_hat at levels that will result in a base stock lower than the pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision phase of the game. Total inventory management logic dictates that since the game ends at the conclusion of this period, any order placed now will not arrive in time to satisfy demand (minimum lead time is 0-1, but effectively the game concludes after this period's demand resolution). Furthermore, the 'In-transit' pipeline (647 units) adjusted for the lost Period 2 shipment (-131 units) equals 516 effective units. This backlog is more than sufficient to cover any remaining demand, and in fact, presents a significant holding cost risk if it arrivals cluster. Per the strategy initiated in Period 47, no further orders are necessary. I will set parameters to ensure a zero order by using current low demand averages (Regime since P36) and the default lead time, allowing the existing pipeline to cover the final period's needs while the OR backend's inventory balancing logic results in no new order.
