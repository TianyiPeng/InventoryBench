Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to establish a baseline order. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available (130, 122, 106, 108, 71), showing a mean of 107.4 and a standard deviation of 23.3. However, there is a noticeable downward trend (the last sample is 71). The promised lead time is 2 periods. To be conservative while accounting for the recent drop in demand, I will use all 5 historical samples to set the parameters for the OR backend. The backend uses a base stock policy where it aims to cover L+1 periods (in this case, 3 periods) of demand. Using 'default' methods will calculate the forecast and volatility based on the mean and standard deviation of all historical samples provided.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 145 units were ordered, but because the promised lead time is 2 periods, they are correctly marked 'arrived=0' in the Period 1 conclude message (they are expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 112 units of lost sales from Period 1 (107 demand - 0 sold). The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a downward trend (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) with the most recent sample in the game history being 107. The average demand across these 6 samples is approximately 107.3. I will use the 'default' lead time (2) and calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the more recent, lower demand levels while balancing against the inventory-out state. This results in a coverage of (1+L)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, the demand for the first two periods was 107 and 149 (average ~128). Promised lead time is 2 periods. We have orders from Period 1 (145 units) and Period 2 (134 units) currently in-transit (total 279). According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and be visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no shipments have arrived yet. Because demand is relatively stable and we are still within the promised lead-time window, I will use the default lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=2 to capture the most recent demand levels (107, 149), which provides a more current mean and variance than the provided pre-game samples.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 117.3 units per period. The promised lead time is 2, meaning the order placed in Period 1 (145 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and should be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0, and the in-transit total is 384 (145 + 134 + 105), which confirms that the Period 1 order has not yet arrived. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or there is a delay. Since we have no completed arrivals yet, I will stick with the default lead time for calculation but monitor for a lost shipment or a sustained lead time shift. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand volatility while we wait for the pipeline to clear the stockout.

Daily Profit: $92.00, Daily Holding Cost: $158.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-66.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first set of arrivals and historical data. Arrivals from Period 1 (145 units) and Period 3 (105 units) both arrived in Period 4, yielding actual lead times of 3 and 1 periods respectively, compared to the promised 2. This averages to 2, so I will stick with the default lead time for now. Demand has shown a downward trend: 107, 149, 96, 92, and the current user-provided sample is 71 (moving from ~120 avg to sub-100). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which creates a 0.5 critical ratio, the OR engine will naturally target a base stock near the mean. To prevent overstocking during this apparent decline, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the lower demand levels (avg ~102) rather than the earlier higher peaks, while maintaining default volatility settings to account for the lead time variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the chips(Regular) SKU. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 107, 149, 96, 92, 125 (Avg ~113.8). Note that the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' provided in the prompt (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) differs slightly from the 'GAME HISTORY' logs (which reflect actual realizations). I will prioritize the GAME HISTORY for the most recent trends. The promised lead time is 2, but we've observed high variability: P1 order arrived in 3 periods, and P3 order arrived in 1 period (actual average lead time is 2). Current state: On-hand=33, In-transit=175. The in-transit likely includes orders from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 5 (41 units). Since L=2 and the Review period is 1, we need to cover demand for (2+1)=3 periods. Mean demand is ~114, so mu_hat should target ~342. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the observed variability around the mean of 2, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to reflect the observed history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after stockouts in Period 6 (sold only 33 units against a demand of 101). The total demand history (107, 149, 96, 92, 125, 101, along with samples 130, 122, 106, 108, 71) suggests an average around 110 units/period. Examining lead times: P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), P3 arrived in P4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2, and the average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. I will use 'calculate' for L. For mu_hat, demand has been relatively stable around 110, so I'll use all 11 samples (6 from recent game history + 5 from historical data) giving an average of approx 110.6. With L=2, the backend calculation for mu_hat (1+L)*mean will be approximately 3 * 110.6 = 331.8. Sigma will be derived from all samples to capture the volatility (std is approx 22). Pipeline inventory is currently 319 (P2 order of 134 + P5 order of 41 + P6 order of 144), meaning the backend policy will likely place an order to cover the (L+1) horizon.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. Historical demand for chips(Regular) across 12 samples (seeds + game history) shows a mean of 110.6 and standard deviation of 19.8. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, while in-transit inventory is 439 (comprising orders from P2, P5, P6, and P7). Reviewing arrival history: P1 order arrived P4 (LT=3), P3 order arrived P4 (LT=1). The P2 order (134 units) is now at Period 8, meaning it has been in transit for 6 periods and is significantly overdue (promised LT=2), suggesting it might be lost. However, since the OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, if I do not account for the potential loss, it will stop ordering. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use observed averages (mean LT=2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the game history demand regime (mean ~111), which is slightly lower than the seed data. This helps stabilize the base stock against the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $1.0 profit), which normally targets a 50% service level.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe 75 units on-hand and 283 units in-transit. Looking at the history, the promised lead time (L=2) is highly unstable: we've seen lead times of 1, 3, 1, and 3 periods respectively (averaging 2.0). However, the oscillation makes the system prone to stockouts (as seen in Period 6 and 7). Historical demand (Periods 1-8) averaged 107.8 units/period. The current in-transit inventory consists of orders from Period 2 (134 units), Period 6 (144 units), and Period 8 (5 units). The Period 2 order is significantly overdue (7 periods since ordering), suggesting it may be lost. If Period 2 is lost/ignored, our active pipeline is only 149 units. I will set L=2 (promised), but use recent_N for demand (N=5) to capture the slight downward trend in demand (mean ~102) and maintain a buffer given the delivery uncertainty.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we have an on-hand inventory of 4 units and an in-transit pipeline of 278 units (consisting of the orders from Period 2 and Period 6). Reviewing history, the promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual arrival patterns show high volatility: we've seen lead times of 1 period (P3, P7, P8) and 3 periods (P1, P5). Notably, the order from Period 2 (134 units) is now 8 periods overdue, suggesting it is lost. The order from Period 6 (144 units) is at period 4 of transit, which is late but potentially still arriving if the distribution is skewed. Demand has been relatively stable, with recent samples (P5-P9) averaging ~99 units per period. Because of the likely loss of the Period 2 shipment, the current 'In-transit' figure of 278 is misleading; only about 144 units are likely realistically incoming. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delays, and use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the current mean of ~99. This will prompt the OR engine to order enough to cover the (L+1) window, effectively compensating for the lost units from Period 2.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is highly volatile (recorded 1 and 3 periods); Period 2 order (134 units) is likely lost (8 periods overdue).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean demand of approximately 108 units across all 10 periods. After a brief stockout in Period 10 (ending on-hand=0), the current pipeline inventory is 392 units (orders from P6, P10, and possibly P2/P7 lingering). Historical lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods: P1/P5 took 3 periods, while P3/P7/P8 took 1 period. The Period 2 order (134 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is confirmed lost. Because on-hand is 0, we need to ensure the pipeline covers our needs. Using a default lead time (2) and recent_N=5 for demand (avg ~101) aligns with recent patterns. The high sigma_hat reflects the high demand volatility and stockout risk.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant backlog of demand (Period 10 and 11 had stockouts). Looking at the lead time history, orders fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P5: 3, P7: 1, P8: 1). The P2 order (134 units) is now 10 periods overdue and must be considered lost, which inflates the 'In-transit' figure seen by the OR backend. The current in-transit (392) likely consists of the lost P2 order (134), P6 (144), and P10 (114). Total active pipeline is effectively 258 units. The demand mean is approximately 110 units/period (avg of 11 historical samples is 109.3). Since the lead time is unstable, I will set L=3 (explicitly choosing the upper bound) to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=5 (P7-P11 mean = 105.6) to capture the current demand level, which, when multiplied by (1+L=4), provides a base stock of ~422. This will trigger a replenishment order to account for the lost P2 shipment and current stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average observed is ~1.8, mode is 1). P2 order (134 units) has reached 10 periods of delay; confirming it as a lost shipment to adjust pipeline expectations.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is low (10 units on-hand) following a period of stockouts. The demand across the last 12 periods averages 108.8 units, but more importantly, the system is recovering from a lost order (Period 2) and variable lead times. Observed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, showing significant deviation from the promised L=2. The pipeline inventory (309) includes a mix of older and recent orders. Specifically, orders from P6 (144) and P7 (120) have significantly exceeded the typical 2-3 period lead time window without a conclude message, suggesting they might be delayed or potentially lost, though P10 (114) arrived in 2 periods. Since 'In-transit' includes the 134 units from Period 2 (which were confirmed lost in carry-over), the actual effective pipeline is 309 - 134 = 175. However, since the OR engine does not manually subtract lost shipments, I will adjust L to 'calculate' to reflect the higher average lead time and use 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) to capture the current stable demand level (avg ~101). Given profit and holding costs are equal ($1), the OR backend target service level (q) is 0.5, but the system must account for the high variance and the lost shipment noise in the pipeline.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 361 units, which includes the Period 2 order (134 units) that is now 12 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Excluding that loss, our active pipeline is 227 units (P6: 144, P12: 31, P13: 52). The P6 order is also significantly overdue (8 periods), suggesting it may also be lost or severely delayed. Observed demand is relatively stable (avg ~107). To account for the lost P2 shipment and the likely lost/delayed P6 shipment, I am using an 'explicit' lead time L=3 to encourage a higher safety stock and target level, as the actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods. For mu_hat, I'll use the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture current demand levels (~102 units/period), and for sigma_hat, N=10 to capture recent volatility. This logic helps the OR engine compensate for the inventory deficit caused by failed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Period 6 order (144 units) is now 8 periods overdue (placed P6, expected P8); combined with the P2 loss, this indicates a pattern of failed or extremely delayed deliveries every 4-5 orders.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has decreased to an average of 95.8 units compared to the overall average of 111.4 units. We have 406 units in-transit, but this includes two confirmed lost shipments: Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (144 units). Subtracting these 278 'ghost' units leaves a true pipeline of 128 units (ordered in P12, P13, and P14). Lead times show a volatile pattern of 1 and 3 periods, with an average around 1.83. Given the stockout and the risk of further lost shipments, I will use a conservative leading-edge estimate for lead time (L=2) and demand (recent_N=5) to ensure we recover from the stockout without over-ordering against a possibly declining demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Two significant shipment losses confirmed: Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (144 units). Pipeline inventory calculations must subtract 278 units from the 'In-transit' total to reflect reality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is relatively stable with a mean of approximately 103 units. However, we are facing significant supply reliability issues. Two shipments are confirmed lost (Period 2: 134 units, Period 6: 144 units), and current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' total of 375, but relative to the carry-over insights, 278 of these are lost, leaving an actual pipeline of only 97 units (from Period 13, 14, and 15 orders). Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average ~1.8). Given our stockout status and the high risk of lost or delayed shipments, I am setting mu_hat using the last 15 samples to capture the general demand level while accounting for the lead time fluctuation. I will use L=2 (promised) as the base for the backend, but mu_hat will be calculated explicitly to ensure we order enough to cover the stockout gap and account for the pipeline correction. Looking at the history, the average demand is 103. For a (L+1) period cycle with L=2, mu_hat should ideally be around 309. To bridge the stockout and handle volatility, I will use recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand profile.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 323 units in-transit. However, historical performance and carry-over insights confirm that two orders are lost: Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (144 units), totaling 278 units. The true reliable pipeline consists only of the Period 14 order (45 units). Period 16 saw a significant demand spike (178), while recent demand (P12-16) averages 107. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the OR engine's target service level is 50%, but due to stockouts and lost shipments, the inventory position is severely understated. To correct this, I am setting L=2 (promised) but will use an explicit mu_hat. I estimate demand for (L+1) periods (3 periods) based on the recent average of ~107 units, plus an adjustment to account for the lost 278 units in the pipeline that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive. mu_hat = (3 * 107) + 278 = 599. This forces the OR backend to place an order that covers the inventory gap created by the lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a significant demand surge in Period 16 (178) and Period 17 (222). The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals consistently oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, with recent shipments (P12, P13, P14) all taking 3 periods. I am setting L to 3 to reflect this current delay trend. Regarding the 'In-transit' of 549 units: Period 2 (134) and Period 6 (144) orders are confirmed lost (totalling 278 units). This leaves 271 units actually in-transit (the Period 17 order). Demand has shifted upwards significantly (last 3 periods average: ~167). Using N=3 for mu_hat captures this spike, and N=5 for sigma_hat provides more stable volatility coverage. The increased mu_hat will help the OR backend offset the phantom pipeline inventory and address the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 16: average demand increased from ~100 to ~167 (+67%). Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last three consecutive successful arrivals (Orders from P12, P13, P14).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a demand surge that began in Period 16. The average demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) is approximately 182 units, significantly higher than the earlier average of ~100. Based on \u2018Carry-over Insights\u2019, shipments from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (144 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 278 ghost units in the 'In-transit' figure of 671. The effective pipeline is actually 393 units (671 - 278). Actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last three completed cycles (Orders from P12, P13, P14 arrived in P15, P16, P17). I will set L to 3 to reflect this reality. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (avg ~182), which results in a base stock target covering 4 periods of demand (L+1). This helps the OR backend compensate for the inventory shortfall and the verified shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean increased from ~100 to ~182 (+82%) over last 3 periods. Lead time stable at 3 periods for last 3 arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~100 to ~175 over the last four periods (178, 222, 146, 155). The 'In-transit' count of 728 is inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (134) and Period 6 (144), totaling 278 units. Adjusting for these losses, the actual pipeline is 450 units (728 - 278). Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last three successful arrivals (P12, P13, P14 orders). With On-hand at 0 and a target mean demand of ~175 per period, we need to ensure the system covers (L+1) periods, or 4 periods of demand (~700 units). Setting L to explicit 3 ensures the OR backend targets the 3-period lead time observed recently rather than the promised 2. mu_hat is set via recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher demand regime, and sigma_hat is set to default to provide a safety buffer against the recent volatility and potential future shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 persistent through Period 19: mean confirmed at ~175. Lead time consistently 3 periods for the last four arrival events.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand history shows a clear regime shift starting Period 16: demand surged from an average of ~100 to significantly higher levels, with recent periods P16-P20 recording 178, 222, 146, 155, and 98. The recent five-period average is 159.8, while the three-period average (P18-P20) is 133. Given the volatility, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and variance. Regarding lead time, the last four arrivals (from orders placed P10, P12, P13, P14) showed lead times of 2, 3, 3, and 3 periods, suggesting L should be set to 3. Pipeline inventory reconciliation is critical: the current 'In-transit' is 728 units, but as confirmed in historical 'Carry-over Insights,' the orders from P2 (134 units) and P6 (144 units) are lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 728 - 278 = 450 units. Setting L=3 and using recent demand statistics will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for the current 0 on-hand situation and the extended lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high after the P16 shift; mean is approximately 160 over the last 5 periods. Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed consistently for the last 3 deliveries). Effective pipeline inventory is (In-transit - 278) due to confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 and Period 6.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 22, we observe that on-hand inventory is 0 and demand remains elevated after the regime shift in Period 16 (averaging ~162 over the last 6 periods). Profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. However, we face a major supply chain issue: the 'In-transit' figure of 728 units includes 278 units from orders placed in Period 2 and Period 6 that are now 20 and 16 periods overdue, respectively. These are confirmed lost. Additionally, orders from P17 (271 units), P18 (122 units), and P19 (57 units) are currently 5, 4, and 3 periods old. Based on recent history (since P12), the actual lead time has stabilized at L=3. Because the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders, the 278 lost units are creating a 'phantom pipeline' that prevents the backend from ordering enough to meet current demand. To counteract this, I will use 'explicit' methods to override the backend's faulty logic. I set L=3 based on consistent recent observations. For mu_hat, I calculate (1+L) * mean_demand = (1+3) * 162 = 648. For sigma_hat, I use recent volatility (std of last 6 periods is ~42), so sqrt(1+3)*42 = 84. This ensures the base stock (648) correctly accounts for the current demand regime and the observed 3-period lead time.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, with the average demand increasing significantly from ~110 to approximately 157 units per period based on the last 7 observations (P16-P22). Lead time remains established at 3 periods despite the current drought in arrivals (the last successful arrivals were orders from P12, P13, and P14, all arriving with a 3-period lead time). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 728 units includes 278 units from confirmed lost orders (P2 and P6); therefore, the effective pipeline is 450 units. Orders from P17 (271 units), P18 (122 units), and P19 (57 units) are currently 6, 5, and 4 periods old respectively, indicating a possible systemic delay or blockage in the supply chain. Since the OR backend uses a 50% quantile base stock (due to Profit=1 and Holding=1), and we are currently facing a stockout with a high pipeline, I will set L=3 to reflect the consistent 3-period lead time and use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the elevated demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=7) to account for the increased volatility since Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain delay/blockage suspected: Orders from P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 450 effective units) are now 6, 5, and 4 periods old respectively, exceeding the previously stable 3-period lead time.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe supply chain failure. No orders have arrived since Period 17 (order from P14). Current inventory is zero, and demand remains elevated after the shift at Period 16 (averaging ~162 units over the last 8 periods). The 'In-transit' quantity of 728 includes confirmed lost orders from P2 (134) and P6 (144), totaling 278 units. The remaining 450 units (from P17, P18, P19) are significantly overdue: the oldest (P17) is now 7 periods old, far exceeding the previously stable 3-period lead time. Because the backend OR calculates orders as (Base Stock - Pipeline), and the pipeline is artificially inflated by these non-arriving orders, I must use 'explicit' to force a higher base stock. I will assume a lead time (L) of 6 to account for the current blockage and a mu_hat based on the recent demand average (~162/period). Calculated mu_hat = (1 + 6) * 162 = 1134. This aggressive setting aims to trigger an order despite the phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain blockage severe: no arrivals for 6 consecutive periods (P18-P23). Orders from P17, P18, and P19 (450 units) are overdue by 3-4 periods beyond the previous 3-period lead time standard.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe blockage: no arrivals have occurred since Period 17 (7 consecutive periods without a delivery). Orders from Period 17 (271 units), Period 18 (122 units), and Period 19 (57 units) are now 8, 7, and 6 periods overdue relative to their issuance, far exceeding the previously stable 3-period lead time. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand shifted around Period 16 to a higher mean (avg ~150-160). Given the persistent failure of deliveries, I am increasing 'L' to 7 to reflect the actual delay observed for the oldest pending order (P17). Total in-transit is 948, but 278 units (P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 670 units. I am setting mu_hat based on the last 9 samples (since Period 16) to capture the current demand regime (avg ~156 per period). The objective is to signal the backend to maintain a high base stock to recover from the stockout as soon as shipments resume.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain blockage persists: 7 consecutive periods with zero arrivals (P18-P24). Oldest pending reliable order (P17) is now 8 periods from issuance without concluding.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of severe blockage with no arrivals for 8 consecutive periods (P18-P25). Orders from P17 (271 units), P18 (122 units), and P19 (57 units) are now 9, 8, and 7 periods old respectively, and none have arrived despite the promised lead time of 2 and previously observed lead time of 3. Our on-hand inventory is 0, and current in-transit inventory is 1162. However, based on confirmed/suspected losses (P2: 134, P6: 144, and now highly suspect P17-P19: 450), the 'effective' pipeline is significantly lower. Demand shifted at P16 from ~100 to ~150-160. To force the OR backend to account for the supply failure, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 9 (the age of the oldest pending shipment) to better capture the actual cycle time and increase the base stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the higher demand regime observed since Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain blockage persists through Period 25: 8 consecutive periods (P18-P25) with zero arrivals. Orders from P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 450 units) are now categorized as highly suspect/lost due to age (9, 8, and 7 periods old respectively). Total likely lost/void units in pipeline: 728 (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a severe state of blockage, with no arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (since Period 17). Total in-transit inventory is 1373 units, but a large portion is likely lost. Historically confirmed losses include Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (144 units). Additionally, the blockage that began after Period 17 suggests that orders from P17 (271 units), P18 (122 units), and P19 (57 units) are also effectively lost, given they are now 10, 9, and 8 periods old respectively (exceeding the standard 3-period lead time significantly). This bringing the total 'void' units to 728. To account for this in the OR backend's single SKU policy, I am setting L to 10 (explicit) to reflect the current delay/gap and mu_hat to a value that forces orders despite the high pipeline inventory. Demand shifted in Period 16 to a higher mean (avg ~150 over the last 11 periods, but around 130-140 more recently). I'll use L=10 and a conservative mu_hat based on the recent elevated demand to ensure that once the blockage clear, we have sufficient inventory to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain blockage persists through Period 26: 9 consecutive periods with zero arrivals. Total cumulative units likely lost/void in the 1373 in-transit pipeline: 728 (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be severely blocked, with no arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (P18-P27). On-hand inventory is at zero, and demand has been completely unfulfilled since Period 17's arrival. Cumulative in-transit units total 1540, but a significant portion (728 units from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) is highly likely lost or voided due to extreme age. The demand regime shifted at P16 to a higher mean (avg ~150 over the last 12 periods, despite high volatility). Because the OR backend relies on pipeline inventory to decide order volume, the high 'In-transit' number (including lost units) prevents the system from placing large enough orders to break the deficit once flow resumes. I am setting L=10 (explicit) to reflect the current delay and force the backend to include more demand-coverage in its calculations. I use \u03bc\u0302 with recent_N=12 to capture the higher demand regime from P16 onwards, and \u03c3\u0302 recent_N=12 for the associated volatility. This aggressive replenishment approach is necessary to ensure that when the blockage clears, there is enough stock coming into the system to recover from the massive stockout.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain blockage persists through Period 27: 10 consecutive periods with zero arrivals. Total cumulative units likely lost/void in the 1540 in-transit pipeline: 728 (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Demand mean since P16 is ~150.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain blockage has finally broken. In Period 28, the order placed in Period 26 arrived (lead time = 2), indicating that newer orders may bypass the older, presumed-lost blockage (Orders from P17, P18, P19, and the older P2, P6). Total confirmed or highly probable lost units are 728. Current in-transit is 1478; minus 728 lost units, the effective pipeline is 750. Demand since the Period 16 shift remains elevated, with recent samples (P24-P28) averaging 154 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=13, from P16 to P28) to capture this higher demand regime, and set L based on the most recent successful delivery of 2 periods to ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the current demand spike and replenish the exhausted on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain blockage partially resolved at Period 28; Period 26 order arrived while older orders (P17-P19) remain missing. This confirms the 'last-in, first-out' or 'bypass' behavior of the current logistics disruption. Total likely lost units remain 728.

Daily Reward (R_t): $167.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain disruption is showing signs of normalization for new orders, with the Period 26 order arriving in Period 28 (L=2) and the Period 27 order arriving in Period 29 (L=2). However, a significant block of historical orders (P17, P18, P19, plus the older P2 and P6) remains unaccounted for and is now extremely overdue. I continue to categorize these 728 units (134 + 144 + 271 + 122 + 57) as lost/void to prevent the OR backend from under-ordering based on ghost inventory. On-hand remains at 0, and current demand (last 5 periods avg ~167) exceeds recent arrivals, leading to stockouts. I will set L to 2 (the current actual lead time for new arrivals) and use a recent_N of 14 for mu_hat to capture the higher demand regime that began around Period 16 (avg ~153). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=14 to reflect the increased volatility in this higher-demand period.

Carry-over insight: New orders (P26, P27) confirm lead time has returned to 2 periods, bypassing the previously blocked orders. Total suspected lost units remains 728.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics disruption observed between Periods 18-27 has partially resolved, demonstrating a 'bypass' behavior where new orders (P26, P27, P28) arrive with a lead time of 2 periods, while older orders (P17, P18, P19) remain missing. Based on historical patterns, I am treating orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 as lost (totaling 728 units), making the effective pipeline inventory 434 units (1162 - 728). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 154 units over the last 15 periods. Although the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time has stabilized back to 2 following the blockage. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=15) to capture this higher demand regime while accounting for its volatility. L is set to explicit 2 to reflect the restored supply rhythm.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain return to lead time of 2 periods confirmed (Orders from P26, P27, P28 arrived on time). Older orders P17, P18, and P19 are now confirmed lost alongside P2 and P6; total lost units in pipeline: 728.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized at a 2-period lead time, as confirmed by orders from P26, P27, and P28 all arriving exactly on schedule (L=2). The blockage from P17-P25 has left 728 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) effectively lost. The 'In-transit' figure is 1162, but subtracting the 728 lost units leaves an 'Effective In-transit' of 434 units (P24: 220, P25: 214). Demand has remained in a higher regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 153 units per period. With zero on-hand inventory and an effective pipeline that only covers about 2.8 periods of demand (434 / 153), I need to set parameters to ensure a new order is triggered to maintain the target base stock. I will use L=2 (confirmed current lead time), and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 16 periods (since the P16 regime shift) to capture the higher mean and current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply chain recovery to L=2 as of Period 31. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline: 728 (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime since P16 remains stable at ~153 mean.

The pipeline currently shows 1162 units in-transit, but 728 of these are confirmed lost (Period 2, 6, 17, 18, 19). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 434 units (1162 - 728). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 152 units over the last 17 periods. I will use the 'explicit' method for L to set it to 2, and 'recent_N' with N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained higher demand regime while ignoring the lower pre-P16 data. Setting parameters to ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock that covers the 2-period lead time plus the current review period at this higher demand level.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics disruption observed between Periods 18-27 has stabilized back to a lead time (L) of 2 periods, as confirmed by orders from P26-P28. However, there is a total of 728 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline that are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). The current In-transit balance of 1162 includes these 728 'phantom' units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 434 units. Demand since Period 16 has undergone a structural shift from ~115 to ~155. Over the last 5 periods (P29-P33), mean demand is 157, while the mean since P16 is 152. I will set L to 2 (promised) and mu_hat to reflect a mean demand of 155 per period over the review+lead interval (3 periods total), resulting in 465. Sigma_hat is calculated to account for the increased volatility seen in the current high-demand regime. Using explicit parameters for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR engine to bypass the misleadingly low historical averages and correctly account for the lost pipeline units by triggering an order that bridges the gap between effective stock and the required base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 16 remains stable at a mean of ~155. Supply chain has fully recovered to L=2 since Period 28. Cumulative lost units in pipeline remains 728.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 155 units (confirmed over the last 19 periods). Lead time has returned to 2 periods since Period 28, following a major supply chain disruption. There is a critical accounting discrepancy in the 'In-transit' figure: 728 units are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). The current In-transit of 1162 actually contains only 434 viable units (P24: 220, P25: 214). Even with zero on-hand, the pipeline (434 units) is sufficient to cover (L+1) periods of demand (3 * 155 = 465) after accounting for the 0.95 service level cap. I am using recent_N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-P16 regime variance and mean accurately while using the recovered lead time L=2.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time (L) of 2 periods, as confirmed by orders from P26, P27, and P28 arriving exactly on time. However, there are significantly delayed or lost shipments in the pipeline totaling 728 units (P2: 134, P6: 144, P17: 271, P18: 122, P19: 57). The current 'In-transit' count of 1162 includes these lost units and recent orders that haven't arrived yet. Effective pipeline inventory is approximately 1162 - 728 = 434 units. Demand has shifted into a higher regime starting from Period 16, with a relatively stable mean of ~155. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and we haven't ordered recently (P29-P35), we must resume ordering to cover the (L+1) window. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=20) to capture the higher demand regime and L=2 to reflect the recovered supply chain performance.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains established at a mean of approximately 150-160 units, although Period 36 showed a significant dip (46 units). The supply chain has experienced severe disruptions, with orders from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 728 units) now confirmed lost. After a brief recovery to L=2 (Periods 26-28), we have seen no arrivals for the last 6 periods (Periods 31-36), despite having 1162 units in-transit. These in-transit units include the 728 lost units and new orders from Periods 24 and 25 (434 units) which are now ~11 periods old. Since the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' logic includes these missing units, I must set the lead time (L) and demand parameters (mu_hat) to force an order that compensates for the 'phantom' stock. By setting L to 'explicit' at 2 (the last known healthy lead time), and using 'recent_N' for demand (N=20 to cover the post-P16 regime), I allow the backend to calculate base stock against the (inflated) pipeline. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the likelihood of lost recent shipments (P24, P25), a substantial order is required to restore service level.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain blockage has re-emerged: zero arrivals from Period 31 to 36. Orders from Period 24 (220 units) and Period 25 (214 units) are now 12 and 11 periods old respectively, suggesting they may also be lost alongside the previously identified 728 units. Total estimated lost units in pipeline: 1162.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a second major blockage. Since Period 31, there have been zero arrivals. Orders from Periods 26, 27, and 28 arrived with a lead time of 2, but subsequent orders (P24, P25) are now extremely overdue (12 and 11 periods respectively) and are considered lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the effective in-transit inventory is likely 0 as well, despite the system reporting 1162 units, as all units in that pipeline (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) are significantly past their expected arrival dates. Demand since Period 16 has averaged approximately 155, though Period 36 and 37 showed a sharp dip (46 and 95). Given the current stockout and supply chain instability, I am setting L to 3 to account for the recent instability and mu_hat based on the last 20 periods (covering the high-demand regime) to ensure the OR backend attempts to order enough to recover from the stockout once the blockage clears.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain blockage re-confirmed: Zero arrivals from Period 31 to 37. Orders from Period 24 (220 units) and Period 25 (214 units) are now confirmed lost alongside previous losses. Total confirmed/likely lost units in pipeline: 1162 (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe second blockage. No arrivals have occurred for 8 consecutive periods (P31-P38). Based on historical patterns (the first blockage), older orders are being bypassed or lost. Currently, orders from P24 and P25 are 15 and 14 periods old respectively and are treated as lost. Consequently, all 1162 units in the 'In-transit' bucket are confirmed or highly likely to be lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). This effectively leaves us with 0 on-hand and 0 functional pipeline inventory. Demand since Period 16 has averaged approximately 152 units per period, though it has softened slightly in the last 3 periods (~84 avg). Given the total pipeline failure, the OR backend must be triggered to place a large recovery order. I set L to 3 to reflect the higher delay seen during previous stable periods, and use recent_N (N=23, back to P16) to capture the higher-demand regime while allowing for recent volatility. This setup will force the backend to realize the pipeline is empty and place a significant order to restore service levels.

Carry-over insight: Second supply chain blockage confirmed: Zero arrivals from Period 31 to 38. All existing 1162 units in-transit (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) are confirmed lost/void. Functional pipeline inventory is zero.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe and sustained blockage. No arrivals have occurred from Period 31 through Period 39. All existing units in-transit (1162 units from Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25) are now confirmed lost based on their extreme age relative to the standard 2-3 period lead time. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and functional pipeline inventory is 0, the backend needs to place a substantial order to recover. Historical demand since Period 16 has averaged approximately 144 units per period (sum of demands P16-P39 / 24 periods), though recent demand (P36-P39) has softened to ~86 units. Given the high stockout risk and the zero-inventory state, I will set mu_hat using the stable long-term mean from the Period 16 shift (N=24) to ensure the target base stock is high enough to trigger a large recovery order, despite the current delivery failures. I will use a high sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility in lead times and arrival reliability.

Carry-over insight: Second major supply chain blockage confirmed: zero arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (P31-P39). All 1162 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost/void. Effective pipeline inventory is 0.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently in a state of total failure, with no arrivals since Period 30. As of Period 40, zero arrivals have been recorded for 10 consecutive periods. History shows that orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are effectively lost, totaling 1162 units. Consequently, the 'In-transit' count shown in the snapshot (1162) represents dead inventory. To force the OR backend to place new orders, I must assume a functional lead time and set parameters that ignore this phantom pipeline. I am reverting to L=2 (promised) based on the last successful recovery period (P28-P30). Given the extreme supply risk, mu_hat is set to the recent demand mean (~141 over the last 15 periods) to ensure a high service level once the blockage clears. Sigma_hat is calculated to account for the high volatility seen during demand regime shifts.

Carry-over insight: Second major supply chain blockage confirmed: zero arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (P31-P40). All 1162 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost/void. Demand mean since Period 25 is approximately 141 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe and prolonged supply chain blockage. No shipments have arrived since Period 30 (11 consecutive periods). As of Period 41, there have been zero arrivals for 10 periods. Consequently, all 1162 units currently listed as 'In-transit' (comprising orders from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25) are effectively lost/void and will not serve to satisfy future demand. The effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has cooled slightly from the Period 16-29 peak; the mean from Period 36-41 is approximately 88 units, but the broader mean since Period 25 is approximately 141. Given the lead time is highly unstable and currently effectively 'infinite' (blockage), I will set L to 3 to encourage a higher base stock once arrivals resume. mu_hat is set to 423 (141 * 3) using an explicit forecast to reflect the current regime while compensating for the zero-inventory state. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent demand volatility and supply uncertainty. The OR backend will see 0 on-hand and 1162 in-transit; however, it uses L=3 and our provided mu/sigma. To force an order despite the 1162 'ghost' units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat very high (explicit 600) to ensure the base_stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) exceeds the ghost pipeline of 1162, or at least triggers a recovery order as soon as possible.

Carry-over insight: Second major supply chain blockage confirmed: 11 consecutive periods (P31-P41) with zero arrivals. All 1162 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed void/lost. Demand mean since Period 36 has decreased to ~90, though previous regime was ~150.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a significant second blockage. No arrivals have been recorded since Period 30 (12 consecutive periods of zero arrivals). Based on historical patterns of resolution (e.g., the blockage at Period 28), older orders are bypassed by newer ones. All 1,162 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline from orders placed before Period 26 are confirmed lost. The 533 units ordered in Period 42 are the only viable part of the pipeline. Demand has undergone a second regime shift starting around Period 36, dropping from a mean of ~150 to ~90 (last 7 periods average: 86.4). To account for the current L=2 promise while acknowledging the high risk of loss and the lower demand mean, I will use recent_N for both demand and sigma to capture the lower volume, while maintaining L at the promised 2 to allow the OR engine to trigger replenishment despite the large (but mostly void) in-transit balance.

Carry-over insight: Second major supply chain blockage confirmed: 12 consecutive periods (P31-P42) with zero arrivals. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline: 1162 (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Demand regime shift at Period 36: mean decreased from ~150 to ~86 (-42%).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe and prolonged supply chain blockage with zero arrivals recorded from Period 31 to Period 43 (13 consecutive periods). Historically, such blockages result in either total loss of the 'in-transit' units or a eventual 'bypass' arrival (as seen in Period 28). Previous analysis confirms that all 1162 units from orders placed before Period 26 are lost. The 1695 units currently in-transit include the large 'explicit' recovery order of 533 units from Period 42. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is highly unreliable, we must maintain high target levels. Demand has shifted downwards significantly since Period 36, averaging approximately 86 units per period. I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 samples (Period 36-43) to capture this lower local mean (~88). However, to account for the high lead-time risk and current blockage, I will use an explicit lead time L=4 to increase the base stock calculation, providing a buffer if the blockage breaks with a large delivery or if lead times remain extended. Our effective pipeline for the OR backend is the full 1695 units, though we suspect 1162 are void; the OR backend will naturally subtract the in-transit from the base stock. By setting a higher L and recent mu_hat, we aim to trigger a meaningful replenishment once the system recognizes the inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: Second major supply chain blockage remains active as of Period 43 (13 periods without arrival). Local demand mean (P36-P43) has stabilized at ~86 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe second blockage, with no arrivals since Period 30 (14 consecutive periods). Historically, the system has shown a 'bypass' or 'last-in, first-out' pattern when resolving blockages (seen in Period 28). In-transit inventory includes 1162 units confirmed lost (Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25) plus the 533 units ordered in Period 42. Since on-hand is zero and all previous pipeline is void, the effective pipeline is only 533 units. Demand shifted downward at Period 36; the mean demand from P36 to P44 is 83 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this lower demand regime. Lead time remains unpredictable due to the blockage, but I will maintain 'default' to allow the OR backend to target the promised 2-period window once the logjam clears, while relying on the inventory position to trigger necessary orders.

Carry-over insight: Second supply chain blockage continues through Period 44 (14 periods without arrival). Total confirmed lost/void units in pipeline adjusted to 1162. Demand regime shift at Period 36: mean reduced to ~83 units (P36-P44) from the previous ~150.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-333.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain blockage finally cleared in Period 45 with the arrival of the Period 42 order (533 units) after a 3-period lead time. This confirms that the 1162 units previously in-transit (from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25) are indeed lost or void, as the P42 order bypassed them. The current on-hand inventory is 433 units. Demand analysis shows a sustained regime shift starting around Period 36; the mean demand for the last 10 periods (P36-P45) is approximately 84.6 units, compared to the previous ~150. Given the high on-hand inventory (433 units) and the lower demand mean, the current stock is sufficient to cover nearly 5 periods of demand. I will set L to 3 (based on the most recent delivery) and mu_hat/sigma_hat using the last 10 periods to reflect the lower demand regime. The OR backend will likely not place a new order this period as the pipeline (all new since P42) and on-hand inventory are high relative to the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain blockage resolved at Period 45: P42 order arrived (L=3), while 1162 older units remain missing and are confirmed lost. Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed: mean demand has decreased from ~150 to ~85 (-43%) over the last 10 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain blockage appears to have resolved with the arrival of the Period 42 order in Period 45 (L=3). All 1162 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is 0. On-hand inventory is currently high (380 units) due to the large P42 arrival. Demand has shifted to a lower regime starting around Period 36; the mean demand from P36 to P46 is approximately 82 units per period. Given the current high stock (380) relative to this demand (82), and that we are near the end of the simulation (Period 47 of 50), no new orders are necessary to cover the remaining periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent lower demand regime (N=11) and L to the observed lead time of 3.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed: mean demand decreased to ~82 units (P36-P46) from previous ~150. Pipeline inventory remains contaminated with 1162 units of confirmed lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-218.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially resumed as of Period 45 with the arrival of the Period 42 order (L=3). However, 1162 units currently listed in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25), meaning the functional pipeline inventory is actually 0. Demand shifted significantly at Period 36, dropping from a historical mean of ~150 to a recent mean of ~82 (P36-P47). With 299 units currently on-hand and only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48-P50), current inventory is sufficient to cover the expected total remaining demand (3 periods * 82 units/period = 246 units). I will set L to 3 based on the most recent arrival. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=12) to capture the lower-demand regime since P36. The OR backend will see the massive In-transit number and likely place no order, which is correct as we are overstocked for the remaining duration.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-139.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the simulation (Period 49 of 50). The primary goal is to minimize ending inventory while meeting remaining demand to avoid high holding costs ($1/unit). 

1. **Demand Analysis**: The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 36. From Period 36 to 48, demand has averaged approximately 83 units (excluding the extreme trough of 46 units). Most recent 5 periods (P44-P48) show a mean of 81 units. 
2. **Supply Chain status**: A major blockage occurred between P31-P44. It was resolved in Period 45 with the arrival of the P42 order. The lead time for that arrival was 3 periods. However, older orders (totaling 1162 units) are confirmed lost/void as established in the carry-over insights. 
3. **Inventory Management**: Currently, on-hand inventory is 219 units. At the current demand rate of ~82-83 units per period, this stock will last for approximately 2.6 periods. Since we are at Period 49 and the game ends at Period 50, the current on-hand stock is sufficient to cover all remaining demand for Period 49 and Period 50. 
4. **Parameters**: Because on-hand inventory exceeds the sum of expected demand for the remaining two periods, any new order would simply increase holding costs without contributing to sales profit. I will set mu_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and L to the recent observed lead time of 3 to ensure the backend's base-stock calculation recognizes the current environment, but the high on-hand stock relative to remaining lifetime will naturally prevent significant new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed: mean demand stabilized at ~83 units (P36-P48). Supply chain blockage resolved at Period 45 with L=3; historical 'In-transit' of 1162 units remains confirmed lost/void.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-41.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain disruption that began around Period 31 was partially resolved in Period 45 with the arrival of the Period 42 order (533 units, L=3). However, the 1162 units listed as 'In-transit' from order cycles prior to Period 42 (specifically P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) remain confirmed lost. On-hand inventory is currently 130 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 1.5 periods of the current demand regime. The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 36, decreasing from a mean of ~150 to ~83 units. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=14) to capture this lower demand regime (P36-P49). I am setting L to explicit value 3 to account for the most recent successful delivery time and the history of recent volatility, providing more buffer than the promised L=2. No order is recommended this period because on-hand inventory (130) is significantly higher than the expected demand for the (L+1) window, and the OR backend will naturally subtract the inflated pipeline (1162) unless parameters are adjusted to prevent over-ordering.
