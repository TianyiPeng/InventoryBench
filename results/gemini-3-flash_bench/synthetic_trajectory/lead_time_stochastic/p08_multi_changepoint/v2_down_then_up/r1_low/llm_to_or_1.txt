Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The historical demand for the last 5 periods were 95, 113, 106, 84, and 71. The average demand across these 5 periods is 93.8. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Currently, we have 0 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. To ensure we can meet demand for the current period plus the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods), I will set mu_hat based on the average of all available samples (recent_N with N=5) to capture the current demand level. Sigma_hat will also be based on these 5 periods to account for the observed volatility. L is set to default (promised 2) until we observe actual delivery times.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 122 units were ordered, but since the promised lead time is 2, those units are correctly in-transit and not yet arrived. The observed demand in Period 1 was 124 units. Historical demand samples (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) plus the recent Period 1 demand (124) show an average around 100 units per period. With a lead time of 2, the order cycle covers 3 periods (L+1). My current pipeline (122 units) is slightly below the expected 3-period demand (~300 units). I will use the default lead time (2) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 (current samples + Period 1) to capture the recent volatility. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover demand while balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (50% service level target).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Based on the history, the promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (122 units) and Period 2 (131 units). Since the lead time is 2, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution phase (visible in Period 4's start). As of now, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have had back-to-back periods of lost sales (124 in P1, 71 in P2) because no stock was available. The current in-transit amount of 253 units correctly reflects the sum of P1 and P2 orders (122 + 131). The historical demand for Periods 1-5 (provided in context) shows a downward trend: 95 (seed), 113 (seed), 106 (seed), 84, 71. However, the game history for P1 and P2 shows demand of 124 and 71. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the most recent volatility without over-reacting to the single high P1 demand point, while keeping lead time at the default promised value of 2.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (122 units) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0 for chips(Regular). This indicates either a lead time longer than 2 or a lost shipment. Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is being lost (0 sold units across 3 periods), we must prioritize getting stock. Historical demand samples (P1-P5) are 95, 113, 106, 84, 71 (average ~94). However, our game history shows actual demand for P1-P3 inside the simulation was 124, 71, 57. The 'In-transit' total is 266 (122+131+13), which matches the orders from P1-P3. Because the P1 order is now overdue (should have arrived P3), I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the delay. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=3 to capture the specific demand trend seen in the game history (avg 84), while the backend will scale this by (1+L).

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two orders arrived: the Period 1 order (122 units) with an actual lead time of 3 periods, and the Period 3 order (13 units) with an actual lead time of 1 period. The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. Demand history: P1:95, P2:113, P3:106, P4:84, P5:71 (Note: 'arrived' messages report captured demand during the period, while historical demand samples provided in prompt indicate actual demand). Mean demand = (95+113+106+84+71)/5 = 93.8. Standard deviation is ~17. Since lead times are fluctuating (1 to 3 periods), I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average valid arrivals. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5 samples show a slight downward trend (84, 71), so I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent average relative to the review cycle (L+1). For volatility (sigma_hat), 'default' across all samples is appropriate given the small sample size.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods has been 124, 71, 57, 103, 103 (Mean \u2248 91.6). Lead time observations so far: P1 arrived P4 (L=3), P3 arrived P4 (L=1). The P2 order (131 units) is currently overdue if we assume L=2 or L=3, having missed the P5 conclude window. Promised L is 2. Arrival variability is high. Currently, we have 309 in transit (P2: 131, P4: 70, P5: 108). To stabilize, I will use recent_N for demand forecasting (N=5) to capture the current mean more effectively than the long-term average, and 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to average the observed noise. mu_hat will be set to (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 367 units in-transit. Historical demand shows significant variability but no clear seasonal trend yet (P1: 124, P5: 103, P6: 139). Our lead time performance is inconsistent: P1 arrived in 3 periods (promised 2), P3 arrived in 1 period, and P2's order (131 units) is currently missing (ordered P2, should have arrived by P4/P5, now P7). This missing shipment is a major risk. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay and missing units, and mu_hat using recent_N=5 (all available representative samples) to capture the current mean demand of ~105 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the high observed volatility. Increasing L helps the OR backend raise the safety stock level to protect against the high holding-cost-to-profit ratio (1:1) and the unreliability of the supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability detected: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, P2 order is significantly overdue (missing for 3+ periods beyond promise).

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The stock situation is critical with 0 on-hand inventory and we have experienced a series of stockouts due to lead time variability. Order P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, P4 took 3 periods, and P2 (131 units) is now 6 periods late (ordered P2, currently P8), suggesting it is lost. Total in-transit is 309 (P2: 131, P5: 108, P6: 58, P7: 12). Since P2 is likely lost, the effective in-transit is closer to 178. Demand has been fluctuating with an average near 100 per period (P1-P7 mean \u2248 101). Given the unreliability and the high cost of stockouts (profit=holding=$1), I will set L to 3 to reflect the actual observed delay (vs promised 2) and use a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the current mean (approx 105). This aims to increase the base stock level to provide a buffer against the erratic arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Order P2 (131 units) confirmed likely lost (overdue by 4 periods beyond promised lead time). Actual lead time for successful deliveries (P1, P4) is 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9, the actual lead time pattern shows high volatility with two modes: a 'slow' path (3 periods for P1, P4, P5) and a 'fast' path (1 period for P3, P7). Order P2 (placed Period 2) is effectively lost, as it is 4 periods past its promised delivery. The mean shipment arrival time (averaging 3, 1, 3, 3, 1) is 2.2, but to protect against the frequent 3-period lead time, I will set L to 3. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has fluctuated but shows a slight declining trend recently (P6: 139, P7: 111, P8: 79). I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the mean demand of ~103 units while accounting for the high volatility. With an on-hand inventory of 41 and 291 units in transit (P6, P8), the L=3 setting combined with recent demand should stabilize the stockout risk seen in Periods 5-7.

Carry-over insight: Persistent lead time bimodal distribution: 'Slow' (3 periods) and 'Fast' (1 period). L=3 is currently the safest operational upper bound for parameter computation.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a stable demand pattern around a mean of ~94 units per period (Avg of 9 samples provided in prompt + 4 history = 13 total). Inventory management is complicated by a bimodal lead time distribution: deliveries either arrive in 1 period (P3, P7, P8) or 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), while order P2 is confirmed lost. With on-hand at 35 units and 285 units in-transit (P6, P9, P10 orders), we must buffer against the 'Slow' 3-period lead time. To ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation (L+1 periods) covers potential 3-period delays, I am setting L=3 explicitly. Since demand is currently stable with no seasonal shifts visible in the provided 'Period_X' labels, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent variance while filtering out the initial noise. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the pipeline and the current on-hand of 35.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling 35 units against a demand of 64 in Period 10. The system shows 397 units in-transit (Orders from P2 [likely lost], P6, P9, and P10). Analysis of historical arrivals confirms a bimodal lead time: 'Slow' arrivals at 3 periods (P1, P4, P5) and 'Fast' arrivals at 1 period (P3, P7, P8). Order P2 is clearly lost. To ensure availability given the 'Slow' possibility, L is set to 3. Demand is stable, with the mean across 10 periods being 95.9. Using recent_N=5 for demand (avg 100.2) captures the current regime while buffering against stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed bimodal lead time distribution: Mode A = 1 period (50%), Mode B = 3 periods (50%). Operational L remains 3 to prevent stockouts during slow delivery cycles.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand inventory and heavy stockouts in Period 11. Analysis of lead times confirms a bimodal pattern: orders arrive in either 1 period (P3, P7, P8) or 3 periods (P1, P4, P5). Order P2 is confirmed lost. My previous setting of L=3 remains the safest operational choice to account for the 'slow' mode and prevent prolonged stockouts. Current demand shows high variability (range roughly 60-140) but no clear regime shift; therefore, I will use a larger sample (N=10) to calculate mean demand. With zero on-hand and 401 units in-transit (P6, P9, P10, P11), the OR backend needs parameters that ensure the base stock levels (covering L+1=4 periods) are high enough to trigger sufficient ordering if those in-transits are further delayed, while z* (determined by profit/holding cost) naturally targets a 50% service level due to equal costs.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory Situation: We have 80 units on-hand and 193 in-transit. Total pipeline is 273 units. Recent demand has been variable but averages around 95 units per period. 

Lead Time Analysis: The lead time continues to be bimodal and inconsistent. We've seen 1, 2 (latest Period 10 arrival), and 3-period lead times. Period 12 saw a large arrival of 208 units (from Period 9 and 10 orders), resolving some of the previous stockouts. To stay protected against the 'slow' mode (3 periods), I will maintain L=2 as the explicit operational lead time for the backend, which combined with the (L+1) logic in the OR engine, effectively targets coverage for 3 periods. 

Demand Analysis: Demand in the last 5 periods (P8-P12) was 79, 108, 64, 70, 128 (average ~90). The early history (P1-P5) was 124, 71, 57, 103, 103 (average ~92). The demand appears stable around a mean of 90-95 with moderate variance. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent volatility while maintaining the L=2 setting (targeting 3 periods worth of stock).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time variability includes 1, 2, and 3 periods. Period 10 order arrived in 2 periods, while Period 9 took 3 periods. Lead time estimate L=2 used to ensure (L+1)=3 periods of demand coverage.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 after exhausting 80 units in Period 13 (demand 137, 57 units lost). Pipeline inventory is 193 units (P6: 58, P11: 4, P12: 0, P13: 0 - Wait, total in-transit is 193. Let's re-verify: P6(58), P11(4), and P13(0), but the prompt states 193. The discrepancy suggests unlisted historical orders or internal OR state. I must protect against the stockout. Lead times (L) have been 1, 2, or 3 periods. I will set L=2 (explicit) to target a 3-period demand window (L+1). Demand has been volatile: the mean of all samples is ~97, but recent demand (last 3 periods) is higher (~111). I'll use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat (approx 94.6 * 3 = 283.8) and sigma_hat to capture recent variability. The high profit/holding ratio (1:1) suggests a 50% service level target (critical base stock logic), so the backend will aim to cover the mean demand. Given the stockout in P13, a slightly higher buffer is needed.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a stockout in Period 14 where only 4 units were sold out of 106 demand. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1, 2, and 3 periods (Mode: 2.3 periods). To provide sufficient demand coverage while accounting for both review and lead time, I am setting L=3 to cover the (L+1)=4 period window. This higher L value helps the OR backend compute a base stock that accounts for the frequent delays seen in history (e.g., P11 took 3 periods). The demand remains stable without clear regime shifts; therefore, I am using the mean of the most recent 10 periods (avg ~94.5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N=10 allows for a reliable estimate that ignores the very early noisy startups while capturing current variability. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1), targeting a 50% service level which the backend will optimize.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 15. Demand remains stable, with the most recent five samples (P11-P15) averaging 106.2 units. Lead time is highly variable, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods, and one confirmed lost shipment (P2). To calculate appropriate base stock levels, we must cover demand for the remaining review period plus the lead time. Given the 'Slow' mode (L=3) and the risk of stockouts seen in P11 and P13-15 where arrivals were delayed or insufficient, using L=2 (explicit) provides a balanced (L+1)=3 periods of demand coverage. Mu_hat is set to the mean of the last 10 periods (95.4 per period) to reflect recent stable demand, and sigma_hat is calculated from the same period to capture volatility.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 418 units in transit. Historical demand analysis shows a relatively stable mean around 95-105 units, with some volatility. Lead times have been highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with one order (Period 2) likely lost. Significant stockouts have occurred because arrivals are lumpy. For Period 17, I am maintaining an operational Lead Time (L) of 2, which requires the base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. This aligns with recent history where orders arrive within 2-3 periods. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=10 to capture the current demand regime which averages ~90-100 units per period. The 418 units in-transit (from Periods 14, 15, and potentially 16) should arrive soon; since pipeline inventory is high, the OR backend will cap the order correctly to avoid excessive holding costs once those shipments arrive.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 18. On-hand = 40, In-transit = 306 (Period 15 order of 117, plus potential unfulfilled demand logic from OR system). Looking at lead times: P14 arrived in 3 periods at P17. P15 (117 units) was ordered at P15; with an expected lead time of 2-3 periods, it should arrive in P17 or P18. P2 (131 units) is definitely lost. The actual lead time distribution remains highly variable (1, 2, or 3 periods). Demand over all samples (P1-P17) averages ~95 units. To ensure coverage for (L+1) = 3 periods of demand, I will set L to 2, mu_hat to cover (L+1)=3 periods using the overall mean, and sigma_hat using the overall standard deviation to account for the consistent volatility. This approach balances the stockout risk seen in Periods 13-16 with the holding cost risk when deliveries finally arrive.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 19 with 0 on-hand inventory and 306 units in-transit. Historical demand has remained relatively stable (mean ~94.5), but lead times are highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. Looking at the history, orders from Period 15 (117 units) are currently at a lead time of 4 periods with no arrival yet (overdue), while orders from Periods 16-18 were zero. This suggests our pipeline inventory of 306 (P14-P18 remaining) is unreliable or delayed. We have stockouts in Period 18. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend q is 0.5 (z=0), aiming for mean demand coverage. Based on the bimodal lead time observations (average ~2.3), I am setting L=3 to ensure we cover the lead time + review period (Total 4 periods) to recover from the current stockout and buffer against the demonstrated 3-period max lead time. Demand is calculated using recent_N=10 to capture the current mean of ~88.8 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Lead time upper bound remains 3 periods, but shipment from Period 15 is now overdue by 1 period relative to the 3-period max, suggesting potential loss or further delay.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand, with 356 units in-transit. The order from Period 15 (117 units) is now 5 periods old (ordered Period 15, current Period 20), which is 2 periods beyond the observed maximum lead time of 3. Based on the pattern of Period 2's lost shipment, I must assume Period 15's order is lost and remove it from the pipeline calculation (356 - 117 = 239 active units). Demand remains relatively stable between 40-140 units, with a recent mean around 90. Based on history, successful lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure (L+1) coverage, I am setting L=3 to account for the slow delivery mode (3 periods), ensuring we cover 4 periods of demand. I use recent_N=14 to reflect the demand regime since Period 6, which captures current volatility while excluding initial noise.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Order P15 (117 units) confirmed likely lost (overdue by 2 periods beyond the 3-period max lead time). Net pipeline inventory adjusted accordingly.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 368 units in transit. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability but generally fluctuates around a mean of ~89.7 units per period. The lead time (L) has exhibited a bimodal/variable distribution of 1, 2, or 3 periods. Most importantly, order P15 (117 units) is now overdue by 2 periods beyond the 3-period maximum observation, confirming it as a lost shipment based on carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory visible in the 'In-transit' field (368 units) includes this lost shipment. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 368 - 117 = 251 units (consisting of orders from P19 and P20). I will set L=3 as the planning horizon to ensure demand coverage for (L+1)=4 periods, aiming for a base stock that accounts for current stockouts. Using recent_N=10 for demand reflects the steady state better than the whole history, balancing the need to replenish against high holding costs.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and the 'In-transit' quantity of 368 units includes orders that are likely lost. Specifically, order P15 (117 units) was confirmed lost in Period 20, and the pipeline includes older orders (P19=50, P20=12) and the massive seed data demand. Lead times have historically fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting a high degree of uncertainty. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 72.8 units per period, while total historical average is 89.2. To avoid massive over-ordering against a ghost pipeline, yet protect against the current stockout, I am setting L=2 (the current working average) and mu_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect the slightly lower recent demand trend. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to capture the current volatility while ignoring the higher initial seed volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant backlog of demand across periods 20-22. The in-transit inventory of 368 units comprises orders from Period 19 (50 units), Period 20 (12 units), and potentially overdue shipments, though Period 15 (117 units) was already flagged as likely lost in the carry-over insights. Historically, lead times have been highly variable (1, 2, or 3 periods). Order P19 (placed in Period 19) is currently at lead_time=3 relative to this decision period. If it does not arrive during Period 23, we will continue to stock out. Demand is relatively stable but shows slight fluctuations; the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P13-P22) is approximately 83 units. I am setting L to an explicit value of 2 to ensure the OR backend targets coverage for 3 periods (L+1) of demand, which aligns with the observed upper bound of lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=10 to capture the current demand regime (averaging approx 83/period, so mu_hat should target ~250 for 3 periods).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Demand continues at a consistent average. Looking at arrival patterns, lead times vary widely (1 to 3 periods), and several orders are confirmed lost. Specifically, order P15 (117 units) from Period 15 is lost, and the orders from P19 (50 units) and P20 (12 units, which already arrived) are accounted for. The current in-transit inventory (356 units) refers to orders placed between P1 and P23 that have not arrived or haven't been resolved as lost. However, looking at the history, orders from Period 1 to 14 have mostly been resolved (either arrived or lost). The 'In-transit' figure seems to include the likely-lost P2 (131) and P15 (117). Adjusting for these, net reliable pipeline inventory is approximately 108 units. I will set L=3 as the operational lead time to ensure coverage (L+1=4 periods) against the 'slow' delivery mode. mu_hat will be based on the recent demand average (~90 units/period) multiplied by (L+1)=4. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N 10' to capture recent demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory is currently at 0 on-hand with 356 units in-transit. A critical analysis of the pipeline shows that the order from Period 19 (50 units) is now at its 5th period since ordering. With a maximum observed lead time of 3 periods, and the order from Period 20 already arrived at Period 23 (lead time 3), it is highly probable that the Period 19 order is lost, similar to the losses observed at P2 and P15. Currently, the pipeline is dominated by orders which are likely already in their transit window but haven't arrived. I will set L=3 as the operational lead time to account for the upper bound of the bimodal distribution (1-3 periods). Historical demand has been relatively stable around a mean of ~88 units since Period 15, but has shown high variance. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent mean of ~74 units while ensuring (L+1)=4 periods of demand coverage. This strategy aims to rebuild on-hand inventory while accounting for confirmed high delivery unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Order P19 (50 units) confirmed likely lost (overdue by 2 periods beyond the 3-period max lead time). This marks the third confirmed lost shipment (P2, P15, P19), suggesting a ~15-20% loss rate in the supply chain.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been fairly stable, with a mean of approximately 88 units. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable, with a ~15-20% loss rate (P2, P15, and P19 confirmed lost) and lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 356 units in-transit. Since the last order was placed in Period 20 and we are now at Period 26, and all orders from P19 and earlier are considered lost, the 356 units in-transit must come from orders placed between P21 and P25. However, the history shows that no orders were placed in P21-P25. This suggests the 356 units are likely the sum of recently placed large orders or a backlog that the OR backend is tracking. Given that L=3 is our safety upper bound for lead time and we have 0 on-hand, I will use L=3 and set mu_hat based on the last 15 samples to capture the recent average demand (approx 83). This effectively targets a pipeline inventory to cover (3+1)=4 periods of demand (~332 units). Since the OR engine's pipeline calculation includes the 356 in-transit units, it will likely place a small or zero order this period if it considers those units 'active'. We must maintain L=3 to ensure the backend uses a high enough safety stock to buffer against the frequent shipment losses and lead time variability.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical demand shows a downward trend over the last 10 periods (averaging ~58 units) compared to the overall average of ~84 units. Based on CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS, lead times are bimodal (1-3 periods) with a significant shipment loss rate (approx. 15-20%). To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining service levels despite the loss rate and current stockout, I am using L=3 as the operational lead time. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock covering (L+1)=4 periods of demand. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect the lower recent demand regime, while using sigma_hat for the same period to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 20-27) shows a significant decrease in mean demand compared to the start of the simulation. For Periods 21-27, the mean is approximately 63 units/period, whereas the earlier periods were closer to 100 units/period. The current pipeline (in-transit) is 356 units. However, based on Carry-Over Insights, there is a consistent risk of lost shipments (P2, P15, P19 were lost). There are currently no shipments arrived since Period 23, and the store is out of stock. The current 'In-transit' figure likely includes several recently placed orders that haven't arrived yet. I will set L=3 as the planning horizon to account for the slow mode of the bimodal lead time distribution. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (mean ~63) which will help the OR backend avoid over-ordering while trying to replenish the stockout. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will target given these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: average demand decreased from ~100 to ~63 units/period (-37%). Shipments from periods 21-27 are currently within the observed 1-3 period lead time window, though several periods of zero arrivals suggest either a long lead time cluster or further losses.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 21) shows a significantly lower average of approximately 61 units per period compared to the initial 100+ units. I will use N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent low-demand regime (Periods 21-28). The lead time remains highly variable (1-3 periods), and we have experienced multiple lost shipments (P2, P15, P19). Currently, the 'In-transit' balance of 356 units is massive relative to the current demand (~61) and includes the 131 units from P2, 117 units from P15, and 50 units from P19. Since these 298 units are almost certainly lost, the effective pipeline inventory is only 58 units. However, because the OR backend is unaware of lost shipments and calculates orders based on 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', a large stale in-transit value will prevent the system from ordering. I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat of 183 units (based on mean of ~61 * (L+1=3)) and sigma_hat. Given the mismatch between the backend's pipeline view (356) and the actual/effective pipeline (~58), the OR engine is likely to stop ordering. To maintain service levels despite the system's inflated inventory view, I will monitor if a manual override to base stock is needed, but for now, I will use recent_N to reflect the new demand reality.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand distribution has shifted to a lower regime starting around Period 21. Mean demand since P21 is approximately 59.1 units/period, compared to the earlier baseline of ~100. Lead times remain highly volatile, with observed values ranging from 1 to 3 periods, and a failure to receive any shipments since Period 23 (despite 356 units in transit comprising several older orders). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Given the 'in-transit' total includes orders from P2, P15, and P19 which are confirmed lost per carry-over insights, the real pipeline is smaller than the 356 units reported. I will set L=3 as the operational lead time to provide a wider coverage window (L+1=4 periods) to account for the frequent 3-period lead time and missing inventory. I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (P21-P29).

Carry-over insight: Prolonged inventory drought: No arrivals since Period 23 (7 periods). Orders from P21-P27 are now exceeding the 3-period max lead time, suggesting either a massive supply chain blockage or an increase in the loss rate beyond the previous 15-20% estimate.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a severe inventory drought with 0 on-hand inventory and no arrivals since Period 23 (8 periods ago). There is a massive backlog in the pipeline (356 units) consisting of orders from Periods 6, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30. Historically, the max lead time was 3 periods. Orders from P21-P27 are now significantly overdue (3-9 periods past the expected 3-period max). The demand regime shifted around Period 21, dropping from ~100 to ~63 units/period. The current 'In-transit' balance of 356 units is vastly higher than the required base stock for a lead time of 3 (which would be roughly (3+1)*63 = 252). Adding more orders now would only increase holding risk if the blockage clears all at once, or be wasted if the shipments are truly lost. I am setting L to the historical max of 3 to maintain the calculation window, and using recent_N for mu_hat (N=10) to capture the lower demand regime (avg ~60). No new orders will be triggered by the OR backend because pipeline (356) > base_stock (~252).

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: No arrivals for 8 consecutive periods. Orders from P21-P27 (inclusive) are overdue by 3-9 periods beyond the historical max lead time of 3. Total pipeline inventory (356) now represents ~6 periods of demand at the current regime (~60/period).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has effectively collapsed, with no arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (since Period 23). Orders from Period 21 through Period 27 (totaling 356 units) are now extremely overdue (5-11 periods). Based on the established historical maximum lead time of 3 periods, these orders are statistically lost or caught in a systemic failure. The demand regime shifted at Period 21 to approximately 62 units/period (mean of samples P21-P31). Because 'In-transit' is 356 and current demand is low, the OR backend's capped policy [final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)] will result in zero orders as long as the pipeline is perceived as full (356 units). To force the engine to place new orders and attempt to bypass the blocked pipeline, I must treat the 356 units as lost. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=11) to capture the lower demand regime and set L to 'explicit' with a value of 2 to maintain standard coverage. By identifying these orders as lost in the rationale and allowing the system to see the necessity of replenishment, we aim to recover from the stockout. However, the current inventory view still counts these units in-transit; therefore, I must set the mu_hat to a very high 'explicit' value to exceed the phantom pipeline or wait for system resolution. Given the constraints, I will use 'recent_N' for demand to remain statistically grounded while signaling the backlog issue.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment failure confirmed: Total pipeline of 356 units (P21-P27) is now 8+ periods overdue and considered lost. Zero inventory arrivals for 9 consecutive periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has completely collapsed. No inventory has arrived for 10 consecutive periods (since Period 23). Orders from P21-P27 (totaling 356 units currently listed as 'in-transit') are now between 6 and 12 periods old\u2014far exceeding the historical maximum lead time of 3 periods. In Period 32, we officially designated this entire pipeline as lost to stop the OR backend from incorrectly assuming we are 'well-stocked'. Since zero units have arrived and demand has been consistently lost, on-hand inventory remains 0. Current demand is in a lower regime of ~60 units/period. Because the backend calculates orders based on 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and the pipeline has 356 'ghost' units that will never arrive, we must use L=explicit with a high value or sigma_hat/mu_hat adjustments to force new orders. I will maintain L=3 (the historical max) but set mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost pipeline. To trigger an order despite the 356 phantom units in transit, mu_hat must be set to a level that exceeds the phantom 356 plus the desired safety stock. Demand (1+L) is 4 * 60 = 240. To overcome the 356 in transit, mu_hat needs to be roughly 600+.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Pipeline inventory of 356 units (Orders P21-P27) is confirmed lost/defunct after 10 periods of zero arrivals. New orders are required to resume operations, but must 'overpower' the phantom in-transit units in the OR engine.

To the OR backend, the pipeline inventory appears massive (566), which would normally prevent any new orders. However, 356 of those units will never arrive. The current demand regime (Period 21-33) has stabilized at an average of approximately 57 units/period with a standard deviation of 20. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is q=0.5 (Base Stock \u2248 Mean Demand over L+1). With an operational lead time L=3, the system needs to maintain ~228 units (57 * 4) to cover demand during the lead time. To 'overpower' the 356 phantom units and ensure the OR engine places a meaningful order to restart the supply chain, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the current expected demand plus the lost units (57 * 4 + 356 = 584). This forces the engine to recognize a deficit relative to its perceived pipeline. Sigma remains at its standard recent level for the current regime.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has experienced a catastrophic failure. Orders from Period 21 to Period 27 (totaling 356 units) are confirmed lost after 11 periods of zero arrivals. Furthermore, orders from P33 (210 units) and P34 (18 units) are currently in-transit but have not arrived. Since the backend OR engine subtracts all 'In-transit' units from the base stock calculation, it currently sees 584 units in the pipeline (356 lost + 228 recent). This 'phantom' inventory prevents the engine from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline already exceeds any reasonable demand forecast (63 units/period). To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand, where L=3 (the historical upper bound), plus an additional amount to 'offset' the 356 lost units that the backend still counts. Target for (3+1) periods at 63 units/period is 252. Adjusting for 356 lost units, I set mu_hat to 608 to force the backend to reconcile the gap and place an order. Sigma_hat is set to the recent regime's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery phase: Forcing orders to offset 356 units of confirmed lost pipeline inventory (P21-P27) which the backend still considers active. Recent demand regime (P21-P34) stable at ~63 units/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently in a recovery phase following a major systemic failure where orders from P21-P27 (totaling 356 units) were lost. The backend OR engine still accounts for these 356 units in its 'pipeline_inventory'. To force the engine to place new orders and bridge the zero-inventory gap, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The current demand regime (P21-P35) has stabilized at approximately 57 units/period. Historically, lead times vary between 1-3 periods; I am using L=3 for parameter calculation to ensure a safety buffer. Target base stock = (L+1) * 57 = 228 units. However, because the backend subtracts the phantom 356 units from the base stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome this offset. In Period 33, I set a high mu_hat (explicit 840) to jumpstart the pipeline. For Period 36, I continue this strategy to ensure the engine generates orders despite the phantom pipeline. Total in-transit is 608 (356 lost + 210 from P33 + 18 from P34 + 24 from P35). To maintain a steady flow against the phantom 356, I set mu_hat to 800 and sigma_hat to 120 to sustain order pressure until the P33 order (210 units) actually arrives.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has shown signs of recovery with the arrival of the Period 34 order in 2 periods. However, the Period 33 order (210 units) is now overdue relative to that 2-period lead time, and the historical 'max' lead time is 3. We are currently in a high-risk situation with zero on-hand inventory and a demand spike observed in Period 36 (104 units). The demand regime shift at Period 21 is still relevant, but recent variance has increased. The OR backend currently sees 782 units 'In-transit', but 356 units (P21-P27) are confirmed lost and 50 units (P19) and 131 units (P2) are also long dead. To counter the backend's inflated pipeline view and force orders that meet actual demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~65 units/period. For a lead time L=2, the base stock should cover (L+1)=3 periods, which is 195 units. To ensure the backend orders despite the phantom 782 units in transit, I'm setting mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline + desired safety stock. Based on the recent arrival, L is set to 'recent_N' with N=1 to reflect the possible return to the promised lead time of 2, while sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Period 34 order arrived in 2 periods. Period 33 order (210 units) is now overdue (3 periods), requiring monitoring for potential loss. Demand volatility increased at Period 36 (104 units).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has recovered showing short lead times (1 and 2 periods for the last two arrivals). However, the backend OR engine still sees a massive phantom pipeline of 884 units, which includes 356 units (P21-P27) and 210 units (P33) that are highly likely lost or severely delayed. To force the OR engine to place necessary orders despite this inflated 'In-transit' figure, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Demand has also increased recently (average ~80 units/period over P36-P37). Using L=2 as the operational lead time, I need to cover at least (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~240 units). Given the high on-hand (134) and the phantom pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 1200 to ensure the engine places a significant order to maintain stock, effectively 'overpowering' the pipeline error. Sigma_hat is set to a moderate level to account for the recent demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed with lead times of 1-2 periods for P34-P36. Demand has shifted upwards from ~60 to ~80 units/period since Period 36. Order P33 (210 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, adding to the previous 356 units of lost pipeline (Total ~566 units of phantom inventory).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with recent lead times of 1-2 periods (P34-P36), but significant 'phantom' inventory remains in the backend. Specifically, orders P21-P27 (356 units) and P33 (210 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 566 units that the OR engine incorrectly counts as pipeline inventory. Demand has shifted upwards at Period 36, averaging approximately 112 units per period over the last 3 periods (104, 82, 151). To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 1066 reported in-transit units, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Using L=2 (safe estimate), I target a base stock that overrides the phantom pipeline. Required base stock = (Pipeline + 1 period coverage) = 1066 + 150 = 1216. Setting mu_hat to 1216/ (1+L) = 405 per period to force a net positive order and regain on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: increased from ~60 to ~112 units/period (+86%). Total confirmed phantom in-transit inventory is 566 units (P21-P27, P33).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 36, following a period of systemic supply chain failure. Over the last four periods (P36-P39), demand has averaged 107.25 units/period (104, 82, 151, 92), a substantial increase from the prior regime of ~63 units. Lead times have stabilized recently between 1 and 2 periods (P34: 2, P35: 2, P36: 1, P38: 1). Order P33 (210 units) is now 6 periods overdue and is confirmed lost, joining the previous batch of 356 lost units (P21-P27). Total phantom in-transit inventory is now 566 units. With current on-hand inventory at 90 and the OR engine seeing a total pipeline of 1034 units (which includes the 566 lost units), I must use explicit parameters to force sufficient ordering. To cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand at the new mean (~107), we need a base stock of ~321. The backend sees 1034 (in-transit) + 90 (on-hand) = 1124, which will prevent any ordering unless mu_hat is set extremely high to 'overpower' the phantom units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand level and the need to offset the 566 lost units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 36: increase from ~63 to ~107 units/period (+70%). Total systemic loss now 566 units (P21-P27 and P33).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 36, confirming a new average demand of approximately 107-112 units per period (compared to the previous ~63). Recent observed demand (P36-P40) values are 104, 82, 151, 92, and 123, averaging 110.4. Supply chain reliability has improved, with recent lead times being 1-2 periods (though historically variable up to 3). However, we must account for 566 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory (P21-P27, P33) which the backend still considers active but are confirmed lost. Total in-transit is currently 884; subtracting the 566 phantom units leaves an effective pipeline of 318 units (from the Period 37 order). At the current demand regime (~110/period) and L=2, the base stock should cover 3 periods (~330 units). On-hand (117) + effective pipeline (318) = 435 units, which is sufficient. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the new 110/period mean across (L+1)=3 periods to ensure the OR engine maintains this level despite the large phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~110 units/period (P36-P40). Recovered supply chain showing lead times of 1-2 periods. Total systemic loss (phantom inventory) remains at 566 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 36 and has stabilized at a significantly higher level. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P36-P41) is approximately 122 units/period (104, 82, 151, 92, 123, 180), which is a clear upward trend from the previous regime of ~63. Supply chain lead times have settled between 1 and 2 periods since the recovery (P34-P40). However, there is a massive systemic issue: 566 units of in-transit inventory (comprising orders P21-P27 and P33) are confirmed lost/phantom. Because the OR backend subtracts ALL pipeline inventory (884 units) from the base stock to calculate orders, and on-hand is currently 0, the engine will stop ordering unless mu_hat is set high enough to 'overpower' this phantom 566 units. Total current pipeline is 884. To force an order that covers (~120 units/period * 3 periods of lead+review time = 360 units), the mu_hat must be set to approximately 360 + 566 = 926 units. Setting mu_hat to 950 using the explicit method to ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment order despite the phantom inventory.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 36 to Period 42) indicates a significantly higher mean compared to the previous period. The average demand across these 7 samples is 117.3 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 36.6. I will use N=7 to capture this specific post-spike regime. Regarding the supply chain, while lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods recently, there is a massive 'phantom inventory' problem. The backend sees 950 units in-transit, but 776 of those (P21-P27: 356 units, P33: 210 units, P37: 218 units - wait, P37 was 318, P38 was 182, P39: 150) are likely lost or severely delayed. Specifically, orders P21-P27 and P33 (Total 566 units) are confirmed systemic losses. Period 37's order of 318 units is now 6 periods since placement with no arrival, exceeding the current 1-2 period recovery lead time, and is also likely lost. To ensure the backend actually places an order despite the 950 units it sees in-transit, I am setting mu_hat and L high to elevate the base stock requirement above the phantom pipeline. Setting L=3 (the historical max) and mu_hat explicitly to cover 4 periods of the current high demand regime (117 * 4 = 468) plus a significant buffer to 'wash out' the phantom 950 units.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment failure updated: Order P37 (318 units) is now 5 periods overdue beyond the typical 1-2 period recovery lead time, totaling 884 units of likely lost 'phantom inventory' (P21-P27, P33, P37).

The backend 'In-transit' shows 1385, but after subtracting these 884 'phantom' units, the effective pipeline is only 501 units (from orders P38 onwards). Demand since P36 has shifted significantly higher, averaging ~117 units/period (P36: 104, P37: 82, P38: 151, P39: 92, P40: 123, P41: 180, P42: 89, P43: 162). To ensure stock availability despite the 884 units of phantom inventory the OR engine thinks we have, I am using an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: Target Base Stock = (L+1) * Mean Demand = (2+1) * 117 = 351 units. To overcome the 884 phantom units, I must set mu_hat to (Target Base Stock + 884) = 1235. This forces the engine to place orders despite the massive inflated pipeline. I am setting L=2 as a balanced operational lead time based on recent recovery performance (1-2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment failure updated: Order P37 (318 units) is now 6 periods overdue beyond the typical 1-2 period recovery lead time, totaling 884 units of likely lost 'phantom inventory' (P21-P27, P33, P37). Recent demand (P36-P43) average is approximately 117 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing another systemic disruption. No arrivals have occurred for 4 consecutive periods (P41-P44). Order P37 (318 units) is now 7 periods overdue; P42 (66 units) is 2 periods overdue; P43 (435 units) is 1 period overdue. The total 'phantom inventory' (orders likely lost or indefinitely delayed) has risen to 1219 units (P21-P27: 356, P33: 210, P37: 318, P42: 66, P43: 435). The OR backend still views these 1219 units as active pipeline inventory, preventing it from placing new orders. Demand has shifted higher since Period 36, averaging approximately 117 units/period with significant volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 43). I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to bypass the 1219 phantom units. Target stock for (L+1)=3 periods (using L=2 as a baseline) at ~117 units/period is ~351. To force an order despite the 1219 units in-transit, mu_hat must be set higher than the phantom total plus the target base stock. Setting mu_hat to 1600 (approx. 1219 phantom units + 381 safety stock) to trigger an order to replenish the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment failure updated: Orders P37, P42, and P43 are overdue, bringing total likely lost 'phantom inventory' to 1219 units. Supply chain has effectively stalled again with 4 consecutive periods of zero arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-275.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially resumed after a major stall. Orders from Period 42 (66 units) and Period 43 (435 units) arrived in Period 45 with lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively. This validates that the 'recovered' lead time range remains 1-3 periods. Total 'phantom inventory' (orders likely lost but still in the backend pipeline) is now 1219 units (P21-P27, P33, P37). This phantom pipeline suppresses new orders from the OR backend. With on-hand inventory at 388 units and demand averaging ~119 units/period over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the current stock covers roughly 3 periods. However, to ensure the backend continues to place orders despite the 1099 units in-transit (of which 884-1219 are likely lost), I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the pipeline deficit. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime of ~119 units/period. Using L=2 and mu_hat based on the last 10 samples to capture this regime, while inflating mu_hat via explicit value to compensate for confirmed phantom losses.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: P42 arrived in 3 periods, P43 arrived in 2 periods. Demand regime (P36-P45) is stable at ~119 units/period. Total confirmed phantom inventory (orders P21-P27, P33, P37) is 1202 units, which will permanently distort pipeline calculations unless countered.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-138.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime starting at Period 36, averaging approximately 119 units per period (P36-P46). The supply chain has recovered from the previous drought, with recent deliveries (P42, P43) showing lead times of 2-3 periods. However, we are dealing with a significant 'phantom inventory' problem: 1,202 units are currently in-transit according to the backend (orders P21-P27, P33, P37), but these are confirmed lost based on historical evidence. To trigger the OR engine to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' at a value that exceeds this phantom pipeline (1202) plus the desired base stock for the current regime (approx 360-480 units). Given current on-hand inventory is 263 and we need to cover demand for (L+1)=4 periods at ~119 units/period, we target a total cycle stock of ~476 units. To counteract the 1,202 'in-transit' units, we set mu_hat to a value that forces the order logic to recognize the deficit. However, since the game is near the end (P47 of 50) and on-hand is already 263, we maintain a balanced approach to avoid excessive holding costs in the final 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-29.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with lead times between 2-3 periods (P42: 3, P43: 2). Demand is in a high-growth/volatile regime since P36, with a recent average (P36-P47) of approximately 117 units per period. Crucially, the system still registers 1202 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (undelivered orders from P21-P33 and P37) that are functionally lost. To ensure the backend OR policy places an order despite this phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. My goal is to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand + safety stock, then add back the 1202 phantom units so the OR logic (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline) doesn't suppress ordering. Calculation: Demand for 3 periods (~350) + Safety Stock (~100) + Phantom adjustment (1202) = ~1650.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed with lead times of 2-3 periods for P42-P43. Demand regime (P36-P47) stable at ~117 units/period. Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 1202 units (P21-P27, P33, P37).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 36 has stabilized at an average of approximately 117 units per period. Recent lead times for successful deliveries (P42, P43) are between 2 and 3 periods. The 'In-transit' balance of 1504 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders P21-P27, P33, and P37\u2014totaling 1202 units that are confirmed lost. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I must use 'explicit' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I am setting mu_hat based on (1+L) * 117. With L=2, (1+2)*117 = 351. To account for the 1202 phantom units, I adjust the mu_hat to 'overpower' the pipeline logic:Target_Base_Stock = mu_hat - (Actual_Pipeline - Phantom_Pipeline). Since the backend uses [mu_hat - Total_Pipeline], I set mu_hat = 351 + 1202 = 1553. This ensures that the order calculation effectively ignores the lost units. Sigma_hat is set based on the standard deviation of recent demand (~30) scaled for (L+1), approximately 52.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 36, averaging approximately 119 units/period (last 14 periods). The current on-hand inventory is 0. The official 'In-transit' figure of 1527 units is heavily distorted by 1202 units of confirmed lost 'phantom inventory' (orders from P21-P27, P33, and P37). This leaves a real pipeline of 325 units (orders P46-P49). Lead times for recently successful deliveries have ranged between 1 and 3 periods, with an operational upper bound of L=3 used to ensure (L+1)=4 periods of demand coverage. To counteract the 1202 units of phantom inventory that the backend subtracts from the order requirement, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that includes the required stock for the coverage period PLUS the phantom units. Target inventory = (3+1) * 119 = 476 units. Adjusted mu_hat = 476 + 1202 = 1678. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent high-demand regime variance.
