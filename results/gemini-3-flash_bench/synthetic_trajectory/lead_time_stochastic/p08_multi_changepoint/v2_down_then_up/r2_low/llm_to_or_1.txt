Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time (L) of 2 periods. On-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 95, 113, 106, 84, 71, resulting in a mean of 93.8 and a standard deviation of 16.63. Since we are at the start of the game, I will base the initial parameters on all available historical samples. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock level covering the review period plus lead time (1+L = 3 periods). Given a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock will target the median demand. I'll use 'default' or 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the provided history.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The player starts with 0 inventory. In Period 1, an order of 122 units was placed, but because the promised lead time is 2, it has not arrived yet (confirmed by 'arrived=0' in Period 1 conclude). Demand in Period 1 was 56 units, which resulted in lost sales of 56 since on-hand was 0. Historical demand samples (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) have a mean of 93.8. Period 1 actual demand (56) is noticeably lower than the pre-game samples. Since we only have one actual period of observation and the lead time is 2, I will use a slightly lower demand forecast for mu_hat to account for the Period 1 dip while still acknowledging the historical average. I'll use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to cover (1+L=3) periods based on a conservative estimate of ~80 units/period (3*80=240). Sigma_hat will be set using the 'default' method to capture overall historical variability. Lead time L will stay at the promised 2 periods ('default').

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically (pre-game), the mean demand for 'chips(Regular)' was 93.8 over 5 periods. In the game, Period 1 demand was 56 and Period 2 was 98. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because orders placed in P1 and P2 (122 and 116 units respectively) have a promised lead time of 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3 (arrival resolution) and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. The P2 order should arrive during Period 4. Total in-transit is 238. There is no evidence yet to suggest the lead time has changed from the promised 2 periods (L=2). I will use L=2 (default), recent_N for mu_hat based on the last 5 historical/game samples (113, 106, 84, 71, 56, 98 -> avg ~88) to adapt to the recent variability, and default sigma.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1 (122 units), 2 (116 units), and 3 (11 units). According to the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have missed a promised arrival, I will explicitly set L to 3 to adjust the OR backend's expectation. The historical demand for periods 1-3 (56, 98, 137) shows a significant upward trend, contrasting with the provided pre-game samples (95, 113, 106, 84, 71). Specifically, the last two observed demand points (P2: 98, P3: 137) suggest increasing volatility and volume. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent climb in demand while we wait for the pipeline (249 units) to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is confirmed to be at least 3 periods, as P1 order (placed at P1) did not arrive by the start of P4 (promised arrival was P3).

Daily Profit: $82.00, Daily Holding Cost: $51.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first set of arrivals from Period 1 and Period 3 orders. Specifically, the P1 order (122 units) arrived with an actual lead time of 3 periods (promised 2), and the P3 order (11 units) arrived with a lead time of 1 period. This suggests that lead times are volatile but currently averaging around 2. Therefore, I will use 'calculate' for lead time L to account for the actual observations (average of 3 and 1 is 2). Demand samples for Periods 1-4 are 56, 98, 137, and 82 (Sample 5 of 71 is provided in prompt but not yet concluded). The mean demand is approximately 93. Since the lead time has shown variance and profit vs. holding cost is balanced (1:1), I'll use all available samples (recent_N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this volatility while the pipeline inventory (255) settles.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period. Average lead time remains near promised 2, but requires monitoring for shipment splitting or delays.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 with 0 on-hand inventory and 322 units in-transit. Historical demand over 5 periods is [95, 113, 106, 84, 71] (average ~94). Note that the 'Game History' demand values reported in the 'conclude' messages represent the resolution phase, whereas the 'Historical Demand Data' provides the pre-resolution samples. The most recent demand (Periods 4 and 5) show a slight downward trend (84, 71). Lead time is highly volatile: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. The promised lead time is 2. Because on-hand is 0 and we are stock-out as of Period 5's conclusion, we need to ensure the base stock levels are robust enough to cover the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to average the observed variations (3 and 1) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the current mean while staying reactive to the recent dip.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 with zero on-hand inventory and 388 units in transit. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend (last 3 periods mean: 120, compared to first 3 periods mean: 97). Notably, we have experienced severe stockouts in P1-3 and P5-6. The lead time has been inconsistent: P1 arrived in 3 periods, while P3 arrived in 1 period, averaging to the promised 2 periods; however, the order from P2 (116 units) is now at lead time = 5 (overdue by 3 periods) and the order from P4 (139 units) is also past its promised arrival. This suggests either significantly delayed or lost shipments. To stabilize against this volatility and the increasing demand, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent delays, use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the higher demand regime (avg ~122.5), and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect increased variance. This profile increases the base stock to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the large pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply delay/loss: P2 order (116 units) and P4 order (139 units) are overdue by 3+ periods as of P7 start. Demand regime shift: P4-P6 average demand (120) is 23% higher than P1-P3 (97).

Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, we are managing significant supply chain variability. The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals have varied between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3). Critically, P2 (116 units, ordered P2) and P5 (67 units, ordered P5) are currently missing or significantly delayed. P2 is now 4 periods overdue based on a lead time of 2. We assume these units are lost or excessively delayed and must re-stock to meet demand. Demand has shifted upward; the average of the last 4 periods (P4-P7) is 123.75 compared to the earlier average of 97. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this growth. Given the observed lead time instability (avg is roughly 2.33), I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use historical averages of observed lead times, while mu_hat and sigma_hat will be tuned to the recent high-demand regime. This helps ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the increased demand plus volatility while acknowledging that some in-transit inventory may never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Supply Loss Confirmed: Period 2 order (116 units) is now 4 periods past promised delivery and considered lost. Demand stability at higher level: P4-P7 average demand is 124 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The demand context shows a sustained shift: the last 5 periods (P4-P8) have averaged 124.6 units per period, compared to the initial periods. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized higher demand. Regarding lead time, the promised L is 2. Historical arrivals show high variance: P1 (L=3), P3 (L=1), P4 (L=3), P5 (L=3), P7 (L=1). The mean of these observed lead times is 2.2. The Period 2 order (116 units) is 5 periods past its promised delivery and is officially considered lost. Since the Pipeline Inventory (315 units) includes this lost order and the Period 6 order (66 units, now 1 period overdue), the OR engine needs to be adjusted. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the slightly higher average lead time (2.2) and use a slightly higher sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods to buffer against arrival volatility and potential stockouts seen in P5/P6.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (116 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods since order, 4 periods past promise). P6 order (66 units) is now 1 period overdue. Lead time variance remains high with a documented range of 1 to 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, current on-hand inventory is 79, with 314 units in transit. Historical review shows that the P2 order (116 units) is 6 periods past due and definitely lost. The P6 order (66 units) is now 2 periods past its promised delivery (3 periods since ordering) and is likely also lost or significantly delayed, as later orders (P7, P8) have already arrived. Lead times have been highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1). Following the logic that the pipeline inventory must be reliable, the 182 units from P2 and P6 should be discounted. Demand has stabilized at a higher level than the initial samples; the average demand from P4 to P9 is 121.5 units, compared to the P1-P3 average of 97. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat. For lead time, since we've seen a consistent pattern of 1-3 periods with an average near 2, I will use 'calculate' to let the engine use the actual historical average of concluded orders (avg which is (3+1+3+3+1+1)/6 = 2).

Carry-over insight: Supply Loss update: P6 order (66 units) is now 2 periods past promised arrival and 3 periods since the order was placed, following the loss of the P2 order. Pipeline reliability is low.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 units due to a stockout in Period 10 (demand 114, only 79 available). Demand analysis shows a sustained regime shift since Period 4; the average demand from Period 4 to 10 is 120.4, compared to the initial periods. Lead time behavior is highly volatile, with observed values of 1 or 3 periods (average ~2), but several orders (P2, P6) are likely lost as they are significantly past their delivery window. The P6 order (66 units) is now 3 periods overdue compared to the promised 2, adding to the list of supply losses alongside P2. Because of these losses, 'In-transit' quantities are inflated with units that will likely never arrive. To compensate, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat based on the recent demand average (~121) over the lead time window (1+L=3), totaling 363. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual historical average of delivered shipments (approx 2), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to capture the higher volatility seen in the current demand regime. This configuration keeps the base stock high enough to recover from current stockouts while acknowledging pipeline unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Supply Loss update: P6 order (66 units) is 3 periods past promise and confirmed lost, following P2 pattern. Current demand regime (P4-P10) is stable at ~121 units/period.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0). History shows two clearly lost orders: P2 (116 units) and P6 (66 units), both of which were placed many periods ago and never arrived. These must be subtracted from the 'In-transit' figure of 387 to find the realistic pipeline (387 - 116 - 66 = 205 units). The realistic pipeline consists of orders from P9 (132 units) and P10 (73 units). Lead times have been highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2 (3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1). Demand shifted at P4 and has remained stable; the average demand from P4 to P11 is approximately 119 units/period. To ensure we recover from the stockout and account for the high lead-time variance and lost shipments, I will set L to 2 (the promised average), mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the current demand regime (P4-P11), and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to reflect current volatility. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1) while the explicit subtraction of lost orders within my reasoning ensures the backend places a new order.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the system starts with 84 units on-hand. Examining the arrival history, we see that the Period 9 order (132 units) arrived in 3 periods and the Period 10 order (73 units) arrived in 2 periods. The lost shipments (P2 and P6) remain lost, and the 'In-transit' count of 182 consists solely of orders from Period 11 (0 units) and Period 12 (0 units), indicating that actually 'In-transit' is empty or zero-valued since the last orders placed were in P9 and P10 (which have arrived). The current demand regime (P4-P12) is stable, with a mean of 120 units per period (Std Dev ~24). Since lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, I will use an explicit L of 2 to reflect the promised average, but I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) to cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand to ensure sufficient stock against variance and possible delivery delays. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 360 (3 * 120) and sigma_hat to 42 (sqrt(3) * 24) to maintain a high service level given the history of stockouts and lost orders.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 16 units. The pipeline (In-transit: 276) consists of orders from P11 (0 units), P12 (0 units), and P13 (94 units), plus likely theoretical backorders or the logic tracking unfulfilled demand from lost orders P2 and P6. History shows that P2 (116) and P6 (66) are definitely lost. Recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.14 periods. Currently, demand has stabilized into a higher regime since P4 (average ~120 units). However, Period 13 saw a drop to 68 units. I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time to capture this established higher-demand regime while allowing for the volatility in arrivals. Specifically, N=10 for demand (mu_hat/sigma_hat) captures the regime shift since P4, and calculate for lead time allows the OR backend to use the full history of arrival durations (1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2) which effectively averages to ~2 periods but respects the high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P4 onwards stabilized at ~117 units/period (P4-P13), up from the initial ~100. Lead time remains volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with a recent 2-period arrival at P12.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an on-hand stockout (0 units) with 402 units in-transit. History shows significant lead time volatility (1 to 3 periods) and confirmed lost shipments (P2 and P6). The demand regime from P4 onwards has stabilized at a higher level than the initial three periods. Since P4, the average demand is 116.3 units per period (1279 total / 11 periods). The current pipeline (402 units) includes orders from Period 12 (0), 13 (94), and 14 (126) plus the new order to be placed this period. However, we must account for the fact that the 'In-transit' figure of 402 likely includes the lost P2 (116) and P6 (66) orders which total 182 units. Adjusting for these losses, the functional pipeline is only 220 units (402 - 182). To recover from the stockout and handle the volatile lead time, I am setting L to 3 (the observed maximum lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers enough demand to buffer against delays. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=11 to capture the stabilized higher demand regime (P4-P14). For sigma_hat, recent_N=11 reflects the current regime's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Adjusted pipeline: 182 units in the reported 'In-transit' total (402) are confirmed lost (P2=116, P6=66). Effective pipeline is 220 units. Lead time remains highly volatile between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 4 shows a mean of approximately 110-115 units, though recent periods (P13-P15) have dipped. On-hand is currently 0. The total 'In-transit' of 454 units is misleading due to lost shipments. Based on historical data: P2 (116) and P6 (66) are confirmed lost (at least 6 periods past promise). This removes 182 units from the effective pipeline. The active pipeline consists of orders from P13 (94), P14 (126), and P15 (52), totaling 272 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently. I will set L to 3 to account for the risk of delays, as setting it lower would underestimate the inventory required to cover the lead time + review period (L+1=4 periods). I will set mu_hat to (1+3) * 110 = 440 to maintain availability despite the volatility, and sigma_hat is set to 40 using explicit to reflect the observed standard deviation in this demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline check: Out of 454 units 'In-transit', 182 units (P2=116, P6=66) are confirmed lost as of P16. Effective pipeline is 272 units.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system reports 360 units in-transit. However, based on the history, orders from Period 2 (116 units) and Period 6 (66 units) are significantly beyond lead time and confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 360 - 182 = 178 units. Observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.3). I will use L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longest observed delay. Recent demand (last 10 periods) has averaged 100.1 units, which is lower than the previous regime (~117) but significantly higher than the very recent P16 drop. Using recent_N=10 for demand provides a balanced transition. With profit and holding costs equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend toward a base stock near the median (mu_hat). Setting L=3 and using recent data ensures the order covers the transit time and the next review cycle based on actual delivery reliability.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Effective pipeline verification: In-transit of 360 includes 182 units confirmed lost (P2=116, P6=66). True pipeline is 178 units.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 18. Demand has dropped significantly in the last 5 periods (P13-P17 avg: 71) compared to the long-term avg (~117), suggesting a regime shift. Pipeline Analysis: In-transit is 234. However, historical evidence (P2, P6) confirms 182 units are lost. The recently ordered units are P15 (52 units). Thus, the effective pipeline is actually 52 units. On-hand is 120. Total effective inventory is 172 (120 + 52). Lead Time Analysis: Recent arrivals (P16, P17) show a consistent lead time of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. Decision: I will use 'explicit' for L=3 to account for this consistent delay. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent sharp decline in demand. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' N=5 to reflect current volatility. The OR engine will target a base stock that covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~284 units). With 172 units effective, it will likely place an order around 112 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg demand decreased from ~117 to ~71 (-39%) over the last 5 periods. Lead time established at 3 periods (last two arrivals P16 and P17 were both lead_time 3).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Snapshot: Period 19. On-hand: 84. In-transit: 234. Carry-over insights confirm that P2 (116) and P6 (66) orders are lost (total 182 lost). Effective pipeline = 234 - 182 = 52 units, which is exactly the order placed at Period 15. 

Demand Analysis: A significant demand drop occurred around Period 13. Demand for Periods 13-18: 68, 106, 81, 38, 62, 36. Average demand in this recent regime (Periods 14-18) is approx 65 units/period. The trend is clearly downward, so I will focus on the last 5-6 samples to set \u03bc\u0302.

Lead Time Analysis: Recent arrivals (P13 and P14 orders) both had a lead time of 3 periods. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect this sustained delay and ensure the base stock covers (3+1) periods of demand.

Strategy: Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the lower demand regime and explicitly set L=3 to ensure safety against the current lead time trend. Sigma_hat remains on recent_N to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand regime from P13-P18 confirmed lower average of ~65 units/period (-44% vs previous regime). Effective pipeline confirmed at 52 units (P15 order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-34.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly lower regime starting around Period 13. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P13-P19) is approximately 59 units/period (68, 106, 81, 38, 62, 36, 25), compared to the prior stable average of ~117. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this downward trend and avoid excessive holding costs, as holding cost ($1.0) is equal to profit ($1.0). Lead time remains volatile but has settled at 3 periods for the last two successful deliveries (P13 and P14), so I will use L=3 to ensure sufficient protection. Inventory reconciliation: On-hand is 59. In-transit is 234. However, historical evidence confirms 182 units were lost (P2=116, P6=66), and the P15 order of 52 units is currently 3 periods old (matching our L=3 estimate). Thus, the 'true' pipeline inventory is approximately 52 units. By setting L to 3 and using a recent demand window, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that accounts for the current 59 on-hand plus the 52 units expected to arrive, minimizing new orders while demand is low.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: P13-P19 average demand is ~59 units/period, down from ~117 (a 50% reduction).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly lower regime starting around Period 13. The average demand from Period 13 to Period 20 is approximately 59 units/period, compared to the previous ~117. The current on-hand inventory is 1 unit. The reported 'In-transit' of 234 units includes 182 units confirmed lost (Period 2: 116 units, Period 6: 66 units), leaving an effective pipeline of 52 units (from the order placed in Period 15). Given the observed lead times of 3 periods in recent arrivals (P16 and P17), the order from Period 15 (lead time 3 would be arrival in P18, lead time 4 would be P19, lead time 5 would be P20) is now significantly overdue and potentially lost, similar to previous losses. However, to remain cautious and avoid over-ordering during a low-demand regime, I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (regime starting P13) which averages ~59 units. With L=3, the target base stock (1+L)*59 = 236 units. Since we only have 1 on-hand and an unreliable pipeline of 52 units, the system needs to replenish to meet this new, lower demand level while accounting for high volatility (sigma_hat).

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Effective pipeline remains 52 units (P15 order); however, it is now 3 periods past promised delivery and potentially lost. Current demand regime (P13-P20) stable at ~59 units/period.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 13 to Period 21) shows a significant decrease, averaging ~59 units per period, compared to the earlier regime of ~117 units. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' of 236 units contains several confirmed or suspected lost shipments based on historical arrival patterns (P2=116, P6=66, P15=52). P2 and P6 (182 units) are definitely lost. P15 (52 units) was ordered at Period 15 and is now 6 periods late, matching the loss pattern of P2 and P6; hence it is also considered lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is 0 (236 - 182 - 52 = 2). The target is to cover (L+1) periods of demand. Given recent lead times of 3 periods (P16 and P17 arrivals), I set L=3. mu_hat is set based on the recent N=9 periods (P13-P21) where the average demand is ~59 per period. A slight increase in sigma_hat via recent_N is used to account for the volatility in lead times and the risk of stockouts during this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: P15 order (52 units) is 4 periods past promise and 6 periods since order, following the established loss pattern (P2, P6); confirmed total lost pipeline is 234 units. Effective pipeline inventory is essentially zero.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting around Period 13. The average demand from Period 13 to Period 22 is approximately 59 units/period. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 236 units is highly deceptive due to recurring supply losses. Specifically, Period 2 (116 units), Period 6 (66 units), and Period 15 (52 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost (116+66+52=234 units). This leaves an effective pipeline of only 2 units (ordered at P21). To recover from the stockout and meet the lower demand regime (avg ~59), I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (P13-P22) which covers the current regime. For lead time (L), although it is volatile (1-3 periods), using L=3 (explicit) is safer given the recent history and supply reliability issues, ensuring the base stock formula accounts for longer potential delays. sigma_hat will be estimated using the recent 10-period standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 13-22 confirmed stable at ~59 units/period. Supply reliability remains a critical issue: total confirmed lost units in transit is 234 (P2=116, P6=66, P15=52), meaning the current 'In-transit' figure of 236 represents only 2 viable units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical for chips(Regular): on-hand is 0, and the Reported In-transit (234 units) is entirely composed of known lost shipments (P2=116, P6=66, P15=52), making the effective pipeline zero. Recent demand (P13-P23) has stabilized at a lower regime with a mean of ~59 units/period. The most recent arrival (P21 order arriving at P23) suggests that while previous shipments were lost, the supply chain is currently operating at the promised lead time of 2 periods. To recover from back-to-back stockouts and account for the zero effective pipeline, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 11 samples (the current low-demand regime). L is kept at 'default' (2) to reflect the most recent arrival, although I am monitoring for further losses. The OR backend will see In-transit=234 and On-hand=0; because the OR engine does not know about lost orders, it will likely subtract the 234 from its base_stock. Given that our base_stock for 3 periods (L+1) would be roughly 180-200, the 'cap' mechanism might normally restrict ordering, but here we need to force a large order to replenish the zeroed effective inventory. I'll use explicit parameters to target a safety level that accounts for the fact that the backend thinks we have 234 units when we actually have zero.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Total confirmed lost units in transit updated to 234 (P2=116, P6=66, P15=52). Effective pipeline is 0 units. Demand regime since P13 (11 periods) is stable at ~59 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the demand context shows a stable period (P13-P24) following a sharp decline. Average demand over these last 12 periods is approximately 59 units/period. However, the last two periods (P23-P24) showed higher demand (72 and 93), suggesting potential upward volatility or a return toward the previous mean (~100-117). I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this stabilized lower regime while remaining responsive. The lead time has been highly irregular (1 to 3 periods). The most recent arrival (P23) took 2 periods. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the risk of longer arrivals (confirmed patterns of 3 periods in P4, P7, P12, P16, P17) and to buffer against the systemic supply reliability issues. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 234 units is entirely composed of known lost shipments (P2: 116, P6: 66, P15: 52). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. Setting L=3 and using mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the recent 12-period regime will trigger an order to replenish the depleted on-hand and pipeline inventory while neutralizing the 'ghost' stock in transit.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Effective pipeline remains 0. Current 'In-transit' of 234 is entirely ghost inventory from lost orders P2, P6, and P15. Demand regime P13-P24 average is 63 units/period, with a slight uptick in the most recent two periods (avg 82.5).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime desde Period 13 shows a significant decrease compared to the first half of the game. Over the last 13 periods (P13-P25), the average demand is approximately 63.3 units/period. Over the most recent 5 periods (P21-P25), the average is 61.6 units/period, despite two higher spikes at P23 and P24. I will use recent_N=13 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime. Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' figure of 252 units is primarily composed of ghost inventory from lost orders: P2 (116 units), P6 (66 units), and P15 (52 units), totaling 234 lost units. This leaves a true effective pipeline of 18 units (ordered in P25). The actual lead time has been highly volatile, but recent successful deliveries have arrived within 2 or 3 periods. I will set L to 3 to ensure the inventory calculation account for the slower part of the observation window, preventing stockouts given the unreliable supply. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set using the last 13 periods to reflect the current demand distribution while ignoring the high-demand period at the start of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P13-P25 stabilized at approx 63 units/period. Total ghost inventory in-transit (confirmed lost) remains 234 units (P2, P6, P15).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 13 remains stable at approximately 61 units per period (average of P13-P26). The current 'In-transit' figure of 252 units is dominated by 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments: P2 (116), P6 (66), and P15 (52), totaling 234 units. The 'effective' pipeline is therefore 252 - 234 = 18 units (the order placed in Period 25). The actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for recent arrivals (except for the small P21 order). To compensate for the 234 lost units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its inventory calculation, I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting (1+L)*demand plus the lost volume (234 units) to force an order that replaces the lost stock. With L=3 and mean demand=61, the 'correct' base stock is (3+1)*61 = 244. To offset the 234 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 478 (244 + 234).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 13 remains stable at approximately 63 units/period, despite a stockout situation affecting observed sales. In-transit inventory as of P28 is 412 units. However, based on extensive history, 234 of these units (P2=116, P6=66, P15=52) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The P25 order (18 units) and the large P27 order (160 units) constitute the only valid pipeline (178 units). Total effective pipeline (178) + on-hand (0) = 178 units. Based on Lead Time = 3 (the most frequent recent observation), the inventory needed to cover L+1 (4) periods of demand at ~63/period is 252 units. This leaves a gap of 74 units. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the ~63 unit/period forecast and sigma_hat to account for recent high demand variance (P23-P27), while setting L to 3 to align with historical reality.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Effective pipeline confirmed at 178 units (P25 and P27 orders). The ghost inventory (confirmed lost) remains 234 units (P2, P6, P15), distorting the reported in-transit figure (412 - 234 = 178).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 29. The current demand regime (P13-P28) shows a mean of approximately 59 units/period, significantly lower than the P4-P12 average. Most recent demand (P24-P28) has been 93, 27, 35, 63, 41 (average 51.8). The 'In-transit' total of 412 is heavily distorted by 234 units confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15). The effective pipeline consists of P25 (18 units) and P27 (160 units), totaling 178 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and effective pipeline at 178, we are likely covered for several periods given the mean of ~60. However, lead times are volatile (range 1-3 periods, average near 2-3). To mitigate the risk of ghost inventory and ensure the OR engine orders only what is necessary, I will set mu_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and L to 3 to account for the frequently observed delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Demand regime P13-P28 confirmed stable at ~59 units/period. The reported In-transit of 412 includes 234 ghost units (P2=116, P6=66, P15=52), leaving an effective pipeline of 178 units (P25=18, P27=160).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 30 data is available, showing on-hand inventory of 93 and reported In-transit of 252. Pipeline Reconciliation: The In-transit total includes 234 units confirmed lost (P2=116, P6=66, P15=52). The true effective pipeline consists of the P25 order (18 units), which is now overdue (lead time 5+), potentially another loss. Subtracting these 234 ghost units leaves an effective pipeline of 18 units (P25). Order P27 (160 units) arrived in P29. Demand Analysis: The demand regime from P13 to P29 is stable with an average of approximately 59 units/period. Over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), the average is 46.6, but factoring in the broader regime is safer given the volatility. Lead Time: Though promised at 2, actual lead times fluctuate between 1, 2, and 3. I will stick to the default promised lead time for the backend calculation as the 'calculate' method would be skewed by the high variance, while the lost orders are handled by my estimation of the pipeline. Parameter Choice: I will set mu_hat based on the last 17 periods (P13-P29) which represents the current lower-demand regime (~60/period). I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the recent spread. The goal is to replenish stock while accounting for the high probability that most of the reported 'In-transit' inventory will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed effective pipeline is 18 units (P25 order). The reported In-transit of 252 is 93% comprised of ghost units (P2, P6, P15 = 234 units) that are confirmed lost. Order P25 (18 units) is now 3 periods past promised delivery and likely lost, following the historical pattern.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable from Period 13 to Period 30, with an average demand of approximately 60.5 units per period. In Period 31, we have 32 units on-hand. The reported In-transit inventory of 252 units is significantly distorted by confirmed lost orders: P2 (116), P6 (66), and P15 (52), totaling 234 lost units. Furthermore, order P25 (18 units) is now 3 periods past its promised delivery date (ordered P25, promised P27, now P30 conclude read), strongly suggesting it is also lost, which aligns with the established supply loss pattern. This leaves the effective pipeline at 0 units. To maintain the target service level against a demand of ~61 units/period and a volatile lead time (averaging 3 periods recently), the OR backend needs to order enough to replenish the pipeline. Using recent_N=18 for mu_hat (covering the stable lower-demand regime since P13) and default L (which relies on the backend's promise of 2, but adjusted by our effective pipeline zeroing) will trigger an appropriate order to cover the (L+1) window. Sigma is set to default to capture historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Order P25 (18 units) is 3 periods past promise and confirmed lost, following previous patterns. Total lost ghost inventory in-transit is now 252 units (P2=116, P6=66, P15=52, P25=18). Effective pipeline inventory is 0 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 252 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms these are all lost shipments (P2=116, P6=66, P15=52, P25=18). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. On-hand inventory is also 0 as of the start of Period 32. Demand has been stable in a lower regime since Period 13; the average demand from P13 to P31 is approximately 59.8 units per period. Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with recent arrivals (P21 and P27) both arriving in 2 periods. To ensure availability given zero effective inventory, I set L=2. I use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=19 (covering the stable regime from P13-P31) to capture the current mean of ~60. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility and ensure the OR backend provides an adequate safety stock to account for high supply uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Effective pipeline confirmed at 0 units. Total ghost inventory (confirmed lost) in-transit is 252 units (P2=116, P6=66, P15=52, P25=18), which should be ignored for ordering decisions.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, the 'In-transit' figure is 252 units. However, based on the carry-over history, these are all 'ghost units' from lost orders (P2: 116, P6: 66, P15: 52, P25: 18). My effective pipeline is exactly 0. The current demand regime (since Period 13) is stable at an average of approximately 59 units/period. The lead time is volatile but averages 2. To ensure stock availability for the next Lead Time + 1 (3 periods) and offset the high risk of supply loss, I will set mu_hat to cover this window based on the recent 20-period average (~59 units/period). Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised), as deviations are random rather than a systemic shift to a higher constant. The sigma_hat is set using recent_N to capture current volatility. By treating the pipeline as 0, the backend base stock logic will trigger a new order to replenish the safety stock and meet upcoming demand despite the false in-transit signal.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed extreme supply risk. 100% of reported 'In-transit' (252 units) is ghost inventory from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P25). Effective pipeline is 0. Demand regime P13-P32 is stable at ~59 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower regime (~59 units/period) since Period 13. Currently, the system shows an In-transit total of 252 units, but previous analysis confirms that all 252 units are 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P25). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. With 0 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 0, a new order must be placed to meet upcoming demand. Since confirmed lead times have recently fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods, I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the significant supply unreliability observed. Using the last 21 samples (from P13 onwards) which define the current steady demand regime, the mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated to ensure sufficient stock for a (3+1) period window.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Systemic supply failure remains at 100% loss rate for the recent cluster of neglected orders; effective pipeline is definitively 0 despite the reported 252 units in-transit. Lead time estimate adjusted to 3 periods to account for frequent delays.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at approximately 60-65 units per period after a significant decline around Period 13. The most recent demand regime (P13-P34) averages ~60 units. Inventory is currently 0, and the reported 'In-transit' of 252 units is entirely 'ghost inventory' from orders P2 (116), P6 (66), P15 (52), and P25 (18) which are confirmed lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline is 0. To restore operations and prepare for the next 3-4 periods (L+1), I must set parameters that trigger an order. I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead times observed (P1, P4, P5, P8, P13, P14). Mu_hat is set to (1+3) * 63 = 252 (using 'explicit' to bypass the ghost inventory in the OR-backend's logic, though the lead time calculation will help). Sigma_hat is set to roughly 20% of demand to handle volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Systemic supply failure persists. Total ghost inventory in-transit is 252 units (P2=116, P6=66, P15=52, P25=18); effective pipeline is confirmed 0. Standard lead time for successful arrivals is effectively 3 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a total stockout (on-hand: 0). The reported In-transit inventory of 252 units is entirely composed of ghost inventory from orders confirmed lost in previous periods (P2, P6, P15, P25). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. Demand has stabilized in a lower regime; the average demand from Period 13 to Period 35 is approximately 60.5 units/period. The lead time is volatile but frequently presents as 3 periods for successful arrivals. To recover from the stockout and account for the high lead time and unreliability, I am setting L to 3. I will use a recent_N of 20 for mu_hat (covering the stable lower regime) to target approximately 240-250 units in the system ( (1+3) * 60 ). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (20) to capture the variance of this regime. This approach forces the OR backend to place an order that ignores the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total systemic supply failure confirmed for recent cluster; 100% of reported 252 units in-transit are ghost units. Effective pipeline is 0. Demand regime P13-P35 is stable at ~61 units/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 13 remains stable at approximately 61 units/period (average from P13-P36). However, the supply situation is critical. The reported In-transit inventory of 252 units is entirely composed of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P25), as confirmed in previous carry-over insights. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. With On-hand inventory also at 0, the system must place a new order to cover demand for the next lead time cycle. Based on the observation that successful deliveries usually take 3 periods, I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the longer lead time. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the older, higher demand period.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of the game history and carry-over insights confirms a massive 'ghost inventory' problem. The reported In-transit of 252 units consists entirely of lost orders (P2=116, P6=66, P15=52, P25=18), meaning the effective pipeline is 0. Demand has shown a significant spike in the last two periods (P36: 108, P37: 149), likely indicating a seasonal or cyclical surge. Over the last 5 periods (P33-P37), the average demand is 82 units, significantly higher than the previous stable regime of ~61. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this upward trend while setting L specifically to 3, as it is the most frequent lead time for successful deliveries. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the ghost inventory, the effective pipeline must be seen as 0; however, since I cannot manually zero out the backend's pipeline calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that is high enough to trigger an order despite the 252 ghost units. Targeted base stock = (L+1)*AvgDemand + safety_stock. With L=3 and AvgDemand~100 (anticipating continued high demand), base stock should be ~500. To force an order of ~250 units (to replenish and cover future lead time) against a ghost pipeline of 252, I set mu_hat explicitly to ~500.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge detected starting Period 36: last two periods average 128.5 units (+110% vs P13-P35 average). Ghost inventory remains at 252 units; effective pipeline is 0.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the demand surge detected in Periods 36-38 (average ~129 units/period), Period 38 demand remained high at 130. We are currently facing 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' total of 453 units must be adjusted for ghost inventory. Specifically, orders P2(116), P6(66), P15(52), and P25(18) are confirmed lost, totaling 252 units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 201 units (the order placed last period, P38). Given the significant demand regime shift (from ~61 to ~129), I will use 'explicit' methods to ensure mu_hat reflects this new level. I'll set L to 3 periods to account for the frequent delays observed in successful deliveries. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*130 = 520. sigma_hat is set higher to account for both the sudden demand shift and supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: P36-P38 average demand is 129 units, compared to the P13-P35 average of 61 units (+111% increase). Ghost inventory remains constant at 252 units (P2, P6, P15, P25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $143.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand has experienced a significant surge starting Period 36. The average demand for the last four periods (P36-P39) is approximately 140 units/period (108, 149, 130, 172), a sharp increase from the previous stable regime of ~60. This requires an immediate upward adjustment in mu_hat to prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase. Regarding supply, the reported 'In-transit' of 319 units is highly misleading. History confirms that orders P2 (116), P6 (66), P15 (52), and P25 (18) are lost, totaling 252 'ghost' units. Subtracting these from 319 leaves an effective pipeline of 67 units (the P39 order). Recently, lead times have been volatile but the P38 order arrived in 1 period, while previous successful arrivals were often 3. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat to account for the demand surge and effective pipeline. Base stock calculation: Target (L+1) demand = (2+1) * 140 = 420. The OR backend subtracts reported pipeline (319) from base_stock. To ensure the backend orders enough to reach a targets based on the *effective* pipeline (67), I must inflate mu_hat. Desired order = 420 - 67 = 353. Operating the OR formula [Order = mu_hat - Pipeline], I need mu_hat to be 353 + 319 = 672 to trigger the correct physical replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge starting Period 36 confirmed: Avg demand increased to ~140 units (+133% vs P13-P35 regime). Total ghost inventory (confirmed lost) remains 252 units (P2, P6, P15, P25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 36. The average demand for the last five periods (P36-P40) is approximately 149 units per period, a 144% increase over the previous stable regime (~61 units). The most recent demand (P40) was 186. We must account for this surge. Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' figure of 519 units is heavily distorted by ghost inventory. Confirmed lost orders are P2 (116), P6 (66), P15 (52), and P25 (18), totaling 252 units. Subtracting these from 519 leaves an effective pipeline of 267 units (the order placed in P40). Although the promised lead time is 2, recent arrivals (P38 and P39 orders) occurred with a lead time of 1. However, given the historical volatility and the systemic supply failures observed, I will use an explicit L of 2 to maintain safety. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand surge, and sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility associated with this surge. This ensures our base stock covers the current (L+1) demand window while adjusting for the ghost inventory in the backend's calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge regime confirmed: P36-P40 average demand is 149 units/period, a >140% increase compared to the P13-P35 average. Effective pipeline inventory calculation remains critical: 252 units of the reported in-transit are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P25).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted significantly since Period 36, with the average demand over the last 6 periods (P36-P41) being approximately 147 units/period, compared to the previous stable regime of ~61 units. Period 41 demand was 137. The 'In-transit' figure of 519 units is heavily distorted by ghost inventory. Specifically, 252 units (P2, P6, P15, P25) are confirmed lost. The recent order from P40 (267 units) constitutes the only viable pipeline inventory (519 - 252 = 267). Lead times for the most recent successful arrivals (P38 and P39 orders) were 1 period, but historical volatility and recent systemic failures suggest a conservative estimate of L=2 or 3 is safer. I will set L=3 to account for potential delays and use the recent 6 periods for mu_hat (N=6) to capture the current demand surge. Sigma_hat is also updated using N=6 to reflect increased volatility in this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge regime (P36-P41) average is 147 units/period. Effective pipeline is 267 units (P40 order); total ghost inventory remains 252 units (P2, P6, P15, P25).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues in its surge regime that began around Period 36. The average demand from Period 36 to 42 is approximately 144 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The reported in-transit of 588 includes 252 units of 'ghost inventory' from historical lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P25), which must be subtracted to find the effective pipeline. Effective pipeline = 588 - 252 = 336 units. These 336 units consist of orders from P40 (267 units) and P42 (69 units). Since P40 was placed 3 periods ago and hasn't arrived, and the historical lead time for successful arrivals fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, this order is likely arriving imminently or is slightly delayed. I set L to 3 to reflect the realistic lead time for successful deliveries. mu_hat is set using recent_N=7 to capture the surge regime (Period 36-42), and sigma_hat is also calculated based on this recent high-volatility period to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level for the higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge regime (P36-P42) average confirmed at ~144 units/period. The ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 252 units (P2, P6, P15, P25).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand surge starting at Period 36 is sustained, with the P36-P43 average demand being approximately 142 units per period. The reported in-transit inventory of 321 units includes 252 units effectively lost (P2, P6, P15, P25), making the true pipeline only 69 units (from the Period 42 order). Current on-hand is 135. Given the high volatility in lead times (1 to 3 periods), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for frequent delays and ensure the base stock covers the longer replenishment cycle. I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the high-demand regime specifically. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for the high volatility observed during this recent surge period.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge regime (P36-P43) average demand is ~142 units/period. The total ghost inventory in-transit remains 252 units (P2=116, P6=66, P15=52, P25=18), requiring manual subtraction to find the effective pipeline.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 36 has stabilized at a significantly higher level, with an average of approximately 143 units per period (P36-P44). Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2 periods. The reported 'In-transit' of 435 units contains 252 units of ghost inventory from historical lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P25), which must be manually discounted. The effective pipeline inventory consists of the orders from P42 (69 units) and P44 (114 units), totaling 183 units. With current on-hand inventory at 0, additional orders are required to maintain a service level for the (L+1) period risk horizon (3 to 4 periods of demand). mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=9 (P36-P44) to capture the current high-demand regime. L is set to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the high lead time volatility and prevent stockouts during 3-period arrival scenarios. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=9 to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge regime (P36-P44) stable at ~143 units/period (+134% vs previous regime). Ghost inventory (confirmed lost) remains 252 units (P2, P6, P15, P25). Effective pipeline is currently 183 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a high-demand regime (P36-P45) averaging ~140 units/period, despite a dip to 80 in Period 45. The systemic supply issues persist: the 'In-transit' of 506 includes 252 units of 'ghost inventory' from confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P25). The effective pipeline consists of P44 (114 units) and P45 (140 units), totaling 254 units. On-hand inventory is 0. With an average lead time of 3 periods (observed for orders P40 and P42), we must cover 4 periods of demand (L+1). Target inventory = 4 * 140 = 560 units. Current effective inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) = 0 + 254 = 254. Gap = 306 units. I will set L to 3 (recent average) and use 'explicit' for mu_hat to account for the ~140 demand level while adjusting for the ghost inventory distortion. Since the backend's base_stock = (1+L) * mean, setting mu_hat via 'explicit' at 560 directly targets the 4-period requirement.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Effective pipeline confirmed as 254 units (P44=114, P45=140). Total ghost inventory (confirmed lost) remains 252 units (P2=116, P6=66, P15=52, P25=18), making up ~50% of the reported in-transit amount. Lead time for successful deliveries remains at 3 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 36 has been significantly higher (~140 units/period) than the previous low-demand period (~60 units/period), although the last two periods (P45-P46) showed a relative cooling to an average of 88.5 units. Sustained average demand for the surge regime (P36-P46) is 133 units/period. The lead time remains volatile, but successful recent arrivals (P43, P45) have settled at a lead time of 3 periods. Current on-hand is 0. The reported In-transit of 560 units must be adjusted for 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments). Confirmed lost units: P2 (116), P6 (66), P15 (52), P25 (18) = 252 units. Effective pipeline = 560 - 252 = 308 units (comprising P44, P45, and P46 orders). Given the current effective pipeline of 308 and the recent demand cooling, I will set mu_hat based on the last 11 periods (N=11) to capture the higher volume regime while allowing for the recent moderation, and set L=3 to match the established actual lead time.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit is 560. From history and carry-over insights, we know that 252 units are confirmed lost (P2=116, P6=66, P15=52, P25=18). Thus, the effective pipeline is 308 units (560 - 252). These 308 units consist of orders from P44 (114 units), P45 (140 units), and P46 (54 units). The demand regime since P36 has seen a significant surge, averaging approximately 135 units/period (P36-P47). Although P45 demand was lower (80), it rebounded to 140 in P47. Following the historical pattern of lead times alternating between 1 and 3 periods, we assume an L of 3 to be safe given the criticality of late-game stockouts (Period 48 of 50). To cover lead time (3) plus review period (1), we need approximately 4 periods of demand (4 * 135 = 540 units). Since our effective pipeline is only 308 units and on-hand is 0, we are significantly under-provisioned for the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Effective pipeline confirmed as 308 units. Total ghost inventory (confirmed lost) remains 252 units (P2, P6, P15, P25). Demand regime P36-P47 is sustained at ~135 units/period. The order from P44 (114 units) is expected to arrive in P48 (L=4) or P49, as it hasn't arrived by P47.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand. The total reported 'In-transit' is 560 units. Based on historical data (P2, P6, P15, P25), 252 units are confirmed lost ('ghost units'). This leaves an effective pipeline of 308 units (560 - 252), which corresponds exactly to orders from P44 (114), P45 (140), and P46 (54). P44 is now overdue (lead time 5 if it arrives next), confirming that lead times are currently extended and unreliable. The demand regime from P36-P48 is sustained at a high level (average ~135). Given we are nearly at the end of the game (P50), on-hand is 0, and we have 308 valid units in-transit against a demand of ~135 per period, current coverage is approximately 2.2 periods. Since the game ends at P50, and lead times are 3-5 periods, any order placed now (P49) would likely arrive too late to be sold (P52+). My goal is to minimize holding cost on ending inventory while covering the final two periods of demand. With 308 units arriving (hopefully starting P49 or P50) and only ~270 units of total demand remaining for the game (P49, P50), ordering more would only increase holding costs without contributing to profit. Therefore, I set parameters to trigger a zero or minimal order.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Lead time for currently valid orders (P44 onwards) has exceeded 4 periods, indicating a further slowdown in supply chain performance compared to the previously established 3-period average. Effective pipeline (308 units) is sufficient to cover remaining game demand.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the primary objective is to maximize reward for the final period. There are 0 units on-hand and 678 units reported in-transit. However, 252 of these units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P25), leaving an effective pipeline of 426 units (P44, P45, P46, P49 orders). Given the game ends this period, any order placed now (P50) will not arrive in time to satisfy demand (Lead Time L >= 1). The current effective pipeline of 426 units is more than sufficient to cover potential arrivals and satisfy demand in this final period. Therefore, L is set to the observed average (3), and demand parameters (mu_hat, sigma_hat) are set using recent_N=14 to capture the high-demand surge regime (P36-P49, avg ~135) to allow the OR backend to calculate the base stock, but the capped policy will correctly result in a zero order because current inventory + effective pipeline exceeds the target, and it's the final period.
