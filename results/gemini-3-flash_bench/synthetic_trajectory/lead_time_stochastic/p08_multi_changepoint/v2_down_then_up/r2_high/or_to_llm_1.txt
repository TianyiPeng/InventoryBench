Demand in Period 1 was 56 units, resulting in 56 lost sales since there was no stock. Historical demand samples (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) show an average of approximately 94 units per period. Period 1's actual demand (56) was lower than the historical average.\n3. Strategy: We need to cover demand for Period 2, Period 3, and Period 4 (L+1 periods) because the order placed now arrives in Period 4. Total demand to cover: ~94 * 3 = 282 units. Current pipeline (in-transit) is 122 units. Gap = 282 - 122 = 160 units. \n4. OR Comparison: The OR algorithm recommends 123 units based on historical demand and the promised lead time. The OR's cap (approx 123) is likely limiting the order to avoid over-purchasing based on a 95% service level for a single period.

Since I have 245 in the pipeline, the raw OR order would be around 22 units, but the capped logic (which uses a smoothed single-period cap) recommends 80 to maintain flow.\n5.

Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 325 (122+123+80). \n3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) averages ~94. Recent game history demand (56, 98, 137) averages ~97. Demand is relatively stable around 95-100 units/period.\n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 32 units is extremely low because it assumes 325 units are in the pipelines and will arrive soon to cover a base stock calculated on a 2-period lead time. However, since P1's order is already late, the 'pipeline' is currently failing to satisfy demand.

This includes P2 (123 - lost), P6 (115), and P8 (110). Adjusting for the lost P2 order, the active pipeline is 225 units. 4. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has rebounded from the initial softening: P6(167), P7(135), P8(128). Average demand over last 3 periods is ~143. 5. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. Total adjusted position (On-hand 0 + Active Pipeline 225) = 225 units. Since L fluctuates, I assume an average lead time and review period (1+L) of 3-4 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods at current rates is ~430. 6. Decision: The OR recommendation of 58 is based on the unadjusted pipeline (348). By removing the lost 123 units, the required order increases by 123. However, even adding 123 to 58 (181) might be conservative given the 0 on-hand status and recent demand spikes.

Historically confirmed lost shipments include P2 (123), P6 (115), and P15 (125), totaling 363 units. Subtracting these from 613 leaves an effective pipeline of 250 units. These 250 units likely consist of orders from P24 (100), P25 (100), and P27 (50). P24 and P25 are now at lead times of 4 and 3 respectively; given the historical variability (1-3 periods), these are overdue and should arrive shortly.\n2. Inventory & Demand Analysis: Currently 0 on-hand. Recent demand (P24-P27) has averaged 54.5 units (93, 27, 35, 63). The 'low demand regime' noted in Period 19 persists, though with slightly more volatility.\n3. OR Baseline Reconciliaton: The OR recommends 0 because it sees 613 in transit against a low demand average. Even after correcting the pipeline to 250 units, 250 units covers roughly 4-5 periods of current demand. However, the system is currently stocked out (0 on-hand) because both P24 and P25 are delayed. Ordering more now would not solve the immediate stockout but would risk future overstock once the pipeline clears.\n4. Strategy: I will place a small order of 50 units. While the effective pipeline of 250 units is technically sufficient for the long term, the high frequency of lost shipments and current stockout justifies maintaining a lean but continuous flow to buffer against future 'lost' batches, especially since P24 and P25 are already hitting the upper limit of observed lead times.",

However, consistent history (Carry-over Insights) confirms that shipments from Period 2 (123 units), Period 6 (115 units), and Period 15 (125 units) are lost. This totals 363 phantom units. The true pipeline consists of orders from P24 (100), P25 (100), P27 (50), and P28 (50), totaling 300 units. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P24-P28) has averaged approximately 52 units per period (93, 27, 35, 63, 41). The 'Demand Regime Shift' at P19 from 100 to 45 remains largely relevant, though recent volatility suggests a slightly higher mean. 4. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is currently 0. We need to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). Using a conservative demand estimate of 60/period, target inventory is ~180 units. 5. **OR Adjustment**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees an inflated in-transit value (663) and a base-stock level lower than that. Correcting for the 363 lost units, the OR's effective pipeline is 300, which is still higher than its calculated target. However, we have been stocking out for 4 consecutive periods (P25-P28). 6. **Action**: The P24 and P25 orders (200 units total) are due to arrive in the next 1-2 periods.

With only 47 units on-hand and 2 periods remaining (P49 and P50), we must ensure coverage for the endgame.

Given the 1-3 period lead time variability and the effective pipeline of 450 units, we already have significantly more than enough inventory arriving to cover the remaining ~270 units of expected demand (135 * 2).
