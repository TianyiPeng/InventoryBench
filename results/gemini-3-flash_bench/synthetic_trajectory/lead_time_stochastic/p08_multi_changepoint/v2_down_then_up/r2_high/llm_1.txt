Historical data (Periods 1-5) shows a mean demand of 93.8 units (95, 113, 106, 84, 71). The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 4 (after the Period 3 conclusion). Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I am guaranteed to stock out in Periods 1, 2, and 3. My goal is to cover demand for Period 3 (arrival) and Period 4 (next decision cycle impact). Looking at the historical mean (~94) and the downward trend in the last two samples (84, 71), I will target a safety-conscious order. To cover roughly 3-4 periods of demand (P1-P4) while accounting for the fact that I can't satisfy P1-P2 demand anyway, I need to build a pipeline. I will order enough to cover the expected demand for the lead time plus one period (L+1 = 3 periods). 94 * 3 = 282. I'll round to 300 to ensure I have stock once the first shipment arrives.",

Recent demand (P9-P12) averaged 112, though P13 dipped to 68 (lost sales of 15 units due to stockout). Lead time is highly unstable, varying between 1 and 3 periods. Assessment of arrivals vs orders: P10 order was 0. P11 order (180) is due (P11+2=P13, currently P14). P12 (140) and P13 (140) are in the pipeline. Total in-transit is 605. However, the 'Carry-over Insights' confirm that orders from P2 (100) and P6 (45) are lost. Therefore, effective in-transit = 605 - 145 = 460 units. These 460 units consist of orders from P11 (180), P12 (140), and P13 (140). Current on-hand is 0. I need to cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L up to 3, I need to cover 4 periods. 4 * 115 (conservative avg) = 460. Since my effective pipeline is exactly 460 units, and on-hand is 0, my current coverage is just enough to meet the pipeline requirement if arrivals resume. However, P11 (180 units) is already 3 periods old relative to its placement and should arrive in the current Period 14 (making it visible in P15). To maintain a safety buffer against the high lead-time variance and the total stockout encountered last period, I will place an order for one average period of demand (130 units) to ensure future cycles are covered even if one of the 'hidden' pipeline orders is also lost.",

Period 37 order is now overdue (max lead time 3, it's been 4), which is concerning; I will treat it as potentially lost.

World knowledge suggests that basic snack categories like 'Regular Chips' have relatively stable core demand but can see spikes during sports events or seasonal gatherings.
