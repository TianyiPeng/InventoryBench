Historical samples showed a spike in Period 5 (126), suggesting potential variability or upcoming demand growth. c) Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2. My P1 order (260 units) should arrive during P3's resolution and be visible at the start of P4. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'.

Even if P1 arrives this period (P4), I have already missed 3 periods of sales. e) Final Order Logic: Since 400 units are already in the pipeline (covering roughly 5 periods of demand at current rates) and the holding cost ($1) equals the profit ($1), overstocking is as balance-sheet-punishing as stockouts.

The mean demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 77 units/period. c) Lead Time Inference: Based on Period 4's conclusion (Order 1 placed in P1 arrived in P4), the actual lead time is confirmed as 3 periods, not the promised 2. d) Inventory & Pipeline Assessment: Current on-hand is 24 units. Total in-transit is 340 units (composed of 140 from P2, 100 from P5, and 100 from P6). Based on LT=3, the P2 order (140 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's resolution phase but was NOT reported in P5 conclude, and similarly not in P6 conclude.

Recent demand (Periods 5-8) averages ~85 units as well.

This suggests LT is inconsistent but averages around 2-3 periods. I will treat the system as having high variability. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand=85. In-transit = 390.

The current 'In-transit' of 385 units includes orders from Period 11 (70 units) and Period 12 (75 units), but there is a discrepancy. Calculation: P6(100) was lost, P9(65) arrived, P10(120) arrived. Remaining in-transit should be P11(70) + P12(75) = 145 units. The system reports 385 units, which is 240 units higher than the known active pipeline. This suggests either a data error or that the 'lost' orders (P2=140, P6=100) are still being counted in the system's 'In-transit' figure even if they never arrive. I will base my decision on the 'Effective Pipeline' of 145 units.
