Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. Historical data shows demand for the first five periods: 84, 55, 79, 85, and 126. The average demand across these five points is 85.8 with a standard deviation of 25.8. Since the system is just starting (Period 1 decision phase), it will see zero on-hand and zero in-transit. I will use the 'explicit' method to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the provided 5 samples of demand. Promised lead time (L) is 2. The OR engine targets a base stock that covers demand over (L+1) periods. I will set mu_hat to (2+1)*85.8 = 257.4 and sigma_hat to sqrt(2+1)*25.8 = 44.69. This ensures the first order accounts for the lead time and current demand volatility.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we are dealing with a same-period observation of a start-up phase. The promised lead time is 2 periods. An order of 129 units was placed in Period 1; as expected with L=2, zero units arrived in the arrival resolution phase of Period 1 (confirmed in the Period 1 conclude message). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 129 units in transit. Demand in Period 1 was 98. Historical demand samples (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) show a mean of 85.8. However, given the initial stockout and the need to build a safety buffer once the first shipment arrives, I will use a slightly more recent window for demand estimation. Since the game is in very early stages, I'll rely on the default calculations for lead time and standard deviation while using a recent_N window for the mean to catch the most relevant demand signals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (placed in Period 1) has not yet arrived. Following the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3 and will be reflected in the Period 4 start state. The total in-transit quantity of 257 units corresponds to the orders from Period 1 (129) and Period 2 (128). Historical demand shows fluctuations (P1: 98, P2: 62), with an average of 80. Since we are in the early stages (Period 3), I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for demand estimation to reflect the most recent data points, although the sample size is small. I will stick with the promised lead time (L=2) for now, as there is no evidence yet of delivery delays beyond the promised window.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (129 units) and Period 2 (128 units). Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start message. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates either a lead time delay or a lost shipment. Since the on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we have missed the arrival of the first order, we are experiencing stockouts (sold=0 despite demand). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including the provided sample for Period 5) is 84, 55, 79, 85, 126. The average demand is approximately 85.8. Since lead time is uncertain and currently seems longer than 2, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delay. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent demand trend, including the spike to 126 in Period 5. This will result in an order that aims to cover (3+1) periods of demand to recover from the current stockout.

Daily Profit: $96.00, Daily Holding Cost: $33.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 98, 62, 68, 96, 126 (Mean: 90, Std Dev: 25.5). The lead time for the first shipment (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 4) was confirmed as 3 periods, which is longer than the promised 2 periods. Currently, 223 units are in-transit (orders from Period 2 and Period 4). With on-hand inventory at 33 and a recent demand spike to 126 in Period 5, there is a risk of a stockout if the Period 2 order does not arrive in Period 5. To address the lead time drift, I am setting L to 'explicit' with a value of 3. For demand forecasting, I will use a 5-period average (recent_N=5) to capture the current mean while acknowledging the recent high demand sample.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P4).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Based on the history, the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 4, which confirms an actual lead time (L) of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. Inventory is currently 0 after Period 5 demand exceeded on-hand supply. Total in-transit is 327 (from P2, P4, and P5 orders). Demand samples are [84, 55, 79, 85, 126] for P1-P5 (avg ~85.8, std ~25.9) or based on 'conclude' demand samples [98, 62, 68, 96, 84] (avg ~81.6, std ~15.9). Period 5 specifically saw a jump to 126 in the provided sample data, though the 'conclude' message reports 84. I will set L=3 based on observed evidence. For mu_hat, I will use a conservative average of the last 5 samples to cover the (1+L) = 4 period window. Sigma_hat will use the default calculation across all available samples to capture the volatility that led to the recent stockout.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but historical evidence (Period 4 conclude) shows the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods. Looking at the history, an order placed in Period 2 (128 units) should have arrived by Period 5 (L=3) or should be arriving now (Period 7). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 327 units in-transit (Orders from P2, P4, P5). Demand has been relatively stable, but we have experienced stockouts due to the lead time being longer than promised. I will set L to 3 based on the confirmed arrival pattern. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the average demand of approximately 77 units per period, scaled for the Lead Time. This will help the OR engine set a higher base stock to account for the actual 3-period lead time.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2 periods, but historical data from Period 4 and Period 7 confirms an actual lead time (L) of 3 periods. Consequently, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3. The demand history shows some volatility but centers around 79 units/period (mean of 98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56, 85). Period 5 had an unusually high demand relative to inventory, but generally, demand is stable. I will use recent_N (N=7, all available historical demand periods) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 3-period lead time plus the review period (total 4 periods of demand coverage). With 10 units on hand and 232 in transit (from orders in P2 and P5), the system needs to maintain a consistent pipeline to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 5 and 6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead time is consistently 3 periods based on P4, P7, and P8 conclusions. Demand has been volatile: P1-P4 mean was ~81, P5-P8 mean is ~85, but with a notable spike in P8 (115). Starting Period 9, on-hand is 0 with 200 in-transit (P2=128, P8=72). Since actual lead time is 3, the P2 order (placed P2) should have arrived in P5 (P2+3), but it is currently 'missing/lost' as it never concluded. This leaves a significant gap. I am setting L=3 to match realized performance. To account for the recent volume increase and the loss of the P2 shipment, I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher mean (~85) and standard deviation of the most recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently observed at 3 periods (P4, P7, P8 arrivals). Period 2 shipment (128 units) is confirmed lost/missing as it is 4 periods overdue beyond the actual 3-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data shows a complex lead time landscape and volatile demand. Historically, we saw a lead time of 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 orders). However, the most recent arrival (P8 order) arrived in only 1 period. The P2 order (128 units) is definitely lost. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 253 units in-transit (P9 order of 125 units and likely some leftovers from previous logic, though the history only explicitly shows P9). Demand history (84, 55, 79, 85, 126, 98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56, 85, 115, 88) suggests a mean around 85. With a critical item (profit and holding costs equal, implying a 50% service level target) and fluctuating lead times, I will set L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) to ensure the base stock covers a wider window and protects against the slower shipments seen previously. I will use the mean of the last 5 demand periods to capture the recent uptick in demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility detected: shifted from 3 periods (P1, P4, P5) to 1 period (P8). Period 2 order is lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. Historical analysis confirms that the Period 2 order (128 units) is lost, as it is now 8 periods past its order date and 5 periods past the observed 3-period lead time. Significant lead time volatility is present: after three consecutive orders arrived in 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), the P8 order arrived in only 1 period. However, the P9 order (placed at the start of P9, promised L=2) did not arrive in Period 10, meaning current lead time is at least 2. I will set L to 2 (promised) but monitor for further instability. Demand has shifted recently; while the long-term average is ~81, the last 5 periods (P6-P10) show a mean of 77.2 and the last 3 periods show a drop to 70.6 (due to the 39 unit outlier in P10). Given the high demand in Period 5 (126) and Period 8 (115), I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility while smoothing the P10 dip. The parameters aim to recover from the stockout caused by the lost P2 shipment and the delayed P9/P10 arrivals.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we face zero on-hand inventory and 343 units in-transit. Historic lead times have fluctuated between 3 periods (P1, P4, P5) and 1 period (P8). The orders placed in P9 (125 units) and P10 (90 units) have not arrived yet. If we assume the lead time remains around 2-3 periods, these should arrive shortly. However, P11 see zero arrivals from orders since P8. Given the volatility, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but monitoring for a shift back to 3. Demand has been relatively stable with a recent mean around 75-80 units, though high variance is present. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the demand mean post-initial noise, which includes the lower recent Period 10 and 11 values. Sigma is set based on all available data to account for the high volatility and stockouts seen in history.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Lead time uncertainty remains high; transition from 3 periods to 1 period (P8 order) followed by at least 2+ periods of no arrivals for P9/P10 orders. Demand mean stabilized around 75-80 across the last 8 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received orders from Period 9 (lead time 3) and Period 10 (lead time 2), resolving the inventory stockout. The Period 2 order of 128 units is officially lost. Demand has been stable but relatively high on average. Over the last 8 periods (P5-P12), mean demand is approximately 77.5. Looking at the lead time history (3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2), the average is approx 2.5 periods. I will use L=3 to be safe due to the risk of stockouts and the previous variability. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=8 to capture the stable recent demand of ~77.5/period across (L+1)=4 periods. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=8 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains volatile but has reverted to a mean of ~2.5 (observed range 1-3 periods). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 78 units over the last 8 periods (P5-P12).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is experiencing highly volatile lead times. Analysis of concluded shipments shows lead times of: P1 (3), P4 (3), P5 (3), P8 (1), P9 (3), and P10 (2). The average observed lead time is 2.5 periods, while the most recent arrivals (P9 and P10) arrived in 3 and 2 periods respectively. I will use an explicit L of 2.5 to better reflect this instability than the promised 2. Demand has stabilized into a consistent regime; over the last 9 periods (P5-P13), the mean demand is 79.5 units. Given the high volatility in lead times and the recent loss of the P2 shipment, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture this stable demand regime while maintaining a buffer against lead time uncertainty. The pipeline inventory (172 units) + on-hand (44 units) seems sufficient to cover the expected (L+1) horizon, but the OR backend's base-stock target will ensure we maintain service levels despite the lead time noise.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent lead times have been highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.4). Specifically, Period 9 arrived in 3 periods and Period 10 arrived in 2 periods (concluding in Period 12). Orders from Period 13 (44 units) and Period 14 (62 units) are currently in-transit and haven't arrived yet, which is expected given the lead time. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has remained relatively stable but shows higher values in the last few periods (94 and 95), compared to the earlier stabilized mean of ~78. To account for the lead time uncertainty and the recent moderate demand increase, I'm setting L to 3 (the upper end of observed lead times) to ensure the system targets a base stock that covers the 4-period window (L+1). For demand, I'll use recent_N=10 to capture the current stable mean while incorporating the recent slight uptick.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility remains high: recent arrivals followed 1, 3, and 2 period lead times. Use L=3 for safety. Demand mean shows a slight upward trend in P13-14 (avg 94.5) compared to the previous stabilization at 78.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (On-hand: 0) following a demand of 55 in Period 15. Lead time continues to be highly volatile, with historical values of 1, 2, and 3 periods; I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longest observed delay and provides a safety buffer against stockouts. Recent demand has fluctuated: P13 and P14 saw high demand (94, 95), while P15 dropped to 55. Over the last 11 periods (P5-P15), the average demand is approximately 75 units. I am using recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized mean while smoothing out the recent peak and dip. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=11) to reflect the observed variability in this regime. Pipeline inventory is significantly high (324 units) due to orders placed in P13 (44), P14 (62), and P15 (90), plus older potentially lingering orders, which the OR backend will subtract from the base stock. Setting L=3 helps protect against the 'lost' feel of shipments when lead times extend to the maximum observed range.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand in Period 16 spiked significantly to 133 units, following a period of moderate demand (mean ~78-80). Lead times remain highly unstable, with the most recent arrival (P13 order) taking 3 periods, while previous orders ranged from 1 to 3 periods. To prevent stockouts during this high-volatility phase, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the upper bound of recent observations. For mu_hat, the recent demand (P13-P16) shows a distinct upward trend with an average of 94.25 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this shift. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' (N=4) to account for the increased variance seen in recent periods (ranging from 55 to 133). These parameters ensure the OR engine targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the elongated lead time and higher demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in P16 (demand = 133), raising the 4-period moving average to 94.25 from a previous baseline of ~78.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 315 units in-transit. Demand has shown a recent upward shift: after stabilizing around 78 units (P5-P12), the last 5 periods (P13-P17) have averaged 94.4 units, with a notable spike to 133 in P16. Lead times remain highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with most recent orders (P13, P14) arriving exactly at 3 periods. To ensure availability against this increased demand and lead time uncertainty, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to reflect the recent upper bound of delivery times. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current higher demand regime (~94 units/period), and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 13: mean increased from ~78 to ~94 (+20%). Lead time appears to have stabilized at 3 periods for the most recent two arrivals (P13 and P14).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are currently facing zero on-hand inventory and have accumulated significant lost sales in the previous periods. Analysis of recent history confirms a demand regime shift that began around Period 13; the mean demand for the last 6 periods (P13-P18) is approximately 94.5 units per period, compared to the earlier baseline of ~78. Lead times remain variable but have shown a tendency toward 3 periods in the most recent completed cycles (orders from P13 and P14 both arrived with 3-period lead times). We have 378 units in transit (orders from P15, P17, and P18), which should begin arriving soon (P15 order is expected at the start of Period 19's arrival phase if L=4, or should have arrived if L=3). To account for the shifted demand and high volatility/stockout risk, I am selecting L=3 to ensure the OR backend aims for enough stock to cover the replenishment cycle. mu_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture the new demand average (~94.5 * 4 = 378 total), and sigma_hat is also set using the last 6 periods to reflect the current demand variance (including the spike of 133 in P16).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand has significantly accelerated in the last few periods (P16: 133, P17: 95, P18: 95, P19: 166), with the average of the last 4 periods jumping to 122.25, compared to the previous regime of ~94. This suggests a new demand spike, possibly seasonal. For lead time, the last two concluded arrivals (P16 and P17) both confirmed a lead time of 3 periods, suggesting relative stability at L=3 despite earlier volatility. My OR parameters will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current spike and calculate for lead time to reflect the observed history centered around 2.7 periods. High sigma_hat via recent_N is used to account for the increased demand variance (std > 30), ensuring the OR engine targets a higher base stock to recover from current stock-outs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 16: demand surged from an average of ~94 to ~122 units (+30%). Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods over the last two arrivals (P16, P17).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime, with demand surging significantly since Period 16 (P16: 133, P19: 166, P20: 115). The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 124.8 units. Although the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for recent arrivals (P16, P17). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 despite heavy demand, and there is a large pipeline of 449 units (orders from P15, P17, P18, and P20). I will set L=3 to account for the actual observed latency and use a recent window of N=5 for demand to capture the current high-activity regime (~125 units/period). This ensures the base stock calculation (covering 1+L periods) adequately targets the current demand spike while the backend's capping mechanism prevents over-ordering against the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 16: average demand increased to ~125 units (P16-P20). Lead time remains confirmed at 3 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted starting Period 16, with an average of approximately 124 units (P16-P21). Period 19 saw a significant spike to 166 units, while the most recent periods (P20, P21) are consistent at 115 and 109. I will use N=6 for mu_hat (P16-P21) to capture this higher demand regime. Historically, lead times have been mostly 3 periods, with a recent gap in arrivals confirming that the promised lead time of 2 is consistently exceeded. P15 (90 units), P17 (97 units), and P18 (63 units) are currently in-transit and overdue based on a 2-period lead time, but expected if the lead time is 3. On-hand inventory is currently 0, necessitating a robust base stock. I will set L to an explicit value of 3 based on confirmed arrivals from P13 and P14, and the lack of arrivals for P15/P17/P18 so far. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 6 periods to account for the increased volatility seen in the current regime (109 to 166 range).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0 and a large pipeline of 484 units. Analyzing recent demand history, a regime shift occurred starting in Period 16, with demand averaging approximately 116 units (P16-P22: 133, 95, 95, 166, 115, 109, 97). This is a significant increase from previous baselines. Regarding lead time, the last recorded arrivals (P16 and P17) confirmed a consistent 3-period lead time. However, no arrivals have been recorded for Periods 18 through 22. Given the promised lead time is 2, and we have observed lead times of 3, the current 'In-transit' inventory includes orders from P15 (90), P17 (97), P18 (63), P20 (71), and P21 (35). The order from P15 is now 7 periods old and significantly overdue, suggesting it may be lost, similar to the P2 order. To stabilize, I am setting L to 3 (recent stable observation) and using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the higher demand regime (avg ~116). By increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent high-demand/high-variability window, the OR backend will aim for a higher base stock to recover from current stockouts once the pipeline begins to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16 confirmed: mean increased to ~116 (from ~94). Period 15 shipment (90 units) is likely lost as it is 7 periods old compared to the 3-period lead time standard.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 24. On-hand = 20. In-transit = 378. Analysis of arrivals shows P16 (ordered P16, L=3), P17 (ordered P17, L=3), and P18 (ordered P18, L=3) are currently in-transit and overdue or at the limit of lead time. Specifically, P20 and P21 both arrived in Period 23 (LT=3 and LT=2 respectively). The Period 15 order (90 units) is confirmed lost. Recently, demand has shifted significantly: P16-P23 mean is ~111 units, which is a jump from the previous regime of ~94. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this higher demand regime clearly observed since Period 16. I am keeping L at 3 based on the most consistent recent lead times, and sigma_hat at N=8 to account for the increased volatility seen in this period (range 86 to 166).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16 confirmed: mean increased to ~111 (P16-P23) with higher volatility (CV increased). Period 15 order (90 units) is confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the on-hand inventory is 0. The demand regime starting around Period 16 remains elevated and volatile, with Period 24 demand spiking to 169. Over the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the mean demand is approximately 118 units. Lead times have recently been observed at 2 and 3 periods (P20 and P21 orders arrived in P23). Based on these observations, I am maintaining L=3 as a safety measure for the OR engine. For the demand parameters, I am using N=9 to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime (P16-P24), as this provides a representative mean (~118) and accounts for the increased variance seen in recent periods, helping the system maintain enough inventory to cover the lead time + current period demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16 remains sustained: mean demand for P16-P24 is ~118 units with significant volatility (high spike of 169 in P24).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the system faces zero on-hand inventory and persistent demand surges. Since Period 16, demand has averaged ~119 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~78, with clear peaks (169 in P24, 167 in P25). Lead times, while volatile, generally cluster around 3 periods. Current in-transit inventory (474 units) includes several potentially older shipments; specifically, Period 15 (90 units) is confirmed lost, and orders from Period 17 (97) and Period 18 (63) are significantly overdue (8-9 periods since order). I will use L=3 to ensure the backend projects demand coverage across the necessary lead-time horizon. For demand estimation, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 10 samples (P16-P25) to capture the higher mean (~119) and sigma_hat using the same window to account for increased volatility (stdev ~29) observed in the recent high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P16-P25 avg: 119.7). Period 17 and 18 shipments (97 and 63 units) are now critically overdue (L=8+), suggesting additional transit losses beyond the confirmed P15 loss.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P16-P26) shows a significant increase, with an average of approximately 134 units and a peak of 169. The last three periods (P24-P26) specifically averaged 168 units, indicating a possible further escalation or high sustained peak. I will use N=11 for mu_hat to capture the regime starting at P16, though it's likely the backend will cap the order due to high in-transit volumes. Regarding lead time, the last successful arrivals (P20 & P21 orders) arrived in 3 and 2 periods respectively. However, shipments from P15, P17, and P18 (totaling 250 units) are grossly overdue (8-11 periods), effectively confirming them as lost. With 0 on-hand and high demand, I must treat L=3 as the active lead time for planning. The high in-transit figure (493) includes these 250 lost units; the OR engine, unaware of losses, will see a inflated pipeline and likely under-order unless mu_hat is set aggressively enough to trigger the cap or force a necessary replenishment. I choose recent_N with N=11 for demand and explicit L=3 to reflect the current reality.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Shipments from P17 (97 units) and P18 (63 units) are now confirmed lost (L=9+), joining the already confirmed P15 loss. Total confirmed pipeline loss is 250 units. Demand regime (P16-P26) mean is verified at ~134 units, with the most recent 3 periods (P24-P26) increasing to ~168 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the regular chips is in a sustained high-demand regime, with the average demand since Period 16 being approximately 134 units, but spiking to ~168 during the last four periods (excluding the most recent dip to 111). Lead time has settled at approximately 3 periods for successful arrivals, but there is a significant systemic issue with lost shipments. Orders from Periods 15 (90), 17 (97), and 18 (63) are confirmed lost (Total 250 units). The current in-transit pipeline is 132 units across Periods 24-27 (6+90+19+17), plus potentially lingering ghost units that haven't arrived yet. To ensure the backend places sufficient orders to cover this high demand and mitigate the impact of historical losses, I will set mu_hat to 160 based on the recent high-demand average (last 4 periods excluding spike) and use sigma_hat=50 to account for the high volatility (68 unit spread in recent demand). L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent lead time of non-lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand regime P24-P27 significantly elevated (avg ~154) compared to previous baseline (~134). Total confirmed lost shipments now 250 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high-level regime beginning around Period 24, with levels significantly elevated compared to the early period mean. Specifically, the average demand from P24-P28 is approximately 138.4 units, despite a dip to 77 in P28. Given the frequent lost shipments (P15, P17, P18 confirmed lost) and recent stockouts (on-hand is 0), it is critical to use parameters that robustly cover the extended lead time. Lead times have recently varied between 2 and 3 periods; I will use L=3 to remain conservative against potential delays. For mu_hat, N=5 (P24-P28) captures the most recent high-demand regime, and for sigma_hat, N=5 accounts for the recent high volatility (ranging from 77 to 169). Although there are 621 units in-transit, 250 of these are confirmed lost (P15, P17, P18), which the OR backend does not know; by setting L=3, \u03bc\u0302 based on the recent average, and a matching \u03c3\u0302, we signal the need for more stock to overcome the supply-side gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Demand regime P24-P28 average is 138.4 units. Despite the P28 dip, the overall volatility remains high. Confirmed lost shipments (P15, P17, P18 totaling 250 units) have not been reconciled by the OR backend, requiring conservative parameter settings.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted starting Period 16, with a more recent and volatile surge since Period 24. Analyzing the last 6 periods (P24-P29), the average demand is 133.5 units with a high standard deviation. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility, high-demand state. Lead time analysis: recent arrivals (P26, P27) show a lead time of 2 periods, while historical lead times averaged 3. Given the confirmed loss of orders from P15, P17, and P18 (totaling 250 units), the 'In-transit' figure is inflated by units that will never arrive. To compensate for these phantom units in the pipeline and ensure the OR backend places sufficiently large orders, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to increase the target inventory level and provide a safety buffer against the high stockout frequency (on-hand is currently 0).

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Demand regime for P24-P29 remains elevated and volatile (avg 133.5). Confirmed lost shipments from P15, P17, and P18 continue to skew pipeline inventory calculations, necessitating conservative parameter selection (L=3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $78.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 decision: Lead time has stabilized recently at 2 periods (P26-P28 arrivals), but historical volatility and confirmed lost shipments (P15, P17, P18 totaling 250 units) still pollute the pipeline inventory calculation used by the OR backend. The system sees 474 units in-transit, but 250 of these are 'ghost' units that will never arrive. To compensate for this massive under-counting of needed inventory, I am setting L to 'explicit' with a value of 3. This forces the base stock formula to cover an extra period of demand, effectively bypassing some of the 'ghost' inventory drag. Demand for the most recent regime (P24-P30) shows an average of ~130 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this post-surge mean while smoothing out the extreme P24 spikes. For sigma_hat, I'll use N=7 to reflect the increased volatility (CV) observed during this higher demand period.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Lead time has recently converged to 2 periods (P26, P27, P28 orders). However, the 250 units lost from P15, P17, and P18 remain in the 'In-transit' view, necessitating a buffer in the L parameter to ensure the OR engine orders sufficient stock.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime beginning at Period 24. Calculating the mean of samples from Period 24 to Period 31 (169, 167, 168, 111, 77, 109, 104, 120), the average is 128.125 units per period. The pipeline inventory currently shows 492 units 'In-transit', but this includes 250 units from confirmed lost orders (P15: 90, P17: 97, P18: 63). To correct for these phantom units and prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, I set the lead time L to a higher explicit value (L=5). This increases the targeted base stock level (calculated as (1+L) * mu) to bridge the gap created by the lost units in the pipeline. This approach is necessary because the backend determines the order quantity by subtracting all units in the 'In-transit' field (including lost ones) from the target base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 context: Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the most recent 10-period regime (P23-P32) shows a shift towards high volume and high volatility, with an average of approximately 123.4 units (P23-P32). Recent demand specifically in P31-P32 has stabilized slightly above 100, but P24-P26 observed spikes near 170. We are also managing a significant pipeline 'ghost' inventory: 250 units from P15, P17, and P18 are confirmed lost (as lead times for those specific orders are now >15 periods), yet they remain in the system's 'In-transit' calculation. This artificially inflates the 'pipeline' and causes the OR backend to under-order. To counteract this, I will set L to 3 (despite recent arrivals at L=1 and L=2) and mu_hat to a value that reflects the higher regime (avg ~124) while ensuring the OR engine's 'base_stock' target is high enough to trigger an order despite the 250-unit phantom pipeline. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat captures the current high-demand regime, and I will use an explicit L=3 to create the necessary buffer for the OR engine to overcome the lost units in the pipeline view.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Lead time recently observed at 1-2 periods (P31 order arrived P32), but L=3 maintained as a buffer to counteract 250 lost units still present in 'In-transit' view. Demand mean for recent regime (P23-P32) is ~123.4 units.

Though lead times have recently shortened to 1-2 periods (P31, P32), the 'In-transit' inventory of 474 units is significantly inflated by 250 confirmed lost units (P15, P17, P18) that the OR backend still considers part of the pipeline. To counteract this, I will set L to 4. By increasing L in the base stock formula (base_stock = (1+L) * mu), the target inventory level rises, forcing the backend to place an order despite the phantom units in transit. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of the most recent 10 periods (P24-P33), which is 123.4. For sigma_hat, I will use a conservative recent_N=10 to capture the high volatility seen in this period (range 77-169).

Carry-over insight: Period 34: L increased to 4 to offset 250 units of ghost inventory (lost P15, P17, P18 orders) still appearing in the 'In-transit' count. Current demand regime (P24-P33) mean is 123.4.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to carry 250 units of 'ghost inventory' from lost orders in Periods 15, 17, and 18, which totals 250 units (90+97+63). These units are visible in the 'In-transit' count (551 units) but will never arrive. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I must keep the L parameter artificially high. Setting L=4 (2 periods above the recent average lead time of ~2) provides a safety buffer. Recent demand (P24-P34) shows an average of ~120 units. I will use recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime while ensuring the inventory calculation accounts for the lost shipments.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand remains elevated. The critical challenge is the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline: 250 units from periods 15, 17, and 18 are confirmed lost (lead times > 15 periods) but still appear in the 'In-transit' count of 607 units. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline), so these 250 units will cause it to under-order by exactly 250 units. To counteract this, I set L=4 (promised L=2). This artificial increase in L raises the Base Stock calculation, allowing the system to place orders despite the inflated pipeline inventory. Demand from P24-P35 shows a mean of approximately 116 units with moderate volatility. I am using recent_N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-demand regime while excluding the earlier lower-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 250 units of ghost inventory (lost orders from P15: 90 units, P17: 97 units, and P18: 63 units) in the in-transit view. To counteract this, I must inflate the lead time parameter L so the base-stock calculation (which uses pipeline inventory) generates order quantities that account for these missing units. Actual recent lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods (P34 arrived in 2 periods). I am setting L=4 to create a sufficient ordering buffer against the 250-unit ghost inventory. Demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime; the average demand from Period 24 to Period 36 is approximately 121 units. I will use recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat to capture this mean. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N to reflect the high volatility observed in this regime (demand ranging from 77 to 169).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed ghost inventory of 250 units (P15, P17, P18) still distorts in-transit view. Lead time L=4 is used as a corrective offset. High-demand regime (P24-P36) mean is approximately 121 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been volatile but reflects a sustained high-demand regime since Period 24. The mean demand from Period 24 to 37 is approximately 119.5 units. In the last 10 periods (P28-P37), the average is slightly lower at 115.3, but given the frequent stockouts, actual demand is likely higher. Lead times have recently stabilized around 2 periods (P34 and P35 both arrived with L=2). However, a critical issue remains: 250 units from P15, P17, and P18 are confirmed lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit 547, subtract 250 = 297 true units). To force the OR backend's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) to ignore this ghost inventory, I am setting L=4 as a corrective offset. This increases the target base stock (calculated as (1+L)*mu) to cover the inventory gap caused by the lost shipments.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a high level. Calculating the mean for the last 23 periods (P16-P38) gives approximately 119.5 units. Recent volatility remains consistent with this regime. Regarding inventory, there is a verified discrepancy: 250 units (from orders in P15, P17, and P18) are permanently lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' count (Total: 596). This 'ghost inventory' prevents the OR backend from ordering enough to meet actual demand. To force the backend to place an order that covers the required base stock despite these phantom units, I am setting the lead time parameter L to 5. This increases the target base stock level (calculated as (1+L)*mu) to absorb the 250-unit deficit while maintaining a safety buffer. mu_hat is set using recent_N=23 to capture the current high-demand regime, and sigma_hat is calculated using the same window to ensure the service level accounts for observed spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Ghost inventory of 250 units (P15, P17, P18) remains in pipeline. Lead time parameter L increased to 5 to force replenishment orders by offsetting the phantom 250 units in the backend's inventory-on-hand + pipeline calculation.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for chips(Regular) remains critical due to the persistent 250 units of ghost inventory (lost orders from P15, P17, and P18) still visible in the in-transit pipeline. At P40, the on-hand inventory is 0 and the reported in-transit is 650. However, the true actionable pipeline is 400 (650 minus the 250 lost units). To force the OR backend's base-stock calculation (on-hand + pipeline) to order sufficient stock, I am maintaining the lead-time parameter L at 5. This artificial inflation acts as a corrective offset against the ghost inventory. The demand mean from the current high-volatility regime (P24-P39) is approximately 116 units. Using the 'recent_N' method with N=16 captures this entire regime. Sigma is also set to 'recent_N' for the same period to account for the sustained higher variance and spikes (ranging from 77 to 169).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a moderately high regime with a mean of approximately 104 units over the last 10 periods (P31-P40). However, the primary operational challenge is 'ghost inventory'. Shipments from Period 15 (90 units), Period 17 (97 units), and Period 18 (63 units) are confirmed lost but still contribute 250 units to the 'In-transit' count in the backend's base-stock calculation. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, I am using an 'explicit' L value of 5. This artificially inflates the target base stock (\u03bc\u0302 is calculated as (1+L) * demand), effectively overriding the ghost inventory's downward pressure on order quantities. Recent actual lead times have been short (1-2 periods), but the L=5 setting is a mathematical offset for the 250-unit pipeline error. mu_hat is set via 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand baseline of ~104 units/period. sigma_hat is set to 'default' to allow the backend to calculate volatility across the history.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Ghost inventory of 250 units (P15, P17, P18) continues to persist in the pipeline view. Lead time parameter L=5 is maintained as a corrective offset to force replenishment despite this phantom stock.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand has recently softened but remains volatile; the mean for the current regime (P24-P41) is approximately 110 units. I will maintain L=5 to offset the 250 units of phantom inventory in the OR backend's order calculation. This setting forces the backend to treat the lead time as significantly longer, effectively ignoring the part of the pipeline that is never arriving. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=18 to capture the current demand regime's average and volatility accurately.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 679 units 'In-transit', but a significant portion is 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P15 (90), P17 (97), and P18 (63) totaling 250 units are confirmed lost. Additionally, the P25 order (90 units) is now 18 periods old and certainly lost, and the orders from P40 (48), P41 (24), and P42 (60) are still within or near the lead-time window. The total confirmed ghost inventory is now 340 units (90+97+63+90). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, I will maintain the Lead Time parameter L=5 as a corrective offset. For demand forecasting, the recent regime (P34-P42) shows a slight decline compared to the P24-P33 peak, with an average of approximately 97.4 units. I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture this updated demand level while the L=5 setting forces the necessary replenishment logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed ghost inventory increased to 340 units as the Period 25 order (90 units) is now 18 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total lost shipments: P15, P17, P18, and P25.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant issue with 'ghost inventory' appearing in the 'In-transit' view. Specifically, 340 units are confirmed lost (Period 15, 17, 18, and 25) but remain in the backend's pipeline calculation. Consequently, the OR backend believes there is more inventory available than effectively exists, leading to under-ordering. To counteract this, I am maintaining the Lead Time parameter 'L' at 6. Since the base stock calculation is (1+L) * mean_demand, increasing L artificially raises the inventory target, forcing the backend to place orders despite the phantom 340 units. Current demand has softened slightly in the most recent periods (P41-43), but the priority is clearing the stock-out state caused by these losses. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime while reflecting the recent lower samples.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45, the system faces two main challenges: a significant amount of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) and a volatile demand regime. Total confirmed lost shipments now reach 340 units (P15: 90, P17: 97, P18: 63, P25: 90). These units remain in the 'In-transit' count of 743, but will never arrive. The OR backend uses 'on-hand + in-transit' to calculate orders, so these phantom units prevent it from ordering enough stock. To counter this, I am using L=6 as an 'explicit' offset parameter. The actual lead time has r\xe9cemment fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, but setting L higher forces the backend's base-stock calculation (\u03bc\u0302 * (L+1)) to rise, effectively ignoring the 340 lost units. Demand has stabilized somewhat in the last 10 periods (P35-P44) with an average of approximately 97 units. I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current trend while providing enough safety stock to cover the persistent stockouts observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed ghost inventory is 340 units (P15, P17, P18, P25). This continues to suppress backend ordering. Lead time parameter L=6 is applied as a corrective offset to bypass this phantom pipeline inventory. Recent demand average (P35-P44) is approximately 97 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant issue with 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments appearing as in-transit). Confirmed lost shipments include Period 15 (90 units), Period 17 (97 units), Period 18 (63 units), and Period 25 (90 units), totaling 340 units of phantom inventory. The OR backend uses 'on-hand + in-transit' to calculate orders, so it believes we have 340 units more than we actually do. To force the OR backend to place orders despite this, I am maintaining L=6. This provides an offset in the base stock calculation, effectively inflating the required stock to bypass the ghost inventory. Demand has stabilized at a lower level recently; the average for the last 10 periods (P36-P45) is 92.6 units. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. Period 46 shows 0 on-hand and 683 in-transit, but 340 of those are lost, leaving a true pipeline of 343 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant inventory discrepancy challenge. As of Period 47, there are 340 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P15, P17, P18, and P25) that remain in the 'In-transit' count. This phantom inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders because the backend assumes this stock will eventually arrive. To counteract this and force orders, I am maintaining an elevated Lead Time parameter (L=6) as a corrective offset. The most recent demand regime (last 12 periods, P35-P46) shows a mean of approximately 99 units with consistent volatility. By setting L=6 and mu_hat based on the last 12 periods, I am ensuring the target base stock (calculated as (1+L)*mu) is high enough to trigger replenishment despite the 340 phantom units in the pipeline.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 with 50 periods total. 'In-transit' inventory is 683 units, but 340 units are confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost orders: P15, P17, P18, P25). The actual pipeline is 343 units (683 - 340). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, I am using L=6 as a corrective offset (Promised L=2 + 4 periods displacement for the 340 lost units). Recent demand (P35-P47) shows a mean of 95.6 units, reflecting a lower regime compared to the previous peak. I'll use recent_N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current trend while maintaining the L=6 safety buffer to clear the current zero-inventory stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Demand regime P35-P47 stabilized at a mean of ~96 units. Ghost inventory remains at 340 units, requiring L=6 as a corrective parameter in the OR backend.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has a confirmed ghost inventory problem totaling 340 units (orders from P15, P17, P18, and P25 that never arrived). These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (Total: 683), leading the OR backend to believe inventory is sufficient when it is actually zero on-hand. Period 48 conclude shows another period of 0 sales despite demand of 110. To force the OR backend to place an order, I must increase the lead time parameter 'L' to act as a multiplier for the base stock calculation, effectively offsetting the phantom inventory. I am setting L=7 (an increase from L=6) because the pipeline view is heavily skewed and on-hand inventory has been zero for three consecutive periods. Use recent_N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stabilized demand regime (avg ~96) from Period 35 onwards.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Ghost inventory of 340 units (P15, P17, P18, P25) continues to block auto-replenishment. Lead time parameter L increased to 7 to serve as a corrective offset against this phantom pipeline stock and trigger necessary orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' count of 773 units. However, based on the historical analysis, 340 of these units are confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P15, P17, P18, P25). Subtracting these results in an actual pipeline of 433 units. The demand regime from P35-P49 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 96 units. To counteract the backend's 'on-hand + pipeline' calculation, which overestimates stock by 340 units, I must manipulate the lead time parameter L. Setting L=7 essentially increases the base stock target to cover (1+7) periods of demand, creating a sufficient buffer to trigger the ordering of approximately 100 fresh units despite the phantom 340 units. This approach maintains service levels while physical inventory is zero.
