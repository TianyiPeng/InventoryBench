Demand Analysis: Historical samples (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) show a mean demand of approximately 86 units. However, Period 1 actual demand was 98. This suggests a slightly higher demand than the historical average. \n3. Inventory Position: On-hand: 0. In-transit: 128 (ETA Period 3). We are currently experiencing a stockout because the initial inventory was 0 and nothing arrived in Period 1. \n4. Strategy: I need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 periods) because the order I place now (P2) will not arrive until Period 4. Total demand to cover for P2, P3, P4 is roughly 3 * 90 = 270 units. \n5. OR Recommendation: The OR algorithm suggests 127 units. Pipeline is 128. Total coverage with OR recommendation = 127 + 128 = 255 units. \n6. Adjustment: Given the stockout in Period 1 (98 lost sales), I will follow the OR's recommendation of 127 units.

Demand Analysis: Historical average demand is approximately 86 units/period (84, 55, 79, 85, 126). 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 because it sees 320 units in the pipeline against a base-stock level calculated for 3 periods of demand (~258 units). 5. Strategy: Because we have had 3 consecutive periods of 0 sales due to 0 arrivals (stockouts), we are losing significant profit ($19/unit). I suspect the Period 1 shipment is lost.

The Period 2 order is currently at L=3 and should arrive this period or next. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are [98, 62, 68, 96, 126] (Average ~90). The most recent demand (126) is the highest recorded, possibly indicating an upward trend for this basic snack item. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation is very low (9 units) because it sees a large pipeline (207) relative to historical averages. However, with demand possibly rising and lead-time being unstable, a slightly higher buffer than the OR recommendation is prudent to navigate the variability, though we must avoid excessive holding costs.

The effective pipeline consists only of orders from P24 and P25 (total 200 units). Demand Analysis: Recent demand has spiked significantly (P24: 169, P25: 167), well above the historical mean of ~85. The OR algorithm recommends 0 because it treats the massive 820 'in-transit' units as valid, whereas most are lost.

Demand Analysis: A regime shift occurred at P24. Since P24, demand has been: 169, 167, 168, 111. Total recent demand = 615, Avg = 153.75. The OR agent recommendation of 0 is likely due to the un-discounted pipeline of 1230 units, which is misleading. 3.

Target base stock = 155 (mean) * 3 (L+1) + safety stock \u2248 550-600. Current reliable pipeline (510) is slightly below this.
