The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 4. To bridge the gap until then, I need to account for immediate demand (Period 1, 2, 3) and the arrival period (Period 4). Total units needed to cover demand through the arrival of the next order is roughly (L+1) * Average Demand = 3 * 86 = 258 units. Since current On-hand and In-transit are 0, I will place an initial order of 300 units to establish a baseline inventory and accommodate the high-end variance seen in history (126 units).",

Since the system confirms its arrival in the 'Period 3 conclude' message (visible at the start of Period 4), and Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0, the order is currently delayed or the lead time is longer than promised. However, I must strictly follow the observation delay rule: Order P1 arrives DURING P3, visibility at start of P4. If P3 conclude says 0, it means the order did not arrive in P3. However, I must check the 'In-transit' total: P1(300)+P2(90)+P3(50) = 440. All these units are still in-transit. This confirms the lead time is at least 3 periods or orders are delayed. Current on-hand is 0, meaning we have lost sales for 3 periods. To cover the pipeline (L+1 periods), and accounting for the high inventory already in-transit (440 units vs a 4-period demand of ~332), I should not over-order until the pipeline clears.

The order from P44 (100 units) is now 5 periods old and highly likely lost based on the patterns established in carry-over insights. Recent successful arrivals (P40-P43) arrived in 2-3 periods. Looking at the active pipeline: P45 (100 units), P46 (100 units), P47 (100 units), and P48 (100 units). These are expected to satisfy demand for the final two periods (P49 and P50) as they arrive.

Demand for the final period (P50) must be covered by arrivals in P50 (orders from P47/P48). Since P50 is the final period, any inventory remaining at the end of P50 is a loss (holding cost). Therefore, the objective is to have just enough to cover P49 and P50 without excess.

Since a Period 50 order would arrive, at the earliest, in Period 51 (for L=1) or Period 50 (if L=0, but history shows L is at least 1), it cannot be sold.
