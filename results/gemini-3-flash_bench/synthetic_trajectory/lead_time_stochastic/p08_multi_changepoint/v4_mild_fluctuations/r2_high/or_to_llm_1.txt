The OR recommendation is 128 units, based on this historical data and the critical fractile (0.95). Currently, there is 0 inventory on-hand and 0 in-transit.

The OR recommendation of 128 units appears to be a reasonable base-stock calculation to start the pipeline.

The fact that arrived=0 in Period 3 conclude for the Period 1 order strongly suggests a lead-time delay or a lost shipment. 2.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) averages ~86. Recent demand is trending upwards. 4.

In-transit consists of Period 2 (124 units - essentially confirmed lost after 7 periods), Period 6 (60 units), and Period 8 (60 units). Total reliable pipeline is 120 units. \n2. **Lead Time Inference**: Actual lead times have been highly variable: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1. The promised lead time is 2, but we are seeing a 'step' pattern (orders from P5 and P7 arrived together in P8). Orders arrive after 1 to 3 periods.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Historical demand (P1-P8) is approx 77 units/period (87, 86, 62, 80, 58, 86, 77, 77). The distribution is relatively stable within the 60-90 range.\n4. **OR Recommendation**: OR suggests 0 units because it includes the lost Period 2 shipment (124 units) in its pipeline calculation. If we subtract the lost 124 units, the OR's uncapped base stock logic would likely recommend approximately 100-110 units.\n5. **Strategy**: To cover demand over the lead time (avg 2-3 periods), we need to maintain roughly 230-300 units in the system (on-hand + reliable pipeline). Currently, we have 86 (on-hand) + 120 (reliable pipeline) = 206.

The average demand over the last 5 periods (~112) is significantly higher than the overall average (~87).

Subtracting these 558 units from the 678 in-transit leaves only 120 units (ordered in P25) actually expected to arrive within the lead-time window. The current on-hand inventory is 63 units. My demand analysis shows a clear regime shift: since Period 14, mean demand has risen significantly, averaging approximately 115 units over the last 12 periods, and peaking at 166 units last period. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1, where L is the max observed 2-3 day lead time), I need approximately 345 units. Current total inventory (On-hand 63 + Real In-transit 120) equals 183. To reach a safe stock level of ~340 units, I must order approximately 157 units.

Based on historical data, shipments exceeding a 3-period lead time are effectively lost. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1278 units is dominated by such losses. Specifically, our analysis confirms the following as lost/ghost inventory: P2(124), P6(60), P15(80), P17(94), P18(100), P19(100), P25(120), P29(120), and P30(120), totaling 918 units. Now, P33(120) is also 3 periods old and did not arrive in P35, bringing the likely ghost total to 1038 units. The 'real' pipeline consists only of orders from P34 (120 units) and P35 (120 units), plus any order placed today. Demand has shifted to a higher mean of ~115-125 units. With 0 on-hand and only 240 units of reliable inventory in-transit, we are facing imminent stockouts. To cover the lead-time window (L+1 = 3 periods) at a demand rate of ~120 units/period, we need a base stock of roughly 360-400 units. Since 'real' pipeline is 240, an order of 120-160 is required.
