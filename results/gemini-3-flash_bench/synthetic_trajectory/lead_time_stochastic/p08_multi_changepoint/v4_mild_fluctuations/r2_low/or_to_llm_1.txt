Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 84, 55, 79, 85, and 126 (Mean: 85.8, Std Dev: 25.7). The OR algorithm recommends ordering 128 units based on these stats and the critical fractile (0.5 for $1 profit/$1 holding cost) using the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. Since the lead time is 2 periods, an order placed now (P1) will arrive in Period 3. We must cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. Average demand over 3 periods is approximately 257 units. However, the OR capped policy is more conservative (128 units).

Adjustment: We have been stocked out for 3 periods. Even if P1's order arrives during P4 (and becomes visible in P5), we need more inventory to cover future demand and buffer against the 0 on-hand status.

Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because the pipeline (209) + on-hand (54) suggests an coverage of ~263 units, which is ~3 periods of demand.

Recent demand is stable around the mean (71 to 95 units).\n3. **Stock Position**: Total effective inventory (On-hand 79 + Effective Pipeline 179) = 258 units.

Average demand is approximately 80 units. I need to cover Period 14 (now) and the lead time period (2 periods), totaling 3 periods of demand (~240 units).

Recent demand is in a high regime, averaging ~125 units over the last 5 periods (P31-P35). With 0 on-hand inventory and the likelihood that P29/P30 are also lost or severely delayed, I must place a substantial order to ensure future demand is met. Current active/reliable pipeline likely only consists of P31-P35 (roughly 630 units). Given a (L+1) horizon (3 periods) at a demand of ~130, we need ~400 units in the immediate pipeline.

Additionally, orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47 (totaling 460 units) have not yet arrived. The game ends at Period 50, meaning only orders placed in Period 48 or earlier that arrive in Periods 49 or 50 will matter for resolving demand and avoiding stockouts. Since the lead time for successful deliveries has recently stabilized at 1-3 periods, the order from P44 (120 units), P45 (120 units), and P46 (100 units) represent the most likely arrivals for the final two periods. Demand analysis: Demand has been fluctuating between 90-125 units. The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it is 'seeing' the massive (but mostly lost) pipeline. Action: We need to ensure demand for Period 49 and 50 is met. Period 48 had 0 on-hand and 0 arrivals, resulting in a stockout. Period 49 needs stock immediately. The order from P44 (placed 5 periods ago) or P45 (4 periods ago) should ideally arrive now, but supplier reliability is low (~25% success rate). To maximize potential profit in the final two periods while acknowledging that any order placed today (P49) will not arrive before the game ends (P50 conclude), the focus is on managing the existing (likely) pipeline.
