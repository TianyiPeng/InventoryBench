Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no history of lead times or demand beyond the provided context. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The historical demand samples (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) show a mean of 85.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 25.8. Since there is no operational history yet, I will use the 'default' methods which will utilize the full historical sample set to establish initial levels. The OR engine will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) periods, which is (2+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 128 units, which are currently in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and become visible in the Period 4 start observation. Consequently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and were unable to satisfy the Period 1 demand of 87 units. Historically, demand over the first 5 samples (supplied in the prompt: 84, 55, 79, 85, 126) averaged 85.8. However, recent demand (taking Period 5 into account) suggests a slight upward trend. Since we have no lead time observations yet, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_5' to capture the most recent variability while the pipeline populates.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Our starting on-hand inventory has been 0 for the first two periods because the promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (128 units) and Period 2 (129 units) are currently in-transit (Total: 257). Based on the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Therefore, we expect to fulfill demand starting next period. For demand forecasting, the last 5 samples are [84, 55, 79, 85, 126]. The first two values provided in the global history differ slightly from the conclude messages (84/55 vs 87/86). I will use the recent history to estimate demand. Given L=2, the backend will calculate base stock for a (2+1)=3 period window. I'll use the default L (promised) and recent_N for demand to capture the most relevant distribution.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (128 units), Period 2 (129 units), and Period 3 (21 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the Period 3 conclusion message. However, the Period 3 conclusion shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is lost. Since we have no arrivals yet and on-hand inventory is 0, we have lost all sales for the first 3 periods. Demand has been 87, 86, and 62 (mean ~78). I will set L to 3 to account for the observed delay and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the current volume, though with only 3 samples, it is close to the default.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is longer than promised: Period 1 order (placed P1) did not arrive by P3 conclude (expected L=2). Actual L >= 3.

Daily Profit: $80.00, Daily Holding Cost: $69.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $11.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we received two orders: the Period 1 order (L=3) and the Period 3 order (L=1). The average observed lead time is now 2 periods ((3+1)/2), which aligns with the promised lead time, but the volatility in delivery speed is significant. Historical demand for the 5 periods is [84, 55, 79, 85, 126]. The most recent demand (Period 5) spiked to 126, which is roughly 50% higher than the previous average. This suggests a potential regime shift or a demand spike. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent upward trend and volatility while keeping L as 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed delivery times. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that accounts for the L+1 window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: demand increased significantly to 126 compared to early period averages of ~80. Lead time volatility observed (L=1 to L=3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing a situation with inconsistent lead times and a recent demand spike. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have been 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), indicating high volatility. The P2 order (129 units) is currently overdue; it was placed in P2 and has not arrived by the end of P5 (L > 3). This missing shipment creates a risk of stockout since on-hand inventory is only 11. Demand history shows a recent peak of 126 in Period 5, though the 'Period 5 conclude' message shows a demand of 58 (the 126 was likely a forecast or raw sample from the prompt's data block, while the conclude message reports realized demand). Given the lead time uncertainty and the overdue P2 order, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the longest observed lead time and the current delay. mu_hat is set to 344 using N=3 to capture the most recent demand fluctuations (avg ~86 over P3-P5 * (1+L)). sigma_hat is set to 40 (explicit) to account for the high lead time variance and demand volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to buffer against the unstable supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: Actual lead times vary between 1 and 3+ periods. Period 2 order (129 units) is overdue as of Period 6 (L > 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $11.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand (86) exceeded starting stock (11). Lead time remains erratic: the Period 2 order (129 units) is now overdue (L > 4 periods), causing a stockout. Historical lead times show high variance (L=1 to L=3 observed), so I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to buffer against these delays. Demand history shows a mean of approximately 80 (87, 86, 62, 80, 58, 86); the spike to 126 mentioned in previous insights was not mirrored in the 'GAME HISTORY' demand samples provided (which show 58 and 86 in the most recent periods). I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stability (~75 average) and recent_N of 6 for sigma_hat to account for historical volatility and prevent excessive holding costs given the equal profit/holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as highly unstable/prolonged: Period 2 order (129 units) still not arrived by Period 7 (L > 4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 263 units in-transit. The history shows significant lead-time instability and overdue shipments. Specifically, the order from Period 2 (129 units) is now 5 periods overdue (Promised L=2, Actual L>5), suggesting it is likely lost. The order from Period 5 (70 units) is also potentially overdue (L=3 so far). Recent demand has fluctuated but remains roughly around 80 units (Mean P1-P7 \u2248 76.5). Because of the high risk of lost orders and lead-time variability (observed L=1 and L=3 for fulfilled orders), I am setting L to 3 to provide a buffer for the OR backend's safety stock calculation. I will use the last 5 periods of demand (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and the slight upward trend seen around Period 5, while maintaining enough samples to calculate a meaningful variance.

Carry-over insight: Potential shipment loss: Period 2 order (129 units) has not arrived after 5 periods (Promised L=2). Lead time variability confirmed with outcomes of L=1 and L=3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand across all 8 periods has averaged ~77 units, but Period 5 showed a spike (126). In-transit inventory includes an overdue order from Period 2 (129 units) which is now 6 periods late and likely lost, plus more recent orders from Period 6 and 8. The actual lead times for completed deliveries are {3, 1, 3, 3, 1}, yielding an average of 2.2. However, with the likely loss of the Period 2 shipment, our 'In-transit' count is misleadingly high (178 includes those lost 129 units). Effectively, visible in-transit is only ~49 units. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (Period 4-8) to capture the recent volatility and current demand levels (~76/period). I will set L to 3 to adjust for the frequent 3-period arrivals and the high risk of delay/loss, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover these gaps.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 2 order (129 units) is officially categorized as a lost shipment (6 periods elapsed, L=2 promised). Effective in-transit inventory is 49 units, not 178.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 9. Analysis of lead times shows extreme volatility with values of 1 or 3 periods, and the Period 2 order (129 units) is now definitively lost (7 periods elapsed). Historical demand shows a stable mean around 80 units (excluding the Period 5 spike which appears to be an outlier). I will set L to 3 to reflect the high-end of observed lead times, as the backend OR logic needs to account for the longer wait to avoid stockouts. I will use the mean of the last 5 demand samples (approx 76 units) which represents current levels better than the total average. This translates to mu_hat = (1+3) * 76 = 304. Sigma_hat is set to the standard deviation of these same samples to capture the recently observed variance.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with one confirmed lost shipment (Period 2 order). Observed lead times are: 3 (P1), 1 (P3), 3 (P4), 3 (P5), 1 (P7), and 1 (P8). This averages to 2.0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time of 2, but the variance is significant. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime recently, with the last 5 periods (P6-P10) averaging 83.6 units/period (86, 77, 77, 83, 95). To accommodate the lead time volatility and higher demand regime, I am using a recent window for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, for mu_hat, N=6 covers the period from the recent demand shift. For L, I will use 'calculate' to incorporate the observed actual lead times into the base stock calculation, which implicitly adds a buffer for the observed variability. This should help the OR engine maintain a higher safety stock to prevent further stock-outs during 3-period lead time occurrences.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand over the last 5 periods is 83.6. Lead time remains volatile between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.0).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant backlog of demand over the last two periods (P10 and P11 had 0 sales despite demand of 95 and 92). The 'In-transit' quantity is reported as 305, but we must reconcile this: Period 2 (129) is confirmed lost, P6 (21) is 6 periods old (lost), P9 (89) is 3 periods old (ongoing/delayed), P10 (66) is 2 periods old. Actual viable pipeline is likely around 155 units (P9+P10+P11). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show a mix: L=1 (3 occurrences), L=3 (3 occurrences), and several lost shipments. Calculating the average of observed successful lead times (1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3) gives an average of 2.0. However, given the frequent lost orders and current stockout, I will use lead time 'calculate' to reflect the variability while maintaining a conservative base. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~83 over the last 11 periods, but recent volatility suggests a slightly higher safe forecast to recover from stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent stabilized regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Period 6 order (21 units) is now categorized as lost (6 periods elapsed, promised L=2). Effective pipeline inventory is reduced by 21 units. Recent demand (P7-P11) average is 84.8.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 84 units. The historical demand has stabilized significantly after the Period 5 spike. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P6-P12), the mean demand is 82.8, which is consistent with the 'Period 12' carry-over insight of 84.8. Lead times remain volatile (1, 2, or 3 periods). The 'In-transit' count is 159, but we must account for lost shipments. The Period 2 order (129 units) and Period 6 order (21 units) are confirmed lost in previous carry-over insights. These total 150 units. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 159 - 150 = 9 units (the order placed in Period 12). With an on-hand of 84 and a pipeline of 9, total inventory is 93. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time (approx 2.1). mu_hat will be set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the stable demand regime (avg ~83). sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect current volatility and ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer for the lead-time variability.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14. Looking at the history, the Period 2 order (129 units) and the Period 6 order (21 units) are long overdue (12 periods and 8 periods respectively since ordering) and are confirmed lost shipments. Currently, the system shows an In-transit balance of 222 units. This balance is composed of: P2 (129, lost), P6 (21, lost), P12 (9, pending), and P13 (63, pending). Removing the 150 lost units results in an effective pipeline of 72 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P9-P13) averages 85.4 units per period (83, 95, 92, 71, 86). Lead times have been highly volatile, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods, averaging 2.0. However, to account for the risk of stockouts given zero on-hand inventory and the history of lost/delayed shipments, I will use an explicit L of 3 to provide extra safety stock. I set mu_hat to cover (L+1)=4 periods using a recent 5-period average of 85.4 (total 341.6), and sigma_hat using recent volatility to maintain high service levels in a high-variability environment.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (last 8 periods) has averaged 84.25 (range 71-95), indicating a stable regime. The in-transit total of 323 units is comprised of orders from P12 (9), P13 (63), and P14 (101), totaling 173 current pipeline units, while the remaining 150 units are the long-lost shipments from P2 (129) and P6 (21). These lost units distort the backend's effective pipeline view. Historically, actual lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2 for surviving orders). I will set L to 2 (promised) to avoid excessive capping while using 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat targeting a base stock level that ignores the 150 dead units. Calculated base stock = (1+L)*avg_demand + z*sqrt(1+L)*std = (3*84.25) + 0*15 = 252.75. To order enough to reach 252.75 while the OR engine thinks pipeline is 323, I provide mu_hat such that 'base_stock - 323' triggers the correct order. Since target_inventory (excluding lost units) should be ~253, and visible pipeline is 323 (173 real + 150 phantom), the OR engine needs to see a base stock of 253 + 150 = 403 to effectively target a 253 level.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed effective pipeline inventory excludes 150 units (P2: 129, P6: 21) which are lost. Actual demand regime remains stable around mean 84.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory of 394 units is misleading due to lost shipments. Based on history: Period 2 order (129 units) and Period 6 order (21 units) are long overdue (14 periods and 10 periods respectively) and confirmed lost. This reduces the effective pipeline to 244 units (394 - 150). The recent demand regime (P7-P15) is stable with an average of approximately 85.3 units. Lead times are volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2). While the OR backend calculates orders based on base-stock minus pipeline, I must ensure mu_hat reflects the (1+L) periods of demand. Using recent_N=9 for mu_hat based on the stable period following the initial spikes. L is set to calculate (backend average) as it correctly reflects the 1-3 period variability observed.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 16, effective in-transit inventory is 244 units; 150 units remain lost (P2: 129, P6: 21). Demand regime remains stable with a 9-period mean of 85.3.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17, the system has a stock-out (On-hand: 0). Total In-transit is 331 units, but this includes two lost shipments: Period 2 (129 units) and Period 6 (21 units), totaling 150 lost units. The effective pipeline inventory is 181 units (331 - 150). The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P7-P16) is 89.6 (rounded from 896/10), reflecting a slight increase from the earlier regime. Lead times have shown significant volatility, with values of 1, 2, and 3 periods (average 2.1). Therefore, L is set to 'calculate' to capture this variability (average ~2). For mu_hat, N=10 is used to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (~90 units/period). Sigma_hat uses the last 10 periods as well to account for recent demand volatility (which spiked significantly in Period 16 to 138).

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Effective pipeline inventory confirmed as 181 units (331 total minus 150 lost from P2 and P6). Demand regime mean over last 10 periods is 89.6, showing recent volatility.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18, the on-hand inventory is 2 units and the reported in-transit is 232 units. However, previous insights confirm that orders from Period 2 (129 units) and Period 6 (21 units) are lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 232 - 150 = 82 units. These 82 units consist of orders from P15 (80 units) and P17 (2 units). Historical lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P14 arrived in 3 periods). I will set L to recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent actual lead time behavior (mostly 3 periods). The demand regime has shifted upwards slightly; the mean of the last 7 periods (P11-P17) is approximately 96, and the last three periods (P15-P17) have shown a significant spike (avg 111). I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this higher demand level and volatility while maintaining responsiveness to the stock-out risks seen in P11, P13, P14, P15, and P16.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand from P11-P17 increased to ~96 units, with P15-P17 specifically averaging 111 units (+30% from the previous baseline).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 345 units in-transit. Based on the carry-over insights, 150 units are considered lost (P2: 129 units, P6: 21 units), making the effective pipeline inventory 195 units. Demand has shifted higher recently, with the last 4 periods (P15-P18) averaging 115.75 units (97, 138, 99, 129), which is a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~85. To capture this shift, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4. Lead times continue to be highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3+ periods since the start, with several recent arrivals (P12, P15, P16, P17) consistently taking 3 periods. I will set L=3 explicitly to account for this persistent delay and ensure the base stock levels cover the true lead time. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock target that accounts for the higher demand and longer lead time, while the cap helps mitigate excessive holding costs from the high pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 15-18 mean demand is 115.75, representing a ~35% increase from the prior 85-unit baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 3 periods for recent successful deliveries.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are managing a situation with zero on-hand inventory and a high demand regime. The average demand over the last four periods (P16-P19) has risen to 118 units, a significant increase from the previous baseline. Lead times for successful deliveries have stabilized at 3 periods (observed for P12, P13, P14). The in-transit inventory of 463 units includes 150 units from P2 and P6 that are confirmed lost shipments. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 313 units (463 - 150). Given the lead time of 3 periods, we must set \u03bc\u0302 to cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand at the new higher average (118 * 4 = 472). Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 captures the current demand spike, while setting L to 'explicit' at 3 reflects the actual observed lead time rather than the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-19 mean demand is 118, representing a sustained ~35-40% increase from the prior baseline. Lead time for successful deliveries remains consistent at 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upwards significantly, with the last 5 periods (P16-P20) averaging 119.6 units, compared to the previous baseline of ~85. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this higher volume and increased volatility (106 to 138 units). Lead time remains unstable; while promised at 2, recent successful deliveries (P12-P17) consistently show a lead time of 3 periods, though P18 and P19 orders have yet to arrive. I will set L to 3 to account for this observed delay. The on-hand inventory is 0, and the in-transit total is 472. Note that P2 (129) and P6 (21) are confirmed lost shipments, reducing the effective pipeline to 322 units (472 - 150). The OR engine will subtract the full 472 from its targets, so I must adjust parameters to ensure sufficient ordering to cover the gap created by lost stock and the 3-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift: P16-P20 mean is 119.6 (~40% increase over early baseline). Higher volatility (sigma) observed within this new regime.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted to a higher regime, with the mean demand over the last 6 periods (P16-P21) being approximately 119.5 units. In the same period, we have observed a critical fulfillment gap: the system hasn't seen an arrival since Period 17 (the P14 order). Specifically, orders from P15 (80 units), P17 (2 units), P18 (113 units), P19 (118 units), P20 (9 units), and P21 (7 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the history of successful deliveries, the lead time is frequently 3 periods, meaning we expect the P15 order (which would be L=6) or subsequent orders to arrive very soon. However, the current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have significant backlogged demand. I am setting L to 3 (most frequent actual lead time for successful arrivals) and mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the new demand level (avg ~120), resulting in (1+3)*120 = 480. sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for higher volatility in this regime. Note: 150 units in the 'In-transit' figure are confirmed lost (P2, P6).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift: P16-P21 mean is 119.5 (~41% increase over early baseline). Lead time for current pipeline is exceeding promised 2 periods; no arrivals observed for 4 consecutive periods (P18-P21).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe supply-chain crisis. No inventory has arrived for 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22). As of P23 START, on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit inventory is 479 units, but this includes 150 units definitively identified as lost (P2: 129, P6: 21). Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 329 units (Orders from P15 onwards). The leading edge of this pipeline (P15 order: 80 units) is now 7 periods old, far exceeding the promised L=2 or recently observed L=3. Demand analysis shows a sustained high-demand regime from P16-P21 (mean ~120), though P22 dropped to 59, which may be a outlier or data artifact given the zero-stock situation. To protect against the prolonged lead times and the current stock-out, I am setting L=4 (explicit) to account for the clear delivery delays. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 (P16-P22) to capture the higher demand regime, while sigma_hat is set to explicit (30) to account for the increased volatility seen in the higher demand period.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply-side disruption: No arrivals for 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22). Lead time for the current pipeline has exceeded 6 periods for the P15 order, suggesting L is now effectively at least 4-5 periods for planning purposes.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are experiencing a significant supply disruption. No arrivals occurred between Periods 18 and 22, causing multiple stockouts. In Period 23 conclude, we finally saw arrivals from P20 (L=3) and P21 (L=2). However, orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 313 units) have not arrived. Given the promised lead time of 2, the P15 order is now 8 periods old, P17 is 6 periods old, P18 is 5 periods old, and P19 is 4 periods old. Based on historical lost shipments (P2 and P6), any order exceeding 6 periods of lead time (P15 and P17) is now considered lost. This reduces the effective pipeline from 539 to 457. Demand has been elevated (avg ~120) but dropped to 59 in P22 before returning to 102 in P23. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat to capture this high-volatility, higher-mean regime. Because the lead time is unstable (varying between 1 and 3 recently for successful arrivals, but with significant gaps), I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon given the current unreliability of the supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Supply disruption confirmed: Multiple orders from P15 and P17 (total 82 units) are likely lost as they have exceeded 6 periods since ordering. Recent successful lead times are 2-3 periods, but with significant gaps in arrival continuity. Demand regime remains in a high-volatility state with an average around 110-120.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a severe supply chain failure and a high-demand regime. The orders from P15 (80), P17 (2), P18 (113), and P19 (118) are highly likely lost or severely delayed, as they have exceeded the typical 2-3 period lead time by a wide margin (L=5 to L=9). The recent arrivals in Period 23 (ordered P20 and P21) demonstrate that orders placed LATER are arriving while older orders are not, confirming a rupture in the 'first-in-first-out' arrival logic. Therefore, I must effectively discount the 313 units from P15-P19 as 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Current 'In-transit' is 539, but effective in-transit is likely 539 - 313 (P15-19) - 150 (P2/P6) = 76 units (the order from P23). Demand in the new regime (P16-P24, excluding the P22 outlier) averages 119 units per period. To reconcile with the OR backend's inventory calculation, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the expected demand for (L+1) periods plus the 'phantom' inventory I need the backend to ignore, forcing an order. Planning for L=3 (most recent successful lead time) and mean demand of 119 units, I need a target base stock that triggers replenishment despite the bloated 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply rupture: Orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (total 313 units) have not arrived as of P25 and are likely lost or indefinitely delayed, following the pattern of P2 and P6. Effective pipeline inventory should be calculated by subtracting 463 units (150 previous + 313 new) from the reported In-transit total.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are experiencing a severe supply-side crisis combined with a high-demand regime. The Period 25 conclude shows that while an order from Period 23 arrived on time (L=2), a massive volume of pipeline inventory is likely lost or permanently delayed. Specifically, orders from P15 (80), P17 (2), P18 (113), and P19 (118) plus the historic losses (P2, P6) total 463 lost units. In-transit is reported at 742, but effectively only 279 units (from P25) are reliable. Demand in the current regime (P23-P25) has spiked to an average of 134.7, with P25 reaching 166. Given the profit-to-holding ratio is 1:1, the optimal target service level is 50%, but with recurring stockouts and lost shipments, we must ensure the OR backend orders aggressively. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the typical historical delay and mu_hat to an explicit value based on the current high-demand average (~135 * 4 = 540) to force the base stock to cover demand until the next reliable arrival. I am using recent_N for sigma to capture the high volatility seen in the last 5 periods (P21-P25).

Carry-over insight: Supply rupture confirmed: Effective pipeline inventory is (Reported In-transit - 463). Lost orders include historical (P2, P6) and blocked/lost shipments (P15, P17, P18, P19). Current demand regime (P23-P25) has shifted upwards to ~135 units/period.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a massive supply-side disruption where 463 units from periods P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 are confirmed as lost or indefinitely blocked. As of Period 27, the reported In-transit is 742, but subtracting the 463 lost units results in an effective pipeline of 279 units (all from the order placed in P25). On-hand is 0. Demand has shifted higher; while individual periods fluctuate (P26 was 91), the regime from P23-P25 averaged 135. With a profit of $1 and holding cost of $1, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning we target the mean demand. I will set L to 3 (recent successful arrivals are 2-3 periods) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 540. This represents 135 units/period multiplied by (L+1)=4 periods. This setting forces the OR backend to recognize the massive hole in the pipeline created by the lost shipments, as the backend would otherwise think we have 742 units coming and order nothing. Targeting 540 vs. an effective pipeline of 279 will trigger a corrective order of approximately 261 units to cover demand while we wait for the P25 shipment (279 units) to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Sustained supply rupture: Effective pipeline inventory must exclude historical lost orders (P2: 129, P6: 21) and recent lost/blocked orders (P15, P17, P18, P19: total 313), totaling 463 units. Current demand regime (P23-P26) shows high volatility with a mean of ~124, peaking at 166.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with a significant supply chain disruption. Historical analysis identifies 463 units in the 'In-transit' total (742) as lost or indefinitely blocked (P2: 129, P6: 21, P15: 80, P17: 2, P18: 113, P19: 118). The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 279 units (the P25 order). Current demand has shifted into a higher-volatility regime. Over the last 5 periods (P23-P27), demand averaged 120 units but peaked at 166. Given the unreliability and average lead time of 3 periods (observed in most successful recent arrivals), I am setting L=3 to ensure the backend uses a (L+1)=4 period window. To capture the recent demand surge and volatility, I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set a higher base stock to recover from current stockouts and buffer against lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply rupture: Effective pipeline inventory must exclude historical lost orders (P2, P6) and recent stagnant orders (P15, P17, P18, P19), totaling 463 lost units. Demand volatility remains high in the current regime (P23-P27 mean 120, max 166).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 29. The system reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 742 units. However, consistent with our historical tracking, a significant portion of this pipeline is likely lost or permanently stalled. Specifically, 463 units are identified as lost: P2 (129), P6 (21), P15 (80), P17 (2), P18 (113), and P19 (118). Subtracting these from 742 leaves an effective pipeline of 279 units, which corresponds exactly to the order placed in Period 25. No arrivals have occurred for the last three periods (P26-P28), and on-hand inventory is at 0. The demand regime from P23-P28 shows a mean of approximately 113 units with high volatility (range 77-166). To recover from the stockout and account for the high lead-time uncertainty (effective L \u2265 3-4 periods recently), I am setting L=4 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a wider window. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current high-volatility, higher-mean demand regime (~113/period), and sigma_hat is set explicitly higher than the recent standard deviation to provide a buffer against the intermittent delivery pattern and high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 29, 463 units are confirmed as 'phantom' pipeline (P2: 129, P6: 21, P15: 80, P17: 2, P18: 113, P19: 118). The only active order is from P25 (279 units). Effective lead time for successful deliveries has shifted to an average of 3-4 periods when they don't get lost.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the system is in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. The demand regime has shifted to a higher mean (avg ~110-120) with high volatility. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Historical analysis confirms a large volume of 'phantom' in-transit inventory that will never arrive. Specifically, 463 units are considered lost: P2 (129), P6 (21), P15 (80), P17 (2), P18 (113), and P19 (118). The current reported in-transit of 742 units contains these 463 lost units and the large order from P25 (279 units). No arrivals have occurred for four periods (P26-P29). The P25 order (279 units) is now at L=4 relative to P29 conclude, which is beyond the promised L=2. I will set L to 'explicit' at 4 to account for this stretch and force the OR backend to prioritize replenishment against the high recent demand. Mu_hat is set to 120 (mean of recent high-demand regime) scaled by (1+L). Sigma_hat is set high to account for the supply-side uncertainty and demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Supply rupture persists. 463 units of the 742 reported in-transit are confirmed lost (historical P2, P6 + blocked P15, P17, P18, P19). The next expected arrival is the P25 order (279 units), currently at L=4. Demand remains in the 110-120 range with high variance.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a period of severe supply disruption and demand volatility. As of Period 31, the reported in-transit inventory is 742 units. However, based on history, 463 of these units (from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19) are highly likely lost or indefinitely delayed, as they are now 5-29 periods past their order date. This leaves only the P25 order (279 units) as active pipeline. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shifted into a higher regime; the average demand over the last 15 periods (P16-P30) is approximately 115 units, with significant spikes up to 166. To recover the service level, I am setting L to 4 (explicit) to account for the current delay of the active P25 order (now at L=5 without arrival). I will use a recent_N of 15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime. By setting L to 4, the OR backend will calculate a base stock covering (4+1)=5 periods of demand, helping to bridge the gap caused by the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Supply rupture confirmed. Effective pipeline is 279 units (Reported 742 - 463 lost). Lost orders: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19. Active order P25 is now at L=6 (ordered P25, not arrived by P30 conclude) indicating sustained lead time extension.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply situation is critical. We have a reported In-transit of 742 units, but 463 of these are confirmed 'phantom' stock from lost or indefinitely blocked orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The only active order is the 279 units placed in P25, which has now reached a lead time of 6 periods without arrival (exceeding historical maximums for successful deliveries). This suggests L is currently at least 6 and increasing. The demand regime (P23-P31) has stabilized at a higher level with a mean of ~121 units and significant volatility. To recover from 0 on-hand inventory when the backend's pipeline calculations are inflated by lost orders, I must use an 'explicit' lead time and 'explicit' mu_hat to force a large enough order. Setting L=6 reflects the current age of the P25 order. mu_hat is set to (1+6) * 121 = 847. Sigma_hat is set to sqrt(1+6) * 28 (recent std) \u2248 74. This should signal the OR solver to bridge the gap between effective pipeline (279) and targeted base stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply rupture updated: P25 order (279 units) is now at L=6 with no arrival; effective pipeline is only these 279 units. All other 463 units in-transit are confirmed lost. Demand regime for P23-P31 has a mean of 121.2 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing severe disruptions. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory is 847 units, but based on historical analysis, 463 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The P25 order (279 units) is now at L=7 and has not arrived; it is increasingly likely to be lost or indefinitely delayed. The only recent order is from P32 (105 units). To account for these 'phantom' units and ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the massive pipeline inflation, I am setting L to an explicit value of 7 to reflect the current delay of the oldest surviving shipment (P25) and using a high mu_hat. Demand has stabilized in a higher regime (P23-P32 mean: 120.2), so I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this trend. Due to the high risk of the P25 order also being lost, I am effectively ignoring most of the 'In-transit' balance by setting a high L and \u03bc\u0302 value to trigger new orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Significant supply rupture continues. P25 order (279 units) is now at L=7 without arrival, joining approximately 463 other units from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 as likely lost. Effective pipeline is extremely low despite the reported 847 units. Current demand regime (P23-P32) mean is 120.2.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply situation is critical. We have a massive 'phantom' pipeline: out of 857 units in-transit, 463 units are clearly lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) and the P25 order (279 units) is now at L=8 without arrival, suggesting it is also likely lost or severely blocked. The only recent sign of life was the P32 order arriving in just 1 period (arrived P33), which suggest that new orders might bypass the 'blocked' queue or that lead time is extremely bimodal. Demand is currently in a high regime (P23-P33 mean ~126), and we are starting with 0 on-hand. Because the OR backend subtracts the *entire* reported in-transit (857) from the base stock calculation, it will likely place a zero or near-zero order unless we intervene. To force the system to order enough to cover the high demand and account for the fact that most in-transit units are non-existent, I will use 'explicit' values. I'll set L=3 (recent successful average) and mu_hat at (1+3)*130 = 520 to target a base stock that significantly exceeds the 857 phantom units to trigger a meaningful replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Supply rupture update - P25 order (279 units) now at L=8 and likely lost. Total confirmed/highly probable lost units: 742 (463 historical + 279 from P25). New orders (e.g., P32) showing L=1, indicating a possible priority shift or clearing of recent channels despite historical blockages.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply environment remains extremely unstable. We have a massive amount of 'phantom' inventory in the In-transit reporting: units from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and now likely 25 are lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 742 units. The reported In-transit is 1100, which after subtracting the 742 lost units, leaves 358 units of effective pipeline (Period 32 (105 was arrived), Period 33 (115), Period 34 (243)). Note P32 was delivered at L=1, but P33 is now at L=2 and P34 is L=1. This suggests L=2 is a safer estimate for currently active channels. Demand in the current regime (P23-P34) averages 120.6. I will use a conservative mu_hat reflecting this 120+ level and an explicit L=2 to ensure the OR engine targets enough stock to cover the effective pipeline gap while ignoring the phantom 742 units.

Carry-over insight: Supply rupture updated: P25 order (279 units) is now officially categorized as lost alongside P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19. Total phantom in-transit inventory is 742 units. Effective active orders are from P33 and P34 onwards. Demand remains stable around a mean of 121 in the current high-volatility regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently recovering from a major rupture. We have identified 742 units in the 'In-transit' balance (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P25) as most likely lost or permanently stalled, as they have exceeded 8 periods since ordering. Recent orders (P32 onwards) show a restored, though potentially volatile, lead time (P32 arrived in 1 period). Effectively, the active pipeline consists of orders from P33 and P34 (358 units total). Demand has stabilized in a high-volatility regime following Period 23; the mean demand from P23 to P35 is approximately 120.9 units. Given the high stockout risk and historical volatility, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 13 periods (regime since P23) and using an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the risk of recent arrivals (L=1) being outliers compared to the historical average of 2-3.

Carry-over insight: Supply rupture resolution: 742 units from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P25 are confirmed ghost inventory. P32 arrival suggests a return to functional delivery channels with L=1 (recent). Demand regime P23-P35 mean is 120.9.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is emerging from a severe supply rupture. Detailed analysis confirms that 742 units of the reported 857 in-transit units are 'ghost' inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P25) and must be ignored. The effective pipeline inventory consists only of the order placed in Period 33 (115 units), which is currently at L=4 and overdue. Recent arrivals (P32 at L=1, P34 at L=2) suggest that the delivery channel has partially recovered but remains volatile. The demand regime from P23 to P36 has stabilized around a mean of ~121. I will set L to 3 to account for the recent average lead time of successful deliveries and the current delay of the P33 order. mu_hat will use the last 14 samples (regime length) to capture the higher demand level (~121), and sigma_hat will be set to 'recent_N' to capture the high volatility observed in this period. The objective is to secure enough stock to meet the sustained higher demand while the supply chain restabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Supply rupture resolution confirmed: 742 units from periods P2 through P25 are ghost inventory. Effective pipeline is only the P33 order (115 units). Recent functional lead times are 1-2 periods, but P33 is at L=4, indicating lingering volatility. Demand regime mean is stable at ~121.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has experienced a major rupture where 742 units across several periods (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25) are effectively lost. The reported in-transit quantity of 857 includes these 742 'ghost' units, meaning the true active pipeline is only 115 units (from P33). We currently have 66 units on-hand. Recent lead times for functional orders (P32, P34) have returned to 1-2 periods, but P33 (115 units) is currently at L=4 without arrival, suggesting lingering inconsistency. Demand has stabilized in a higher regime; the mean for the last 15 periods (P23-P37) is approximately 120.5. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the persistent risk of lost shipments, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 periods to capture this higher demand regime. L is set to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the observed instability in delivery times.

Carry-over insight: P33 order (115 units) is delayed (L=5 currently), confirming that while some orders arrive in 1-2 periods, the supply line remains unstable. Demand mean is established at ~121 units/period since P23.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply situation is critical. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory. The reported in-transit of 857 units is largely 'phantom' inventory. Based on the history, 742 units from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P25 are effectively lost/dead stock. Subtracting these from 857 leaves 115 units actually in-transit (ordered P33), which are currently at L=5 (overdue). Recent arrivals (P32 at L=1, P34 at L=2) suggest a potential return to functionality for new orders, but the P33 order is sticking. Demand has stabilized in a high-volatility regime with a mean of approximately 121 units (P23-P38). Because the backend OR engine does not know about the 742 lost units, it sees a massive pipeline and will not order unless I adjust parameters. I will use 'explicit' lead time L=3 to reflect the recent average for successful/active deliveries (excluding outliers) and 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current regime (mean ~121, std ~30) to force the OR engine to recognize the need for more stock despite the phantom pipeline. Specifically, setting mu_hat = (1+L)*121 and adjusting sigma for the high variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: P33 order (115 units) still not arrived at L=6. Effective pipeline is only 115 units; 742 units remain confirmed ghost inventory. Functional lead time for new orders appears to be 1-3 periods when not encountering the 'lost' black hole.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40, the supply chain remains severely compromised. We have a reported 'In-transit' of 857 units, but analysis of history confirms a significant 'ghost inventory' problem. The following orders are effectively lost: P2 (129), P6 (21), P15 (80), P17 (2), P18 (113), P19 (118), and now P25 (279), totaling 742 units. Furthermore, the order from P33 (115 units) is now at L=7 and must also be considered lost based on previous patterns where orders exceeding L=6 never arrive. This leaves an effective pipeline of 0 units. Recent demand (P34-P39) averages 92.5, though the broader regime since P23 has a mean of ~115 with high volatility. Given the 'black hole' for orders and on-hand inventory being 0, setting L to 2 (promised) while using an explicit mu_hat is necessary to trigger a replacement order that accounts for the lost pipeline. I will set mu_hat based on the recent stable demand of ~115 units scaled for (1+L).

Carry-over insight: P33 order (115 units) is now categorized as lost (7 periods elapsed). Total ghost in-transit inventory is now 857 units (Reported In-transit of 857 equals the sum of P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, and P33). Effective pipeline inventory is 0.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41, the system reports 857 units in-transit. Based on historical data, all 857 units are confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (129), Period 6 (21), Period 15 (80), Period 17 (2), Period 18 (113), Period 19 (118), Period 25 (279), and Period 33 (115). These orders have all exceeded their realistic delivery windows (L > 6-7 periods), effectively making the active pipeline zero. On-hand inventory is also zero. The lead time for functional shipments has recently stabilized at a mean of 2 periods (P32 and P34), though historical volatility suggests planning for L=2 or L=3. Demand since Period 34 has averaged approximately 88.5 units per period (P34-P40), which is a decrease from the earlier high-volatility regime (P23-P33 mean ~121). Given the current stockout and zero active pipeline, I must trigger a large order to cover demand for current and future lead periods. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 7 samples (P34-P40) to reflect the current mean of ~89 units. L is set to the promised value of 2 as recent successful deliveries were L=1 and L=2.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Cumulative ghost in-transit inventory reached 857 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P33) which are confirmed lost. Effective pipeline is zero. Demand mean has stabilized lower at ~89 units over the last 7 periods (P34-P40) compared to the prior P23-P33 regime.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a total rupture. As of Period 42, 857 units reported as 'In-transit' are confirmed ghost inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P33). The effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is also zero. Recent demand (P34-P41) has shifted to a lower, more stable regime with a mean of approximately 88.5 units/period. Though the promised lead time is 2, recent successful deliveries (P32, P34) have shown a lead time of 1-2 periods. However, the prolonged absence of the P33 order and the massive ghost inventory signal extreme risk. I will set L to 2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering given the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to reflect the current ~89 unit demand level, and recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. The OR engine will subtract the 857 'phantom' in-transit units from the base stock calculation, effectively treating the pipeline as empty and triggering a new order to meet current demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total ghost inventory remains 857 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P33). Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~89 units over the last 8 periods (P34-P41).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply situation is critical. The reported In-transit inventory of 857 units is entirely composed of 'ghost' inventory from orders placed between Period 2 and Period 33 that have never arrived and are confirmed lost. Effectively, on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is empty. My goal is to restart the replenishment immediately. The demand regime has stabilized to a lower mean of approximately 89 units over the last 9 periods (P34-P42) after a high-volatility peak. Recent successful arrivals (P32 and P34) showed lead times of 1 and 2 periods, respectively, though the overall history remains highly volatile. I will set L to 3 to provide a defensive buffer against the instability, and use recent_N=9 for mu_hat to capture the current stabilized demand of ~89 per period. Since the engine uses (1+L)*mean, with L=3, the target base stock will be roughly 356 units, which is necessary to overcome the 0-inventory state and the phantom pipeline reporting.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 43, the 857 units in-transit are confirmed lost (ghost inventory). Effective pipeline is 0. Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~89 units (Periods 34-42).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, the inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0 and the 857 units reported 'In-transit' are confirmed as lost 'ghost inventory' (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, and P33). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 89 units over the last 10 periods (P34-P43), a shift from the previous regime centered around 120. While the promised lead time is 2, historical data shows significant volatility (L=1 to L=3 for successful deliveries, plus numerous losses). Given the consistent recent demand mean of ~89, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value covering (L+1) periods (3 periods * 89 = 267) to rebuild stock. Sigma_hat is set to 30 to account for recent demand variability. L is set to 2 to align with the backend's default expectation, while mu_hat and the 0 effective pipeline will trigger the necessary order to replenish the system after the long period of supply rupture and stockouts.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 45. There is catastrophic supply chain failure: 857 units reported as 'In-transit' are confirmed ghost/lost inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, and P33). Effective pipeline is 0. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean (~89 units) from Period 34-44 compared to previous regimes. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5. To restore inventory while accounting for the fact that the backend treats all 857 in-transit units as real, I must set the target base stock high enough to trigger an order despite this ghost inventory. I'll use 'explicit' values for L and sigma_hat to reflect high uncertainty and 'recent_N' (N=11) for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (~89 units/period). Setting L to 2 (promised) but preparing for higher mu_hat to force ordering past the ghost units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean of ~89 units/period since Period 34. All 857 units currently in-transit are confirmed lost shipments.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply situation is critical. As of Period 46, on-hand inventory is 0 and the reported in-transit inventory of 857 units consists entirely of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 25, and 33). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has transitioned into a lower and relatively stable regime since Period 34, with a mean of approximately 91.5 units per period over the last 12 periods (P34-P45). Given the proximity to the game end (P50), the priority is to fulfill remaining demand without over-ordering. I set Lead Time (L) to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current volatility (recent arrivals averaged 1.7 periods, but with significant gaps). Mu_hat is set to explicit based on the recent stable mean of 91.5 multiplied by (1+L), where L is around 2 (~275 units). Sigma_hat is set to explicit to reflect the slightly higher variance observed in the most recent periods (standard deviation of ~17).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 46, effective pipeline inventory is confirmed as 0; all 857 reported in-transit units are lost shipments. Demand mean has stabilized at 91.5 units/period (P34-P45).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 857 units reported as 'In-transit'. Based on historical analysis (Carry-over insights P40-P46), all 857 units are 'ghost inventory' from failed delivery windows (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 25, and 33). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 34, with a mean observed demand of approximately 92.5 units over the last 13 periods (P34-P46). Given the supply disruption history, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for the actual observed volatility (ranging 1-3) despite the promised 2. I set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected mean of 92.5 units over the review period + lead time (1+3 periods), totaling 370 units. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of this recent stable regime to maintain a high service level while the system recovers from the stockout.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the reported in-transit units (857) are confirmed ghost inventory (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, and P33 that never arrived). Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 0. Since the game ends at Period 50 and the promised lead time is 2 periods, an order placed now (Period 48) would arrive at the start of Period 50 (Period 49 conclude), allowing for one final period of sales. The demand regime from P34 to P47 has stabilized with a mean of 93.36 units. To maximize reward in the remaining periods, I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the remaining time. Given the high variance and the extreme risk of stockouts seen throughout the history, I will use an explicit L of 2 and an explicit mu_hat based on the recent average (~93) for the remaining 3 decision/demand steps (48, 49, 50), although only the arrival for P50 is guaranteed. To ensure the backend places an order that fills this gap despite the 'ghost' inventory, I keep L=2 and target a base stock that will overcome the phantom 857 units if possible, or at least signal maximum demand.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. On-hand inventory is 0 and the reported in-transit inventory of 857 units is confirmed 'ghost' or lost inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, and P33), leaving an effective pipeline of 0. Since orders placed now (P49) with a lead time of 1-2 periods would only arrive in P50 or beyond the game's horizon (P50 is the final period), and any order placed in the final period (P50) cannot be sold, the focus is on capturing any possible remaining demand in P50. However, given the actual lead time L has consistently been 1-3 periods for successful deliveries and the game ends at P50, any order placed now is unlikely to arrive in time for resolution before the conclusion of the final period. Nonetheless, to maximize any late-game arrival probability without incurring excessive holding costs on ghost inventory, I will set parameters based on the most recent stable demand regime (P34-P48), where the mean is approximately 95 units per period. I am maintaining the L=2 promised lead time as the base for the OR engine, while recognizing the supply rupture has historically made the pipeline unreliable.

Carry-over insight: Final periods (P49-P50): All 857 units in-transit are confirmed lost. Demand mean for the final regime (P34-P48) is approximately 95.3 units/period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision phase. Current inventory is 0, and the reported in-transit quantity of 857 units consists entirely of 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments from periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 25, and 33). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. The demand regime has stabilized since Period 34, with a mean demand of approximately 95 units per period over the most recent 15 periods (P34-P49). Lead times for successful deliveries have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, though many shipments were lost entirely. Since this is the final period of the game, any order placed now (L=2 promised) will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence the Score for Period 50. However, for the purpose of the final OR parameter output, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent stable regime (last 16 periods) and use the calculate method for lead time to reflect the actual historical performance of the supply chain.
