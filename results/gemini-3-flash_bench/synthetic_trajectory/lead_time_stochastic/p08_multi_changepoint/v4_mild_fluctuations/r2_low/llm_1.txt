The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 0 units in-transit, I need to place an order that covers demand for the lead time plus one period (L+1 = 3 periods) to ensure availability when the order arrives in Period 3. Using the mean demand of ~86 units, I calculate a base requirement of 258 units. Given the high variance (range 55-126) and a high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 cost vs $1.0 profit), I will aim for a slightly more conservative initial order to mitigate holding cost risk while establishing the pipeline. I will order 150 units to start building inventory and will adjust based on actual arrivals and demand performance in subsequent periods.",

The supply chain has stabilized, though lead times can still vary between 1 and 3 periods (P40 arrived in 3 periods, P38-P39 in 1 period). Currently, on-hand inventory is 110 units. The active/reliable pipeline (orders from P41 onwards) consists of: P41 (80 units), P42 (40 units), and P43 (40 units), totaling 160 units. This provides a total available supply of 270 units (110 on-hand + 160 in-transit). To cover the lead-time horizon (L+1 = 4 periods) at a target demand of 85 units/period, I need approximately 340 units. Current shortfall is 340 - 270 = 70 units. I will order 70 units to maintain adequate stock without excessive holding costs, especially as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).",

To calculate the order for P45, I target covering demand for the next 3 periods (L+1, where L=2) to maintain a safety buffer against the volatile 1-3 period lead time. Expected demand for 3 periods is ~265 units. Current On-hand (99) + Reliable Pipeline (40+40+70 = 150) = 249 units. An order of 100 units is placed to bolster the pipeline and ensure availability as the game nears conclusion (P50), while accounting for the historical pattern that some orders in the total reported 'In-transit' (1655) are legacy lost units from periods P17-P30.",

Pipeline assessment: P44 (70 units, expected P46-47) and P45 (100 units, expected P47-48). Total reliable stock + pipeline = 63 (on-hand) + 70 (P44) + 100 (P45) = 233 units. Remaining demand for P46, P47, P48, P49, P50 (approx 5 periods) at ~95 units/period is 475 units. Current reliable inventory (233) is insufficient to cover the remaining game duration. Since we are nearing the end of the game, we want to satisfy demand but minimize ending inventory (holding cost). To cover P46-P48 (lead time + 1), we need roughly 300 units; we have 233.

In the previous periods (P46-P48), the system experienced a stockout because orders from P44 (70 units), P45 (100 units), P46 (100 units), and P47 (120 units) have not yet arrived. Our objective is to maximize reward, which is (Profit * Units_Sold - HoldingCost * Ending_Inventory). Since P50 is the final period, any inventory remaining at the end of P50 incurs a holding cost without any possibility of being sold in a subsequent period. For Period 49, we have 0 on-hand inventory. Given the lead time volatility (recently 2-3 periods), an order placed now in P49 would arrive either in P50 (LT 1) or after the game ends. However, we already have a massive pipeline of 1895 units (most of which are historically lost, but ~390 units are recent and viable: P44-P47). Specifically, the 70 units from P44 (now 5 periods old) and 100 units from P45 (now 4 periods old) are likely to arrive in P49 or P50. Adding more units now would likely only increase the ending inventory in P50, incurring holding costs of $1/unit while the profit is also $1/unit. Given the proximity to the end and the volume already in transit, the optimal move is to order 0 and let the existing pipeline satisfy the final period's demand.",
