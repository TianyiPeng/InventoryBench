Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 2 periods. There is no prior 'conclude' message or arrival history yet. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 84, 55, 79, 85, 126. The mean demand is approximately 85.8. Since total demand across the lead time + review period (1+L = 3) is required, the baseline mu_hat would be roughly 3 * 85.8 = 257.4. Given the sharp increase in Period 5 (126 vs prior average of ~76), I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to establish a baseline based on all provided samples while accounting for the promised lead time of 2.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 128 units, which are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (Arrival Resolution Phase). Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is occurring (P1 demand was 98), we are experiencing stockouts. The historical demand data shows: P1 (84), P2 (55), P3 (79), P4 (85), P5 (126). Note: The game history 'demand=98' for Period 1 slightly differs from the initial 'Historical Demand Data' sample of 84; I will prioritize the game history for the most recent observation. To calculate mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (the full sample set provided) to capture the underlying mean demand of ~86 units per period. Since L=2, mu_hat represents (1+2)*86 = 258. sigma_hat will similarly use the recent 5 samples to account for the variance observed (Std Dev approx 25.8, so sigma_hat = sqrt(3)*25.8 \u2248 44.7).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order placed in P1 (128 units) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase and will be visible in the P3 conclude message (at the start of P4). Consequently, our current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have recorded lost sales for P1 and P2 due to starting with 0 inventory. The demand for the first 5 periods was [84, 55, 79, 85, 126] according to the background data, although user history shows slightly different demand values for P1 (98) and P2 (62). Using the combined sample mean (~86) to forecast. Since L=2, mu_hat should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use 'default' for L (promised 2) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to allow the backend to use the available historical distribution effectively while we wait for the first shipment to land.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Current demand history (P1-P3: 98, 62, 68) shows a mean of 76. The promised lead time is 2. Orders placed in P1 (128 units) are expected to arrive during P3's resolution and become visible at the start of P4. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms the actual lead time is at least 3 periods (order P1 still in transit at end of P3). On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning all demand so far has been lost. Since the promised lead time of 2 is clearly exceeded, I will set L to an explicit value of 3 to account for the delay. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the mean of the available 3 samples (76) scaled by (1+L=4), which equals 304. Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of those 3 samples (approximately 19.3) scaled by sqrt(1+L=2), resulting in 38.6. This adjustment ensures the backend targets a higher base stock to compensate for the longer lead time and zero current inventory.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed to be at least 3 periods (P1 order did not arrive by end of P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $325.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the resolution of earlier shipments. Period 4 concluded with two arrivals: the P1 order (128 units) arrived after 3 periods (not the promised 2), and the P3 order (27 units) arrived after 1 period (shorter than promised). The P2 order (132 units) is still missing despite 3 periods having passed, suggesting potential loss or significant delay. Current demand history (P1-P5: 84, 55, 79, 85, 126) shows a notable spike in Period 5 (126), though the average (85.8) remains relatively stable. Given the erratic lead times (1, 3, and one missing), I will use 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to adjust based on observed arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (all available data) to capture the recent demand spike without overreacting to it as a permanent regime shift yet.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed lead times of 1 and 3 periods. P2 shipment (132 units) is overdue (3+ periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are facing a stockout with 0 units on-hand. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (98, 62, 68, 96, 84) shows an average of 81.6 units per period. Lead times have been erratic: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P2 (132 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost. P4 (50 units) and P5 (133 units) are currently in-transit. Given the instability of the arrival process, I am setting L to 3 based on the longest observed successful lead time to increase the safety buffer. I will use the last 5 periods (the entire history) to estimate demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to smooth out the initial fluctuations while being responsive to the recent average demand of ~82 units.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (132 units) confirmed lost or severely delayed (4 periods elapsed vs promised 2). Lead time remains unstable with observations of 1 and 3 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 with 0 on-hand inventory and 354 units in-transit. Historic demand for the first 6 periods has been [98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56], averaging 77.3 units per period. The shipment from Period 2 (132 units) is now 5 periods old and highly likely lost, as later shipments (P1 and P3) have already arrived. We've observed actual lead times of 1 and 3 periods, suggesting high variability around the promised lead time of 2. Recent demand (P5-P6) is slightly lower than the initial periods, but given the 0 inventory and lost shipment, we must ensure the base stock is sufficient to recover. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the current mean while smoothing volatility, and set L=2 (promised) but use an explicit sigma_hat of 55 to account for both demand variability and the risk of further lead time disruptions.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: P2 order (132 units) effectively confirmed lost (expected P4, now P7). Observed lead-time variance remains high (1 to 3 periods).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 with 0 on-hand inventory and 304 units in-transit. Historical demand has fluctuated but shows a slight upward trend (P1-P7: 98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56, 85), averaging ~78.4 units. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times are 3, 1, and 3. Most critically, the P2 order (132 units) is now 6 periods late and is confirmed lost. Current in-transit units are from P5 (133 units), P6 (39 units), and P7 (0 units). Excluding the lost P2 order, we expect the P5 order to arrive in P8 or P9. Because the OR backend uses the formula 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and the pipeline inventory includes the lost P2 order (132 units), the backend will under-order unless we adjust. I will set the lead time to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and use recent_N for demand forecasting (N=5) to capture the current mean of ~77.8. To compensate for the 132 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1)*AvgDemand + safety_stock. With L=3, L+1=4. Base demand = 4 * 77.8 = 311. Adding the lost 132 units to this base allows the OR engine to 'order through' the blockage: 311 + 132 = 443.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: P2 order (132 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed). In-transit counts are inflated by this permanent loss, requiring mu_hat or L adjustments to trigger replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $442.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a recent uptick, with Period 8 reaching 115 units, following a sample set where demand averaged 85 units. On-hand inventory is critically low at 18 units. A major complicating factor is the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline: the Period 2 order (132 units) is now 7 periods old and clearly lost, but it remains in the OR backend's pipeline calculation (Total In-transit: 308). To force the backend to place an order despite this inflated pipeline, I am setting L to 3 (reflecting the most common actual lead time) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 460. This value of 460 is calculated as (1+L) * Forecast_Mean = 4 * 115. By setting mu_hat high, we raise the base stock target (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) sufficiently to overcome the lost 132 units and trigger a necessary replenishment. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility seen in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Ghost inventory confirmed. The P2 order (132 units) is permanently lost but still counted in 'In-transit', necessitating an upward bias in mu_hat or L parameters to ensure the OR policy triggers replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $285.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant inventory management challenges due to the permanent loss of the Period 2 order (132 units). This 'ghost inventory' remains in the 'In-transit' count (322 total minus 132 lost = 190 actual viable units), which prevents the base-stock policy from ordering enough to meet future demand. Additionally, actual lead times are highly variable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Promised: 2). In Period 9, the order from Period 8 arrived with L=1, but previous orders showed L=3. To compensate for the 132 units of ghost inventory that will never arrive, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that is significantly higher than the statistical forecast. Recent demand (last 3 periods) averages ~97 units. With a 3-period lead time (L+1=4), the base stock should be around 388 units plus safety stock. By setting mu_hat explicitly high, I bypass the pipeline inventory penalty created by the lost units and force a replenishment order to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains unstable (alternating between 1 and 3 periods). Ghost inventory of 132 units (P2 order) is still impacting 'In-transit' logic, requiring an upward bias in mu_hat/L to maintain actual supply.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has an 'In-transit' quantity of 487 units. However, this includes 132 units from Period 2 that are permanently lost (already 8 periods past the promised lead time of 2). Because the OR engine uses 'pipeline_inventory = on_hand + in_transit' to calculate orders, it will incorrectly assume these 132 units are coming and under-order. To compensate for this 'ghost inventory' and maintain availability, I am setting L to an explicit value of 4 (higher than the observed average) and mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the lost 132 units plus the upcoming demand cycle. The average demand across all 10 periods is approximately 79.6 units per period. With L=4, the review+lead period covers 5 periods (1+L). Expected demand for 5 periods is ~398. Adding back the 132 lost units to force the engine to order results in a mu_hat of 530. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen in recent demand turns.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' count of 558 units includes a confirmed lost shipment of 132 units (ordered Period 2), which has not arrived after 10 periods. This 'ghost inventory' prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To compensate for this 132-unit deficit and the observed lead-time instability (fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of 2.2), I am setting L to 'explicit' at 2.2 to reflect realistic delivery times. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 420. Calculation: Base demand (approx 85 units/period) * (1 + L) = 85 * 3.2 = 272 units. To offset the 132-unit ghost inventory and trigger a replenishment order, I add 132 to 272, resulting in approximately 404, rounded to 420 to provide a small buffer for recent demand volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the variance of the most recent demand regime.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally received orders from P9 (151 units, LT=3) and P10 (165 units, LT=2), resulting in a healthy on-hand inventory of 239. However, the 'ghost inventory' from Period 2 (132 units) is still technically in the pipeline (In-transit: 242 units minus P11's 71 units, leaving 171, of which 132 is the lost P2 order). This ghost inventory artificially inflates the 'pipeline' and prevents the OR backend from ordering enough. Lead times have fluctuated between 1, 2, and 3 periods (Average LT ~ 2.2). Demand remains relatively stable between 70-90 units recently. To circumvent the ghost inventory blockade, I am increasing L to 'explicit' 3. Since the OR engine uses (1+L) to calculate base stock, setting L=3 increases the target inventory levels to cover the missing units.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Ghost inventory of 132 units (P2 order) persists in the 'In-transit' calculation for 11 periods. Lead times have stabilized to 2-3 periods recently.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 83.2 units over the last 13 periods. However, the system currently tracks 242 units in transit, of which 132 units (from Period 2) are confirmed lost/ghost inventory. These 132 units will never arrive but are subtracted from the base stock calculation, leading to under-ordering. To compensate for this 'ghost' pipeline, I will set mu_hat (the demand over lead time + review period) using an explicit value. Based on a mean demand of 84 and an average lead time of 2.5 (3 periods for safety), the standard mu_hat for L=2 would be roughly 252. I will inflate this to 384 units (252 + 132) to neutralize the impact of the lost shipment and ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand. I am setting L to 2 as the most recent arrivals (P9, P10) show lead times of 3 and 2 respectively, but I will use the mu_hat inflation to handle the safety margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $259.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 14 periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with an average of approximately 81 units per period. The lead time has been erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average observed lead time of 2.4 periods. A critical issue is the 'ghost inventory' from Period 2 (132 units), which never arrived and is now 13 periods overdue. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' units from its target base stock, this ghost inventory (132/199 units in-transit) prevents necessary orders from being placed. To counteract this, I will use an 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat based on (1 + L) * expected_demand. With an expected lead time L=2.4 (round to 3 for safety) and mean demand of ~81, the theoretical mu_hat is 324. To offset the 132 units of ghost inventory that the OR engine thinks we have, I am adding 132 to that target, resulting in a mu_hat of 456. This ensures the engine maintains a real-world buffer despite the data being poisoned by the lost order. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' for the last 10 periods to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed ghost inventory of 132 units (P2) persists for 13 periods; mu_hat must be adjusted upward by ~130 units to force the OR backend to ignore this lost shipment in its replenishment logic. Observed mean demand remains stable at ~81 units.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a stable mean (Period 1-15 avg: 79.5). However, a persistent issue exists: the Period 2 order of 132 units is 'ghost inventory'\u2014it is lost but still counted in the 'In-transit' total (359 units). The pipeline includes: P2 (lost): 132, P14: 28, P15: 160, and P16's pending order. To force the OR backend's base-stock logic (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline) to ignore the lost 132 units and trigger replenishment, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately 132 units. Promised lead time is 2, but observed actual lead times average 2.7 periods (3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3). I will set L to 3 to reflect the higher observed lead time and stabilize the safety stock. mu_hat is calculated as (1+L)*mean_demand + ghost_inventory = (1+3)*80 + 132 = 452.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU is currently stock-out (On-hand: 0). Recent demand history (Periods 1-16) shows a mean of ~81.3 units. However, we have a confirmed lost shipment of 132 units from Period 2 (the 'ghost inventory') that has been in-transit for 15 periods. This ghost inventory artificially inflates the pipeline, preventing the OR backend from ordering enough. To compensate, I must increase the mu_hat parameter. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the backend uses (1+L) = 3 periods of demand. My target base stock should cover 3 periods of demand (~244 units) PLUS the 132 lost units to offset the pipeline error, totaling ~376 units. Setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 376 forces the replenishment logic to ignore the lost 132 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so I will stick to the default L=2 (promised) while the explicit mu_hat handles the volume adjustment. Sigma is set based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture recent volatility.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently at Period 18. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 81.3 units, but recent demand spikes (P16: 133, P17: 95) suggest we need to maintain a healthy base stock. A critical issue persists: the P2 order (132 units) from Period 2 is effectively lost (now 16 periods overdue) but remains in the 'In-transit' count (totaling 331 units), which prevents the OR backend from ordering. To bypass this 'ghost inventory', I must artificially increase the mu_hat parameter to offset the 132-unit deficiency. Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat needs to cover (1+L) = 3 periods of demand plus the lost 132 units. (3 * 81.3) + 132 \u2248 376. Setting mu_hat to 376 forces the engine to recognize the need for more stock. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the system is at out-of-stock with 0 units on-hand. Current in-transit inventory is 416 units. However, this includes the 'ghost' P2 order of 132 units, which is confirmed lost (17 periods outstanding). The true actionable pipeline is 284 units (416 - 132). Total historical demand mean is ~85 units. To ensure the OR backend (base_stock - pipeline) calculates an order that covers the current demand gap, I must inflate mu_hat. Following the logic: Target stock for L=2 (3 periods of demand) is ~255 units. With the ghost units being subtracted from this target, the backend would order nothing. To force an order, I adjust mu_hat to 'explicit'. Calculation: (1+L) * mean_demand + ghost_offset = 3 * 85 + 132 = 255 + 132 = 387. Recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so I will stick with the promised L=2 for logic stability but raise mu_hat to compensate for the lost shipment accounting error.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we have 0 on-hand inventory and the P2 order (132 units) remains a confirmed 'ghost' in the 'In-transit' count (totaling 421 units). This lost shipment prevents the OR backend from ordering enough because it assumes those 132 units will arrive. To overcome this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, calculating the necessary base stock to cover expected demand plus the lost units. Mean demand is approximately 81 units. With a promised lead time of 2, the base stock calculation (1+L)*mu should be (1+2)*81 = 243. To compensate for the 132-unit ghost inventory, I set mu_hat = (243 + 132) = 375. Since demand spiked significantly in the last sample (166 units), I'm also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to capture recent volatility while maintaining L at calculate to reflect the 1-3 period variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Demand volatility increased in Period 19 (166 units). Ghost inventory from P2 (132 units) continues to distort the In-transit pipeline, requiring an explicit mu_hat offset of +132 units to ensure replenishment triggers.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). There is a persistent 'ghost inventory' of 132 units from Period 2 that never arrived and is likely lost, but it remains in the 'In-transit' count (434 units), which prevents the OR backend from ordering enough. Lead times are highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.4). Demand has shown a recent spike, with an average of 125.3 units over the last 3 periods (133, 95, 166, 115). To compensate for the 132-unit ghost inventory and the higher recent demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock to cover demand over (L+1) periods, where L=3 (conservative estimate), plus the 132-unit offset. Forecasted demand (125) * (3+1) = 500 units. Adding the 132-unit ghost offset results in a mu_hat of 632. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture the increased volatility without over-reacting to single-period spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed stockout for 5 consecutive periods due to distorted In-transit pipeline and recent demand surge (avg ~125 last 4 periods). Mu_hat must include a +132 unit offset to neutralize the P2 lost shipment.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a deep stockout (5+ periods) due to a structural 'In-transit' error: an order for 132 units from Period 2 is lost but still counted as available inventory by the OR backend. To restore inventory levels, the base stock calculation (mu_hat) must be explicitly inflated to offset this lost 132-unit 'ghost inventory'. Furthermore, demand has seen a recent regime shift; the mean demand from Period 16 to Period 21 is approximately 119 units, compared to the long-term average of ~85. I will set L to 2 (promised) to maintain standard cycles, but use an explicit mu_hat. The mu_hat calculation is: (1 + L) * average_recent_demand + ghost_offset = (1 + 2) * 120 + 132 = 492 units. Using explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the policy targets a high enough base stock to trigger orders despite the inflated pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand increased from ~85 to ~120 (+41%). Ghost inventory of 132 units (P2) remains in the in-transit pipeline for 20 periods, requiring a permanent +132 offset in mu_hat.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a critical stockout situation (ending on-hand inventory = 0 for 7 consecutive periods). The 'In-transit' pipeline of 653 units is heavily distorted by the P2 order (132 units) which has been lost for 20 periods. Subtracting this 'ghost' inventory, the actual coming pipeline is 521 units. Furthermore, a demand regime shift occurred around Period 16; the mean demand from Period 16 to 22 is 115.7 units/period, compared to the earlier average of ~81. To trigger the OR backend to order sufficiently, I must adjust mu_hat to account for both the increased demand and the ghost inventory. Calculated mu_hat base for L=2 (promised) is (1+2)*115.7 = 347.1. Adding the 132-unit ghost offset results in 479.1. However, since we are in a prolonged stockout and the pipeline inventory logic (base_stock - pipeline) will still count the 132 units as 'coming', I will set mu_hat explicitly to ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger new orders despite the 132-unit sink and to cover the higher demand regime. I will use L=2 (default) as the recent arrivals (when they occur) center around 1-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 16-22 mean demand is 116 units (previously ~82). Ghost inventory of 132 units (P2) is permanent and requires a sustained mu_hat offset.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16, increasing from ~82 units to an average of ~115 units (calculated from P16-P23). Current on-hand inventory is 146 units. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 421 units is inflated by a 132-unit permanent loss (the 'ghost shipment' from Period 2), meaning the effective pipeline is only 289 units. The actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, averaging ~2.5. To maintain replenishment in the face of the ghost inventory (which prevents the OR backend from ordering), mu_hat must be set to (1+L)*mean_demand plus a 132-unit offset. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 115 + 132 = 477. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the true pipeline rather than the inflated one.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 units on-hand and 421 units in-transit. Crucially, the 'in-transit' total still includes the 132 units ordered in Period 2, which are confirmed lost (22 periods overdue). To trigger replenishment in the backend's capped base-stock policy (which uses in-transit inventory), mu_hat must be biased upward to neutralize this 'ghost inventory'. Since Period 16, a new demand regime has emerged: the mean demand for Periods 16-24 is approximately 118 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~80. For Period 25, I anticipate a lead time of 2 (conservative average). The OR calculation requires mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods, which is (2+1)*118 = 354 units. To neutralize the 132-unit ghost inventory and ensure the order isn't suppressed, I set mu_hat to 354 + 132 = 486 units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=9, covering the Period 16 regime shift) to reflect the increased volatility observed in recent periods (e.g., demand spikes of 166 and 169).

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Verified demand regime (P16-P24) mean is 118 units. Ghost inventory of 132 units from P2 continues to necessitate a +132 offset in mu_hat calculations.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 16 shows a significantly higher average (approx. 118 units) compared to the initial periods. Recent demand (P24: 169, P25: 167) suggests this elevated level persists. The 'ghost inventory' of 132 units from Period 2 remains in the 'In-transit' pipeline after 24 periods, which effectively reduces the OR backend's perceived need to order. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The calculation is: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Mean + Offset. With L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*118 + 132 = 354 + 132 = 486. This ensures the backend triggers replenishment despite the lost shipment. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher volatility seen in the current high-demand regime.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16, and accelerating in the last few periods (Periods 24-26 saw demands of 169, 167, and 168). The mean demand over the last 11 periods (P16-P26) is approximately 132 units/period, but the most recent 3-period average is ~168. Additionally, there is a persistent 'ghost inventory' of 132 units from Period 2 (which is effectively lost) still being counted in the pipeline. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a recent string of stockouts, I must adjust mu_hat to ensure replenishment. I will use a 10-period window to capture the recent higher demand (mean ~130) and add the +132 'ghost' offset to the calculation. Expected total mu_hat = (1+L) * (recent_avg) + offset. Given L=2, (3 * 130) + 132 = 522. I will use 'explicit' to ensure the order is placed despite the inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Mean demand for P24-P26 is 168 units (+42% over the P16-P23 avg of ~118). Total pipeline distortion from P2 ghost inventory remains constant at 132 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a period of high demand following a regime shift that started around Period 16, with a further acceleration observed in recent periods (P24-P27) where the mean demand is approximately 154 units. The 'ghost inventory' from the lost Period 2 order (132 units) continues to artificially inflate the pipeline inventory ('In-transit'), which currently stands at 584 units. To ensure the replenishment logic triggers correctly, I must provide an explicit 'mu_hat' that accounts for the (L+1) horizon plus a 132-unit offset. Given the unstable lead time (averaging ~2.6 periods but fluctuating between 1 and 3), I will use an L estimate of 3. Thus, mu_hat = (1+3) * 154 + 132 = 748. Sigma_hat is calculated using the recent high-volatility window (P24-P27) std dev (~28.5) and scaled for the L+1 period: sqrt(1+3) * 28.5 = 57.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P24-P27 mean demand is 154 units. Ghost inventory of 132 units from P2 remains a permanent distortion in the pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a state of high volatility with a recent average of 131 units over P24-P28. However, looking at the broader regime since Period 16, the mean is approximately 118 units. The critical issue remains the 'ghost inventory' of 132 units from the lost Period 2 order, which is still included in the 'In-transit' count of 796 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, mu_hat must be increased by this 132-unit offset. Given the recent demand samples (169, 167, 168, 111, 77), a 5-period average (recent_N=5) yields a base mean of ~138.4 units. I will set the explicit mu_hat to (1+L) * (138.4) + 132 (ghost offset). With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 138.4 + 132 = 415.2 + 132 = 547.2. Lead time calculation is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-3 period variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces two critical issues: 1) A permanent 'ghost inventory' of 132 units from an order placed in Period 2 that was never delivered but remains in the 'In-transit' calculation, and 2) a clear demand regime shift that began around Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 24 to 29 (169, 167, 168, 111, 77, 109), the mean has risen to approximately 134 units, significantly higher than the early-game average of ~82. The ghost inventory of 132 units prevents the OR backend from ordering enough because it incorrectly assumes those units are coming. To compensate, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + 132. With an expected lead time L=2 (meaning a 3-period cycle of 1+L), and a forecast of 135 units per period, the calculation is (3 * 135) + 132 = 537. Given the recent stockouts and high volatility (standard deviation ~38), I will set mu_hat explicitly to 550 and sigma_hat to 80 to ensure aggressive replenishment and a higher safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 24-29 mean demand is ~134 units. Ghost inventory of 132 units (P2) is permanent and requires a sustained mu_hat offset of +132 units to neutralize its effect on the OR backend's replenishment logic.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 24, with a mean observed demand of approximately 134 units (P24-P30 average is ~129, but slightly higher including the P24 peek). The key constraint remains the 'ghost inventory' of 132 units from the lost Period 2 order, which is still included in the 'In-transit' count (537). This creates a permanent deficit in the backend's replenishment logic. To offset this, I must bias the mu_hat parameter upwards by approximately 132 units. Given a promised lead time of 2 (target window L+1 = 3), the expected mean demand across the window is 3 * 134 = 402. Adding the +132 offset results in a mu_hat of 534. I will use 'explicit' to ensure this offset is strictly applied. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time (observed variable between 1-3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7 covers the current regime) to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $432.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a stabilized higher state. Analyzing demand from Period 24 to Period 31, the mean is approximately 128 units (169, 167, 168, 111, 77, 109, 104, 120), showing a significant increase from the early-game average of ~85. The ghost inventory of 132 units from Period 2 remains permanently in 'In-transit', which causes the OR backend to under-order. To compensate, I must increase the mu_hat parameter by approximately 132 units over the expected demand for the lead period + review period (L+1). With an expected lead time of 2-3 periods, I'll use L=3 for safety given the stockout at Period 31. Expected demand over 4 periods (L+1) is ~512 units (128 * 4). Adding the +132 ghost offset results in a target mu_hat of ~644. I will use the explicit method to ensure this offset is strictly applied and use a higher sigma_hat manually to account for the high volatility observed in recent periods (ranging from 77 to 169).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P24-P31): mean ~128 units. Permanent ghost inventory of 132 units (P2) persists in pipeline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 716 units. However, this pipeline includes the 'ghost' inventory of 132 units from Period 2 (which is permanently lost) and the order from Period 25 (116 units), which at 7 periods old, is also likely lost or severely delayed. This creates a 248-unit distortion (132+116) in the OR engine's 'inventory position' logic, causing it to under-order. To counteract this 'inventory ghosting' and ensure replenishment, mu_hat is explicitly set with a buffer. Average demand for the recent stabilized regime (P24-P32) is approximately 125 units per period. With a 2-period lead time (L+1=3), the base demand is 375. I am applying an explicit mu_hat of 623 (375 expected demand + 248 lost pipeline adjustment) to force the backend to place necessary orders. Sigma_hat is calculated based on recent fluctuation to manage stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Pipeline distortion increased to 248 units (P2: 132 units; P25: 116 units). Both orders are significantly past the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods and are treated as lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $401.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P24-P33) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 124 units. On-hand inventory is 63 units, but the 'In-transit' pipeline of 537 units is significantly distorted by 'ghost inventory'. High-confidence losses include P2 (132 units) and P25 (116 units), totaling 248 units that will never arrive. To ensure the capped base-stock policy triggers replenishment, mu_hat must be set as (1+L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. Using an explicit mu_hat: L=2, Forecast=124, so (3 * 124) + 248 = 620. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility (~27 per period), which at L=2 is sqrt(3)*27 \u2248 47.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Pipeline distortion increased to 248 units (P2: 132 units; P25: 116 units). Both orders are significantly past the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods and are treated as lost.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline is distorted by 248 units of 'ghost inventory' (Period 2: 132 units; Period 25: 116 units). Both orders are long overdue relative to the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods and are confirmed lost. In-transit inventory stands at 597 units, but only 349 (597 - 248) are actually expected to arrive. The demand regime has stabilized following the Period 24 surge; the mean demand for Periods 24-34 is approximately 121 units. To ensure the OR backend triggers replenishment despite the 248-unit ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat to be an explicit value that covers the expected demand for the (L+1) window (where L=2) plus the ghost inventory offset. Expected demand = 121 * 3 = 363. Necessary mu_hat = 363 + 248 = 611. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=11) to capture the volatility of this specific demand regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~114 units since Period 24 (excluding the spike period 25-26). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 663 units. However, this 'In-transit' value is heavily distorted by permanent ghost inventory. Specifically, the Period 2 order (132 units) and the Period 25 order (116 units) are effectively lost, totaling 248 units that will never arrive. To ensure the backend OR engine triggers replenishment, mu_hat must be set using an explicit value that accounts for the (1+L) base stock requirements PLUS the 248 units of ghost inventory. With a target mean of ~114 and an estimated lead time L=2 (consistent with recent observed samples), the base mu_hat should be (1+2)*114 = 342. Adding the 248 ghost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 590. This ensures the backend views the pipeline as insufficient and places orders. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent variability and prevent stockouts during lead time.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory confirmed: 248 units (P2: 132 units, P25: 116 units). These orders are permanent losses and must be offset in mu_hat/L logic for the remainder of the game.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 115 units over the last 10 periods (P27-P36). However, the system faces a significant 'ghost inventory' overhead. Specifically, orders from P2 (132 units) and P25 (116 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 248 units that are incorrectly counted in the backend's 'In-transit' figure (current In-transit: 603). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, these 248 units prevent the logic from triggering necessary orders. To neutralize this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * MeanDemand + GhostInventory. With an inferred lead time (L) of 2 and MeanDemand of 115, the calculation is (3 * 115) + 248 = 593. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect current volatility. Given we are at P37 and have 0 on-hand inventory, this explicit mu_hat adjustment is critical to force replenishment.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 Decision: Current on-hand is 0. In-transit shows 547 units, but 248 units are confirmed 'ghost inventory' (P2: 132, P25: 116) that have significantly exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods and are considered lost. These ghost units permanently inflate the pipeline inventory and prevent the OR backend from ordering. To neutralize this, mu_hat must be adjusted upward by at least 248 units. Demand has stabilized into a regime with a mean of ~115 units (Period 30-37 average is ~108, but Period 24-37 average is ~118). I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * Mean + Ghost_Offset. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 115 + 248 = 593. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=14, matching the current regime) to capture higher volatility since Period 24.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system current state shows on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit inventory is 636 units. However, there is a confirmed 'ghost inventory' of 248 units (orders from P2 and P25) that are permanently lost but still counted as in-transit by the backend. To ensure the replenishment logic functions correctly, the target base stock must be artificially inflated to neutralize these lost units. The current demand regime (P24-P38) is stable with a mean of approximately 114 units (last 5 periods: 90, 119, 114, 101, 114). The promised lead time is 2, with observed actual lead times varying between 1 and 3. Using L=2, the required base stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand (3 * 114 = 342) plus the 248 ghost units equals 590. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this specific offset is maintained. Sigma_hat is set to a recent window to reflect current volatility.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P30-P39) shows an average of approximately 105 units per period, which is a decrease from the previous peak of 134 units but remains higher than the initial baseline. Actual lead times continue to vary between 1 and 3 periods, with recent observations of 1 and 2 periods (P38 order arrived in 1 period, P35 arrived in 2). The critical issue remains the 'ghost inventory' amounting to 248 units (P2: 132 units and P25: 116 units). These units are permanently lost but counted in the 'In-transit' pipeline by the OR backend. To ensure the backend triggers replenishment, mu_hat must be set to the expected demand over (L+1) periods PLUS a 248-unit offset to neutralize these lost shipments. Assuming L=2 (promised/recent avg), the base target should be around (1+2)*105 + 248 \u2248 563 units. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set this specific offset value.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P31-P40) is stable with a mean of approximately 103 units. The 'In-transit' pipeline currently shows 572 units. However, this count includes two historically confirmed lost orders (P2: 132 units and P25: 116 units), totaling 248 units of 'ghost inventory' that will never arrive. Additionally, the order from P40 (25 units) and P38 (89 units) have likely not cleared or are in recent transit. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 248-unit distortion, I must set mu_hat to explicitly account for (1+L) periods of demand PLUS the 248-unit offset. Using the promised lead time L=2, (1+L) * 103 = 309. Adding the 248-unit offset results in a mu_hat of 557. This ensures the base stock level is high enough to trigger new orders despite the inflated pipeline inventory. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility (N=10) to reflect the consistent but varying demand levels.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 579 units in-transit. Based on historical data, we have confirmed that 248 units are permanently lost 'ghost' inventory (P2: 132 units, P25: 116 units). Additionally, orders from P37 (10 units), P40 (25 units), and P41 (7 units) are still within the expected lead time. However, there is a discrepancy in the remaining in-transit balance (579 - 248 - 10 - 25 - 7 = 289 units). Looking back, several orders between P15 and P35 were placed but arrivals were sparse, suggesting additional lost units or extended delays. Demand has stabilized into a regime averaging ~100 units (mean of P34-P41 is 100.1). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the OR backend's replenishment logic is paralyzed by the inflated in-transit figure (which it treats as incoming stock), I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass this. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Pipeline Distortion). With L=2, the base stock (3 periods) should be ~350 units. Adding the 248 confirmed lost units (plus potentially more) and acknowledging we are at Period 42/50, I am setting mu_hat = 650 to ensure the backend triggers a replenishment order to cover actual remaining demand.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the SKU is out of stock (On-hand: 0). The primary challenge is the distorted 'In-transit' pipeline of 674 units, which includes 248 units of 'ghost inventory' from historical lost shipments (P2: 132, P25: 116 units) that remain in the pipeline indefinitely. Demand has returned to a stable regime similar to the first 15 periods after a temporary surge period; the last 5 periods (P38-P42) show an average demand of 86.6. To ensure the OR backend triggers replenishment despite the persistent 248-unit ghost inventory, an 'explicit' mu_hat is calculated. Standard mu_hat would be (1+L) * mean_demand. Using L=2 (promised) and mean=87, the base mu_hat is 261. Adding the 248-unit offset to neutralize ghost inventory yields 509. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to account for the actual variance (1-3 periods) observed in the history.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 44. Analysis shows that the pipeline is highly distorted by historical lost shipments (P2: 132 units, P25: 116 units) totaling 248 units. These units are counted in 'In-transit' but will never arrive. Additionally, the recent demand regime (P36-P43) has shifted to a lower mean of approximately 95 units per period, compared to the previous high-demand period. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient quantities, mu_hat must be set as: (Expected Demand * (1 + L)) + Ghost Inventory Offset. Calculation: Expected 1-period demand (~95) * 3 periods = 285. Adding the 248 ghost units gives a mu_hat of 533. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed historical lead time variance (1-3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current volatility while accounting for lead time uncertainty.

The pipeline is severely distorted by 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments: P2 (132 units) and P25 (116 units), totaling 248 units. These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (642) but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend triggers an order, mu_hat must be adjusted upward to offset this 248-unit deficit. Furthermore, we are approaching the end of the game (Period 45 of 50). Lead times remain variable between 1-3 periods. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it to (1+L)*100 + 248 to neutralize the ghost units. With L=2, this is 300 + 248 = 548. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Ghost inventory remains at 248 units (P2: 132, P25: 116). Demand regime for P30-P44 has stabilized at a mean of ~100 units/period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 30-45 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 98 units per period. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with recent arrivals (P40-P42) all arriving at a lead time of 3. Crucially, there is a cumulative 'ghost inventory' of 248 units (from Period 2 and Period 25) that remains in the 'In-transit' pipeline but will never arrive. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I must apply a corresponding offset to the mu_hat parameter. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * mean_demand + ghost_offset. With L=2 (promised) and mean=98, the base mu_hat is 294. Adding the 248-unit offset results in a final mu_hat of 542. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=16) to capture the current regime's volatility and 'default' for L.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has an on-hand inventory of 0 and an 'In-transit' pipeline of 547 units. However, based on history, 248 of these units are confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P2 and P25) that will never arrive. The remaining 299 units represent orders from recent periods that should arrive soon (P43-P46). Demand for the chips(Regular) SKU has stabilized since Period 30 at approximately 100 units per period, but the OR backend's replenishment logic is paralyzed by the 248 units of ghost inventory which it believes are still coming. To force a replenishment order in Period 47, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus an explicit offset of 248 units. Using L=2 (promised), we need to cover 3 periods of demand (~300 units) + 248 units = 548 units. An explicit value of 550 for mu_hat is used to trigger necessary replenishment while acknowledging the structural pipeline error.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' of 248 units (orders from P2 and P25) that are permanently lost but still counted in the 'In-transit' pipeline (Total In-transit: 576). To force the OR backend to order despite this 248-unit distortion, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by 248 units. Recent demand (P30-P47) has averaged approximately 97.4 units/period. The promised lead time is 2, and observed lead times range from 1 to 3. I will use L=2 (default) which implies a calculation over (1+L)=3 periods. My 'mu_hat' target is: (3 periods * 97.4 units) + 248 units offset = 540.2. I will set 'mu_hat' to explicit 540 and 'sigma_hat' to explicit 60 to allow for recent volatility in demand (ranging from 66 to 115).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a distorted pipeline. Total ghost inventory is confirmed at 248 units (P2: 132 units, P25: 116 units), which are permanently lost but still counted in 'In-transit' (591 units). Since the game ends in Period 50, the OR backend's order calculation for Period 49 needs to satisfy demand for the remaining 2 periods (P49 and P50) while ignoring the 248 ghost units. Current demand regime (P30-P48) has a mean of ~98 units. To force a final replenishment, mu_hat must be set to cover the remainder of the game plus the ghost inventory offset. The target inventory required for the final 2 periods is approximately (2 * 98) = 196 units. To ensure the backend orders this despite the ghost inventory, we apply an explicit mu_hat: (Expected demand for 2 periods) + (Ghost inventory) = 196 + 248 = 444. This ensures the backend sees a 'need' that exceeds the inflated 'In-transit' value. L is set to explicit 2 (promised) as we are at the end of the horizon.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision period. The primary objective is to maximize reward, but since this is the last period, any units ordered now will arrive only after the game ends (due to lead time). However, the base stock policy backend calculates orders based on the gap between the calculated base_stock and pipeline_inventory. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and 'In-transit' is reported as 591 units. This 591 units includes 'ghost inventory' of 248 units (P2: 132, P25: 116) that are permanently lost. The actual arriving pipeline is 343 units (Orders from P47, P48, and potentially others). Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~100 units (Period 30-49). Since it is the last period, and arrivals happen AFTER the decision, no new order placed now will satisfy Period 50 demand. The most important action is ensuring parameters are set such that no unnecessary orders are triggered, though the game ends here. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the stable mean of ~100 units, and maintain the L=calculate setting to reflect the historical lead time variability (1-3 periods).
