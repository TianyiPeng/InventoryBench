Inventory Check: On-hand is 191 units. In-transit is 379 units, but as confirmed in Carry-over Insights, this includes 259 units from likely lost shipments (P2: 136, P6: 123). Therefore, effective in-transit is 379 - 259 = 120 units (the P17 order). Combined inventory is 191 + 120 = 311 units. 3. Demand Analysis: The last 5 periods (P13-P17) show an average demand of 102 units. There was a notable spike to 151 units in P17, which might be an outlier or a shift. 4. Strategy: With 311 units, we cover roughly 3 periods of average demand (102 x 3 = 306). Since lead time can be up to 3 periods, we are currently at the edge of the required base stock (L+1).

However, if P17 follows the 3-period pattern, it will only satisfy demand *after* this period's resolution.

Subtracting the 779 lost units from the 1119 in-transit units leaves 340 units of 'real' pipeline inventory. Current on-hand is low (29). The demand remains steady, averaging ~105 units per period. Considering a 3-period lead-time safety window (demand for P40, P41, P42 plus some safety stock), we need to maintain at least 350-400 units in the real pipeline/on-hand. With 29 on-hand and 340 real in-transit, we are roughly at that level, but given the volatility and high profit density ($4 profit vs $1 holding), stockouts are far more expensive than holding costs.

Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, and P37 (totaling 899 units) and likely P42 (120 units, currently at LT 3 with none expected today based on the pattern) have not arrived. Subtracting at least 1,019 units (including P42) from the 1,359 in-transit gives a more realistic pipeline of ~340 units (representing P43, P44, and the recent arrival P41). Recent demand (Periods 42-44) is stable at ~100 units/period. With only 21 units on hand and a lead time that fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, I need to maintain a continuous order flow.

{
  "rationale": "Inventory Assessment: Current on-hand inventory is 192 units. There is a total in-transit quantity of 1,239 units. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, it is highly probable that 1,019 of these units are lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, P37, and P42). P42's 120 units are confirmed lost as of Period 45 conclude (LT 3 exceeded with no arrival). The effective in-transit (pipeline) is therefore: 1,239 (Total In-transit) - 1,019 (Likely Lost) = 220 units. These 220 units consist of orders from P44 (120) and P45 (120). Wait, 120+120=240, but the math implies P44 and P45 are the only ones left. 1239 - 1019 = 220. My records show P44 (120) and P45 (120), totaling 240. The discrepancy (20 units) may stem from a slight calculation error in earlier periods, but the core issue is the massive loss rate. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has stabilized around ~100 units. Strategy: Total inventory (on-hand 192 + effective pipeline ~220) is 412 units. This covers roughly 4 periods of demand. With a maximum observed lead time of 3 periods, we are currently sufficiently stocked. However, the game ends at Period 50. Orders placed after P47/P48 may not arrive. The OR recommendation is 0, reflecting high current inventory relative to the single-period model.

Based on the documented 'Carry-over Insights', orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, P37, and P42 are likely lost, totaling 1,019 units. Subtracting these from the reported in-transit gives an effective pipeline of 320 units (P44: 120, P45: 120, P46: 100/wait for P43 arrival confirmation: P43 arrived in P45). Actually, looking at the history: P43 arrived in P45 (LT 2). Currently pending are P44 (120), P45 (120), and P46 (100). The average demand over the last 10 periods (excluding the outlier 0 in P31 and spike in P35) is approximately 100 units. With 118 on-hand and 340 units in the 'healthy' pipeline (P44, P45, P46), the total inventory position is 458 units. At 100 units per period, this covers 4.5 periods. Since the max observed actual lead time for successful deliveries is 3 periods, we have sufficient safety cover. However, given the high frequency of lost shipments (roughly every 5-6 orders), maintain a steady ordering rhythm is necessary to prevent stockouts from the next failure. The OR recommendation is 0, but this is based on the unadjusted in-transit figure (1,339 units).

Total confirmed/likely lost units in the pipeline include P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, P37, and P42, totaling 1,019 units. Inventory Analysis: Current on-hand is 22 units. Total In-transit is 1,439. Subtracting the 1,019 lost units leaves a real pipeline of 420 units (P44, P45, P46, P47, P48 orders). Demand Analysis: Historical average demand is approximately 102 units per period (P1-P47). Strategy: With the game ending at P50, we must ensure enough inventory arrives for the final three periods (P48, P49, P50). Current pipeline (420) + on-hand (22) = 442 units.

As this is Period 49, any order placed now will arrive in Period 50 at the earliest (current lead times range from 1 to 3 periods). Our current on-hand inventory is 0. However, we have a significant pipeline. Based on historical patterns, orders from P44 (120 units), P45 (120 units), and P46 (100 units) are currently 'in transit' and healthy (within the 1-3 period arrival window). Specifically, the P44 order (placed 5 periods ago) is overdue but not yet declared lost based on the 5-period 'lost' threshold used in previous carry-over insights; P45 and P46 are clearly within normal delivery ranges. The OR recommendation is 0 because the game is ending. Ordering for Period 50 arrival is risky; if it arrives in Period 50, it could capture demand, but any excess would incur holding costs with no future period to sell.
