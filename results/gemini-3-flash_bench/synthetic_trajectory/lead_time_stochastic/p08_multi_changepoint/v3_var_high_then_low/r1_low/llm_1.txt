The promised lead time is 2 periods. To maximize reward, I must cover demand for the current period (P1) plus the lead time (P2, P3), as an order placed now will not arrive until the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and will be usable for demand starting in Period 3 (effectively visible at the start of P4). However, since there is an immediate need and a 2-period delay, I will aim to build a pipeline to cover the expected demand of ~100 units/period. Given that Period 1 demand is resolved after this decision, and nothing is currently in stock, the first period's demand will result in lost sales. I will order 300 units to cover the pipeline for approximately 3 periods of expected demand (Periods 1, 2, and 3) to establish a base inventory level.",

However, the lead time is erratic (varies between 1-3 periods) and orders are frequently lost (Order 2 from P2 and Order 6 from P6 never arrived). Looking at the pipeline: the order from P12 (100 units) is expected to arrive during P15 (LT=3). If it arrives, on-hand goes to 160, covering P15 demand. However, there is a distinct risk it is lost or delayed further. The Order from P13 (150 units) is expected by P16. To maintain a safe service level given the high stockout risk seen in P11 and P13, I need to ensure the pipeline covers (LT+1) periods of demand, which is roughly 4 * 110 = 440 units. Current pipeline (excluding P12 as it is arriving now) is 450 (P13, P14, P15). This seems sufficient for the immediate future.
