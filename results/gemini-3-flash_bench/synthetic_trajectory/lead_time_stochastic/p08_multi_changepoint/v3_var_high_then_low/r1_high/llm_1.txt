Product is 'chips(Regular)', a staple item with moderate demand variance. Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and the promised lead time is 2 periods, any order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 3 (after the Period 3 decision phase, becoming usable for Period 3 demand). I need to cover demand for Period 1 (already lost/missed as arrivals happen after decision), Period 2, and Period 3 to establish a baseline. Using the average demand (~97) and adding a safety buffer for variance, I will target an inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) that covers approximately 3-4 periods of demand.

This high volatility necessitates a safety stock approach. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 171. In-transit consists of orders from P2 (120 units) and P4 (120 units).

Lead time analysis: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, P2 (ordered P2) is still missing after 5 periods (likely lost), and P4 arrived in 3 periods.

On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total in-transit pipeline is 1050 units, but historically, about 20% of orders are lost or severely delayed (P2, P15, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33, and P37 are considered lost/dead). Excluding these dead units (total 720 units), the active pipeline consists of P40 (180 units) and P41 (150 units). The P40 order was expected to arrive in P41 (if LT=1) or should arrive in P42 (if LT=2/3). Because on-hand is 0, the P40 arrival is critical for satisfying P42 demand. To cover demand for the next 3 periods (P42-P44) at a rate of ~115 units, I need approximately 345 units. With 330 units in the active pipeline (P40, P41), I am slightly under-provisioned relative to the demand mean and the high risk of shipment loss. I will order 150 units to maintain a continuous flow and build a small safety buffer given the zero on-hand status and 13%\u201320% historical loss rate.",

Inventory status is currently critical with 0 on-hand and 4 consecutive periods of stockouts or partial fulfillment (P41-P42). The historical loss rate remains a major factor, with approximately 20% of orders (7 total) failing to arrive. Lead times for successful deliveries currently fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. Looking at the pipeline, P37 (120 units) is 5 periods overdue and effectively lost, congruent with the Carry-over Insight for P41. P40 (180 units) is 3 periods late but still within the viable 'delayed' window (3 periods). P41 (150) and P42 (150) are the active pipeline. Total viable in-transit is therefore P40+P41+P42 = 480 units. To cover demand for the remaining 8 periods (estimated 880 units) while accounting for the ~20% loss rate and aiming to clear the current backlog of unsatisfied demand, I will maintain a consistent order flow of 150 units.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand has stabilized around ~85-100 units (P46: 80, P47: 99, P48: 85). I estimate demand for P49 and P50 to be approximately 100 units each.\n2.

In-transit pipeline includes P44 (130 units, ordered 5 periods ago), P45 (50 units, ordered 4 periods ago), and orders from P37, P40-P43 which have already arrived or were lost. P44 and P45 are significantly overdue based on the typical 1-3 period lead time; however, P43 arrived in P43 (LT 3) and P41/P42 arrived in P44/P45 (LT 3). Because the game ends in Period 50, any order placed now (P49) would only arrive in Period 50 (at the earliest, if LT=1) or later. \n3. Lead Time: Even if I order now, if LT is 2 or 3 (common), the stock arrives after the game ends. If LT is 1, it arrives in P50 resolution. \n4. Strategy: Current on-hand (109) covers P49 demand (~90-100). The P44 (130) and P45 (50) orders are extremely late and might be lost, but even if one arrives in P49 or P50, it will cover P50 demand. Since the game ends next period and holding costs apply to ending inventory, placing a new order is unnecessary and risky (likely leading to excess stock after the game concludes).",
