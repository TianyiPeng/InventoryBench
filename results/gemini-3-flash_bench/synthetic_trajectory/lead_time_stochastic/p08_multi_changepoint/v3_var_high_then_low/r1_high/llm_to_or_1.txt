Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 2 periods. Historical demand data for the first 5 periods is available (71, 120, 95, 116, 82), showing a mean of approximately 96.8 and a standard deviation of 20.4. Since we have no lead time history yet, I will use the 'default' method for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the characteristics of the initial provided sample set. This will allow the OR backend to calculate the base stock level (target inventory position) covering the current period plus the 2-period lead time (L+1=3 periods total).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order of 132 units placed in Period 1 is currently in-transit and is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). In Period 1, there was a demand of 110 units which resulted in 110 lost sales because starting inventory was 0. Historical demand samples (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) plus the actual demand in Period 1 (110) suggest a mean demand of approximately 99 units per period. Since the OR backend uses (1+L) * mean, and L=2, mu_hat should target ~297. I will use the 'default' method for L to respect the promised lead time of 2. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=6 (all available samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand levels accurately while including the high Period 1 actual demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Data shows a significant amount of lost sales (stockouts) because initial inventory was 0 and the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (132 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase, which will be visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, 264 units are in transit (orders from P1 and P2). Demand in the first two periods was 110 and 145, averaging 127.5, which is higher than the historical samples provided (mean \u2248 96). Given the stockout and the upward trend in recent demand, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=2 to capture this higher demand regime. For lead time, I will stick to the 'default' (promised = 2) for now, as we haven't yet reached the point where the first order should have arrived according to the 'Period N+L' rule.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The SKU chips(Regular) has a promised lead time of 2 periods. No units have arrived yet. Based on the sequence: Period 1 order (132 units) should arrive during Period 3 resolution and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the first shipment is delayed/lost. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to significant lost sales (demand ~110-145 vs sold 0). To address this, I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect the observed delay. For demand forecasting, the last 5 periods (including user-provided samples) show a mean of ~97. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime. This adjustment to L will increase the base stock level to account for the longer pipeline, helping the OR backend recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for chips(Regular) exceeds promised 2 periods; Period 1 order (ordered P1) did not conclude by P3 START, indicating L >= 3.

Daily Profit: $1672.00, Daily Holding Cost: $213.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1459.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the resolution of previous orders. From 'Period 4 conclude', we see a high variance in lead times: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period. The Period 2 order (132 units) is notably missing despite the promised lead time of 2, suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. Demand over the first 5 periods has averaged 96.8 units (71, 120, 95, 116, 82). Given the lead time instability (3 periods and 1 period observed), I will set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to average observed lead times. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use all 5 samples (recent_N=5) to capture the current mean of ~97. Since we have sufficient on-hand inventory (213) and some in-transit (226), the priority is stabilizing the forecast against the inconsistent delivery cadence.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 order took 1 period. P2 order (132 units) is currently missing/overdue as of P5 START.

Daily Reward (R_t): $487.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the inventory and lead-time situation. Looking at the 'conclude' messages: The order from Period 1 (132 units) arrived in Period 4 (LT=3). The order from Period 3 (169 units) also arrived in Period 4 (LT=1). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (132 units) is still missing (it should have arrived in P4 if LT=2 or P5 if LT=3), suggesting it may be lost. Demand has shown a decline in the last two periods (88 and 35). Current on-hand inventory is 178, and we have 300 units in-transit (P4 order of 94, P5 order of 74, plus the likely lost P2 order of 132). Given the erratic lead times (avg: 2, but values are 1 and 3) and the potential lost shipment, I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed variances. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent volatility and the recent dip in demand while still accounting for the earlier higher volume periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 2 order (132 units) confirmed lost/extensively delayed (exceeded LT=3). Demand volatility observed: P5 demand (35) is significantly lower than the P1-P4 average (~114).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1942.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe a recovery in demand for chips(Regular) to 106 units, following a sharp dip in Period 5 (35 units). The average demand across P1-P6 is approximately 99.5 units. The supply chain remains highly volatile: while the P1 order took 3 periods and the P3 order took 1 period, the P2 order (132 units) is confirmed lost or extremely delayed, as it has not arrived by the start of P7 despite being placed 5 periods ago. Consequently, rely on the on-hand inventory of 72 and the pipeline of 217 units (from orders in P4, P5, and P6). Given the lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods), I am setting L to 3 periods to ensure the inventory position covers a longer potential delay. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the overall average while acknowledging the recent volatility, resulting in a mu_hat that represents 4 periods of demand (1 + L=3).

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Demand recovered to 106 units after Period 5 dip, stabilizing the 6-period average at ~100 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1274.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we reconcile the inventory for chips(Regular). The current on-hand inventory is 94 units with 353 units in-transit. Historical lead times have been volatile: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3. Crucially, the P2 order (132 units) is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost, while the P5 (74 units), P6 (49 units), and P7 (98 units) orders are still in transit. Given the observed lead times, I will set L to 3 (explicitly) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longer realized delay. Demand history (excluding the P5 outlier of 35) shows a mean of roughly 106 units per period (P1-P4, P6-P7). I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the broader average while smoothing the P5 dip, and recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to account for the demand volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (132 units) now confirmed lost (5 periods since order, well past max observed LT=3). Lead time remains unstable (range 1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1974.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the on-hand inventory is 154 units. Historical demand analysis shows a relatively stable mean around 100 units (avg P1-P8 is ~102). Lead times remain highly erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P7: 1). The Period 2 order (132 units) is officially categorized as lost. Current in-transit inventory is 231 units (consisting of orders from P6 and P8). To account for the variability and the high probability of a 3-period lead time, I am setting L to 3 (explicitly) instead of the promised 2. For demand (mu_hat), the last 3 periods show a stable recovery (106, 72, 112), so I'll use recent_N with N=8 to capture the full range of recent demand while smoothing out the Period 5 dip. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=8) to reflect the observed volatility in demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1816.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the chips(Regular) SKU shows a stabilization in demand and continued lead-time volatility. Average demand across the 9 recorded periods is approximately 98.2 units, with the most recent sample (Period 9) at 101, reinforcing this mean. The lead time (L) has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods: P1 (3), P3 (1), P4 (3), P5 (3), P7 (1), and P8 (1). The Period 2 order (132 units) is officially categorized as lost. Given the variance in lead time, I am setting L explicitly to 2 (the promised value) but accounting for the risk of L=3 in the base stock. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the demand behavior since the Period 5 dip, which averages ~88 units per period, but I calculate the total across (1+L) periods. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized around ~100 units/period (avg P6-P9: 97.75). Lead time patterns show bimodal behavior: either 1 period or 3 periods (Average observed L: 2.0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1957.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory hit 0 units, and demand was 121, resulting in 18 units of lost sales. This was caused by the decision to order 0 units in Period 10 Combined with the absence of arrivals. Currently, On-hand is 0 with 295 units In-transit (Orders from P11, P9, and P6 - though P6 is likely lost). Demand history shows a stable pattern around 100 units/period (mean of last 5: 95; mean of all: 100.3) despite a Period 5 dip. Lead times are bimodal (1 or 3 periods), making the promised L=2 a reasonable central estimate. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand level (~100/period) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. L will be set to 'calculate' to let the backend average the bimodal lead-time observations (1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1). This ensures the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand to prevent further stockouts while accounting for pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: P2 order remains lost. Periodic stockout occurred at P10 conclude due to zero arrivals and high demand (121). Demand remains stable at ~100 units/period.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) following zero arrivals in Periods 10 and 11. Historical analysis shows that the Period 2 order (132 units) is confirmed lost. Recently, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of 2.0 (observed L: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1). Demand is stable around ~100 units/period (avg P1-P11: 97.4, with a recent dip to 67 in P11). I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time of 2.0. mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 (P7-P11) to capture the stable demand mean (approx 100) while weighting recent performance, which leads to a base stock targeting (1+2)*100 = 300 units. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the actual volatility found in the recent stable regime. The in-transit pipeline (428 units) is high, but given the critical stockout and lead-time variability, maintaining these parameters ensures the OR backend targets a robust base stock to recover service levels once arrivals commence.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 100 units per period (the average of periods 6-12 is approximately 98.7 units). The current on-hand inventory is very low at 7 units following a significant stockout cycle caused by lead time variability. Lead times have shown a consistent bimodal pattern of either 1 period or 3 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 314 units includes the Period 11 order (133 units) and the Period 2 order (132 units). As established in previous insights, the Period 2 order is officially considered lost (now 11 periods since order). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 182 units (314 - 132). To ensure the OR engine orders enough to replenish the stock and cover the 3-period lead time risk, I will set L to 3. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while acknowledging recent volatility.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) as of the end of Period 13, with demand for the last period being 130. Historical arrivals indicate a bimodel lead time of either 1 or 3 periods (P9 arrived at P12 [LT=3], P8 arrived at P9 [LT=1]). The P2 order (132 units) is confirmed lost. Average demand remains stable at approximately 100 units/period (P9-P13 average is 105). To prevent future stockouts, I am setting L to 2 (average of observed 1 and 3) to ensure the base stock calculation covers at least 3 periods of demand (L+1). mu_hat is set to 297 using recent_N=3 to capture the slightly higher recent demand (107, 130, and the demand samples mentioned in the prompt), ensuring the pipeline covers demand during the lead time and the current period.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains bimodal (observed 1 or 3 periods). P2 order (132 units) is permanently lost and should be excluded from pipeline considerations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1667.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we observe that the lead time for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit bimodal behavior, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Recent arrivals: P9 at LT=3, P11 at LT=3, while previous cycles saw LT=1). The P2 order (132 units) is confirmed lost and must be excluded from pipeline math. On-hand inventory is 43, and the active pipeline (In-transit minus the lost P2 order) is 207 units (orders from P13 and P14). Mean demand remains stable at approximately 100 units per period (Avg P10-P14: 103 units). Given the high profit to holding cost ratio ($19:$1), a critical service level is required. I will use L=3 to account for the frequent maximum arrival delay observed, and recent stats for demand to reflect current stability. The OR backend needs to cover at least (L+1) periods of demand to prevent the stockouts seen in P11 and P13.

Daily Reward (R_t): $817.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 15 (demand 93, sold 43). The pipeline is quite large at 428 units, which includes the Period 11 shipment (133 units - concluded at P14), Period 13 shipment (132 units), Period 14 (26 units), and Period 15 (89 units). Wait\u2014re-evaluating in-transit: Period 11 arrived in P14. The 428 units in-transit includes the lost Period 2 order (132 units), plus orders from Period 13 (132), Period 14 (26), and Period 15 (89), and presumably a Period 12 order (observed in game history as 'ordered=0' actually, but pipeline is reported as 428). History shows demand is stable around 100 units (mean of P1-P15 is approx 98, mean of last 5 is 97.4). Lead time remains bimodal (1 or 3 periods). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time (approx 2.1) and use 'recent_N' for demand (N=10) to capture the stable mean of ~100. Overdue shipments and the lost P2 order are handled by the OR backend's pipeline subtraction, though the OR engine will over-estimate pipeline by including the lost P2 order; however, the 'cap' mechanism usually prevents massive over-ordering if the current pipeline is perceived as full.

Daily Reward (R_t): $948.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with an average of approximately 96 units over the last 10 periods (P7-P16), despite a dip in Period 16 (54 units). The lead time continues to be highly volatile and bimodal, alternating between 1 period and 3 periods. Specifically, recent arrivals from orders placed in P11 and P13 both took 3 periods to arrive. Given the current on-hand inventory of 78 and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 298 units (which includes an 89-unit order from P15 and a 26-unit order from P14 that may arrive this period), the system is well-buffered to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs. The Period 2 order (132 units) is confirmed lost and should be disregarded. I am setting L to 2 (the promised and historical average), mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to reflect the stabilized demand mean (~96), and sigma_hat using the same N to capture the observed standard deviation. The OR backend's inventory cap will naturally temper the ordering since the pipeline is full.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is very low (On-hand: 14) following a demand of 92 in Period 17. The pipeline contains 320 units (P15: 89, P17: 50, and unspecified previous orders totaling 181 units). Note that the P2 order (132 units) is confirmed lost. Average demand has stabilized around 100 units per period (P6-P17 average is ~93, but excluding the P5 outlier, it's closer to 100). Lead times remain bimodal (either 1 or 3 periods). I will set L to 2 (the promised and calculated average) and use recent_N (N=12, covering Periods 6-17) to capture the current stable demand regime while accounting for the high volatility in arrivals. This ensures we maintain a sufficient base stock for the next (L+1) periods despite the bimodal arrival pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a recent peak (157 units in P18), with the last 5 periods (P14-P18) averaging approximately 89.2 units. The 10-period average (P9-P18) is roughly 101.2 units. Given the stockout in P18 (0 ending on-hand) and high demand volatility, I will use a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for mu_hat to capture the underlying mean of ~100 while allowing the OR backend to handle the variance. The lead time remains highly unstable and bimodal (observed values of 1 or 3 periods). Using the 'calculate' method for L will allow the engine to average these outcomes (mean L \u2248 2.2), providing a safer buffer than the promised 2. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with a window of 5 to prioritize recent volatility (including the high P18 demand) in the safety stock calculation. The P2 order (132 units) remains permanently lost and correctly removed from pipeline calculations by the system over time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in P18 (157 units), but the 10-period average remains stable at ~100 units. Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, on-hand inventory is 0 following two periods of stockouts due to high demand (P18: 157, P19: 150) and lead-time delays. The lead time for chips(Regular) continues to be bimodal, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.0). The Period 2 order (132 units) remains permanently lost and is excluded from pipeline logic. Current in-transit (492 units) includes orders from Period 15, 17, 18, and 19. Demand has shown a recent spike but has historically centered around 100 units/period (average P10-P19 is 111, influenced by the recent P18-P19 peak). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=10) to capture this slight upward trend without overreacting to the P18-19 outliers. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time of 2.0, which aligns with the promised lead time but accounts for the 1/3 oscillation. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture the increased volatility of the last 10 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift: Recent demand (P18-P19) significantly exceeded the 100-unit average, reaching ~153 units. Monitoring if this is a sustained trend or a temporary spike.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand inventory = 0) following a demand spike in P18-P19 (~153 units) and a subsequent sharp drop in P20 (20 units). The P20 drop likely indicates a pause or correction rather than a permanent low-demand regime, given that the underlying average remains around 100-110 units. The pipeline inventory (499 units) is heavily distorted by the 'lost' P2 order (132 units), which has never arrived. Since the OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory from the base stock to calculate orders, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 (average of bimodal 1 and 3) and an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate expected demand per period to be ~115 (accounting for the recent spike) across (L+1) = 3 periods, totaling 345 units. I will set sigma_hat using the last 15 periods to reflect recent volatility. The pipeline correction is handled by the OR engine's internal math, but by setting a sufficient mu_hat, we aim to trigger orders despite the phantom inventory of the lost P2 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: P20 demand dropped to 20 units following a two-period spike (avg 153). Observed lead times continue to be bimodal (1 or 3 periods), averaging 2.0.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory and a pending pipeline of 499 units. Recent demand has shown extreme volatility, with values ranging from 20 to 190. While the long-term average hovers around 100, the last few periods (P18-P21) showed a significant upward pressure with an average of ~129, despite the P20 outlier. The lead time is confirmed bimodal (1 or 3 periods), averaging 2.0 periods. The 499 units in-transit includes orders from P15 (89), P17 (50), P18 (89), P19 (83), P20 (7), and the missing P2 order (132). Excluding the lost P2 order, the active pipeline is 367 units. To recover from the stockout and handle the current demand volatility, I am setting mu_hat using the last 15 samples to capture the historical mean while acknowledging the recent instability. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend use the historical average (2.0) and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain a buffer for the observed high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in P21 (190 units), confirming that despite the P20 dip (20 units), the system remains prone to high-demand spikes. Total active pipeline inventory (excluding P2) is 367 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a critical stockout state (on-hand inventory = 0) following a volatile demand period where demand spiked and dropped significantly (157, 150, 20, 190, 109 in the last 5 periods). High demand resulted in several periods of lost sales because arrivals have been delayed. Specifically, no arrivals have occurred since Period 17, and the pipeline inventory is heavily bloated (503 units), including the long-lost Period 2 order (132 units) and multiple orders from Periods 15, 18, 19, 20, and 22 that are likely in the 1-3 period lead-time window. The mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 107 units, but the high variance (due to spikes like 190 and 157) requires a higher sigma estimate. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the bimodal 1-to-3 period lead time (avg ~2.0). Demand (mu_hat) is set to a recent_N of 10 to capture the slightly higher recent average (~107) compared to the all-time average, while sigma_hat is set to 10 to account for heightened volatility. The OR backend's capped policy will likely prevent a massive new order because the pipeline (503 units) is already very high relative to expected demand, even after discounting the lost 132 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified from Period 18-22, with spikes up to 190 units and a low of 20 units; 10-period mean now ~107. Pipeline inventory is currently high (503 units) but has failed to deliver any units since Period 17.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24, on-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline inventory is high (552 units), but it includes the Period 2 order (132 units) which is confirmed lost. After excluding the lost shipment, the actionable pipeline is 420 units. Arrivals remain extremely unreliable; in Period 23, only 11 units arrived (from orders placed in P20 and P22) despite a massive backlog. This confirms the bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) continues, but there is a severe delay or bottleneck for orders placed between Period 15 and 19 (all of which are overdue if L=3). Recent demand (P18-P23) has been volatile, averaging 119 units, while the 50-period mean is lower. Given the zero on-hand status and the failure of the pipeline to deliver the P15-P19 block (311 units), I will set L to 3 (the observed maximum) to capture the current delivery delay. For demand, I'll use recent_N=6 to reflect the higher volatility and mean (119 units) observed since the P18 spike. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that accounts for the 1+3 period risk, while the cap will prevent over-ordering against the massive (though potentially stuck) in-transit total.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline bottleneck confirmed: Orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (total 311 units) have not arrived as of P24 START, exceeding the previously observed max LT of 3 periods. Demand from P18-P23 shows increased mean of ~119 units compared to the long-term ~100.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is currently experiencing severe disruptions. At the start of Period 25, we are at zero on-hand inventory with 676 units in transit. Crucially, a cluster of orders placed between Periods 15 and 19 (totaling 311 units) are now missing, having exceeded the previously observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. This indicates either a significant lead time extension or permanent loss of these shipments. Although Period 23 conclude showed two small arrivals (P20 and P22), the larger, older orders remain stuck. Demand has also shifted upward; the average demand from Period 18 to Period 24 is ~119 units, compared to the long-term average of ~100. Due to the high uncertainty in lead times (ranging from 1 to >9 periods) and the high probability of lost shipments in the pipeline, I am setting L explicitly to 4 to force the OR engine to account for a longer cycle. I am using a recent_N approach for demand (N=7, covering the recent high-volatility regime) to capture the increased mean and variance, which helps the system maintain a higher safety stock against the combined threat of supply delays and demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Significant pipeline blockage: Orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (311 units) have exceeded 5+ periods in-transit, suggesting they are lost or subject to a major lead-time shift (L > 5). Recent demand regime (P18-P24) mean has increased to ~119 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe supply chain disruption. While the promised lead time is 2, arrivals have recently been bimodal (1 or 3 periods). More critically, there is a massive 'pipeline blockage' with orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 311 units) now 6-10 periods overdue. These units must be treated as permanently lost because the OR backend's capped policy will see the 739 units 'In-transit' and stop ordering, resulting in perpetual stockouts if the units never arrive. Demand has also shifted; the average demand from P18-P25 is approximately 105.5 units, but volatility is extremely high (range 10-190). To bypass the OR backend's stock-counting logic and force orders despite the false 'pipeline', I will use 'explicit' parameters. I'll set L to 3 (the maximum reliable observed lead time). I'll set mu_hat to (1+L)*120 = 480 to cover the recent higher demand regime, and sigma_hat to 100 to account for high volatility, ensuring a high service level while the pipeline reconciles.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed extensive supply chain failure: Orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (311 units) are now 6+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. In-transit data is currently unreliable due to these stale units. Demand regime remains volatile with a mean of ~105 since P18.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing significant disruptions. Orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 311 units) are now 7-11 periods overdue and are confirmed lost. Additionally, the order from Period 24 (124 units) has not arrived within its expected lead time (L=2). The most recent arrival (P23 order) arrived in 2 periods. The current 'In-transit' of 739 units includes 443 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) that are effectively lost. This makes the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation highly unreliable, as it believes we have 739 units coming, while we likely only have 296 valid units (P24, P25). Demand has been volatile, with a mean of ~102 over the last 10 periods (P17-P26), including a recent drop to 10 and 55. To compensate for the 'ghost' pipeline units and prevent stockouts, I will set L to 5 explicitly (accounting for delayed delivery reality) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture the recent regime (last 10 periods). Setting L to 5 increases the target base stock, helping overcome the OR engine's belief that the pipeline is full.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (311 units), totaling 443 lost units including Period 2. Pipeline inventory calculation as of P27 is skewed by 443 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant disruption. As of Period 28, a total of 443 units (from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, and 19) are confirmed lost, as they have exceeded the documented maximum lead time of 3 periods by a wide margin (some as long as 13 periods). This makes the 'In-transit' figure (832 units) highly unreliable for the OR backend's calculation. The actual viable pipeline is approximately 389 units (832 - 443). Recent lead times for successful deliveries (Period 23 arrived in Period 25 and Period 20/22 arrived in Period 23) show a recovery toward the promised lead time of 2, but the delivery from Period 23 specifically was a 2-period lead time. Demand remains volatile; while the average since Period 18 is ~105, recent spikes and dips (190, 88, 120, 10, 55, 84) reflect high variance. I am setting L to 2 to align with the most recent arrival (P23), and mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture the recent regime (last 10 periods) where mean demand is ~103 and volatility is high. To compensate for the 443 lost units hidden in the in-transit tally, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, increasing the base stock target manually to trigger an order despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery noted in P25: Period 23 order arrived with LT=2. However, the pipeline is still cluttered with 443 units from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, and 19 that are confirmed lost.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to struggle with severe disruptions. A total of 443 units are confirmed lost (Periods 2: 132 units, 15: 89 units, 17: 50 units, 18: 89 units, and 19: 83 units) as they are well beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. These units skew the in-transit calculation; adjusting for these losses, the actual 'active' pipeline is significantly smaller (936 - 443 = 493 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a stockout occurring in Period 28. Demand remains volatile, with the most recent sample at 59 units, but the broader regime average since Period 18 is approximately 105 units. Given the bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods, sometimes 2), setting L to the promethean default of 2 is appropriate for the OR calculation, but \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 must account for the recent demand regime's volatility and the urgent need to replenish following consecutive stockouts. Using recent_N=10 for demand statistics to capture the most recent regime while smoothing out the extreme P21 spike and subsequent dips.

Carry-over insight: P24-P28 confirm that the 443 units ordered in P2, P15, P17, P18, and P19 are permanently lost. In-transit monitoring must subtract these 443 units to accurately reflect the supply chain state.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30, the demand for chips(Regular) shows a long-term average of approximately 100 units, but with significant volatility (highs of 190 and lows of 10). Period 29 demand was very low (23), but given the history, a recovery toward the mean is expected. The supply chain has stabilized somewhat with recent lead times of 2 periods (P23 arrived in P25, P27 arrived in P29), although historical lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. A critical factor is the 'ghost' inventory: 443 units (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 843. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 843 - 443 = 400 units. To maintain service levels against a volatile demand mean of ~100 with a lead time of 2, the base stock should cover roughly 3 periods of demand plus a safety buffer. I am using 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the demand regime since P18, which has seen higher variance. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (which remains around 2.0).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently (P18-P21 saw spikes up to 190, while P25-P30 dropped significantly, averaging ~48 units/period). The long-term mean is ~101, but the last 13 periods (P18-P30) average 89.3. I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 13 to capture this volatile but generally lower recent demand profile. Lead time has stabilized over the last few arrivals (P23, P27, P28) to exactly 2 periods, so I will return to the 'default' promised lead time. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 739 units includes 443 documented lost units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19), meaning real pipeline inventory is effectively 296 units. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent data, I aim to maintain sufficient safety stock for potential spikes while avoiding over-ordering into a recovered supply chain.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized to an actual lead time (L) of approximately 2 periods based on orders from P23, P27, and P28, despite previous volatility and lost units. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after exhausting 119 units against a demand of 138 in P31. The pipeline inventory is heavily skewed by 443 confirmed lost units (from P2, P15, P17, P18, and P19). The current reported 'In-transit' of 739 includes these lost units; thus, the real functional pipeline is 739 - 443 = 296 units. Demand has entered a lower-volatility regime recently following a series of extreme spikes, with the last 14 periods (P18-P31) averaging ~92.5 units per period. Setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=14 (accounting for the recent regime shift post-P17) and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=14 to reflect this sustained variance. L is set to 'calculate' to favor the recent stabilized observations over the volatile history.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilized: P23, P27, and P28 orders confirmed an actual lead time of 2 periods. Total lost units in the pipeline remain 443 (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19).

The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be volatile but centered around a mean of ~100 units. Recent demand (P29-P32) has fluctuated between 23 and 138 units. The supply chain has stabilized for new orders, with arrivals from P23, P27, and P28 confirming a consistent lead time of 2 periods (L=2). However, total 'In-transit' inventory (739 units) is significantly inflated by 443 units confirmed lost (Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19). Adjusting for these losses, the actual pipeline inventory is 296 units. Despite the high on-hand ending in P30, the stockout in P31 and P32 suggests we need to maintain a robust base stock to handle the bimodal lead time (1-3 periods) and demand spikes. I am setting L to the promised 2 periods (as recent arrivals align with this), mu_hat (demand for R+L) to 3 periods of the long-term mean (~100 units), and using a standard sigma_hat to account for the high variance observed in both demand and delivery times.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following zero arrivals since Period 30. The system shows an 'In-transit' balance of 739 units, but historical analysis confirms 443 of these are permanently lost (Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). The effective pipeline is thus 296 units (739 - 443), primarily consisting of orders from P24 and P25 (total 247 units) which are now significantly overdue (LT > 8), suggesting they may also be lost or deeply delayed. Recent demand (P29-P33) has softened considerably, averaging ~58 units compared to the long-term ~100. However, given the zero on-hand status and the unreliability of the 'In-transit' balance, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time of successful deliveries and use 'recent_N' (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer for potential spikes. I am choosing not to place a large order yet because the OR backend's capped policy will account for the pipeline; instead, I am optimizing the parameters so the backend triggers an order if it perceives the effective pipeline as insufficient to cover the (L+1) window.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain remains unstable: Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19 (443 units) are definitively lost. Orders from P24 and P25 (247 units) are now 8+ periods overdue and highly likely lost. Effective pipeline as of P34 is near zero or includes only very recent/uncertain orders. Demand regime has shifted downward since P29 (avg ~58 units).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently in a severe failure state. As of Period 35, there are 739 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms a massive portion of these are lost shipments that will never arrive. Specifically, the following orders are confirmed lost: Period 2 (132), Periods 15, 17, 18, 19 (311), and Periods 24, 25 (247). Total confirmed lost units = 690. Subtracting these from the reported 739 total in-transit units leaves an effective pipeline of only 49 units (from recent orders), or potentially zero given the lack of recent orders. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has also shifted significantly lower since Period 29, averaging approximately 58 units per period compared to the previous 100-115 range. Due to the high lead-time volatility and the history of lost orders, I will set L to 3 (the max successful lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand \u03bc\u0302, I will use recent_N=6 to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~58). \u03c3\u0302 will also be based on this recent period to reflect current volatility. The target is to rebuild inventory from zero despite the misleadingly high pipeline figures.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed as of Period 34: 690 units in the pipeline (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) are permanently lost. Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 29: average demand decreased from ~100 to ~58 (-42%).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a total collapse, with 690 units in the pipeline confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25). While the 'In-transit' count is 739, only 49 units (from P35, though the history shows zero orders placed in P26-P35) are potentially viable, though the game history indicates no orders were actually placed since Period 28. Demand has shifted to a lower regime starting at Period 29, averaging approximately 58 units/period, despite a recent outlier of 164 in P35. To regain control of the inventory with 0 on-hand and a broken pipeline, I must set the OR parameters to trigger a fresh order. I will use a recent demand window of N=7 (P29-P35) to capture the lower mean (~74 including the spike, or ~58 excluding it) and set L=2 (the last observed successful lead time). By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' for the last 7 periods, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that ignores the stale 'in-transit' units because the cap and logic will be forced to respond to the 0 on-hand state and the lower demand forecast.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a total failure for all orders placed between Period 15 and Period 35, except for brief arrivals from P23, P27, and P28. Specifically, 690 units from orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) are confirmed lost. In-transit currently shows 739 units, but subtracting the 690 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of only 49 units. Demand has shifted: From P29 to P36, the average demand is ~75 units, significantly lower than the historical ~105-119 range, though P35 and P36 showed a sudden spike (164 and 111 respectively). On-hand inventory is 0 and has been for several periods. Since the promised lead time L=2 is generally respected when orders actually arrive (as seen in P25, P29, P30), I will use L=2. To capture the recent volatile yet slightly lower demand regime, I'll use recent_N (N=8) for mu and sigma to cover the P29-P36 period and account for the recent spikes while ignoring the older high-mean regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply chain collapse for orders placed between P15 and P35 (excluding P23, P27, P28); cumulative lost units in pipeline reached 690 by P37. Demand regime since P29 is highly volatile (range 23-164) with a localized mean around 75 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a catastrophic failure, with 690 units in-transit (from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25) now confirmed as permanently lost after exceeding all reasonable lead-time windows. The current in-transit figure of 739 units is largely comprised of these lost items, with only very recent orders potentially valid. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the last arrival was in Period 30. Demand has shown a localized regime shift and high volatility since Period 29; while the average has dropped to ~75 units, the range is extreme (23-164). Given the 690 lost units, the 'real' pipeline is essentially 49 units (739 - 690). To resume supply, I must set parameters that allow the OR backend to place new orders. I will use an explicit L of 2 (the last successful LT) and explicit mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the recent demand regime (avg ~75, high volatility). mu_hat is set to cover review + lead time (1+2=3 periods) at 75 units/period = 225. sigma_hat is set to 120 to account for recent spikes (e.g., 164 in P35).

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Confirmed 690 units lost in pipeline (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Systemic supply failure for orders placed between P15-P25. Recent demand regime (P29-P37) mean is ~75 units with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 50).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a catastrophic failure, with 690 units ordered between Period 2 and Period 25 currently in-transit but confirmed lost based on historical lead times (max observed LT=3 vs actual latency >13 periods). This creates a massive artificial 'Pipeline Inventory' of 739 units, whereas the actual viable pipeline is likely zero or includes only very recent/uncertain units. Total lost units = 2 (132) + 15 (89) + 17 (50) + 18 (89) + 19 (83) + 24 (124) + 25 (123) = 690 units. Subtracting these from the current In-transit (739) leaves an effective pipeline of 49 units (the Period 27/28 orders were small or already arrived). Because the OR backend subtracts full pipeline from base stock, I must use 'explicit' methods to override this. Demand since Period 29 has been highly volatile (range 23-164) with a mean of 77.8. I will set mu_hat to cover this demand over the review period (L+1=3) plus a buffer for the high volatility (sigma_hat). I set L=2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P29, P30) showed LT=2. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly allows me to bypass the 739-unit pipeline blockage.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure confirmed: 690 units in-transit (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) are permanently lost and must be manually excluded from replenishment logic. Demand regime since P29 is highly volatile (avg 78, \u03c3 ~48).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40, the supply chain is in a state of severe crisis. Historical data confirms that 690 units ordered between Periods 2 and 25 (specifically P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25) are permanently lost. Subtracting these from the current in-transit total of 1147 leaves an 'effective' pipeline of 457 units. This effective pipeline primarily consists of the 408 units ordered in Period 39. Demand has shifted several times; the regime since Period 29 averages approximately 78 units per period, but recent demand (P35-P39) has surged back to a mean of ~121 units. To address the current stockout (on-hand is 0) and the extreme uncertainty in lead times (which range from 1 to 3 periods but have recently seen massive failures), I am setting L to 3 to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For demand, I'm using a 'recent_N' of 5 to capture the most recent high-demand spike (mean ~121). The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on these parameters, and by accounting for the high 'lost' inventory in my rationale, I am effectively signal-boosting the need for replenishment while acknowledging the 408 units already placed in P39.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Effective pipeline inventory is only 457 units (1147 total in-transit minus 690 confirmed lost units from P2-P25). Recent demand (P35-P39) has surged to a mean of ~121 units, reversing the previous downward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1972.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain exhibits high instability with systemic order losses. As per carry-over insights, 690 units from orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are permanently lost. The current in-transit of 739 units includes these 690 lost units, making the 'effective' pipeline only 49 units (the order from P40, which hasn't arrived yet). Demand has shifted again: after a low-demand regime (P29-P34 avg ~58), it has surged in P35-P40 to an average of ~121 units/period. The order placed in P39 arrived in P40 (LT=1), suggesting a potential return to shorter lead times, though historical bimodal behavior (1 or 3 periods) remains a risk. To prevent stockouts during this demand surge while accounting for the unreliable pipeline, I am setting L=2 (the average observed). mu_hat is set to (1+L)*121 \u2248 363 to cover the current high-demand regime, and sigma_hat is set explicitly to 75 to account for the high volatility (range 101-164) observed in the last 6 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed Period 35-40: mean increased to ~121 units/period from previous low of ~58. Effective pipeline inventory calculation must exclude 690 confirmed lost units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has surged and stabilized since Period 35, with a mean demand of approximately 119 units per period (P35-P41), reversing the previous downward trend. Lead times remain volatile but have recently shown a mix of 1-3 periods (averaging 2). The pipeline inventory currently stands at 739 units, but we must manually account for the 'lost' units. Based on historical carry-over, 690 units (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) are permanently lost. Therefore, the 'effective' pipeline is 739 - 690 = 49 units (this corresponds to the order placed in P39 actually already arriving 408 units, so the 739 in-transit likely includes the 690 lost units + 49 remaining units). With 188 units on-hand and 49 effective in-transit, total effective inventory is 237 units. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~119 units/period (~357 total), and considering the high profit margin ($19) vs holding cost ($1) which dictates a high service level (q = 0.95), I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for the recent surge. I use L = recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent faster arrivals (P39 arrived in 1 period), and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the last 7 periods (P35-P41) to capture the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~119 units/period since Period 35; high demand volatility remains (range 101-164). Effective pipeline inventory must subtract 690 units of confirmed lost legacy orders.

The recent demand regime (Period 35-42) has stabilized at a significantly higher mean compared to the previous slump. The mean demand over the last 8 periods is approximately 118 units, with a standard deviation around 20. The supply chain has shown signs of recovery with a recent lead time of 1 period (Period 39 order), though historical bimodal behavior (1 or 3 periods) and the 690 confirmed lost units (Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25) continue to skew pipeline data. Effective on-hand inventory is 76, and the 'In-transit' of 739 units is heavily compromised by the 690 lost units, meaning the real pipeline is only 49 units (739 total - 690 lost). To ensure availability against the current ~118 unit demand and account for bimodal lead times (L=2 average), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) at the current regime mean (118 * 3 = 354) and setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~118 units/period since Period 35 (range 101-164). Total confirmed lost units in pipeline remains 690 (Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Real pipeline inventory as of P43 is 49 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has transitioned from a severe supply chain failure (P15-P25) into a more stable arrival pattern recently (P39 arrived in 1 period). However, history shows lead times are bimodal (1 or 3 periods). The demand regime has stabilized following a surge; the average demand since P35 is approximately 117 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units). The in-transit inventory of 739 units is heavily skewed by 690 confirmed lost units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). The effective pipeline is actually 49 units (739 - 690). To capture the current demand level (~117) and maintain service levels despite high volatility (101-164 range), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to cover the post-surge period (P35-P43). Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to account for the bimodal 1-3 period behavior while recognizing the recent faster arrival.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is entering the final periods (P45-P50). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 739 units is heavily skewed by 690 confirmed lost units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25), leaving an effective pipeline of 49 units. Demand has stabilized into a high-volatility regime since P35, with a mean of ~118 units (P35-P44) and a standard deviation of ~24. Lead times have been highly inconsistent but recent arrivals (P39 order arriving in 1 period) suggest a shorter lead time is possible, though the promised lead time remains 2. To ensure stock for the remaining 5 periods while accounting for the high volatility and clearing the backlog created by lost shipments, I will use an explicit L of 2 and an explicit mu_hat reflecting the recent 10-period demand average (~118) scaled for (1+L) periods. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to cover the observed volatility (approx 24 per period) to maintain service levels without excessive holding costs as the game concludes.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P39-P45) has a mean of approximately 101 units with a standard deviation around 17, representing a slight cooling from the high-demand surge seen in P35-P40. We are currently at Period 46 with 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit balance of 739 units. However, as established in carry-over insights, 690 units from orders placed in P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are confirmed lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is only 49 units (from P39's order of 408, where 359 units have already been sold or used). To avoid stockouts in the final 5 periods, we must replenish based on the stable demand of ~101 units per period. The bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) averages to 2, which is the promised lead time. I will use recent_N=7 to capture the post-surge demand stabilization and set L to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 39-45 average demand is 101 units (\u03c3 \u2248 17). Effective pipeline inventory is (In-transit - 690 lost units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 47, the SKU is in a state of high pipeline uncertainty despite recent demand stabilization. The official 'In-transit' figure of 739 units is heavily skewed by 690 units confirmed lost or severely delayed (from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25). Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is only 49 units (739 total - 690 lost). Period 46 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout. Demand has stabilized post-Period 39 at a mean of approximately 101 units (P39-P46: 120, 119, 101, 112, 72, 105, 80, 80). Since we are at Period 47 of 50, and the actual lead time L has recently shown values of 1 or 2, use L=2 to ensure availability for the final periods. By setting L to 'explicit' 2, mu_hat to 'recent_N' 8 (covering the current 101-unit regime), and sigma_hat using the same window, the OR backend will calculate a base stock target that accounts for the 100+ unit demand, resulting in an order that bridges the gap between the 49 real in-transit units and the total requirement to satisfy the remaining periods without excessive holding risk at the game's end.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48. The demand regime since Period 39 has stabilized around a mean of ~102 units with a standard deviation of approximately 18. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the in-transit inventory is listed at 739 units. However, as established in previous insights, 690 units from orders placed in Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25 are confirmed lost or permanently stalled. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 739 - 690 = 49 units (this likely represents the residual from the large Period 39 order that may have arrived or been handled differently, though historical conclude shows P39 arrived in full in P40. The current 'In-transit' 739 minus 690 leaves 49 units still technically in pipeline from recent periods, though no orders were recorded between P40 and P47). Given we have 0 on-hand and only 49 nominal units in transit, and the game ends at P50, we need to ensure enough stock for the final 3 periods (P48, P49, P50). Targeted base stock = (L+1) * mu = 3 * 102 = 306 units. Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat (explicit) = 306, and sigma_hat (explicit) = 31 (approx sqrt(3)*18) to ensure high service level for the final periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 49. Reviewing the inventory state, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory is 739 units. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, 690 units in the pipeline (from Period 2 through Period 25) are confirmed lost and have never arrived despite many periods passing. Additionally, since P39 (where a large order of 408 units was placed and arrived in P40), no new orders have been placed (P40-P48 orders were 0). Therefore, the 'real' in-transit inventory is calculated as 739 (total) - 690 (lost) = 49 units. Demand has stabilized recently; the average demand from Period 43 to Period 48 is approximately 87 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 13. The most recent demand (P48) was 85 units. Lead times have been volatile but recently showed a 1-period arrival (P39 order arrived in P40). I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the stable demand regime (~95 units) and set L to default (promised 2) to ensure the OR backend aims for enough stock to cover the replenishment cycle, while accounting for the fact that nearly all 'in-transit' units are phantom/lost.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P45-P49) has averaged 89 units. The pipeline shows 739 units in-transit, but based on carry-over insights, 690 units (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) are permanently lost. Subtracting these from the 739 units reported in-transit reveals an effective pipeline of only 49 units. Since the last arrival was at Period 40 (ordered P39), the system hasn't received replenishment in 9 periods, while demand has consistently hovered around 90-100 units. To restore inventory levels and account for the bimodal lead time (observed 1-3 periods), I am setting L to 2 (the promised and long-term average). I will use a recent_N of 11 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stable regime since Period 39 (approx 100 units/period) and recent_N of 11 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility.
