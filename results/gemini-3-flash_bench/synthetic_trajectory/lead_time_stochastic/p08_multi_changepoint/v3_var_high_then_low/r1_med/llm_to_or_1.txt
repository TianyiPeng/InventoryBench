Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) averages 96.8 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since there is no on-hand inventory or units currently in-transit, we need to establish a base stock level quickly to cover demand for the review period (1) plus the lead time (2), totaling (1+L) = 3 periods of demand. Using the mean of all 5 available samples (N=5) provides a stable estimate of the demand mu. For sigma, we use the standard deviation of those 5 samples (~21.0) to account for volatility and set a service level appropriate for high-margin chips (Profit $4 / Holding $1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 132 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 will arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the Period 4 start message. Thus, the 0 units arrived in Period 1 is expected. Total demand in Period 1 was 110, resulting in significant lost sales because we started with 0 inventory. Historical demand for the last 5 pre-game periods was [71, 120, 95, 116, 82] (mean ~96.8). Period 1 demand was 110, which is slightly above average but consistent with the historical range. Since there is no confirmed regime shift yet after only one period of gameplay, I will use the default methods for lead time and sigma, but use recent_N for mu_hat to capture the most recent historical context (N=6 includes the 5 historical samples plus Period 1). This helps set a base stock that covers the expected demand over the review and lead time periods (1+2=3 periods).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 with an on-hand inventory of 0 and 264 units in transit (ordered in P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. No units have arrived yet, which is expected for L=2 (the P1 order of 132 units should arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in P3's conclude message). Historical demand for the last five periods (from data provided) is 71, 120, 95, 116, 82, averaging 96.8. However, recent demand reports from Period 1 & 2 conclude messages show 110 and 145, suggesting a potential upward trend or higher recent volatility. Given the critical state of 0 on-hand inventory and the need to fulfill demand immediately upon arrival, I will use recent_N (N=2) for mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand (avg 127.5) and default methods for L and sigma_hat until more arrival data confirms lead time stability.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (132 units) was expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 1, 2, and 3. This indicates a delay or that the lead time is longer than promised. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have missed demand for 3 consecutive periods due to stockouts. Total demand so far (110, 145, 113) averages around 122.6 units. Since we have no order arrivals yet, I will keep L at default for now but monitor for a lost shipment. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand intensity (avg ~122.6) while we wait for the pipeline (419 units) to arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $153.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that orders from Period 1 (132 units) and Period 3 (155 units) have arrived, resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 199 units. Historical lead times have been 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), while the promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 2 (132 units) is currently in-transit and overdue based on the 2nd period arrival expectation, or it may arrive in Period 5. Given the high variance in lead time (1 to 3 periods), I will use 'calculate' for L. Demand samples (110, 145, 113, 88) show a mean of 114. Forecast for mu_hat will use all 5 available samples (including the user-provided sample for Period 5: 82), resulting in a mean of ~101. No clear demand trend is identified yet, so I will stick to 'default' parameters to allow the backend to use all historical data for the forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead time patterns for chips(Regular). Historically, demand has been volatile: Periods 1-4 showed high demand (avg ~114), but Period 5 dropped significantly to 35. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times were 3 (P1) and 1 (P3), suggesting an average of 2. We have 164 units on-hand and 257 in-transit (orders from P2 and P5). Since we are at Period 6, the order from P2 (ordered 132 units) is likely to arrive this period (if L=4) or next. To account for the recent drop in demand while acknowledging the overall mean, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (avg ~98) and sigma_hat. Using recent_N for L allows the OR backend to average the observed lead times (3 and 1), which aligns with the promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $366.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 58 units with 298 units in-transit. Historical lead times show high variability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period, against a promised 2. The order from Period 2 (132 units) is currently missing (4 periods elapsed), suggesting a lost shipment or severe delay. Demand has been fluctuating with an average of approximately 99.5 units per period (N=6 history: 110, 145, 113, 88, 35, 106). Since we have a high in-transit volume (298 units) and the OR engine uses a capped policy (base stock minus pipeline), I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the observed variance and 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand parameters to stabilize the forecast. This approach allows the OR backend to reconcile the large pipeline inventory against the demand target while protecting against further lead-time instability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability documented: P1 lead_time=3, P3 lead_time=1. Potential lost shipment: Period 2 order (132 units) not arrived after 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The 'chips(Regular)' inventory is currently 0 after demand exceeded stock in Period 7. Historically, demand has been volatile, ranging from 35 to 145, with an average of approximately 95.9 over the first 7 periods. Lead time is highly unpredictable: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and the order from P2 (132 units) is now 6 periods old and likely lost. The pipeline currently consists of orders from P5 (125), P6 (41), and P7 (104), totaling 270 units, plus an unknown status for the P2 order which the game logic likely considers in-transit (Total in-transit reported as 402 includes the missing 132 units). Because of the lead time variance (avg ~2) and the high risk of stockouts shown in Period 7, I will use a 5-period recent average for demand to capture recent lower trends while maintaining a buffer. I set L to 2 (promised) but will rely on the OR engine's service level logic to handle the variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: P2 order (132 units) is confirmed lost/severely delayed (6 periods elapsed). Total pipeline of 402 effectively includes 132 units of dead inventory; the OR engine must order enough to cover current stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $331.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, on-hand inventory is 117 units. Analysis of arrivals shows that the Period 2 order (132 units) is definitely lost or severely delayed (7 periods elapsed). The 'In-transit' figure of 173 units likely consists of the Period 6 (41 units) and Period 8 (0 units ordered, so this is confusing) orders, but looking at game history, we have historical orders from P6 (41) and P7 arrived in P8. Wait, P7 (104) arrived in P8. P5 (125) arrived in P8. P6 (41) is still missing along with P2 (132). Total in-transit 173 = 132 (P2) + 41 (P6). Since P2 is lost and P6 is likely delayed/lost, the 'pipeline' used by the OR engine is inflated by 173 units of 'ghost' inventory. To force an order, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. Mean demand is ~97 units. With lead time L=2, base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods (~291 units). Since the backend subtracts 173 (pipeline) from its calculation, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that offsets this ghost inventory. Setting mu_hat to 464 (target 291 + ghost 173) to ensure the OR engine places an order to replenish stock. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the high variance (1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: P2 (132) and P6 (41) orders confirmed as lost or severely delayed (7 and 3 periods elapsed respectively). Pipeline inventory is currently overstated by 173 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we continue to see significant lead time instability and lost shipments. The orders from Period 2 (132 units) and Period 6 (41 units) are now 8 and 4 periods overdue respectively, totaling 173 units of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline that the OR engine will wrongly subtract from its order calculation. Current on-hand is low (16), and the valid pipeline consists of the Period 9 order (171). To compensate for the 173 lost units and the high target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 80%), I am setting an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: Average demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) is 91.2. Base stock for (L+1=3) periods would be ~273. However, with 173 units lost and 171 arrived/valid in-transit, the OR engine sees 16 (on-hand) + 171 (valid) + 173 (dead) = 360 units. To trigger a necessary replenishment order of approximately 100-150 units to hedge against further delays and the depletion of the 16 remaining units, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 500 units and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high variance in both demand and lead times.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Confirmation that P2 (132 units) and P6 (41 units) are definitively lost/stagnant (8 and 4 periods lapsed). Effective pipeline is only 171 units (P9 order).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11, currently stocked out (Ending Inventory = 0). Demand is stable but slightly increasing, with Period 10 demand at 121. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 535) is heavily contaminated by lost shipments. Analysis of history confirms: P2 (132 units) and P6 (41 units) are lost (9 and 5 periods elapsed). Recent arrivals show highly variable lead times: P1(3), P3(1), P5(3), P7(1). I will treat the effective lead time as the average of these observed outcomes (L=2). To compensate for the 173 lost units (P2+P6) and the current stockout, I'll use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a recent demand average of ~112 units/period (last 5 periods). For a 2-period lead time, the system needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). Target stock = 112 * 3 = 336. Since in-transit (535) includes 173 lost units, effective in-transit = 362. To trigger an order despite the high visible in-transit, I set mu_hat to 650, which shifts the base stock target high enough to account for the lost inventory that the OR backend still thinks is arriving.

Carry-over insight: P2(132) and P6(41) orders (total 173 units) are definitively lost. Reported in-transit (535) significantly overstates actual future arrivals (362).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 682 units, but historical tracking reveals a significant discrepancy. We have confirmed through 'Carry-over Insights' that orders from Period 2 (132 units) and Period 6 (41 units) are definitively lost (10 and 6 periods since ordering, respectively). This results in 173 units of 'ghost inventory' that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive. Current actual pipeline consists of orders from P9 (171), P10 (191), and P11 (147), totaling 509 units. Since on-hand is 0 and demand is steady (averaging ~105 units/period), the OR backend needs to place a substantial order to cover the shortfall created by the lost shipments. To force the OR engine to order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: Predicted base stock for L=2 (Review+Lead = 3 periods) at a target service level of 80% (Profit 4, Holding 1) with mean demand ~105 and std ~30 is approx 315 + 0.84 * sqrt(3)*30 \u2248 358. To offset the 173 units of lost inventory that the OR engine thinks is coming, I will set mu_hat (the expected demand over Review + Lead time) to its standard value of 315 + 173 = 488. This 'tricks' the backend into ignoring the lost units. Sigma_hat is kept at default.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Pipeline inflation remains at 173 units (P2=132, P6=41 lost). Actual effective pipeline is 509 units vs 682 reported. No new arrivals since Period 8 confirm continued lead-time volatility/delays.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, two shipments arrived (P9 and P10 orders), totaling 362 units. This confirms that the P2 (132 units) and P6 (41 units) orders are definitively lost, as they are now 11 and 7 periods past their order dates respectively. The reported In-transit of 320 units consists of the P11 order (147 units) and the P12 order (0 units, but internal state might differ) plus the 173 units of 'ghost' inventory from P2 and P6. Thus, the effective pipeline is only 147 units. Current on-hand is 255 units. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages ~100 units. To compensate for the 173-unit pipeline inflation and ensure the OR backend orders enough to maintain service levels, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to reflect the recent arrival from P10. Mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * Mean_Demand + Lost_Units = (1+2)*100 + 173 = 473. This encourages the engine to place an order that treats the lost 173 units as immediate need. Sigma_hat is based on the recent 5-period volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $395.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe on-hand inventory of 125 units and a reported in-transit of 320 units. However, consistent history (Carry-over insights Period 7-12) shows that orders from Period 2 (132 units) and Period 6 (41 units) are definitively lost, totaling 173 units of 'ghost' inventory. The reported in-transit of 320 units effectively only contains the order from Period 11 (147 units), as 320 - 173 = 147. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I must set mu_hat to a value that compensates for this 173-unit gap. Current average demand is approximately 104 units per period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the demand over the decision horizon (L+1) is roughly 312 units. To offset the 173 ghost units and ensure the base stock calculation targets the correct physical amount, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target mu_hat as: Expected Demand (312) + Ghost Inventory Offset (173) = 485. This ensures the OR engine places an order sufficient to cover the actual physical need despite the backend's reliance on the flawed 'in-transit' figure. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed ghost inventory of 173 units (P2 and P6) continues to inflate reported pipeline; mu_hat must be adjusted upward until these units are manually cleared or aging out of the system's logic.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 182 units. The reported in-transit is 258 units, which consists of the order from Period 14 (85 units) and the persistent 'ghost' inventory of 173 units (P2: 132, P6: 41) that we have identified as lost. The OR engine subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from the 'base_stock' to determine the order quantity. Since the backend sees 258 units in transit but only 85 are actually coming, it will under-order by 173 units. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Average demand over the last 14 periods is roughly 100 units. With a lead time L=2 (Review + Lead = 3), the required base lead-time demand is 300 units. I add the 173-unit deficit to this (300 + 173 = 473) to force the OR backend to place an order that accounts for the lost shipments. I set sigma_hat to explicit based on the observed demand standard deviation (~25) across 3 periods (sqrt(3)*25 \u2248 44).

Daily Reward (R_t): $283.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 status analysis: On-hand inventory is 89. Reported in-transit is 329. This in-transit total includes 173 units of 'ghost inventory' from Period 2 (132 units) and Period 6 (41 units) which are now 14 and 10 periods overdue respectively and are considered lost. The actual effective pipeline is 156 units (85 ordered P14, 71 ordered P15). Demand over the last 15 periods averages 98.6 units, while recent demand (last 3-5 periods) remains stable around 90-100 units. To compensate for the 173-unit shortfall in the OR's perception of pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating target base stock for L=2: (1+L)*E[D] + safety_stock \u2248 3*100 + 50 = 350. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (329) from base_stock, I need to raise mu_hat so that (base_stock - 329) = desired_order. To ensure a replenishment order of approximately 100 units is triggered to maintain service levels despite the ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 500.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system reports On-hand: 35 and In-transit (Pipeline): 454. However, historical evidence from Carry-over Insights and Game History confirms that orders from Period 2 (132 units) and Period 6 (41 units) are lost/ghost inventory (now 15 and 11 periods overdue respectively). This total of 173 'ghost' units inflates the reported pipeline, leading the OR engine to under-order. To compensate, I must adjust mu_hat upward. The base demand (L+1 periods) where L=2 is 3 * ~98 (average) = 294. Adding the 173 lost units to this target yields an explicit mu_hat of 467. Setting L=2 explicitly maintains the promised lead time framework. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) which is slightly higher than the historical standard deviation (~30) multiplied by sqrt(L+1) to provide additional safety stock buffer against the observed lead-time volatility (range of 1 to 3 periods).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 153 units. Reported in-transit is 290 units, comprised of orders from P15 (71 units) and P17 (46 units), plus the long-standing lost/ghost inventory of 173 units (P2=132, P6=41). Because the OR engine uses the 'reported' pipeline of 290 to subtract from its target base stock, it will under-order by 173 units. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target base stock by 173 units. The 5-period average demand is ~82.6 units. With a lead time of 2, the standard base stock calculation (1+L)*demand would be 3 * 82.6 = 247.8. Adding the 173 'ghost' units, the adjusted mu_hat is 420.8. I'll use 421 for mu_hat. L remains at the default (2) as recent arrivals (P14, P16) had lead times of 3 and 1, averaging out to the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Ghost inventory remains at 173 units (P2=132, P6=41). Average demand over the last 10 periods remains stable at approx 93 units/period (range 54-130). Lead time volatility persists (range 1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $612.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory following a minor stockout in Period 18 (demand 157 vs starting on-hand 153). The reported in-transit is 306 units, but as established in history (Periods 7-18), 173 of these units (P2 order of 132 and P6 order of 41) are definitively lost/stagnant 'ghost inventory'. The actual effective pipeline is only 133 units (P15 order of 71, P17 order of 46, P18 order of 16). Demand has remained relatively stable; the last 10 periods (P9-P18) show an average demand of 102 units per period. The actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods. To force the OR backend's capped base-stock policy (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) to account for the -173 unit discrepancy in the pipeline and current stockout, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target mu_hat as (1 + promised_L)*mean_demand + lost_inventory. (1+2)*102 + 173 = 479. This ensures the engine places an order that covers the 2-period lead time demand plus the current period's demand, while offsetting the 'ghost' units it incorrectly thinks are coming.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 0 units on-hand and 515 units in-transit. However, historical tracking (documented in carry-over insights since Period 7) confirms that orders from Period 2 (132 units) and Period 6 (41 units) are lost, totaling 173 units of 'ghost inventory'. Consequently, the effective pipeline is only 342 units. Recent demand has surged, with the last two periods showing 157 and 150 units (well above the long-term average of ~93). This spike has resulted in a stockout at the start of Period 20. To compensate for the 173-unit inflation in the pipeline inventory and the recent demand shift, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 450. This value is derived from (1 + L) * expected_demand. Given a promised lead time (L) of 2, (1+2)=3 periods of coverage. I estimate demand at 95 units/period (reflecting the stable mean but acknowledging recent spikes), which gives 285 units, plus the 173 unit ghost-adjustment = 458. Setting mu_hat to 450 will force the OR engine to order enough to clear the deficit created by the ghost units while maintaining a service level for the current demand regime. L is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (range 1-3).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as on-hand stock is 0 and we are currently stocking out. The reported in-transit of 515 units is severely inflated by 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P2 and P6 totaling 173 units), meaning the effective pipeline is only 342 units. Furthermore, no arrivals occurred in Periods 18-20, indicating that orders from P15 (71), P17 (46), P18 (16), and P19 (209) are likely experiencing lead-time volatility (averaging ~3 periods based on previous delays). To compensate for the 173-unit pipeline deficit and the current stockout, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 453. This is calculated as (1+L) * mean_demand + ghost_inventory = (1+3)*70 + 173 (rounding for safety). Demand has been relatively stable around 70-130, but P18-P19 saw a spike (~150). I will use L=3 to reflect the high observed lead times and set sigma_hat to explicit 120 to account for demand and lead-time variability. Using explicit parameters is necessary because the OR engine's internal 'in-transit' logic is blind to the 173-unit loss, which would otherwise result in under-ordering.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) following a demand spike in Period 21 (190 units). The reported in-transit inventory of 554 units is heavily distorted by 173 units of 'ghost inventory' (P2 132 units, P6 41 units) which are confirmed lost. Additionally, orders from P18 (16), P19 (209), and P21 (39) are pending. Based on the history, actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting that the P19 order is likely to arrive in P22 or P23. To compensate for the 173 units of lost pipeline that the OR backend still counts as available, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P12-P21) is approximately 109 units. With an estimated lead time of 2, the required coverage for (L+1) periods is 327 units. Adding the 173 lost units to this target results in an explicit mu_hat of 500. This forces the OR backend to place an order that accounts for the phantom stock it believes is coming. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture the increased volatility seen in the last two periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, the system reports on-hand: 0 and in-transit: 585. However, history and carry-over insights confirm that 173 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are lost/ghost inventory. Furthermore, there have been no arrivals since Period 17, and the shipments from P15 (71 units), P17 (46 units), P18 (16 units), and P19 (209 units) are now delayed or overdue relative to the promised lead time of 2. Specifically, the P15 order is 8 periods old, suggesting it too may be lost. Effective pipeline is likely only ~337 units (P19, P21, P22) if we assume P15, P17, and P18 are also compromised. Demand has shown extreme volatility recently (P20: 20 vs P21: 190), but the 10-period average remains near 95. To force the OR engine to overcome the stockout caused by 'ghost' in-transit units and high demand variance, I will set L to 3 (reflecting the actual experienced delays) and use an explicit mu_hat. This mu_hat is calculated as (1 + 3) * 115 = 460. By setting mu_hat higher than the recent average, we compensate for the ~173+ units of 'phantom' pipeline that the engine assumes will arrive but never will, ensuring a positive order is generated despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Potential loss of orders from P15 (71), P17 (46), and P18 (16) due to no arrivals for 6 consecutive periods. Total suspected ghost inventory in pipeline may now be as high as 306 units (173 confirmed + 133 suspected).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports a pipeline (in-transit) of 515 units, but our stock is at 0 and we are facing stockouts. Analysis of history confirms a massive amount of 'ghost inventory' - orders that have likely been lost or are indefinitely delayed. Specifically, orders from P2 (132), P6 (41), P15 (71), P17 (46), P18 (16), and P19 (209) are severely overdue. While P21 and P22 arrived quickly (LT 2 and 1), the earlier bulky orders haven't arrived. Effectively, of the 515 units in-transit, 515 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are missing/delayed beyond 5+ periods. Since the OR engine subtracts in-transit from the base stock to calculate the order, we must inflate mu_hat to 'force' an order that bypasses this ghost pipeline. Recent demand average (last 10 periods) is ~104 units. With L=2, base stock would normally be ~312. Since reported pipeline (515) is higher than the required base stock, the engine will order 0 unless we intervene. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the ~515 ghost units + desired base stock (~312) to ensure a substantial order is placed to break the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed massive pipeline inflation: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19 (total 515 units) are effectively lost/stagnant. Actual physical pipeline is likely 0 as of P24 start.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing extreme lead-time volatility and significant lost shipments. As of Period 25, the reported 'In-transit' of 811 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory' (orders that are lost or severely delayed and likely will never arrive). Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 515 units) haven't arrived long past the promised lead time of 2. The order from P24 (296 units) is the only credible component of the pipeline. Since the backend's 'capped policy' subtracts the reported pipeline (811) from the base stock, it will result in an order of 0 unless parameters are adjusted to offset this inflation. I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the expected demand for the next (L+1) periods (approx 3 * 105 = 315) PLUS the ghost inventory of 515. This 'tricks' the OR engine into placing a non-zero order to cover the current stockout despite the false pipeline data. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (actual lead times range from 1 to 3).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed massive pipeline inflation: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19 (total 515 units) are effectively lost/stagnant. Internal tracking suggests actual physical pipeline is only the P24 order (296 units).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a critical stockout state (on-hand: 0). The primary challenge is a massive inflation of the 'In-transit' figure (914 units), which includes 515 units confirmed as lost or stagnant (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19). The real pipeline consists only of orders from Period 24 (296) and Period 25 (103), totaling 399 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the total reported pipeline (914) from the base_stock calculation, it will refuse to order unless we artificially inflate the 'mu_hat' parameter to offset the 515-unit 'ghost' inventory. Demand remains volatile, but averaging approximately 100 units per period. With a 2-period promised lead time (L=2), the target coverage is (L+1) = 3 periods, roughly 300 units. To force the OR backend to place an order that covers future demand despite the 515 units of dead pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for 3 periods of demand PLUS the 515 unit offset (approx 300 + 515 = 815).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed massive pipeline inflation: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19 (total 515 units) are effectively lost/stagnant. Internal tracking suggests actual physical pipeline is 399 units (P24, P25 orders).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 914 units, but historical analysis confirms a massive accumulation of 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments. Based on P24-P26 history: orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 515 units) are effectively lost or permanently stagnant. These units are being counted in 'In-transit' by the OR engine but will never arrive. Additionally, the P20 order seems to have been skipped (ordered=0), and orders after P22 have not yet arrived. The actual physical pipeline consists only of orders from P24 (296 units) and P25 (103 units), totaling 399 units. Because the backend subtracts the full 914 reported pipeline units from its base stock calculation, it will likely order 0 units and perpetuate the stockout. To force an order and bridge the 515-unit gap, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value calculated as: (base_stock for 3 periods of demand) + (ghost inventory). Average demand is ~100 units/period. For L=2, base stock needs to cover 3 periods (~300 units). Adding the 515 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 815. This allows the OR engine to 'see' the demand and the lost inventory simultaneously, resulting in a net order that replenishes stock.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory confirmed at 515 units (P2: 132, P6: 41, P15: 71, P17: 46, P18: 16, P19: 209). Reported in-transit (914) overstates the physical pipeline (399) by this amount.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for chips(Regular) remains critical due to 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) that inflate the pipeline seen by the OR backend. As of Period 28, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 914 units reported in-transit. However, based on history, 515 units are definitively lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The only 'real' pipeline units are from P24 (296) and P25 (103), totaling 399 units. This discrepancy (515 units) causes the OR backend to under-order because it believes the pipeline is sufficient. To compensate for this 515-unit deficit and prevent continued stockouts, I will set an explicit mu_hat. The average demand is ~100 units/period. With a Lead Time (L) of 2, the system looks at (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~300 units). To force an order that bypasses the ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - reported_pipeline' results in a positive order. Given reported_pipeline=914 and expected real need for ~300 units, mu_hat must be set significantly higher to 'cancel out' the 515 ghost units. Base Stock Target = (Real Need 300) + (Ghost 515) = 815. I will set mu_hat to 815 to ensure the pipeline-adjusted order accounts for the physical reality of the stockout.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical stockout state (on-hand: 0). Reported in-transit units (914) are heavily inflated by 'ghost' orders that have not arrived for many periods (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19). These ghost units total 515 units. The actual physical pipeline consists of orders from Period 24 (296 units) and Period 25 (103 units), totaling 399 units. Both of these are now within the 3nd-4th period since ordering, which is consistent with the upper end of the observed lead-time range (1-3 periods). Because the OR engine subtracts the full (inflated) in-transit amount of 914 from the target base stock, it will fail to place necessary orders. To counteract this 'ghost' pipeline of 515 units, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock should cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~100 units/period) PLUS the 515 units of ghost inventory to force the OR backend to actually order. Target base stock calculation: (3 * 100) + 515 = 815. Set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat to 815. Sigma is set based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 29, the ghost inventory confirmed since P27 (515 units) still hasn't arrived. No arrivals for 5 consecutive periods (P24-P28). Actual physical pipeline remains only P24 (296) and P25 (103).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe crisis. There has been zero arrival for the last 6 periods (P24-P29). The reported in-transit inventory of 914 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' orders (lost or stuck shipments). Specifically, P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 are definitively lost (515 units). Furthermore, recent orders P24 (296 units) and P25 (103 units) are significantly past their promised lead time of 2. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and the system is stocking out. To force the OR backend to place a new order despite the massive (but fake) pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the reported pipeline. Total reported in-transit is 914. I will set mu_hat to 1250 (covering approximately 13 periods of average demand of 95) to trigger a replenishment. I will use 'explicit' for L to acknowledge the high delay, setting it to 6 to reflect the current period-of-silence.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 30, zero units have arrived for 6 consecutive periods. Reported pipeline (914) is 100% unreliable; effective pipeline is now estimated at 0 until any arrival is confirmed.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is experiencing a catastrophic collapse in reliability. There have been zero arrivals for 7 consecutive periods (P24-P30). As of Period 31, the reported in-transit inventory is 1184 units, but based on historical analysis, at least 515 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are definitively lost/stagnant. Furthermore, recent orders from P24 (296 units) and P25 (103 units) are now well beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods, suggesting they may also be lost or severely delayed. The on-hand inventory has been at 0 for 7 periods, causing total stockouts. Because the OR backend subtracts the reported pipeline (1184) from the base stock, it will not place NEW orders unless the base stock parameter (mu_hat) is set high enough to overcome this massive 'ghost' pipeline. To force the system to order despite the inflated in-transit numbers, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the expected demand for the lead time plus the known ghost inventory (approx 1200+ units), effectively bypassing the pipeline deduction to trigger replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Zero arrivals for 7 consecutive periods (P24-P30). Total ghost inventory in reported pipeline (1184) is likely 100% of the value; effective physical pipeline is estimated at 0. mu_hat must be set to explicitly override the pipeline deduction.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics system is in a state of catastrophic failure. Average demand over the last 10 periods remains approx 62 units/period, but zero units have arrived for 8 consecutive periods (since P23), leading to a total stockout. The reported in-transit of 1576 units is entirely 'ghost inventory' (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, P31 are all significantly overdue). Since the OR backend subtracts this 1576 from its order calculation, it will never place an order. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value (1576 + (1+2)*100 = 1876) to force the OR engine to place a meaningful order despite the inflated pipeline, while using L=2 (promised) to keep the cap calculation reasonable. This targets a 'physical' base stock of approx 300 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Systemic delivery failure confirmed. Total ghost inventory now 1576 units (all orders since P24 are now late, plus historical losses from P2-P19). Effective physical pipeline is 0. mu_hat must be set to override total pipeline deduction until arrivals resume.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, a delivery of 392 units (ordered in P31) finally arrived after a 7-period drought of any arrivals. However, this arrival highlights a massive discrepancy: nearly all previously 'In-transit' units are ghost inventory. The current 'In-transit' count is 1545. Subtracting known recent orders (P30: 270, P32: 361) and assuming P24 (296) and P25 (103) are still theoretically possible but highly suspect, we see roughly 515 confirmed ghost units from periods 2-19 plus potentially another 399 from P24-25. The prompt's internal logic for orders (min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)) will fail to order if the pipeline is significantly inflated by these lost units. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the expected demand for the (L+1) period plus a massive buffer to force the OR engine to ignore the 1545 ghost units. Average demand is ~93. With L=2, (L+1)=3. 3 * 93 = 279. To bypass a 1545 unit deduction, I must set mu_hat high enough such that (mu_hat - 1545) still results in a healthy order. I will aim for a functional base stock that targets current safety levels despite the pipeline noise.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: First arrival in 8 periods (392 units from P31). Confirms that while the supply line is not completely dead, the reported 1545 units in-transit are primarily ghost inventory from P2-P30. Effective physical pipeline is likely only the P32 order (361) and potentially the P30 order (270).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, a second consecutive arrival (361 units from P32) was received, confirming that the supply chain has resumed function after a long outage, albeit with high volatility. Current on-hand inventory is 677. The reported 'In-transit' of 1184 units is heavily contaminated by 'ghost inventory' from periods P2-P30 (estimated at approximately 1184 units, meaning the effective physical pipeline is close to 0). Demand has dropped significantly over the last 5 periods (mean ~48), likely a post-stockout cooling or seasonal shift. We must avoid ordering more until the massive on-hand stock and the ghost inventory reconcile. I will set mu_hat conservatively using the recent low-demand regime (N=5) and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the recent 1-period arrivals while acknowledging historical variance. No new order is desired this period as current on-hand covers ~14 periods of recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Supply resumed at P32/P33 with lead_time=1. Ghost inventory from P2-P30 (approx 1184 units) still persists in the system's in-transit calculation. Recent demand regime (P29-P33) has shifted downward to an average of 48.4 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-532.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the inventory position for chips(Regular) is high with 648 units on-hand. Physical supply resumed in Periods 32 and 33 with a lead time of 1, but the system still reports 1184 units in-transit, which are almost entirely 'ghost inventory' from historical losses (Periods 2 to 30). Demand has shifted significantly downward: the average demand from Period 5 to 25 was ~97 units, while the average over the last 6 periods (P29-P34) is only 48.5 units. With 648 units on-hand and current demand levels, we have over 13 periods of supply. The OR backend's capped policy will naturally prevent ordering because the (base_stock - pipeline) calculation will be deeply negative due to the ghost inventory. To ensure no unnecessary orders are placed while we burn through this excess, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the lower demand regime. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift: Average demand decreased from ~97 to 48.5 units/period starting Period 29. Ghost inventory persists at 1184 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted recently. From Period 29 through Period 35, demand dropped to an average of approximately 65 units per period (23, 55, 138, 49, 27, 29, 164), though Period 35 shows a sharp rebound. Using a recent_N (N=7) approach captures this shift while acknowledging the recent spike. Current on-hand inventory is 484 units, which is high relative to the recent demand average. The reported in-transit (1184) remains dominated by 'ghost inventory' (historical lost orders from P2-P30, totaling approx 1013 units if we subtract P31 and P32 arrivals which already landed). However, since on-hand (484) is sufficient to cover approximately 7 periods of average demand, and recent lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods, no new order is required. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and 'calculate' for L to acknowledge the recent lead time variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an on-hand inventory of 373 units and a reported in-transit (pipeline) of 1184 units. However, consistent history from Periods 30-36 confirms that approximately 1184 units are 'ghost inventory' from historical orders (P2-P30) that never arrived. The effective physical pipeline is actually 0. Recent demand (P29-P36) shows two distinct phases: a low period (avg ~48) followed by a sharp spike (P35: 164, P36: 111). Given the current on-hand of 373 and the risk of holding costs ($1/unit) versus the high profit ($4/unit), I will set mu_hat to cover the recent higher demand (last 3 periods average: ~101) for the lead time plus review period (1+2=3 periods). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1184 ghost units as available supply and ordering nothing, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 1487 (1184 ghost + 303 target stock), which forces an order of roughly 303 units. Sigma_hat is calculated for the recent high-volatility regime (N=5).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand volatility has increased (P35: 164, P36: 111) compared to the P29-P34 lull. Ghost inventory remains constant at 1184 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to struggle with 'ghost inventory'. There are 1,184 units (from P2-P30) that have never arrived and are likely lost, yet they remain in the 'In-transit' count (currently 1,202). This means the OR backend sees a massive pipeline and will not order unless mu_hat is set to override the pipeline deduction. On-hand inventory is 263. Demand has returned to a higher range (P35: 164, P36: 111, P37: 110), averaging 128 over the last 3 periods. To ensure a new order is placed despite the ghost pipeline, mu_hat must be set to (On-hand + Target Order). A target of covering 3 periods of demand (~385 units) minus current hand (~263) suggests an order of ~122. Thus, mu_hat is set to 400 (explicit) to force the backend to reconcile the pipeline and place a replenishment order. L is kept at 2 (promised) as recent actuals varied between 1 and 3.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1202 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms massive ghost inventory. Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P30 (totaling ~1184 units) have not arrived and are considered lost or permanently stalled. Real arrivals resumed at Period 32 (from P31 and P32 orders) with a lead time of 1 period. Demand has recovered from a Periodic 29-34 lull (avg ~48) to a more normal level (avg ~114 over the last 4 periods). With 162 units on-hand and an effective pipeline near 0 (the only non-ghost order is the P37 order of 18 units), the OR engine would naturally stop ordering because it thinks 1202 units are coming. To force the engine to maintain stock, I must set mu_hat to 'explicit' to override the pipeline deduction. I'll target a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1=3) at the recent average demand of 110 units plus a safety buffer, while adding the 1184 ghost units to the value so the subtraction (Base Stock - Pipeline) results in a meaningful order. Calculation: (110 * 3) + Z*sigma + 1184 ghost units. Setting mu_hat to 1600 and sigma_hat to 100 ensures the engine places an order to bridge the gap between physical reality and reported figures.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant pipeline inflation from historical 'ghost inventory' that never arrived. Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19 (totaling 515 units) and likely the bulk of orders between P24-P30 (approx 669 units) have not materialized, leading to a reported in-transit of 1523 units while physical on-hand is low (42). Recent demand has returned to a higher regime after a lull in P29-P34; the average demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is approximately 121 units. With a promised lead time of 2, the current on-hand (42) is insufficient to cover the next period's expected demand. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the massive (but fake) pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate the necessary base stock to cover 3 periods (L+1) at approximately 121 * 3 = 363 units plus a safety buffer. However, because the backend subtracts the pipeline (1523) from the base stock, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds 1523 + desired order quantity. I am targeting an order of approximately 300-400 units to restore physical inventory. Setting mu_hat to 1950 and L to 2 (promised) creates a base stock much larger than the inflated pipeline, triggering the necessary replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory in pipeline now estimated at approximately 1184 units (confirmed P2-P30 losses). mu_hat must remain explicitly inflated (value > 1500) to override pipeline deduction and maintain physical stock.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from extreme pipeline inflation due to 'ghost inventory'. Historical analysis confirms 1,184 units from Periods 2-30 are lost or permanently stalled, but still appear in the 'In-transit' count (1,624 total). The effective physical pipeline consists only of the Period 40 order (422 units). To prevent the OR engine from zeroing out orders due to this ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set to an explicit value that exceeds the inflated pipeline. Current on-hand is 244 units. Demand has rebounded from a mid-game lull and averaged 110.1 units over the last 10 periods. With a lead time of 1-2 periods, we need to maintain approx 330-440 units of inventory. Setting mu_hat to 2000 ensures the order calculation (target - (1624 reported pipeline)) still results in a positive order to maintain safety stock and cover the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed: 1,184 units from Periods 2-30 are permanently lost but remain in the system's in-transit calculation. Effective physical pipeline is only the Period 40 order (422 units). Demand has stabilized at a higher level (avg 112 units/period) over the last 5 periods compared to the Period 29-34 low.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant issue with 'ghost inventory'. A total of 1,184 units (from orders placed in Periods 2-30) are permanently lost but remain in the 'In-transit' figure, which is currently reported as 1,822. The effective physical pipeline consists only of the orders from Period 40 (422 units) and Period 41 (198 units), totaling 620 units. To prevent the OR engine from zeroing out orders due to this inflated pipeline, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that approximates the target base stock plus the ghost inventory. Demand has stabilized at a higher level (averaging 112 units/period over the last 5 periods). A 3-period horizon (L+1) requires approximately 336 units. Adding the 1,184 ghost units results in a target of roughly 1,520. I will set mu_hat to 1,600 to ensure safety stock is maintained and the system actually places orders to meet real demand. Lead time remains volatile but recently shows a 1-period actual turnaround; 'default' (2) is a safe conservative setting for the calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $417.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1822 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms 1184 units (from P2-P30) are permanently lost. Additionally, orders from P40 (422 units), P41 (198 units), and P42 (0 units) are currently in the valid physical pipeline. Thus, effective pipeline = (1822 - 1184) = 638 units. Demand has stabilized at higher levels recently; the last 5 periods (P38-P42) average 110.6 units/period. With on-hand at 31 and promised lead time of 2, the inventory position covers roughly 6 periods of demand (669 units), which is close to our target. To prevent the OR engine from stopping orders due to the 1184 units of ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set as an explicit override. Calculation: target base stock (approx 4 periods of demand @ 110/period) + ghost inventory = 440 + 1184 = 1624. Setting mu_hat to 1650 to ensure physical orders continue to arrive and mitigate stockout risk while lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 1184 units. Current demand regime (P38-P42) is stable at ~111 units/period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44, the inventory situation is stabilized but remains affected by systemic data noise. On-hand inventory is healthy at 381 units. The reported in-transit figure of 1400 units is heavily inflated by 1184 units of ghost inventory (confirmed losses from P2-P30). Subtracting this ghost inventory gives an effective pipeline of 216 units (comprised of the P41 order of 198 units and other smaller residual units). Total demand has stabilized in the current regime (P38-P43) at an average of approximately 107.5 units per period. The lead time remains volatile, with the most recent arrival (P40 order) taking 3 periods, while others take 1. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to maintain service levels despite the 1184-unit 'inflation' in the pipeline deduction, I must explicitly set mu_hat to a value that overrides this deduction. Target base stock = (Effective Pipeline + On-hand) + Safety Buffer \u2248 (216 + 381) + 300 = 897. To trigger an order that maintains this level while the system subtracts 1400, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1400 + 107.5 * 3. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1750 and L to 3 to account for the most recent observed lead time.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 1,184 units of 'ghost inventory' from Periods 2-30 that are permanently lost but remain in the backend's in-transit calculation (1,202 total in-transit). Physical on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 474 units, and recent arrivals from P40 and P41 (lead times of 3 periods) have replenished the stock. Demand over the last 7 periods (P38-P44) has been stable, averaging 104.3 units. To prevent the OR engine from halting orders due to the inflated pipeline, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that offsets the ghost inventory while accounting for the target base stock. A base stock target for 3 periods (L+1) at ~105 units/period is roughly 315 units plus a safety buffer. Setting mu_hat to 1550 ensures that 'mu_hat - ghost_inventory' (1550 - 1184 = 366) results in an effective base stock that maintains physical availability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-74.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46, we have 394 units on hand. The reported in-transit quantity is 1202 units, but based on historical tracking (Carry-over insights), 1184 of these units are 'ghost inventory' from periods 2-30 that are permanently lost but still included in the system's pipeline calculation. Therefore, the effective physical pipeline is actually 18 units (the order from Period 37 which is now 9 periods overdue and likely also lost, though small). Essentially, we have ~394 units to cover all future demand until the end of the game at Period 50. Average demand over the most recent stable regime (P38-P45) is approximately 101 units per period. With 5 periods remaining (46, 47, 48, 49, 50), total expected demand is ~505 units. Since our actual inventory (394) is less than the expected remaining demand (505) and the reported pipeline is false, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force the OR engine to place an order. Setting mu_hat to 1600 overrides the 1184 ghost units and ensures a buffer for the final periods, targeting an arrival by Period 48/49. L is set to 'calculate' to use the average observed lead time for the base case logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive pipeline inflation due to 1,184 units of 'ghost inventory' from Periods 2-30 that are permanently lost but remain in the system's in-transit calculation. Currently, reported In-transit is 1,234, but 1,184 of those units will never arrive, meaning the actual physical pipeline is only 50 units (likely the Period 46 order of 32 units plus small residuals). To prevent the OR engine from skipping orders due to this false inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Demand over the last 10 periods (P37-P46) has stabilized at an average of 100.1 units/period. The game ends in 3 periods (P50). With 314 units on hand and 3 periods left, our current stock covers approximately 3 periods of demand at the 100 units/period rate. However, to ensure we don't stock out in the final stretch while accounting for the ~1,184 units of ghost inventory the OR engine will subtract, I set mu_hat to 1500 (100 avg demand * (2+1) periods + 1200 cushion to offset ghost inventory). Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals show volatility (1-3 periods).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to report a pipeline (in-transit) of 1234 units, but significant carry-over evidence confirms that 1184 units from Periods 2-30 are lost ('ghost inventory'). The actual physical pipeline consists only of the Period 46 order (32 units). Demand has stabilized after the Period 29-34 lull; the average demand over the last 10 periods (P38-P47) is 99 units/period. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously subtracting the 1184 lost units from its order calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock level that covers 3 periods (L=2 + review) of demand (~300 units) plus a safety buffer, and then add the 1184 units of ghost inventory to 'offset' the backend's deduction. Calculating: Target physical base stock ~400 + 1184 offset \u2248 1584. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile history and mu_hat to an explicit value to ensure replenishment occurs despite the inflated pipeline.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 49, the system reports 1397 units in-transit. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, at least 1184 units (from P2-P30) are confirmed ghost inventory/lost shipments that still clutter the pipeline calculation. Therefore, the effective physical pipeline is only 1397 - 1184 = 213 units, which matches the sum of the Period 46 order (32 units) and the Period 48 order (163 units) plus some residual variance. Demand has stabilized over the last 10 periods (P39-P48) with an average of approximately 104 units, compared to the earlier lull. Lead times continue to be volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend places an order that covers physical needs despite the inflated reported pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1500. This compensates for the 1184 ghost units and targets a safety stock based on a (1+L) requirement of approximately 312 units (104 * 3 periods). Setting mu_hat to 1500 effectively signals to the backend that it needs to maintain a much higher inventory level than the 'in-transit' data suggests.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are at the final decision point. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' of 1184 units (from P2-P30) that persists in the reported in-transit calculation (1397 units total), while the actual physical pipeline consists only of orders from P46 (32 units) and P48 (163 units), totaling 195 units. Current on-hand inventory is low (29 units). The demand regime has stabilized following the P29-P34 dip, with the last 10 periods (P40-P49) averaging 105.6 units/period. Historically, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure we don't stock out due to the OR engine deducting the ghost inventory from the ordering logic, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the ghost inventory + (L+1)*expected_demand. This forces the base stock calculation to account for the units that will never arrive. Given this is the final period, the goal is to cover the immediate demand risk and maximize service level before the game ends.
