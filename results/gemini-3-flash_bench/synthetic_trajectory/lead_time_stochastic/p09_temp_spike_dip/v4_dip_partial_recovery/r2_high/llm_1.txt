This means an order placed now (P1) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be available for sale in Period 4. To maximize reward, I need to cover demand for Period 1 (already partially elapsed or about to resolve), Period 2, and Period 3 until this replenishment arrives. Total periods to cover = L+1 = 3. Historical data provided shows a mean demand of approximately 96 units over the first 5 periods (82, 89, 65, 106, 136). However, there is an upward trend toward the end. Given the product is 'chips(Regular)', demand is generally stable but subject to snacking occasions. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and I have 0 units in-transit, I must order enough to cover the immediate demand and build a buffer. Calculating a conservative requirement: 3 periods * ~100 units/period = 300 units. I will order 300 units to establish the pipeline.",

Specifically, orders from P2 (100 units) and P6 (110 units) are confirmed/likely lost based on historical gaps. This means only 310 units of the 520 in-transit are reliable. Lead time is highly variable (1-3 periods). Current on-hand is low (36). Given the L=2/3 volatility, I need to cover demand for the current period plus the lead time (approx 3-4 periods of demand). 100 (P15) + 100 (P16) + 100 (P17) + 100 (P18) = 400.

The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable, characterized by a significant number of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, and P37). Analysis of the pipeline shows that the order from P41 (100 units) is now 3 periods old and the order from P42 (100 units) is 2 periods old; given the historical failure rate, there is a high probability these will not arrive. Only the P40 order arrived recently (P43) with a lead time of 3. To maintain a service level that captures the ~80 unit/period demand while accounting for a >50% shipment failure rate, I will continue ordering 100 units. This allows us to maintain a flow of inventory without over-accumulating, as we only charge holding costs on physical on-hand stock and not the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline.",

At the start of P45, we have 77 units on hand. Orders from P42, P43, and P44 (100 units each) are currently in transit. The supply chain success rate is roughly 50%. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the priority is avoiding stockouts due to shipment failure. We will place an order of 100 units to ensure that we maintain a continuous stream of incoming goods, compensating for the high probability of individual shipment loss and providing coverage for approximately 3-4 periods of demand if successful.",

Examining the supply chain, we see that orders from Periods 42 and 43 arrived in Period 45 (lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively), which is an improvement over the high failure rates seen in the P24-P37 window. However, the total in-transit units (1165) includes a massive amount of 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (orders from P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, and P37 are long overdue and confirmed/highly likely lost). The viable pipeline currently consists of orders from P44 (100 units) and P45 (100 units). Given that we are entering Period 46 and the game ends at Period 50, we have 5 periods of demand remaining (~400 units total). Our current assets (204 on-hand + 200 viable in-transit) total 404 units, which almost exactly covers expected demand to the end. Since the holding cost is $1.0 vs a $19 profit, and we must account for the 50% historical risk of order loss, one final moderate order is prudent to ensure no stockouts in the final stretch, while avoiding excessive holding costs for the very final period.",

The P44 order (placed P44) is expected to arrive during P46 or P47 based on the current lead time of 2-3 periods.

Current on-hand (144) + reliable pipeline (300) = 444 units. This is sufficient to cover the remaining horizon, including a buffer for lead-time variance.

Looking at demand: recent periods (P43-P48) show levels of 76, 85, 73, 60, 78, 143. The P48 spike to 143 resulted in a stockout. Averaging the last 10 periods yields ~83 units/period. For the final two periods (P49 and P50), we anticipate ~160-180 total demand. On-hand is currently 0. In-transit is 1365 units, but as noted in the Carry-over Insights, at least 565 units (from P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37) are confirmed lost. The relevant pipeline includes P44-P48 (totaling 460 units). P44 (ordered P44, L=2/3) should arrive in P49. P45-P47 should logically arrive either in P49 or P50. Since the game ends after Period 50, any order placed now (Period 49) with a minimum promised lead time of 2 would arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends), making it useless for sales but potentially incurring costs. However, history shows some orders arriving with a 1-period lead time. Even if an order arrived in P50, we already have 460 units in the 'active' pipeline (P44-P48) to cover a remaining demand of roughly 180. Additional orders would only increase the risk of high holding costs or leftover inventory at the end of Period 50. Therefore, I will place a zero order.",

Since the game concludes after Period 50's demand resolution, any order placed now will arrive in Period 51 or later (due to the minimum lead time of 1-3 periods confirmed in history), meaning it cannot be sold and would only incur holding costs if the game continued or result in zero utility. In-transit inventory stands at 1365 units. Historically, about 565 units are likely lost (from P24-P37), but many recent orders (P44-P48) are still within the valid delivery window (1-3 periods). Specifically, orders from P44 (6 periods ago - likely lost), P45 (5 periods ago - likely lost), P46 (4 periods ago - likely lost), P47 (3 periods ago), and P48 (2 periods ago) are pending. If P47 or P48 arrive during Period 50, they will satisfy demand. Placing an order now for 'chips(Regular)' cannot satisfy Period 50 demand.
