Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical data beyond the provided demand samples (Period 1-5). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Total demand samples show a mean of 95.6 and a standard deviation of 27.8. Since I am in the decision phase for 'Period 1' (relative to the game start, although historical samples exist up to Period 5), I must assume the system is moving forward from that baseline. Given the high profit to holding cost ratio (19:1), the critical objective is to maintain high service levels (q = 0.95). I will use the default methods which calculate parameters based on all available samples. For mu_hat, the backend will compute (1 + 2) * 95.6 = 286.8. For sigma_hat, the backend will compute sqrt(1 + 2) * 27.8 = 48.15. This provides a robust safety stock for the initial order to prevent stockouts.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 140 units, but since the promised lead time (L) is 2, these units are currently in-transit and not yet available to meet demand. This resulted in 0 sales and 0 ending inventory for Period 1. The demand in Period 1 was 108, which is consistent with the historical sample range (82-136). The game history provided matches the 'chips(Regular)' historical data. I will use the promised lead time of 2. For forecasting (mu_hat), the mean of the 5 historical samples plus the Period 1 observation (82, 89, 65, 106, 136, 108) is approximately 97.6. Using this average across the (L+1=3) period window, the expected demand is roughly 293. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture all available data points (historical + Period 1) for both the mean and standard deviation to stabilize the base stock calculation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. In the first two periods, we faced a total demand of 252 units (P1: 108, P2: 144) but had zero starting inventory, resulting in 252 lost sales. Orders were placed in P1 (140 units) and P2 (139 units), totaling 279 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on Scenario A in the instructions, an order placed in P1 with lead_time=2 will arrive during P3's arrival phase and be visible in the P3 conclude message (read at the start of P4). Therefore, seeing 0 arrivals in P1 and P2 conclude messages is normal. Historical demand samples (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) suggest an average demand of ~95.6. However, the last two actual game periods showed significantly higher demand (108, 144). I will use recent_N=2 to capture this upward shift in demand and set L to default (2) as there is no evidence yet to suggest the promised lead time is incorrect.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4 decision phase. Looking at the history, no stock has arrived yet. In Period 1, we ordered 140 units. Since the promised lead time (L) is 2, those units should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This indicates an actual lead time longer than 2 or a lost shipment. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delay. Demand history for the first 5 periods (including historical context) shows: 82, 89, 65, 106, 136. The mean is approximately 95.6. With L=3, mu_hat should cover (1+3)=4 periods of demand. 4 * 95.6 = 382.4. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent upward trend (106, 136). The pipeline inventory is currently 447, which is high, but since we have 0 on-hand and have missed all demand so far (0 sold out of ~400 units), we need the OR backend to recalculate the base stock against this 3-period lead time expectation.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time exceeds promised; Period 1 order (L=2) did not arrive by Period 3 conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1372.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4 conclude, we observed two arrivals: the Period 1 order arrived with a lead time of 3 periods (vs promised 2), and the Period 3 order arrived with a lead time of 1 period. This suggests lead time variability. However, the Period 2 order (139 units) is notably missing from the 'Period 4 conclude' message. Since it was placed in Period 2 and hasn't arrived by the end of Period 4, its actual lead time is at least 3 periods or it is potentially lost. Current demand shows an upward trend (P1: 82, P2: 89, P3: 65, P4: 106, P5: 136). I will use a recent_N approach for demand to capture this growth (N=5). For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to let the OR engine factor in the recently observed values (3 and 1), which averages to the promised 2 but acknowledges the variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 order took 1 period. P2 order (139 units) is overdue or lost as of Period 5 start.

Daily Reward (R_t): $876.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 169. Observed demand over the last 5 periods has averaged 106.6 units (82, 89, 65, 106, 136). However, the game history shows actual demand was significantly higher in periods 1-3 (108, 144, 142) before decreasing in periods 4-5 (84, 55). The lead time history is highly volatile: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P2 (ordered in Period 2) is still missing after 3 conclude cycles (should have arrived by P5 conclude), suggesting it may be lost. To handle this volatility, I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat that accounts for the (L+1)=3 periods of demand coverage. Using the recent 5 samples (mean 95.6) as a base, 3 * 95.6 = 286.8. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), I will use a high sigma to ensure service levels are met despite the erratic lead times and missing shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Shipment from Period 2 (139 units) is confirmed missing/lost after failing to arrive by Period 5 conclude (L=3+); demand volatility remains high with a cooling trend in the last 2 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 75 units, and 353 units are in-transit (orders from Periods 4 and 5). Note that the Period 2 order (139 units) is officially categorized as lost, as it has not arrived by the end of Period 6 (5 periods later). Lead times have been highly erratic: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P2 was lost. Given this uncertainty and the promised lead time of 2, I'm setting L to 3 to provide a buffer for variability and potential delays. Demand has also cooled from its initial peak (Avg P1-P3: ~131) to a lower recent average (Avg P4-P6: ~77). To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels, I'm using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this cooling trend (Period 4-6) effectively for the (L+1) horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2081.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, we have observed significant lead time instability for chips(Regular). The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals have been 3, 1, and 3 periods. Most notably, the shipment from Period 2 (139 units) is confirmed lost as it has significantly exceeded any observed lead time window. Currently, we have 85 units on hand and 229 units in transit (from Periods 5, 6, 7). Recent demand exhibits high variance with an average of approximately 92 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 3-7: 142, 84, 55, 94, 114). To account for the lead time instability and the lost shipment, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient horizon. For mu_hat, I'll use the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the current demand regime which is lower than the initial spike but still volatile. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect this recent volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a safety stock buffer against potential late arrivals or demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; Period 2 order (139 units) is confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $825.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe significant lead time instability and a lost shipment from Period 2 (139 units). Confirmed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods (Average ~2.5). The current on-hand inventory is 125, and in-transit is 291 units (which includes the order from P8 of 152 units and the current order to be placed). Demand mean over the last 8 periods is ~98.6. Recent demand shows some cooling (50, 114, 94). Given profit=19 and holding=1, the critical ratio q = 19/20 = 0.95, justifying a high service level. Since L is effectively 3, I am setting L to explicit 3 to ensure the backend uses 4 periods of demand coverage (L+1). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the recent cooling trend (Avg ~78.6 * 4 = 314) vs the higher all-time average. This balances the need for protection against lead time delays with the lower recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is consistently 3 periods across most recent observations (P1, P4, P5 all arrived with L=3), contradicting the promised L=2. Period 2 order remains lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1983.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the actual lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (P8 order arrived in 1 period, while P4 and P5 arrived in 3). The promised lead time of 2 is unreliable. Period 2's order of 139 units is permanently lost. Current on-hand inventory is 164 with 144 units in-transit (orders from P9 and P10). Demand over the last 9 periods (P1-P9) averages 94.8 units per period, with a standard deviation of 30.6. Given the lead time instability, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers a 4-period window (L+1), mitigating the risk of stockouts during 3st-period arrival delays. I'm using a recent window (N=5) for demand to capture the current mean, while using the full history for sigma to account for the overall volatility (standard deviation).

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P8=1, P5=3, P4=3). Current pipeline inventory includes 144 units across recent orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1256.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 93 units with 277 units in-transit. Cumulative history shows a lost shipment from Period 2 (139 units), which has never arrived. Observations of actual lead times show high volatility, oscillating between 1 period (P3, P8) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), compared to the promised 2. The most recent demand (P10) was 71 units, while the average demand across the last 10 periods is approximately 97.5 units. Given the lead time instability, setting L to 'calculate' allows the engine to use the historical average (which is currently (3+1+3+3+1)/5 = 2.2), effectively bridging the discrepancy between the promised 2 and the actual occurrences of 3. For demand, the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering Periods 6-10) yields an average of (94+114+50+113+71)/5 = 88.4 per period. Using this recent window is appropriate to capture the current demand trend (88.4) compared to the long-term average (97.5), helping to prevent over-stocking while in-transit inventory is high (277 units).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (On-hand: 0) following a demand of 107 in Period 11. The lead time continues to be highly volatile, with historical values of 1 or 3 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show a distribution of {1, 1, 3, 3, 3}. To be conservative and prevent stockouts during this high-variability phase, I am setting L to 2 (the promised value) but relying on the OR backend's calculate logic which considers the historical drift. Demand over the last 11 periods has averaged 98.4 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 29.5 units. However, recent demand (last 3 periods) has slightly increased (avg 97). Given the stockout, I need to ensure the pipeline + current order covers (L+1) periods of demand. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (avg 91) to capture the trend while avoiding over-reactive ordering, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Stockout occurred Period 11; lead time remains bi-modal (1 or 3 periods); Period 2 order (139 units) is definitively lost and removed from pipeline expectations.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received orders from Period 9 (L=3) and Period 10 (L=2), bringing on-hand inventory to 28 units after satisfying 110 units of demand. The Period 2 order (139 units) remains lost. The current pipeline inventory is 291 units (from orders in Period 8, 11, and 12). However, looking at the 'arrived' logs, the Period 8 order (152 units) already arrived in Period 9! Therefore, the 'In-transit' figure of 291 includes the lost P2 order (139), the P11 order (50), and the P12 order (102). Subtracting the lost 139 units, the effective pipeline is 152 units. Demand has stabilized over the last 5 periods (94, 114, 50, 113, 71, 107, 110), averaging around 94 units. Lead time is bi-modal (1, 2, or 3 periods). Given the recent stockout and the lost order risk, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon, use recent_N (N=7) for demand to capture the current stable-but-high range, and use recent_N for volatility to protect against the high variance observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory has hit zero for the second time in three periods due to high demand (149 units in P13) and a lack of arrivals in the P13 conclude phase. Lead times are bi-modal, specifically alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P9 took 3, P10 took 2, P8 took 1). The Period 2 order of 139 units is confirmed lost. Currently, there are 426 units in-transit (P11: 50, P12: 102, P13: 135, and the P14 order which will be placed now). Demand has surged recently (avg 122 over the last 3 periods vs life-to-date avg of 98). To prevent further stockouts given the zero on-hand balance and erratic lead times, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of recent observations) to ensure the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the longer potential lead-time. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (covering periods 9-13) to capture the recent high-demand regime, and default for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock based on overall volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Period 9-13 average demand is 110 units (+12% over historical mean). Lead time remains bi-modal (1, 2, or 3 periods) with an average of 2.2 periods over the last 5 successful arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $950.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation (on-hand inventory = 0) despite a large pipeline of 489 units. The previous period (P14) saw a significant demand drop to 64 units, but the broader Period 9-13 average remains high at ~110 units. Historical demand across P1-P5 (82-136) also supports a mean around 100. Lead time remains bi-modal and unpredictable, with recent arrivals showing 3, 2, and 3 periods respectively. The P2 order (139 units) is officially ignored as lost. To recover from the stockout and account for the observed lead time instability, I am setting L explicitly to 3 (the upper end of the observed range). I'm using recent_N for mu_hat with N=9 (covering the period since the demand shift) to capture the higher average demand (~105-110 units/period) while smoothing the recent P14 dip. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=9) to capture the high volatility (50-149 range) observed in this regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level to clear the stockout.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we enter with an extremely low on-hand inventory of 5 units. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has shown significant volatility, averaging 105.4 units, which confirms the recent regime shift documented in Carry-Over Insights. Lead times continue to be highly unreliable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; the last four arrivals (P9, P10, P11, P12) had lead times of 3, 2, 3, and 3 periods respectively. This warrants setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the current bottleneck. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=7) to capture the higher demand regime (approx 100-110 per period) while ignoring the very old, lower demand samples. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=7) to account for the high variance observed in recent sales cycles (e.g., from 64 to 149), which is crucial for protecting against stockouts given our current low inventory position.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has stabilized at a longer duration: 4 out of the last 5 arrivals had L=3. Demand regime remains elevated compared to the initial 5 samples, averaging ~105 units over the last 7 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe that on-hand inventory is 117 units with 360 units in-transit. Analysis of the game history confirms that the lead time has shifted from the promised 2 periods to a dominant actual lead time of 3 periods (4 out of the last 5 arrivals took 3 periods). The demand regime has also stabilized at a higher level compared to the initial samples; the average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 93 units, but recent periods (P9-P13) showed spikes over 110. To prevent stockouts like those seen in P11 and P13/14, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the consistently realized delay. mu_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture the current demand level (~930 for the total lead/review cycle of 4 periods), and sigma_hat is set to default to provide a balanced safety buffer for the high variance observed (ranging from 23 to 149 in the last 10 periods).

Carry-over insight: Lead time is consistently stabilized at 3 periods (observed in arrivals at P12, P14, P15, P16). Demand remains volatile with an average around 95-105 units in the most recent regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $782.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the supply chain has stabilized into a bi-modal lead-time pattern, where shipments typically arrive in either 1 or 3 periods (average ~2-3 periods), contradicting the promised L=2. The most recent arrival (ordered P16, arrived P17) took 1 period, following the P14 order which took 3 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high at 282 units because two significant shipments (113 units and 108 units) arrived simultaneously in the Period 17 conclusion phase. Demand has cooled in the last two periods (23 and 56 units) compared to the Period 9-13 peak (~110 units), but it remains highly volatile. Given the current high stock level (282) and the pipeline (139 units from Period 11, likely the lost shipment, or a late one), we are well-covered for the immediate future. I will set the lead time to 'explicit' at 3 periods to account for the frequent delays, and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=9 to capture the behavior since the last major regime shift (Period 9 onwards, which includes both the peak and the recent dip), ensuring the OR backend targets a robust base stock that protects against lead-time variability while acknowledging the current high on-hand balance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant cooling trend in Periods 16-18 (23, 56, and 16 units), dropping well below the previous regime average of ~105 units. This follows a period of high volatility. In-transit inventory includes orders from Period 18 and potentially a late arrival from Period 17 (though Period 17 ordered 0). On-hand inventory is currently high at 266 units due to lower-than-expected demand and arrivals in Period 17. The lead time has stabilized significantly at 3 periods, although a 1-period arrival occurred at Period 17. To prevent excessive holding costs given the current high inventory and downward demand trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the cooling demand while maintaining enough stock to cover the expected 3-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Period 16-18 average is 31.7 units compared to the previous regime of ~105 units. Lead time remains predominantly 3 periods despite occasional short-cycle fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $314.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a distinct 'cooling' regime. In the last four periods (P16-P19), demand has been 23, 56, 16, and 29, averaging approximately 31 units per period, which is a significant drop from the previous average of ~105 units. With an on-hand inventory of 237 units and 194 units already in-transit, the current stock level is more than sufficient to cover even a rebound in demand for several periods. The lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods, although there is occasional bi-modal behavior (observed L=1 in P17). Given the current excess inventory (inventory-to-demand ratio > 10x), the OR backend should be set to a lower target to avoid unnecessary holding costs. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the consistent reality, and mu_hat/sigma_hat to the most recent 4 periods to capture the cooling demand trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $983.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a cooling phase as noted in the Carry-over Insights (Period 19). The mean demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) is 37 units (23, 56, 16, 29, 61), a significant drop from the previous regime which averaged over 100 units. Regarding lead time, the last recorded arrival (P17) was exceptionally fast (L=1), but the predominant actual lead time has been 3 periods throughout the history (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12, P13, P14 were all 3 periods). Therefore, I am setting L=3 to ensure the inventory policy covers the likely lead time duration. Given the high on-hand inventory (176) and in-transit units (194), the pipeline is currently very full relative to the new lower demand level. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current cooling trend while allowing for the recent slight uptick in P20 (61 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend sustained: Average demand for P16-P20 is 37 units, down drastically from ~105 units in the prior regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a distinct cooling phase. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is 33.1 units, a significant drop from the previous regime of ~105 units. Despite this, the current on-hand inventory (162) and in-transit inventory (194) are extremely high. The in-transit inventory consists of an order from P18 (55 units) and likely the older lost shipment from P2 (139 units), although the OR engine manages pipeline based on promised lead time. Since the the most recent lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2), setting L to 'calculate' allows the engine to use historical performance. To prevent over-ordering during this low-demand period given the current surplus, I am using a 'recent_N' of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the low mean (33.1) and lower volatility, effectively lowering the base stock level to avoid further accumulation of holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1198.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant cooling shift. Starting from Period 16, demand has averaged approximately 38 units per period (P16-P22: 23, 56, 16, 29, 61, 14, 68), a sharp decline from the previous regime of ~105 units. Current on-hand inventory is 94 units, and there are 194 units in-transit (P18, P20, etc. orders). Given the lower demand, the 'inventory position' (on-hand + in-transit) of 288 units is significantly more than enough to cover the expected demand for the immediate multi-period horizon (L+1). Lead times remain inconsistent but average around 2.5-3 periods based on recent history (P12, P13, P14, P16 all showed L=3, though P17 showed L=1). I will set L to 3 to be conservative regarding the replenishment cycle. mu_hat will use recent_N (N=7) to reflect the low-demand regime, and sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current volatility (roughly 14 to 68 range). This profile creates a lower base stock, preventing further over-ordering while we burn through the existing excess stock/in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed and sustained through Period 22: Average demand for P16-P22 is ~38 units, significantly lower than the previous ~105 unit regime. Inventory position is currently high relative to this new demand.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand cooling trend is now clearly established, with recent demand averaging approximately 38 units per period over the last 8 periods (P16-P23), compared to the previous regime of over 100. The lead time continues to be unstable but typically ranges between 1 and 3 periods, averaging near 2.5-3 periods based on historical arrivals. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 66 units and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 194 units. Given this cooling trend and the high total inventory position (260 units total), the system already has enough stock to cover roughly 6-7 periods of the new lower demand level. My parameters aim to prevent further over-ordering while the system digests this excess. Setting mu_hat to a recent window (N=8) captures the 38-unit average, while L=3 provides safety against observed arrival delays.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained low-volume regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to 24 (23, 56, 16, 29, 61, 14, 68, 28, 39), the average demand is approximately 37 units per period. This is a significant drop from the prior regime (~105 units). The lead time remains unstable but averages approximately 3 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P12, P13, P14 arrivals). Currently, on-hand inventory is 27 units, and there are 194 units in-transit (orders from P18: 55 units, and likely older unaccounted ones, though P18 is the only remaining active pipeline order visible unless others are truly lost). However, total pipeline + on-hand far exceeds the requirements for the current low-demand regime (37 units/period * 4 periods = 148 units). I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays, and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the most recent 9 periods of low demand (N=9) to prevent over-ordering while we burn through existing stock.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently recovering from a stockout at Period 25 (Ending OH: 0). Demand has shifted to a lower regime starting around Period 16; calculations show the mean demand for Periods 16-25 is approximately 36.6 units per period. The lead time remains variable but averages 3 periods for most recent long-cycle deliveries, though there are frequent 1-period arrivals. To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand regime while addressing the current stockout, I am setting L=3 (the conservative lead time estimate) and using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current lower demand profile. There are 194 units in-transit (Orders from P18 and potentially P25/P26) which should satisfy this demand once they arrive, but at a base stock level, the OR backend will calculate the gap considering on-hand is 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend sustained: Average demand for P16-P25 is approximately 37 units (down from ~105). Lead time remains bi-modal but appears to favor 3 periods for standard replenishment cycles.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained 'low demand' regime that began around Period 16, with demand averaging approximately 37-40 units per period, although Period 26 showed a significant spike (112 units). This spike caused a stockout (on-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory is 209 units, which includes orders from Period 18 (55 units), Period 26 (15 units), and significant older quantities still in transit. Lead time remains bi-modal but averages 3 periods for standard replenishment. Given the stockout and the high spike in Period 26, I will use a larger N for demand estimation to capture both the recent low-demand stability and the recent spike, preventing an under-correction. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=11 (covering P16-P26) yields an average demand of ~44 units per period. I'll set L to an explicit value of 3 based on the consistent historical pattern for standard arrivals, which helps the OR engine set a safer base stock for the lead time duration.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike at Period 26 (112 units) ended the strictly low-demand streak, though the overall regime since Period 16 remains significantly lower than the P1-P15 average. Lead time remains most frequently observed at 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout situation (on-hand inventory is 0). Demand analysis shows a significant cooling trend starting from Period 16, typically averaging ~37-40 units. However, Period 26 saw a sharp spike to 112 units, followed by a settling back to 42 units in Period 27. The average demand for the last 12 periods (P16-P27) is approximately 43 units. Regarding lead time, observations consistently show arrivals taking 3 periods (e.g., P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12, P13, P14 were mostly L=3), despite the promised L=2. There is currently 269 units in-transit (ordered at P18, P26, and P27). However, the orders from P18 (55 units) and others placed during the quiet period are likely either delayed significantly or approaching arrival. Given the current stockout and the spike in Period 26, I will set mu_hat to reflect the more recent average (recent_N=12) to account for the cooling trend while acknowledging the recent volatility. Sigma_hat is set to the same window to capture the recent spike's impact on variance. L is set to explicit 3 to better protect the pipeline against the frequently observed 3-period arrival cycle, preventing the backend from under-ordering due to perceived 'phantom' inventory that hasn't arrived yet.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Stockout continues; demand average for P16-P27 is ~43 units despite P26 spike. Lead time remains effectively 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $285.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the inventory position is critical with 0 on-hand units and 254 units in-transit. A stockout has persisted since Period 25 (with only a brief 15-unit arrival in P28). Recent demand has shown a resurgence: Period 26: 112, Period 27: 42, Period 28: 108. This suggests the previously identified cooling trend (avg ~37) has ended, and we are back in a higher demand regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (avg ~87) to capture this rebound. Lead time remains unstable; while P26 arrived in 2 periods, historical data shows a mode of 3. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient time horizon (L+1 = 4 periods) to recover from the stockout. This approach balances the need to replenish quickly against the risk of over-ordering if the recent demand spikes were anomalies, though consecutive high values suggest a sustained shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 26: The cooling trend (avg ~37) has ended; recent demand (P26-P28) averages ~87 units (+135% increase).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a new high-demand regime that started at Period 26. Demand for the last four periods (P26-P29) has been 112, 42, 108, and 52, averaging 78.5 units. This is a significant jump from the previous 'cooling' phase (avg ~37 units) and requires an upward adjustment in mu_hat to prevent further stockouts. The lead time (L) has recently shown stabilization at 2 periods (P26 order arrived P28, P27 order arrived P29), although the historical bimodal behavior (1-3 periods) suggests we should remain cautious. Setting L to the recently observed 2 periods. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=4 to capture this new elevated demand regime exactly. For sigma_hat, N=4 is used to capture the increased volatility associated with this shift. The goal is to rebuild inventory to match the higher service level required for a high-profit item ($19 profit vs $1 cost) while accounting for the 346 units already in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Average shifted from ~37 to ~79 units (+113%). Lead time has recently stabilized at the promised 2 periods (observed P28, P29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted back to a higher regime since Period 26, following a cooling trend. The average demand for the last five periods (P26-P30) is approximately 77 units (112, 42, 108, 52, 71). This is consistent with the shift identified in the Period 29 and 30 insights. Lead time is currently behaving predictably at the promised 2 periods (observed in arrivals for orders from P26 and P27). Despite an in-transit balance of 346, the system recorded a stockout in Period 30 (ending on-hand 0). To stabilize availability while factoring in the recent higher demand variance, I will set L to 'default' (2 periods) and use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the new demand regime (P26-P30). This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the current mean (~77) and the significant volatility observed in this cluster.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted again since Period 26, moving away from the 'cooling trend' (avg ~37) seen between Periods 16-25. For the current window (P26-P31), the average demand is 74.8 units. The lead time has stabilized back toward the promised 2 periods, as seen in the last two arrivals (P26 at P28, P27 at P29). Despite 346 units in-transit (ordered P29), the current on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time of 2 periods means these units will arrive during Period 31 resolution (visible at P32 start). I will set L to 2 (promised) based on recent arrivals. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the post-cooling regime (P26-P31). I will use a larger N for sigma_hat (N=10) to reflect the high volatility observed across the regime transition. The high in-transit amount likely stems from the large P29 order (152 units) which is expected this period; the parameters will help the OR engine determine if additional stock is needed to cover the current (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~37 to ~75 units. Lead time has re-stabilized at 2 periods (observed in arrivals from P26 and P27).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 conclude, we are in a high-demand regime that started at Period 26. Since Period 26, the mean demand is approximately 76 units (samples: 112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93). We have 0 units on-hand and 346 units in transit (which includes orders from Period 29, 31, and 32). Looking at the recent arrivals (P28 conclude: P26 order via L=2; P29 conclude: P27 order via L=2), the lead time has stabilized back to the promised 2 periods for the last two observed shipments. Given the current pipeline of 346 units and a estimated lead time of 2 periods, the OR backend's base-stock calculation (L+1 periods of demand) would target roughly 230-250 units. Since 346 (pipeline) is greater than this requirement, the OR engine will likely order 0 units this period to allow the excess inventory to arrive and start meeting demand. We will set L to 2 to reflect the recent stabilization and use a recent_N window of 7 to capture the current demand regime starting at Period 26.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. A significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 26, moving from a low average (~37) to a higher average of approximately 76 units (calculated from P26-P33: 112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93, 69). The pipeline inventory is substantial (346 units), primarily consisting of the large order from Period 29 (152 units) which is now overdue if lead time were 2 periods, but historically matches the 3-5 period delay seen during high-demand or high-variability phases. While arrivals from P26 and P27 had L=2, the lack of arrivals in P30-P33 suggests either a return to L=3 or a temporary bottleneck. To address the stockout while acknowledging the large pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the new demand regime (approx 76/period) and setting L to an explicit value of 3 to reflect the high probability that replenishments are taking longer than the promised 2 periods. This will increase the target base stock to cover the current demand regime across the perceived lead time plus review period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P26-P33 confirmed at ~76 units/period (+105% vs previous cooling trend). Lead time variability persists; despite brief stabilization at L=2 in P28-29, the lack of arrivals from P29-P32 by P34 start suggests a shift back toward L=3 or greater.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 26, moving from a cooling phase (avg ~37) to a higher demand phase. For the current regime (P26-P34), the average demand is approximately 77.7 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 390 units in-transit. Lead time is highly unstable: while it briefly stabilized at L=2 in P28-P29, recent orders (P29, P30, P31, P32, P33) have failed to arrive within that window, suggesting a reversion to L=3 or higher. Specifically, the order from P29 (152 units) is now at L=5 without arriving, indicating either a significant delay or a lost shipment similar to Period 2. A lead time estimate of L=3 is used to capture the likely replenishment cycle, though the high pipeline (390 units) suggests significant stock is incoming if not lost. I will set mu_hat to cover the recent demand regime (N=9, P26-P34) and maintain sigma_hat based on recent volatility to ensure the OR backend aims for a high service level given the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Lead time reverted to high variability/instability: Order from P29 has not arrived by P34 (L=5+), suggesting potential lost shipment or severe delay. Demand regime P26-P34 confirmed at avg ~78 units/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. Since Period 26, demand has shifted to a new regime averaging approximately 78 units per period (P26-P35 avg = 78.1). Lead time remains the primary concern: orders from Periods 29 (152 units), 34 (44 units), and 35 (1 unit) are in-transit. The Period 29 order is now overdue (L=6), suggesting it is either significantly delayed or potentially lost, though I will continue to track it in the pipeline for now. However, I must set the lead time parameter (L) to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the frequent observed delays beyond the promised L=2. I will use a 'recent_N' of 10 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (approx 78 units/period) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility in this period. The backend will target a base stock sufficient to cover the extended lead time plus the current review period.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Order from Period 29 (152 units) is now highly suspect as lost/severely delayed (L=6+). Demand regime for P26-P35 is confirmed at ~78 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is confirmed to be stable at a higher mean compared to the previous cooling trend. For the last 11 periods (P26-P36), the mean demand is approximately 75.2 units. Although Period 36 showed a lower demand (64), it remains within the expected volatility of this regime. Lead time behavior continues to be highly concerning. The shipment from Period 29 (152 units) has now failed to arrive for 7 periods (from P30 to P37 start), which strongly suggests it is lost. To prevent the OR backend from factoring this lost shipment into its 'pipeline inventory' calculation, I must either reduce the expected lead time L or use explicit parameters. However, the most recent arrival (P34 order arriving at P36 conclude) showed a lead time of 2 periods. To account for the missing P29 stock while recognizing that newer orders might arrive in 2-3 periods, I will set L=3 to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=11 to capture the current 75-unit mean regime accurately. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=11 to reflect the volatility of this specific period.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Order from Period 29 (152 units) is officially categorized as lost (L=7+ without arrival). Recent successful arrival from P34 indicates a return to L=2, but pipeline reliability remains low.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is confirmed to be higher (averaging ~77 units) compared to the prior cooling period, though recent demand shows some moderation (Period 37: 56 units). The lead time has recently shown arrivals at 1 and 2 periods (P34 at L=2, P35 at L=2, P36 at L=1), but historically it has been bi-modal and often takes 3 periods. Notably, the large shipment from Period 29 (152 units) is officially categorized as lost. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 382, but 139 units (from P2) and 152 units (from P29) are likely lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 91 units (from P37 and very recent unrecorded activity). I will use a 12-period window for demand to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history, and set L=3 explicitly to provide a safety buffer against the frequently observed bi-modal lead-time spikes, ensuring the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Shipment from Period 29 (152 units) confirmed lost (L=8+). Lead time for most recent successful arrivals (P34, P35, P36) has returned to 1-2 periods, but historical bi-modality suggests planning for L=3 is safer.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is confirmed as stable at approximately 75 units per period (P26-P38 average is ~75.6). Lead time for the most recent successful arrivals (P34, P35, P36) has returned to the promised 1-2 periods. However, the order from Period 29 (152 units) is confirmed lost, leaving a significant gap in the pipeline. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a stockout occurring in Period 38. Total in-transit inventory is 382 units, of which 152 (from P29) should be treated as non-existent. Adjusted pipeline is 230 units. To restore service levels, I will use recent_N for both demand (N=13 to cover the regime starting P26) and lead time (N=5 to capture recent stabilization at 2 periods, while the OR engine will still compute based on L=2). Since we are currently stocked out and the pipeline is compromised by lost units, the backend needs to target a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Order from Period 29 (152 units) is definitely lost; pipeline adjusted for decisions. Demand regime P26-P38 is stable at ~76 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is stable, averaging 76.5 units per period. The current inventory position is critical: on-hand is 0 and the system has undergone consecutive stockouts (P38, P39). Although the Period 29 order (152 units) is officially categorized as lost, the in-transit value of 382 units suggests there are other pending orders (likely the sum of various unrecorded or late-stage orders if the OR backend didn't clear them). Recent successful arrivals (P36, P37) show lead times of 1-2 periods, but historical data shows a frequent shift to L=3. To recover from the stockout and mitigate the risk of further lead time extensions, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a larger pipeline window. For demand, I'm using the mean of the current regime (P26-P39) which is approximately 77 units (recent_N, N=14). Sigma is set to recent_N to capture the current volatility of this regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 26, entering a higher regime averaging ~76 units/period (P26-P40), following a cooling trend (~37 units). Recent demand (P38-P40) is consistent with this regime (71, 94, 79). Inventory is currently critical: on-hand is 0, and a stockout has persisted for several periods due to the lost shipment from Period 29 (152 units). The current in-transit inventory of 382 units likely includes orders from Period 37 onwards and perhaps older delayed ones. Lead time has shown bi-modality (1-3 periods) but with the Period 29 loss complicating the pipeline, setting L to an explicit 3 periods is the safest buffer for the base-stock calculation. mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=15) to capture the stable high-demand regime since Period 26. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=15) to account for the volatility in this specific period range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 26-40 is confirmed stable at approximately 76 units/period. Lead time remains bi-modal (1-3 periods) with periodic risk of lost shipments (e.g., P29).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime since Period 26, averaging approximately 76 units per period (current regime includes P26-P41). Although there were zero units on hand at the start of Period 42, there is a significant pipeline of 382 units. Specifically, an order for 152 units from Period 29 is officially confirmed lost (L=12+), which I am excluding from active planning. However, subsequent orders from Period 37 onwards should begin arriving soon. Lead time remains bi-modal, showing a tendency towards L=2 or L=3, but recent reliable arrivals (P34-P36) favored L=1 or L=2. I will set L to 3 to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the periodic delays and bi-modality observed. I will use a recent_N of 16 for mu_hat to capture the post-P26 regime (P26-P41), which averages ~78 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=16 to account for the volatility within this specific high-demand window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 26-41 is confirmed stable at approximately 77 units/period. Lead time remains bi-modal (1-3 periods) with periodic risk of lost shipments (e.g., P29).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at an average of approximately 76 units (period 26-42 average is 75.5). The most recent demand in Period 42 was lower (45), but the overall trend remains elevated compared to the P16-P25 cooling period. A significant stockout persists because no orders have arrived since Period 37, and on-hand inventory is 0. The current pipeline inventory (382 units) consists largely of orders placed prior to Period 40 that have not yet arrived. Historical analysis shows lead times are bi-modal, frequently hitting 3 periods. With L=2 promised but L=3 often observed, setting L to 'explicit' at 3 periods provides a safer buffer. For mu_hat, recent_N with N=17 covers the current stable regime (P26-P42). Sigma_hat uses recent_N=17 to capture the variance within this specific period of higher demand. This configuration should trigger replenishment orders while accounting for the high in-transit volume to avoid over-ordering once the pipeline clears.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at approximately 75-80 units per period, following a previous cooling trend. Specifically, the average demand from Period 26 to Period 43 is 76.8 units. The lead time remains highly problematic; the order from Period 29 (152 units) is confirmed lost, while recent orders had lead times of 1-2 periods. However, the last arrival was at Period 37, and despite having 382 units in-transit (reflecting the 152 lost units from P29 plus recent orders), on-hand inventory has been zero since Period 38. This confirms a current stockout and highlights that pipeline reliability is low. For this period, I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the observed bimodal lead time (1-3 periods). I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * 77 units based on the stable demand regime since Period 26, and use the recent standard deviation to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P26 to P43 confirmed stable at ~77 units/period. Lead time remains bi-modal (1-3 periods) with identified shipment loss at Period 29.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at approximately 77 units per period (average of P26-P44 is 76.8). Despite a prolonged stockout since Period 38 due to lack of ordering, this demand signal remains consistent. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand with 382 units in-transit (reflecting recent large replenishment orders that haven't arrived yet). Lead time continues to be bi-modal, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with one confirmed lost shipment (P29). To ensure the OR backend properly captures the current demand volume and the inherent lead time risk, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays, and mu_hat to the recent regime's mean (77) scaled by (1+L), which is 308. Sigma_hat is set to the recent regime's standard deviation (approx 18) scaled by sqrt(1+L), which is 36. These parameters will ensure the target base stock is high enough to cover the lead time and the current high demand while the system waits for the pipeline inventory to arrive.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at an average of approximately 77 units per period (P26-P45 mean = 76.85). Currently, the system is resolving a massive stockout due to a lack of orders between Period 38 and 45, which has resulted in zero on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' quantity of 382 units likely reflects the accumulation of orders placed in earlier periods (though the history shows a long stretch of zero orders from P38-P45, earlier orders like P37 (36 units) are still in the pipeline). Given current Period 46, we are near the game end (P50). With 0 on-hand inventory and the need to cover demand for the remainder of the lead time plus review period (roughly 3-4 periods of demand), I will set mu_hat to reflect the stable 77-unit regime. Lead time remains bi-modal but centering on 2-3 periods; I will use L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-P26 regime volatility and volume. The goal is to flush the pipeline and satisfy remaining demand without over-ordering before Period 50.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 26-46) is stable at approximately 75-77 units/period. The current inventory state is critical: there are 382 units in-transit (reflecting the cumulative pipeline) but 0 units on-hand, and a chronic stockout has persisted from Period 38 to 46 due to a lack of ordering in those periods. The order from Period 29 (152 units) is confirmed lost, and several subsequent periods had zero orders, leading to the current stockout. To recover, we must account for the current demand (avg ~76) and the fact that lead times are bi-modal (1-3 periods). I will set L to 3 to be conservative given the history of delays and lost shipments. mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=20) to capture the stable demand regime (~76 units) since Period 26. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that should trigger a large replenishment order to refill the depleted pipeline and end the stockout.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 with 0 on-hand inventory and 382 units in-transit. Demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 26, averaging approximately 76-77 units per period. Recent demand (P40-P47) includes samples of 79, 93, 45, 76, 85, 73, 60, and 78, confirming this stable elevated regime. Lead time remains the primary concern; while the promised lead time is 2, historical observations show a bi-modal distribution of 1-3 periods, with a significant risk of lost shipments (P2, P29). Currently, huge stockouts are occurring because no orders were placed between Periods 38 and 47. With 382 units in vacuum (likely from several large orders placed earlier, like P29 which was lost, and others), the OR backend needs to recognize the current demand level. I will use recent_N=22 (covering Period 26 to present) to capture the ~77 unit mean demand. For lead time, I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the frequently observed 3-period delay, ensuring the base stock level (L+1 periods of demand) is sufficient to recover from the current stockout once arrivals resume.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 49, the penultimate period. The 'In-transit' pipeline contains 382 units, which is remarkably high given that the recent demand regime (P26-P48) averages approximately 77 units per period. The 382 units in transit represent over 4 periods of demand. With only 2 periods remaining in the game (P49 and P50), and an on-hand inventory of 0 units, our primary goal is to capture as much of the remaining demand as possible without ordering units that cannot arrive or sold within the timeframe. Given the lead time variability (bi-modal 1-3 periods), any order placed now (P49) would only arrive in P50 at the absolute earliest (L=1) or, more likely, after the game ends. Since our pipeline inventory (382) already vastly exceeds the likely demand for the final two periods (~154 units), any further ordering would only increase potential holding costs for units that arrive in P50 but cannot be sold. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure no new order is triggered, relying instead on the existing substantial pipeline to satisfy remaining demand.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 382 units in-transit. Looking at the history, the demand regime from Period 26 onwards has stabilized at approximately 77 units per period. The lead time has been highly variable, typically settling between 2 and 3 periods, although a significant shipment from Period 29 was lost. Since this is the final period of the game, any order placed now will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or impact the total reward (due to the 1-2 period lead time and the game ending). However, for the purpose of submitting the final parameters, I will maintain the current stable demand forecast and lead time estimation based on the established regime. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the most frequent actual lead time observed, and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the demand since Period 26 (N=24).
