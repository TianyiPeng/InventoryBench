Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a historical demand pattern (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) over the last 5 periods. The average demand is approximately 95.6 per period. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Since we have no specific calendar dates or product-specific events available yet, I will use the recent demand data to set the forecast. The target inventory level (base stock) needs to cover 1 + L (3) periods of demand. Using all 5 historical samples provides a reasonable baseline for mean and variance. I am setting L to 'default' (2), mu_hat to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the trend seen in the historical data (which shows an upward movement from 82 to 136), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect current volatility.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 140 units, but they are still in-transit due to the promised lead time of 2 periods (arriving in Period 3). The starting on-hand was 0, and demand was 108, resulting in 108 lost sales and 0 ending inventory. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including the starting sample) shows 82, 89, 65, 106, 136, and the actual Period 1 demand was 108. The average demand across these 6 data points is approximately 97.6. Since we are in the early stages and have no reason to suspect a regime shift yet, I will use 'default' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the most relevant recent history including the high Period 1 demand (108).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (140 units) and Period 2 (139 units) are currently in-transit (Total 279). Based on the lead time definition (Order in N arrives in N+L resolution phase), the Period 1 order (L=2) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message at the start of Period 4. Demand for the first two periods was 108 and 144, while the historical samples provided (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) show significant variance. However, given the actual demand in P1 and P2 (108, 144) is higher than the early historical samples (82, 89), there appears to be a slight upward trend or higher recent volatility. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 (using the 5 samples provided in the prompt) to capture the recent mean of ~95.6, ensuring the base stock calculation (1+L)*mu covers the next 3 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is set to default reflecting historical volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts (sold=0 for Periods 1-3) because arrivals have not yet commenced. The promised lead time (L) is 2. According to our timing rules, an order placed in Period 1 (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 5. Consequently, it is normal that 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. However, demand has been consistently higher than the initial samples (Avg P1-P3: 131 vs. initial avg: 95). Current in-transit is 377. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture this upward shift in demand observed over the first 3 periods of the game, while keeping L at 'default' (2) until evidence suggests otherwise.

Daily Profit: $336.00, Daily Holding Cost: $154.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $182.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Historical demand samples: 82, 89, 65, 106, 136 (mean ~95.6, std ~28.6). Period 4 concluded with the arrival of 140 units (P1, LT=3) and 98 units (P3, LT=1), while the P2 order (139 units) is notably missing/late despite the promised lead time of 2. This suggests high lead-time variability. Demand in Period 5 (136) is higher than previous periods, but within a reasonable fluctuation range for a 'chips' product. Given the uncertainty in lead time (ranging from 1 to 3+ periods) and the missing P2 order, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full history while acknowledging the recent uptick in demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead-time patterns. Demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' show high variability (82, 89, 65, 106, 136 based on context; history shows 108, 144, 142, 84, 55). The mean demand over these 5 periods is 106.6. Lead times have been inconsistent: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period, suggesting an average of 2 (equal to promised), but with high variance. Currently, we have 99 units on-hand and 352 in-transit (orders from Period 2, 4, and 5). Since on-hand inventory is decreasing (154 down to 99) and demand is inherently volatile, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent average, and 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to average the observed shifts. I will use 'default' for sigma_hat to account for the overall historical volatility including the early spikes.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the demand for chips(Regular) across the first 6 periods has been [108, 144, 142, 84, 55, 94], with a mean of approximately 104.5. However, the last three periods (84, 55, 94) show a lower average (77.6) compared to the first three (131.3). The lead time is volatile: promised is 2, but we observed a Lead Time of 3 for Period 1's order and 1 for Period 3's order, suggesting an average of 2 but with high variance. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (5 units), while in-transit is high (381 units). The in-transit includes orders from P2 (139), P4 (47), P5 (166), and P6 (29). P2 is now overdue (placed P2, expected P4/P5, it is now P7). I will use L=2 (default) as the base, but I'll use recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent lower demand trend (avg ~78), which helps prevent over-ordering while awaiting the large pipeline to arrive. I'll use recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to capture the full volatility seen so far.

Daily Reward (R_t): $208.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a significant in-transit pipeline (334 units). Promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are volatile (actuals: 3, 1, 3). The average lead time from history is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. Demand analysis: historical samples (P1-P5) and concluded period data (P1-P7) show a mean of approximately 104 (P1: 82, P2: 89, P3: 65, P4: 106, P5: 136, P6: 94, P7: 114). There is no strong evidence of a sustained regime shift yet, so I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture recent demand levels (Avg ~107) and 'calculate' for lead time to account for the drift above the promised 2. mu_hat should cover (L+1) periods; with L=2.33, it covers approx 3.33 periods. The OR backend will calculate the base stock. Given the high stockout risk demonstrated in P7, using recent demand ensures we don't under-order if the P5 peak was the start of a trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of the history shows significant lead time volatility: Promised is 2, but observed lead times are 3 periods (P1, P4, P5) and 1 period (P3). The average seen across more reliable arrivals (P1, P4, P5) is 3. I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect this recurring delay, ensuring the pipeline covers an extra period. Regarding demand, the mean of all samples (P1-P8) is 108.8, with recent demand (P5-P8) showing a slight dip (avg 78.25), but earlier demand was much higher (avg 119.5). Given the variability and the high profit relative to holding cost (4:1), I want to maintain a healthy base stock. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the full history while allowing for recent trends, and sigma_hat with N=8 to account for the standard deviation (approx 36.5). The current inventory (On-hand 116 + In-transit 281 = 397) is substantial, but with L=3, the target base stock covers 4 periods of demand (~435 units), which justifies the high in-transit level.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consistently observed at 3 periods (3 out of 4 resolved shipments), exceeding promised 2 periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is volatile but frequently settles at 3 periods (Periods 1, 4, and 5 all arrived with L=3), despite two outliers of L=1 (Periods 3 and 8). To prevent stockouts like the one seen in Period 7, I am setting L to 3 to ensure the inventory pipeline is sufficiently buffered. Demand has averaged approximately 93.6 units over the first 9 periods, but recent periods (P7-P9) have shown higher variance (114, 50, 113). I will use the last 5 periods (reflecting a more stable recent regime) to calculate the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). Current inventory (On-hand: 116 + In-transit: 227 = 343) is significant, but a higher L parameter ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for the extended lead time window (L+1=4 periods of demand).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Historical demand for chips(Regular) from Period 1 to 10 shows a mean of approximately 97.5 units per period (\u03a3=975/10), with no clear trend or seasonality identified yet. Lead time performance is highly inconsistent: while the promised lead time is 2, we have observed actual lead times of 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 periods. Specifically, orders from P1, P4, P5 arrived in 3 periods, while orders from P3 and P8 arrived in 1. Because the distribution of lead times is skewed towards 3 (3 out of 5 observations), I will set L=3 to ensure the inventory position covers the longer cycle. Given the demand variability (range 50 to 144) and lead time instability, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the most recent demand levels (avg ~83) and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain a sufficient safety buffer.

Historically, lead times have been highly volatile (1 or 3 periods), though the carry-over insight suggests a tendency toward 3. Specifically, the order from Period 2 (139 units) is significantly overdue (9 periods since order), suggesting it may be lost. Average demand over all 11 periods is approximately 102.9. Given the current stockout and the risk of lost shipments, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to reflect the higher observed delay, which increases the lookahead window for the OR engine. Demand seems relatively stable in the 90-110 range, though recent samples (P11=107, P10=71, P9=113) show some variance. Using Mu_hat and Sigma_hat based on the last 5 samples will capture this recent movement while hedging against the stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Order placed in Period 2 (139 units) is significantly overdue (9 periods) and highly likely lost; inventory planning should not rely on its arrival.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory of 304 units includes a lost shipment of 139 units from Period 2 (which is 11 periods overdue). Correcting for this, the effective pipeline is 165 units. Lead time performance remains volatile: of the 7 resolved orders, 4 had a lead time of 3, 1 had a lead time of 2, and 2 had a lead time of 1. Given this instability and the stockouts in Periods 11 and 12, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the most common actual lead time and protect against further stockouts. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown high variance over the last 12 periods (ranging from 50 to 144). I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full recent distribution for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level targets the 80% service level (q = 4/(4+1)) and accounting for the extended lead time (L+1=4 periods of demand).

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Effective pipeline inventory revised; Period 2 order (139 units) is confirmed lost (11 periods overdue). Effective in-transit is 165 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and a significant backlog of demand. Analysis of lead times confirms that while the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time is highly variable with a mode of 3. Crucially, the order for 139 units from Period 2 is lost (11 periods overdue). This means the effective pipeline is 309 units (448 total - 139 lost). I am setting L to 3 to reflect the actual observed delivery performance, ensuring the OR backend targets enough stock to cover the longer replenishment cycle. Demand has trended higher in recent periods, specifically the last 3 periods (P11: 107, P12: 110, P13: 149), averaging ~122 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture this upward shift and ensure the base stock is calculated against current demand levels rather than the lower historical average. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to allow the model to account for the overall volatility in demand across the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 11: 3-period average is 122 units compared to historical average of ~95 units.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Periods 11-14) shows a shift with an average of 107.5 units per period, significantly higher than the earlier historical average. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current trend. On lead times, while the promised time is 2, the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods for most resolved shipments. I will set L to 3 explicitly to ensure the OR engine calculates base stock for a 4-period window (L+1). Regarding inventory, the Period 2 order (139 units) is confirmed lost and should be excluded from pipeline logic. Current in-transit is 479, but excluding the lost order, the effective in-transit is 340 units (76 from P12, 144 from P13, 91 from P14, and 29 from P6 which is also likely lost or severely overdue). Given 0 on-hand and high demand, I need to maintain aggressive parameters to recover from consecutive stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 11-14 average is 107.5 units (vs historical ~95). Lead time remains reliably 3 periods based on P11 arrival in P14.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, on-hand inventory is 0. History shows a stockout in the last 5 periods (P11-P15). The 'In-transit' count is 413, but this includes a lost shipment from Period 2 (139 units), making the effective pipeline 274 units. Lead time analysis: Excluding outliers, the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, and P12 all resulted in 3-period arrivals). We use L=3. Demand analysis: Demand has shifted upwards since Period 11. The mean of the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 105.4. Given the persistent stockouts (sold < demand), the current inventory is insufficient to meet demand. I will set L=3 and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift in both mean demand and volatility, providing the OR backend with the most relevant data to calculate a robust base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-29.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system shows 121 units on-hand and 329 units in-transit. However, the 'Period 2' order of 139 units is now 15 periods overdue and is definitely lost. Subtracting this from the reported in-transit (329 - 139) reveals a functional pipeline of 190 units (consisting of orders from P14, P15, and P16). Recent demand has shown high volatility (e.g., P13: 149, P16: 23), but the underlying regime since P11 has averaged roughly 90 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this regime while smoothing the extremely low P16 observation. Lead time is consistently behaving as 3 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P14, P15, and P16), so I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to override the backend's promised lead time and appropriately cover the (L+1) exposure window (4 periods). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the longer lead time and the lost shipment, preventing stockouts during the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is consistently 3 periods across the last 3 arrivals (P14, P15, P16). Demand regime since P11 fluctuates significantly (mean ~90, range 23-149).

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 216 units with 178 units in-transit (P15 order of 10 and P2 order of 139 which is confirmed lost, leaving only P15 order as active pipeline). Historical lead times over the last 6 resolved shipments (P8, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14, P16) show values of 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1. The modal lead time is 3 periods, and the 'carry_over_insight' suggests using L=3. Demand since the regime shift at Period 11 has been volatile: 107, 110, 149, 64, 97, 23, 56 (average ~86.5). However, the initial phase (P1-P5) and subsequent peaks suggest demand can frequently exceed 100. Setting L=3 (explicitly account for the frequent 3-period delay) and using the recent 7 periods (N=7) for demand and volatility captures the current regime. Note: The backend will subtract the 178 in-transit units (which includes the lost P2 order of 139) from the target base stock. Since the lost order won't arrive, the OR backend might under-order. To compensate, I set L=3 and use recent_N to ensure the calculated base stock is robust against the actual lead time and recent demand volatility.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the current on-hand inventory is 200 units with an in-transit pipeline of 201 units. Analyzing the history, the order placed in Period 2 (139 units) is over 16 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is (201 - 139) = 62 units. Summing on-hand and reliable in-transit gives 262 units. Recent demand (last 8 periods since Period 11) has averaged ~78 units per period, but volatility is extremely high (range 16 to 149). Based on the lead-time analysis, the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods (observed in most recent arrivals: P14, P15, P16). I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect this stability. For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N with N=8 (the period since the identified regime shift in P11) to capture the higher mean and variance observed in the current window. This ensures base stock covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand, approximately 312 units, suggesting a small order is needed to reach the target service level.

Carry-over insight: Consistent demand volatility observed since Period 11: Mean ~78 units, but range is 16-149 units, requiring higher safety stock despite a lower recent mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-55.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we see on-hand inventory of 171 and 201 units in transit. Reviewing the history, the 201 units in transit comprise the order from Period 2 (139 units, confirmed lost since P13), P15 (10 units), P18 (23 units), and P19 (0 units? wait, history shows P15=10, P18=23, P19=0). Recalculating: P2(139) is lost. P15(10) is overdue (lead time 5+), P18(23) is in transit. Total visible in-transit is 201, which likely includes the P2(139), P15(10), P18(23), and unidentified units. Since P2 is lost, the OR's 'pipeline_inventory' view is inflated. Lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods for the majority of successful deliveries. Demand from P11 to P19 has a mean of approximately 72 units but is highly volatile (standard deviation ~45). I will set L=3 explicitly to account for the real delay. mu_hat is set using recent_N=9 (periods 11-19) to capture the current lower mean regime (~72 units/period), and sigma_hat is set to recent_N=9 to ensure safety stock covers the high volatility (SD ~45) observed in this window. Setting L=3 results in mu_hat = (1+3)*72=288.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 21. Demand has been highly volatile since Period 11, ranging from 16 to 149 units. The mean for the last 10 periods (P11-P20) is approximately 71.2 units, which is lower than the early game average (~95). However, the variance remains high. Lead time analysis: While the promised lead time is 2, arrivals since Period 7 have consistently shown an actual lead time of 3 periods (with occasional outliers of 1 period). Inventory Check: On-hand (110) + In-transit (201) = 311 units. The Period 2 order (139 units) is confirmed lost, so the effective in-transit is 62 units (the 201 visible - 139 lost). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the consistent delivery delay. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat to capture the recent lower mean (71.2) over a 4-period window (L+1), and 'recent_N' with N=10 for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for the high volatility observed in this regime.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are managing the 'chips(Regular)' SKU. Analyzing arrivals: Orders from P18 (23 units) and P21 (48 units) are in the pipeline. Note that the order from P2 (139 units) is confirmed lost and should be excluded from pipeline calculations (Total In-transit 249 - 139 = 110 effective). Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed consistently for most recent shipments). Demand has entered a lower but highly volatile regime since P17 (recent demands: 16, 29, 61, 14). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P17-P21) have an average demand of 35.2 units, which is a significant drop from the ~90-100 units seen previously. We will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this lower volume and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to maintain sufficient safety stock against the high variance observed in this SKU's history. L is set to 3 to reflect the actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand volume drop starting Period 17: 5-period average is 35.2 units (previously ~90). High volatility remains a key characteristic of this SKU.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a low-demand regime that started around Period 17. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P17-P22) is approximately 40.7 units (56, 16, 29, 61, 14, 68), which is a significant drop from the previous historical and regime averages (around 90-100). Despite the lower mean, the variance remains high (standard deviation of ~24 in this window), necessitating a controlled safety stock. Lead time is consistently averaging 3 periods (mode and mean), so L is set to 'explicit' at 3 to allow the OR backend to account for a 4-period window (L+1). mu_hat is set to 164 based on the recent average of ~41 units/period across 4 periods (1+L=4). sigma_hat is set to 48 (sqrt(4)*24). The inventory position (On-hand: 28, In-transit: 249) is quite high relative to this new demand level, so the backend is likely to suppress orders until the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at lower volume: Period 17-22 average is ~41 units/period with high volatility (range 14-68).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower mean since Period 17, with a 7-period average (P17-P23) of 38.8 units. While volatility remains present (range 14-68), the volume is significantly lower than the historical average. The actual lead time has stabilized closer to the promised 2 periods (as seen in P23's arrival of the P21 order) or 3 periods (as seen in the majority of historical arrivals). I will set L to 3 to be conservative regarding the actual delivery speed. I am using recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume/high volatility regime and prevent over-stocking while maintaining a buffer for spikes in this variant. The pipeline includes an old lost order from Period 2 (139 units) which the OR engine still counts, but since current on-hand (48) and recent arrivals are sufficient for the lower demand, the 'cap' mechanism in the backend will mitigate over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P17-P23): Mean ~39 units, lower than previous regimes, but volatility remains substantial.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime starting from Period 17. The average demand from P17 to P24 is approximately 38.8 units per period, with a range of 14-68. Although Period 13 order (144 units) arrived in P16, the Period 2 order (139 units) is definitively lost and should be discounted from pipeline calculations. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (9 units), and in-transit inventory is 201 (comprised of orders from P15, P18, and potentially older unrecorded small adjustments, though the game history shows P15 order was 10, P18 was 23). Given the consistent lead time observations (averaging 3 periods, with some variability), I will set L to 3. For demand forecasting, I will use the last 8 periods (P17-P24) to reflect the stabilized lower demand regime (Mean ~39) while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the high volatility (sigma) seen in this SKU. The OR backend will use these values to determine if a new order is necessary to maintain the base stock level for a (3+1) period horizon.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean since Period 17, with the last 9 periods (P17-P25) showing an average demand of approximately 38 units (ranging from 14 to 68). I am setting N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower-volume regime while respecting the continued high relative volatility. The lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' because, despite the promised lead time of 2, actual arrivals have frequently taken 3 periods, and the OR backend needs to account for this variability in its base stock calculation. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 201 units in-transit. A significantly overdue order from Period 2 (139 units) is confirmed lost and must be ignored; the OR backend will calculate the order based on (on-hand + valid in-transit).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of stockout (on-hand: 0) with a large pipeline of 201 units. Recent history shows a demand regime shift started around Period 17, but Period 26 saw a significant outlier spike of 112 units, which is much higher than the recent average (~39). The actual lead time is consistently around 3 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P11 arriving P14, P13 arriving P16, P21 arriving P23), though it is volatile. Given the current pipeline of 201 units (from orders in P18, P21, even if some were 0, the total in-transit is reported as 201), the OR backend needs to account for this stock. However, since we are at 0 on-hand and just experienced a demand spike, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the lower volume but acknowledge the high volatility (range 14-112). I will set L to 'explicit' value 3, as it is the most frequent actual lead time and we need to ensure the pipeline coverage accounts for the 3-period lag plus the decision period (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand spike of 112 units detected, breaking the previous low-volume stabilization (~39 units), suggesting potential return to previous regime or increased volatility.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of high volatility with a recent demand spike (Period 26: 112 units) breaking a period of low-volume stabilization (~40 units). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts over the last two periods (P26, P27) due to late arrivals and the demand surge. The lead time has historically averaged around 3 periods despite the promised 2. Current in-transit inventory is 232 units (excluding the lost P2 order), which includes several small orders and a large pending replenishment. Given the recent demand jump followed by a 42-unit demand in P27, I am setting L=3 to account for the consistent actual lead time. For demand forecasting, I am using a recent_N=10 approach (Periods 18-27) to capture the lower-volume regime while incorporating the recent high-volatility spike (mean ~44 units). This ensures the OR engine maintains a safety stock buffer against the observed volatility while attempting to clear the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the dominant risk; Period 26 spike (112 units) confirms that while mean demand dropped in Period 17, the SKU is prone to sudden high-volume bursts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Recent demand has shown a resurgence in volatility and volume, with spikes of 112 (P26) and 108 (P28) breaking the previous low-volume stabilization (~39 units). The current in-transit inventory is 232 units, but this includes a significantly overdue (27 periods) order from Period 2 (139 units) which is confirmed lost. Therefore, the 'effective' pipeline is only 93 units (232 - 139). While the lead time is promised at 2, it consistently averages 3 periods. I will use 'explicit' for L to reflect this reality. For mu_hat, the recent 12-period average (P17-P28) is roughly 50, but given the recent spikes (112, 42, 108), I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the recent regime including the higher volatility. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=12 to ensure the backend accounts for the significant variability observed recently, balancing the high profit margin ($4.0) against the holding cost ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified starting Period 26: Recent 3-period demand (112, 42, 108) averages 87.3, significantly higher than the P17-P25 average of ~39. The SKU remains prone to high-volume bursts.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of stockout (on-hand: 0) following a demand regime shift back to high-volume bursts. Since Period 26, demand has been 112, 42, 108, and 52, averaging 78.5 units/period\u2014a sharp increase from the previous 'low-volume' period (avg ~39). Lead times are unstable but frequently gravitate toward 3 periods (Recent arrivals: P27 arrived in P29, LT=2; however, history shows many LT=3). Given the stockout and the return of high-volume demand spikes, I am setting L to 3 to ensure sufficient pipeline coverage. mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-demand burst regime (P26-P29). sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the extreme volatility (range 42-112) observed in this new regime, which is the primary driver of stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 26: Return to high-volume/high-volatility pattern. Recent 4-period mean is ~78.5 (vs. previous ~39), with single-period spikes exceeding 100 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-volume/high-volatility regime that began at Period 26. The recent 5-period demand (112, 42, 108, 52, 71) averages approximately 77 units, which is a significant increase from the previous 'low-volume' period (avg ~39). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this shift. The actual lead time has historically fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most common during active replenishment phases (e.g., Periods 12-17). Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are emerging from a series of stockouts due to the demand spike, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3 to reflect the high end of observed lead times, ensuring the OR engine builds enough pipeline inventory. Sigma_hat is also calculated using recent_N=5 to account for the intense volatility seen in this new regime (range 42-112).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Transition from low-volume (~39 units) back to high-volume/high-volatility regime (~77 units avg, spikes >100).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has transitioned back to a high-demand, high-volatility regime starting at Period 26. The recent demand samples are 112, 42, 108, 52, 71, and 64, resulting in a mean of approximately 74.8 units\u2014a sharp increase from the previous low-volume regime of ~39 units. Currently, the system has 0 units on-hand and 365 units in-transit. It is critical to account for the lost shipment from Period 2 (139 units), which means the effective pipeline inventory is 226 units (365 total in-transit - 139 lost). The promised lead time is 2 periods, but historical data shows an actual lead time frequently hitting 3 periods. To ensure adequate service levels during this volatile high-demand phase, I am selecting L=3 to cover the lead period plus the current period's demand (L+1 approach). For forecasting, I am using recent_N with N=6 to capture this current high-volume regime specifically, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to mitigate stockouts while penalizing the high holding cost of excess regular chips.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~39 to ~75 units (~90% increase) with high volatility (range 42-112).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 26 to a high-volume, high-volatility pattern. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P26-P32) is approximately 77.4 units, a significant increase from the prior low-volume regime (~39 units). Volatility remains extreme, with demand ranging from 42 to 112 units. In-transit inventory stands at 365 units, but this includes a 139-unit order from Period 2 confirmed lost and a 23-unit order from Period 18 that is 14 periods overdue and also likely lost. The effective pipeline includes orders from Period 29 (25 units) and Period 30 (139 units), totaling 164 reliable units. With on-hand inventory currently at 0 and a consistent lead time of 3 periods, I set L=3 and use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and its volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the higher mean and the necessary safety stock to handle the observed spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Period 18 order (23 units) is 14 periods overdue and confirmed lost; Effective pipeline inventory for Period 33 is 164 units (excluding P2 and P18 orders).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at a higher volume (mean ~77.5 units) compared to the previous low-demand period (P17-P25). Recent demand values (P26-P33) are 112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93, 69. For Period 34, I am using a recent_N of 8 to capture this regime shift accurately. In terms of lead time, while the promised lead time is 2, the historical data (confirmed in carry-over insights) demonstrates a consistent actual lead time of 3 periods for most resolved shipments. Therefore, I set L explicitly to 3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the realistic delay. The 'In-transit' of 365 units includes confirmed lost orders from Period 2 (139 units) and Period 18 (23 units), totaling 162 lost units. The effective pipeline inventory is actually 203 units (365 - 162). By setting L=3 and using mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the last 8 samples, the base stock will target a level that accounts for the higher demand and the shipping delay, while the OR logic will subtract the (inflated) pipeline. I am monitoring the large order of 139 units placed in Period 30, which is expected to arrive in Period 33 or 34 but has not appeared in the Period 33 conclude message.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that resumed at Period 26. Since Period 26, the demand mean is approximately 80 units (ranging from 42 to 112). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline is listed as 365 units, but history shows significant losses: Period 2 (139 units) and Period 18 (23 units) are long overdue and confirmed lost. This leaves an effective pipeline of 203 units (from orders in P29, P30). The actual lead time is consistently 3 periods. With L=3, the target base stock covers 4 periods of demand. At a mean of ~80, we need ~320 units to cover the pipeline and current demand. Since 203 are in-transit and 0 are on-hand, we rely on the OR backend to calculate the optimal order. I will use recent_N (N=9, starting from P26) to capture the current high-volatility regime and set L=3 to match observed reality.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand regime since P26 remains stable in its high-volume, high-volatility state (avg ~80 units). Effective pipeline inventory is adjusted to exclude P2 and P18 lost orders.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized in a high-volume, high-volatility state. The last 10 periods (P26-P35) show a mean demand of approximately 79.1 units (112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93, 69, 88, 92), a significant increase from the previous low-volume regime (~39 units). Lead times have historically fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, but I will use the established recent average. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Total In-transit is listed as 365 units; however, as previously documented, the orders from Period 2 (139 units) and Period 18 (23 units) are significantly overdue (34 and 18 periods respectively) and confirmed lost. The 'effective' pipeline inventory is therefore 365 - 139 - 23 = 203 units (from P29, P30). With effective pipeline inventory at 203 and an expected demand of ~80 per period over a 3-4 period window (L+1), current coverage is thin but present. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the older low-demand data.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand regime (starting P26) with an average demand of approximately 80 units/period and high volatility. Inventory has been at zero for multiple periods because the OR backend's cap mechanism, combined with lost orders in the pipeline (P2 and P18), restricted ordering. In-transit inventory is currently 365 units, but 162 of those (139 from P2 and 23 from P18) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 203 units. To recover from the stockout and account for the observed lead time of 3 periods (vs promised 2), I am setting L to 3. I am using recent_N (N=11, from P26-P36) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current high-demand, high-volatility regime. This will raise the base stock level and help the OR backend generate an order that accounts for the lost pipeline and the 3-period lead time requirement.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-volume demand regime that started at Period 26, following a period of low volume. Since Period 26, demand has averaged approximately 77.8 units per period (12 samples), with notable volatility (range 42-112). Historical lead times show significant variability, but more recently have leaned towards 2-3 periods. Crucially, orders from Period 2 (139 units) and Period 18 (23 units) are long-overdue and confirmed as lost. This subtracts 162 units from the reported 'In-transit' of 365, leaving an effective pipeline of 203 units (from orders in P27, P29, and P30). The current 'On-hand' is 0, and no arrivals have occurred since Period 29. The order from Period 30 (139 units) is now at lead time = 8, which is highly concerning but not yet written off like P2/P18; however, its delay explains the persistent stockouts. To recover, I choose to use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the current high-demand regime since P26 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For lead time, I will use an 'explicit' value of 3 to account for the consistently observed delays earlier and the current massive delay in the P30 order, effectively forcing the OR engine to buffer for longer cycles.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Effective pipeline confirmed at 203 units. Order from Period 30 (139 units) is now 8 periods overdue, indicating a catastrophic lead-time failure or potential loss, though not yet officially written off in logic. Demand regime since P26 remains stable at ~78 units avg.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stock-out state (on-hand: 0) with a significant demand regime shift that occurred at Period 26 (avg ~78 units, high volatility). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead time has historically averaged 3. A critical issue is identified with the pipeline: several orders (P2, P18, and now likely P30) are missing or extremely overdue. Specifically, the order from Period 30 (139 units) is now 9 periods overdue, suggesting it should be treated as lost. Subtracting lost orders (P2, P18, P30) from the 'In-transit' total of 365 leaves an effective pipeline of 64 units (orders from P29 or later, though historical logs show only P29=25 units and potentially newer orders not yet reflected in the summary). Given the sustained stock-out and high volatility (spikes > 110), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the real delay, and mu_hat using recent_N=13 (covering the start of the high-volume regime at P26) to capture the ~78 unit mean demand. Sigma_hat is set to explicit (40) to ensure high service levels (q=0.8) and buffer against the known volatility/spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Order from Period 30 (139 units) is 9 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Effective pipeline inventory is adjusted to exclude P2, P18, and P30 lost orders. Demand regime remains stable at ~78 units avg since P26.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, the SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to face significant stockout issues with 0 units on-hand. The demand regime has stabilized into a high-volume, high-volatility pattern since Period 26, with a recent 14-period average (P26-P39) of 77.5 units. The primary bottleneck is the supply chain: multiple orders (P2, P18, P30) totaling 301 units are confirmed lost, and several recent orders have not yet arrived. The 'In-transit' quantity visible to the backend is 365, but after subtracting the confirmed lost units (139 from P2, 23 from P18, and 139 from P30), the effective pipeline inventory is only 64 units (the order from P29 of 25 units and the order from P27 of 31 already arrived in P29, so actually only the 25 units from P29 are pending plus any other smaller recent adjustments). In reality, the 365 in-transit minus the 301 lost leaves 64. To correct for this and force the OR backend to order despite a large 'phantom' pipeline, I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I am forecasting based on the current high-demand mean (~78) but adjusting mu_hat upward to roughly 4 periods of demand (L+1) minus the 64 units of real pipeline, aiming to trigger a substantial replenishment order. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=14) to capture the high volatility of the current regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-volume demand regime that started at Period 26, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 78 units and significant volatility (peaks > 110). Recent demand history (P35-P40) supports this stable average (92, 64, 56, 71, 94, 79). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system shows 365 units in-transit. However, historical analysis identifies three lost orders: Period 2 (139 units), Period 18 (23 units), and Period 30 (139 units). Subtracting these lost units (139 + 23 + 139 = 301) from the reported in-transit (365) leaves an effective pipeline of only 64 units. Given a lead time of 3 periods and current demand of ~78/period, the target inventory level (Base Stock) for L+1 (4 periods) should be approximately 312 units plus safety stock. With only 64 units effectively in-transit and 0 on-hand, there is a massive inventory deficit. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent high-volume mean (approx 80/period across 4 periods) and maintain L at 3 to align the OR backend with actual delivery performance.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues in a high-volume, high-volatility regime that started at Period 26. Since P26, the average demand is approximately 78 units per period, with significant fluctuations (range: 42 to 112). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity is 365, but this includes multiple confirmed lost orders: Period 2 (139 units), Period 18 (23 units), and Period 30 (139 units). Subtracting these (139 + 23 + 139 = 301 units) leaves an effective pipeline inventory of only 64 units (specifically, the order from Period 29 for 25 units is also long overdue and likely lost, while the Period 27 order for 31 units arrived in P29). Since Period 31, no arrivals have occurred, and no new orders were placed from P31 to P41, leading to a prolonged stockout. I will set L=3 based on consistent historical delays. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=16, covering P26 to present) to capture the current ~78 units/period demand regime. Given the zero on-hand inventory and the depleted real pipeline, the OR backend will calculate a base stock sufficient to cover (3+1) periods of demand (~312 units) and place a necessary order.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized into a high-volume, high-volatility pattern. Analysis of the last 17 periods (P26-P42) shows a mean demand of approximately 75 units, which is significantly higher than the low-volume phase (P17-P25) which averaged ~39 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory is listed as 365 units, but this includes multiple confirmed or highly probable lost orders: P2 (139 units), P18 (23 units), and P30 (139 units), totaling 301 lost units. The true effective pipeline inventory is only 64 units (365 - 301). Lead time is set to 3 periods because, despite the promise of 2, history consistently shows 3-period arrivals or total loss. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) = 4 periods of demand based on the recent high-volume regime (N=17 since P26), and sigma_hat will be set using recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock given the frequent spikes over 100 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Effective pipeline inventory further clarified. Total in-transit of 365 units includes confirmed/lost orders from P2 (139), P18 (23), and P30 (139). Effective in-transit is 64 units. Demand regime (P26-P42) confirmed stable at ~75 units mean with high volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. The total in-transit quantity of 365 units is misleading because it includes three confirmed lost orders: Period 2 (139 units), Period 18 (23 units), and Period 30 (139 units). Subtracting these (139+23+139=301) reveals an effective in-transit quantity of only 64 units (from Period 29's order of 25 units which hasn't concluded, and subsequent logic). Period 29 order of 25 units is 14 periods overdue and likely lost. Effective pipeline is effectively 0. The demand regime from Period 26 to Period 43 is stable at a high-volume, high-volatility state with a mean of approximately 76 units. Although the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time has historically averaged 3. Given the complete lack of arrivals since Period 29 despite the known 'lost' status of multiple shipments, I must set the lead time to an explicit value (L=3) and use recent history (N=18, covering P26-P43) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend attempts to recover from the stockout. I will set L to 3 to account for the likely 3-period delay once shipments resume.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Effective pipeline is 0. Recent orders from P2, P18, P29 (25 units), and P30 are all confirmed or highly likely lost. Demand regime (P26-P43) remains stable at ~76 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-volume demand regime that started at Period 26, characterized by a mean of approximately 76 units per period and significant volatility (range 42-112). On-hand inventory is 0 and the current in-transit visibility is misleading. Based on carry-over insights, the orders from P2 (139), P18 (23), P29 (25), and P30 (139) are all confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 326 units. Subtracting these from the current 'in-transit' of 365 leaves an effective pipeline of 39 units. The lead time is consistently 3 periods rather than the promised 2. To recover from 19 consecutive periods of stockouts and maximize profit for the final 5 periods of the game, I need the OR backend to place a substantial order immediately. I will set L to 3 (actual observed) and mu_hat to an explicit value covering (L+1) or 4 periods of demand at the recent mean (~76 * 4 = 304). Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility observed in the recent regime to ensure a sufficient safety stock buffer.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) since Period 26 has remained stable with a mean of approximately 78 units and significant volatility (range 42-112). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit units (365) are technically composed of orders from Period 2 (139), Period 18 (23), Period 29 (25), and Period 30 (139), plus others. Based on the history where the latest successful delivery occurred in Period 29 (a P27 order with lead_time=2), all 365 units currently cited in the pipeline are either confirmed or highly likely to be lost shipments, as they are between 16 and 44 periods overdue. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. To restore service for the remaining 5 periods of the game, I am setting L=3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and using recent_N for mu_hat (N=20 to capture the post-P26 regime) and sigma_hat. This will trigger the OR backend to place a new order that accounts for the reality of zero usable stock and zero expected arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Effective pipeline inventory remains 0; all 365 units in-transit are confirmed lost (at least 16 periods overdue). Demand regime (P26-P45) is stable at ~78 units/period with persistent high volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable high-volume demand regime since Period 26, averaging approximately 76-78 units per period with significant volatility (standard deviation ~20-22). The critical issue remains the supply chain: effective pipeline inventory is 0 as all 365 units currently marked 'In-transit' are confirmed or highly likely lost (orders from P2, P18, P29, and P30). The last successful arrival was in Period 29. Actual lead time, when shipments do arrive, has historically trended towards 3 periods rather than the promised 2. With on-hand inventory at 0 and no incoming stock, the priority is to re-establish the inventory pipeline. I will set L=3 to reflect actual historical lead time and use recent_N=21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (P26-P46) while providing enough statistical power to account for the high volatility.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues in a stable high-volume/high-volatility demand regime that began around Period 26. The mean demand for the last 20 periods (P28-P47) is approximately 75.8 units, with a standard deviation of 15.6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the 365 units 'in-transit' are all confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 18, 29, and 30, meaning the 'effective' pipeline is 0. To prevent persistent stockouts in the final periods, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 20-period demand average and sigma_hat to account for historical volatility. Although the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time has historically been 3 periods. I will use L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the likely delivery time. This approach aims to restore inventory levels to meet the stable ~76 unit/period demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in Period 49. Reviewing the inventory state: On-hand is 0, and In-transit is 365. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights, all 365 units currently in-transit (from Periods 2, 18, 29, and 30) are confirmed lost or significantly past any reasonable lead time, resulting in an effective pipeline of 0. The demand regime since Period 26 has returned to a high-volume, high-volatility state. While the mean from P26 to P45 was ~78, recent demand in P48 spiked to 143, reinforcing the high volatility. However, since the game ends at Period 50 and the lead time (L) is consistently 3 periods, any order placed now (Period 49) would not arrive until Period 52 (49 + 3), which is outside the simulation window. Therefore, the optimal decision for this final period is to set parameters such that no new order is generated, avoiding unnecessary holding costs or pipeline inventory for a period that will not be resolved.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Simulation end imminent. Lead time is 3 periods; orders placed in Period 49/50 will not arrive before the period 50 conclusion. Effective pipeline remains 0 as all in-transit units (365) are confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As Period 50 is the final period of the simulation, any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends (actual lead time is consistently 3 periods, and the arrival resolution for a Period 50 order would occur in the future). The current on-hand inventory is 0. All 365 units in-transit are confirmed lost (ordered in P2, P18, P29, and P30; all are at least 20 periods overdue). The demand regime has been stable since Period 26 with a mean of approximately 78 units and high volatility. However, since the goal is to maximize total reward and no new inventory can arrive to satisfy demand in the remaining time, ordering would only incur potential system costs or serve no purpose. I will maintain the current parameter logic, but logically, no units ordered now will impact the final score positively.
