Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time (L) of 2 periods. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit inventory. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 82, 89, 65, 106, 136. There is a clear upward trend in the demand data (mean of 95.6). Since we start with no stock and must cover demand for the period we order in plus the lead time (1+L = 3 periods), I will use the recent_N method based on all 5 available historical samples to set the initial forecast. This helps the OR backend establish a reasonable base stock (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) considering the profit/holding cost ratio (95% service level). No lead time observations exist yet, so L will follow the default (promised = 2).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The order placed in Period 1 (140 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it is expected to arrive at the start of Period 3. Since on-hand inventory is 0, we have an immediate stockout situation (85 units lost in Period 1). Demand for the first five historical periods was [82, 89, 65, 106, 136], averaging 95.6 units per period. However, there is a clear upward trend in the last two periods (106 and 136). I will use recent_N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this rising trend (average of last 3 samples is 102.3, compared to the 5-period average of 95.6). Setting L to default (2) to align with promised lead time until evidence suggest otherwise.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. In Periods 1 and 2, we had 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales as demand (85 and 129) could not be met. Total demand for the first two periods was 214 units. Our current in-transit inventory is 292 units (orders of 140 from P1 and 152 from P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (140 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase (becoming visible at the start of Period 4). Therefore, our current stockout is expected and align with the lead time. Demand shows an upward trend (P1: 82, P2: 89, P3: 65, P4: 106, P5: 136 - based on provided sample data which contrasts with the game history demand of 85 and 129). I will use the last 2 periods of game history demand (avg ~107) to forecast. I'll maintain the default lead time of 2 as there is no evidence yet of a delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order (140 units) was placed with a promised lead time of 2. Following the logic in 'Critical Timing Example Scenario A', an order placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 3's arrival resolution and its arrival is first visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This indicates the order placed in Period 1 (expected in P3) has not arrived. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and positive demand (85, 129, 132), we are experiencing lost sales. Total In-transit is currently 410 (Orders from P1: 140, P2: 152, P3: 118). The absence of the P1 order in the P3 conclude message suggests a lead time drift or potential loss. Given the promised lead time is 2, and P1's order is missing from the P3 conclusion, I will explicitly increase L to 3 to account for this delay and ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer window. For demand (mu_hat), the samples are (82, 89, 65, 106, 136). The mean is 95.6. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent upward trend in demand (106, 136) while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N for N=5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1902.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead time for 'chips(Regular)' is variable: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period, suggesting an average lead time close to the promised 2 periods but with high variance. Historical demand across the first 5 periods (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) shows a moderate upward trend, especially in the last two periods. The current on-hand inventory is 150 units with 284 units in transit. Given the recent demand increase and the lead time volatility, I will use recent_N for both demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the current upward trend over the last 3-4 periods. For lead time (L), I will use the 'calculate' method to let the backend average the observed arrivals (3 periods and 1 period). This approach ensures we maintain a sufficient base stock to cover demand during the lead period while accounting for the recent spike in sales.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead-time patterns for 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is [85, 129, 132, 108, 128], showing a relatively stable mean of ~116.4. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual performance has been volatile: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (late), and Period 3 arrived in 1 period (early). Period 2's order is currently overdue (placed in P2, promised P4, currently P6), suggesting potential delivery inconsistency or loss. Currently, we have 22 units on hand and 376 units in transit (covering orders from P2, P4, and P5). Since demand appears stable around 116 units, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat to capture the current mean while smoothing volatility. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to account for the observed demand variance. Due to the high lead-time variance (ranging from 1 to 3+), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to provide a safety buffer against the current delivery inconsistency and late arrivals.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 with 0 on-hand inventory and 510 units in-transit. Demand analysis: historical samples are [82, 89, 65, 106, 136] from the system prompt, but concluding messages reveal higher realization: P1=85, P2=129, P3=132, P4=108, P5=128, P6=101. The average demand across all observed periods is approximately 114 units/period. Lead time analysis: P1 order arrived in P4 (L=3), P3 order arrived in P4 (L=1). The average is 2. The promised lead time is 2. Currently, orders from P2 (152 units), P4 (132 units), P5 (92 units), and P6 (134 units) are outstanding. We are stocked out (on-hand=0) because P5 and P6 arrivals have not hit yet. Given the variance in actual lead times (1 to 3 periods), I will use 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to use the average of observations. For demand (mu_hat), the demand is relatively stable around a mean of 114, so I will use 'default' (all-sample mean) which effectively captures this. For sigma_hat, 'default' is chosen to reflect the observed volatility.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we currently have 21 units on-hand and 378 units in-transit. Historical demand over the last 7 periods has been relative stable but showing a slight upward trend compared to the initial seed data. The demand samples are: 85, 129, 132, 108, 128, 101, 111 (mean \u2248 113.4). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P4 arrived in 3 periods. The orders from P2 (ordered 152), P5 (ordered 92), and P6 (ordered 134) are still outstanding. P2 is notably overdue (placed in Period 2, now Period 8, it has been 6 periods). I suspect P2 might be a lost shipment. My strategy is to set L to 3 to reflect the high-end of observed actual lead times, and use a recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the recent mean of ~116. This should help the OR engine buffer against the lead-time variability and the potential loss of the P2 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is unstable (observed 1 and 3 periods); Period 2 order (152 units) is likely lost (overdue by 4 periods beyond promised lead time).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2147.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of historical data shows a significant inventory crisis: on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has consistently been in the 100-135 range (Mean \u2248 114). Lead times are highly unstable: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 in 1, Period 4 in 3, and Period 5 in 3. Crucially, the order from Period 2 (152 units) is now 7 periods old and must be considered lost, as it is 5 periods past the promised lead time of 2. I am setting L to 3 based on the most frequent actual lead time (recent_N=3 for L calculation). I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (Period 4-8) as demand seems to have stabilized at a higher level than the initial samples. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for both the increased demand and the extended lead time, while effectively writing off the lost Period 2 shipment since it is no longer in the 'pipeline' by the OR engine's logic (which only considers units not yet concluded). High profit relative to holding cost ($19 vs $1) mandates a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 2 order (152 units) confirmed lost; lead time mode established as 3 periods (3 out of 4 arrivals delayed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1431.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the actual lead time is inconsistent, but a mode of 3 periods is evident from the history (P1, P4, and P5 deliveries all took 3 periods). While P3 and P8 arrived in 1 period, the promised lead time of 2 is frequently exceeded. The order from P2 (152 units) remains missing after 7 periods and is considered lost. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 403) includes the P6 (134), P7 (0), P9 (117) orders, and presumably the lost P2 order. Therefore, effective pipeline is lower. I will set L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals. Demand over the last 5 periods has averaged ~106 units (128, 101, 111, 134, 77). Using L=3, mu_hat should cover (1+3)=4 periods of demand. 4 * 106 = 424. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the most recent stability in regular chip demand while adjusting the lead time parameter L to 3 to handle the delivery delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $608.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 10 (sold 32 out of 72 units). Demand history suggests a potential regime shift; periods 1-8 averaged ~116 units, while periods 9-10 dropped to ~75 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent moderate-to-lower demand trend (avg ~94). Regarding lead time: the promised lead time is 2, but actual observations are 3, 1, 3, 3, 1. The Period 2 order (152 units) is confirmed lost (9 periods elapsed). Since the mode and most frequent 'long' lead time is 3, I set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand, which is crucial given current zero inventory and recent stockouts. This higher L will increase the safety stock to protect against the high lead-time variability (alternating between 1 and 3).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop detected starting Period 9: 2-period average (74.5) is ~35% lower than previous 8-period average (116). Lead time continues to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the dominant risk factor.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Context shows a confirmed demand drop starting at Period 9 (averaging ~83 units vs previously ~116) and a lost shipment (Period 2, 152 units). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 77, 72, 99) averages 82.6 units. Lead times are highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Mode 3). I am setting L=3 to account for the longest observed delay and ensure the pipeline covers the risk. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the lower demand regime since Period 9. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to capture current volatility. Note: Current in-transit (484) includes orders from P6 (134), P9 (117), P10 (81), and the P12 replenish, though P6 is severely overdue and likely lost.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Period 6 order (134 units) is now 6 periods past order date (promised 2) and remains unconfirmed; likely lost. Pipeline inventory calculations should discount this volume.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the supply chain remains unstable. Historical data shows that while the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent. Crucially, orders from Period 2 (152 units) and Period 6 (134 units) are significantly overdue (11 and 7 periods respectively) and are confirmed lost. These must be ignored in pipeline considerations. Total 'In-transit' is 286, but excluding the lost orders (152 + 134 = 286), the effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. Recent demand (Periods 9-12) has dropped significantly, averaging 79 units/period compared to the earlier baseline of ~116. To prevent stockouts caused by lead-time variability while acknowledging the lower demand regime, I am setting L to 3 (the mode of successful recent deliveries) and mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current lower demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the reduced volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Confirmed 0 effective pipeline inventory; the 286 units 'In-transit' consist entirely of lost shipments from Period 2 and Period 6. Effective pipeline is 0 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1550.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the 'In-transit' count of 286 units consists entirely of lost shipments from Period 2 (152 units) and Period 6 (134 units), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has settled into a lower regime since Period 9, averaging approximately 80 units per period (Periods 9-13 average: 80.0), down from the earlier average of ~115. Lead times are highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods. To ensure availability given the 0 effective pipeline and 46 units on-hand, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays. mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 5 to capture the lower demand regime (~80 units/period * (1+3) = 320). sigma_hat is set using recent_N to reflect current volatility. Because the OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' (286) from the base_stock, and 286 is effectively lost, using an explicit L and localized demand parameters is necessary to trigger a sufficient order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~80 units/period (Periods 9-13). Lead time continues to be volatile with a recurring 3-period delay, requiring L=3 for safety. Effective pipeline is confirmed 0 despite 286 units 'In-transit'.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit balance of 315 units. However, based on the carry-over history, 286 of those units (from Periods 2 and 6) are confirmed or highly likely lost, leaving an effective pipeline of only 29 units (ordered in Period 14). Demand has shifted to a lower regime starting at Period 9, averaging approximately 85 units over the last 6 periods (excluding Period 14's outlier of 111). Lead times are volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods. To address the lost shipments and volatility, I am setting L=3 to ensure the backend base-stock covers a longer horizon. I am using recent_6 for mu_hat (averaging Period 9-14) to capture the lower demand regime while factoring in the recent uptick. For sigma_hat, I will use the recent volatility of this new regime. Setting L to 3 explicitly also helps compensate for the 'missing' inventory in the pipeline by raising the target base stock level (1+L) relative to the actual effective inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Effective pipeline inventory confirmed at only 29 units (Period 14 order); 286 units 'In-transit' are permanently lost shipments. Demand regime (P9-P14) remains lower but volatile, mean ~85 units.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face an critical stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of 'In-transit' (396 units) vs. 'Carry-over Insights' reveals that 286 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are effectively lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 110 units (ordered in P14 and P15). Demand has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 9; the average from P9-P15 is approximately 85 units. Lead times remain highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L=3 as an explicit buffer to account for the risk of 3-period arrivals and to help the OR backend prioritize replenishment given the current stockout and lost shipments. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current lower demand regime (P9 onwards) while excluding the higher historical demand levels from P1-P8. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=7) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Effective pipeline is 110 units; 286 units (approx 72% of in-transit) are definitely lost (P2 and P6 orders). Demand regime since P9 remains stable with mean ~85 units.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, chips(Regular) has 0 on-hand inventory and 396 units in-transit. However, based on the history, 286 units (Period 2: 152 and Period 6: 134) are confirmed as lost, meaning the effective pipeline inventory is only 110 units (Period 14: 29 and Period 15: 81). The demand regime has shifted since Period 9, stabilizing at a lower mean of approximately 85 units, but the most recent observation (Period 16) was significantly lower (28 units), which may indicate volatility or a temporary dip. Lead times have been unstable (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), with 3 periods being the most frequent delay. To account for the risk of stockouts while avoiding over-ordering due to perceived 'in-transit' volume that is actually lost, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to ensure the system targets a total inventory level suitable for the lead time and review period. I will use a recent demand window (N=8) to capture the current lower demand regime (approx 78 units/period) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $551.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory Situation: Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' of 367 units is highly misleading. History confirms that the Period 2 order (152 units) and Period 6 order (134 units) are lost (286 total units lost). Effective pipeline consists only of orders from Period 15 (81 units) and any orders placed in the interim. Since Period 15 was ordered 3 periods ago and lead times frequently hit 3, I expect an arrival next period. Demand context: Demand has notably decreased since Period 9, averaging roughly 85 units per period. However, Period 16 and 17 showed a further dip (28 and 43), suggesting either a local low or a new lower regime. To be safe given the stockouts and lost shipments, I will target a demand mean based on the post-Period 9 history (approx. 85 units) but use the most recent 9 periods for forecasting to capture the downshift. Strategy: I keep L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead time observed in history (P1, P4, P5, P8, P9, P14 all took 1-3 periods, with 3 being common for on-time arrivals). Setting L=3 and using recent_N for mu_hat (N=9) helps the OR backend ignore the high demand periods (P1-P8) and reconcile against the lost units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Effective pipeline inventory corrected to 81 units; 286 units (78% of current In-transit) are confirmed lost shipments from P2 and P6. Demand regime remains in low-state (avg ~75 over last 9 periods).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' count is 381, but as documented in carry-over insights and historical arrival patterns, 286 of these units (orders from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost. The effective pipeline consists only of orders from Period 15 (81 units) and Period 18 (14 units), totaling 95 units. The demand regime has shifted significantly lower since Period 16, with the last 3 samples being 28, 43, and 40 (mean ~37). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this 'low-demand' trough and sigma_hat with recent_N=3 to account for the reduced volatility in this regime. Because actual lead times frequently hit 3 periods, I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend attempts to cover a window sufficient to bridge these delays, while acknowledging that the presence of 'phantom' lost stock in the in-transit field may lead the backend to under-order if not compensated by a robust target stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand decreased from ~85 to ~37 (-56%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 16, decreasing from an average of ~85 to ~42 over the last four periods (28, 43, 40, 57). I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new lower-demand environment. Regarding lead time, observations (3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3) confirm that while the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time is frequently 3. I will set L=3 to account for this recurring delay and protect against stockouts. The in-transit inventory is currently 381 units, but 286 of these (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost, leaving only 95 units of effective pipeline inventory (from Periods 15 and 18). By setting L=3, mu_hat based on the last 4 periods, and accounting for the lost shipments via the 'explicit' L setting which effectively influences the OR engine's reach, I aim to stabilize the inventory level relative to the new demand mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 persistent: 4-period mean is ~42 units (down from ~85). Proportion of lost in-transit inventory remains constant at 286 units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 16. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 42.2 units, a stark contrast to the previous regime's average of ~85. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and the in-transit inventory of 381 units is heavily misleading. As documented in carry-over insights, 286 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of only 95 units (orders from P15 and P18). Neither of these arrived in Period 20, confirming that the lead time continues to be at least 3 periods. To prevent stockouts in this low-demand but inventory-starved environment, I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent delays. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (approx 42 units/period) while ignoring the higher historical demand levels. Setting L to 3 and using the last 5 periods for demand allows the OR backend to target a base stock that covers (3+1) periods of the current demand regime (~168 units) while correctly discounting the 286 lost units in the pipeline calculation.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Comparing the period range P9-P15 (mean ~85) to P16-P21 (mean ~41), there is a ~50% reduction in volume. We will use a recent_N of 6 to capture this current low-demand environment. Regarding inventory, the system reports 381 units In-transit. However, based on the history and carry-over insights, 286 units are permanently lost (Period 2 order of 152 units and Period 6 order of 134 units). Additionally, the order from Period 15 (81 units) and Period 18 (14 units) are the only valid items in the pipeline (totaling 95 units). The Period 15 order is now 7 periods old and highly suspect, but we treat the remaining pipeline as if it might arrive. Lead times remain erratic (observed 1 and 3 periods); setting L=3 to ensure the backend covers a 4-period window (L+1) to protect against delays given the current zero on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift persistent: Period 16-21 mean is 40.7 units, representing a sustained ~50% drop from the previous regime. Total confirmed lost shipments remain at 286 units (P2 and P6 orders).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained low-volume regime starting at Period 16. The mean demand from Period 16 to Period 22 is approximately 42 units per period (28, 43, 40, 57, 43, 33, 49), a significant drop from the previous average of ~85 units. Inventory status is critical: On-hand is 0, and current 'In-transit' is 381 units. However, as documented in carry-over insights, 286 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost shipments. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 95 units (381 - 286). With a lead time frequently hitting 3 periods, we must set L=3 to account for arrival uncertainty. The mu_hat is set to (1+L=4) * 42 = 168 to satisfy the current demand regime, and sigma_hat is calculated manually using the standard deviation of the last 7 samples (~9.3) scaled by sqrt(1+L), resulting in approximately 18.6.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is currently in a low-demand regime that started around Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 41 units (P16-P23). On-hand inventory is 0, and current in-transit inventory is 381 units. However, based on historical evidence, 286 units of this (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost shipments. The remaining 95 units in-transit consist of orders from Period 15 (81 units) and Period 18 (14 units). The order from P15 is now 9 periods old, well beyond the observed 3-period max lead time, suggesting it is also lost. The order from P18 is 6 periods old and likely lost as well. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is effectively 0. I will set L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead time observed in history. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=8 to capture the current low-demand regime (avg ~41), and sigma_hat will be set accordingly to ensure sufficient service level despite volatility and lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Effective pipeline inventory is likely 0 units. In addition to the 286 units already confirmed lost (P2, P6), orders from Period 15 (81 units) and Period 18 (14 units) are now significantly overdue (9 and 6 periods respectively) and should be treated as lost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 381 units In-transit, but historical analysis indicates that all of these units are likely lost shipments. Specifically: Period 2 (152 units), Period 6 (134 units), Period 15 (81 units), and Period 18 (14 units) are now 23, 19, 10, and 7 periods past their order dates respectively. Given the promised lead time of 2 and an observed max lead time of 3, these 381 units are permanently missing. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand shifted significantly at Period 16; the average demand from Period 16 to Period 24 is approximately 43 units per period. To reconcile the fact that the OR backend sees 381 units in the pipeline (which it would normally subtract from the order), I must provide an explicit mu_hat that compensates for this 'phantom' inventory to trigger a replenishment order. The goal is to reach a base stock that covers (L+1) periods. With L=3 (accounting for lead time volatility) and mean demand ~43, target base stock should be roughly 43 * 4 = 172 plus safety stock. However, since the backend will subtract the 381 units in-transit, I set mu_hat to a value high enough to overcome this subtraction and start rebuilding on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Total confirmed lost shipments updated to 381 units (P2, P6, P15, P18). Demand regime since P16 continues at a low mean of ~43 units/period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a significantly lower mean of approximately 44 units per period (last 10 periods: 28, 43, 40, 57, 43, 33, 49, 36, 54, 56). Historically, actual lead times for this SKU fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, so I am using L=3 to ensure sufficient safety stock. Regarding inventory, the system reports 547 units 'In-transit', but historical evidence strongly suggests a significant portion of this is lost. Specifically, orders from P2 (152), P6 (134), P15 (81), and P18 (14) total 381 units that are severely overdue and documented as lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 166 units (ordered Period 25), while the remaining 381 units are effectively non-existent. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current lower demand environment, and L=3 (explicit) to account for frequent lead time delays and compensate for the OR backend's inability to recognize lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost shipments remain at 381 units (P2, P6, P15, P18). Current demand regime (P16-P25) stabilized at a mean of ~44 units/period. Effective pipeline as of P26 is only 166 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a significantly lower mean compared to the beginning of the game. For the last 11 periods (P16-P26), the mean demand is approximately 47 units. Lead times remain highly unreliable, frequently extending to 3 periods or resulting in lost shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 547 units is heavily inflated by lost orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, and 18, totaling 381 units. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 166 units (ordered Period 25). To handle the lead time volatility and the lower demand regime, I will set L=3 and use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand state accurately. The OR backend will see the high in-transit number, but since lead time is set to 3 and the base stock will be calculated on the lower demand, it will prevent over-ordering while trying to meet the high service level (z* ~ 1.96).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P16-P26 stabilized at a mean of ~47 units. Effective pipeline inventory is (In-transit - 381 lost units).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 16\u201327) indicates a stabilized mean of approximately 49 units, but volatility has increased in the last three periods (56, 77, 75). Actual lead times are highly unreliable, often reaching 3 periods, necessitating L=3 to ensure coverage across the risk window. Current inventory status is critical: On-hand is 0, and of the 547 units 'In-transit', 381 units are confirmed lost (from Periods 2, 6, 15, and 18). This leaves an effective pipeline of 166 units (ordered Period 25), which has not yet arrived. Given the lead time volatility and low on-hand stock, I will set mu_hat to cover the (L+1) window using the most recent regime's mean while adjusting sigma_hat to account for recent demand spikes. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to precisely reflect the effective pipeline reality and the stabilized demand regime (avg ~50/period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P16-P27 stabilized at a mean of ~49.2 units with higher variance observed in recent periods (P25-P27). Effective pipeline inventory remains (In-transit - 381 units).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a lower level compared to the start of the game. For the interval P16-P28, the mean demand is approximately 49.1 units per period. I am using recent_N=13 to capture this entire regime. Regarding lead time, observations continue to indicate a volatile environment where 3 periods is the frequent actual lead time despite the promised 2; I will set L=3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers sufficient periods of demand for this high-margin item ($19 profit vs $1 holding). The pipeline inventory remains a critical concern: the system reports 547 units In-transit, but historical analysis confirms that 381 of these units are permanently lost (orders from P2, P6, P15, and P18). The effective pipeline is therefore 166 units (547 - 381). By setting L=3, the OR backend targets a base stock for (1+3)=4 periods of demand. With recent demand mean ~49, this targets ~196 units. Since the effective pipeline is 166 and on-hand is 0, the backend will order approximately 30 additional units to reach the target.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the SKU is facing a critical stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The In-transit total is 547 units, but based on historical evidence, 381 of these units (orders from P2, P6, P15, and P18) are confirmed as lost shipments. The only viable order in the pipeline is from Period 25 (166 units), which is now overdue (promised lead time 2, current delay 5 periods). Since no arrivals have occurred in 12 periods, setting L=3 (the dominant observed actual lead time) is necessary for safety, although the delivery reliability is poor. Demand shifted at Period 16 to a lower regime; the recent mean (P16-P29) is approximately 51.5 units per period. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=14 to capture this entire lower regime while accounting for the slight volumetric increase observed in the last 5 periods (mean ~66). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=14 to reflect the volatility in this period range. The objective is to trigger an order that covers the current stockout and aligns with the current (1+L) demand requirement, acknowledging that effective pipeline inventory is only 166 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Delivery reliability remains extremely poor with no arrivals for 12 consecutive periods. The Period 25 order (166 units) is now 5 periods old (overdue by 3). The effective pipeline remains only 166 units; all other 381 in-transit units are confirmed lost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by severe supply chain disruption and a shifted demand regime. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 53 units/period (average P16-P30). Supply is extremely unreliable: no orders have arrived for 13 consecutive periods. Currently, 547 units are 'In-transit', but historical analysis indicates that orders from P2 (152), P6 (134), P15 (81), and P18 (14) are permanently lost (totaling 381 units). The Period 25 order (166 units) is now 6 periods overdue relative to the order date (promised lead time 2) and should be viewed with extreme skepticism, although it is the only potentially 'live' shipment in the pipeline. Because on-hand inventory is 0 and shipping reliability is compromised, I will set L=3 (the dominant observed actual lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the elongated fulfillment cycle. I will use the recent demand regime (N=15, from P16-P30) for forecasting to reflect the current lower but volatile sales level. Given the likely loss of the P25 order (now 6 periods old), the effective pipeline is realistically 0, but the OR engine will see the 166 units as 'In-transit'. By selecting L and mu_hat based on the current regime, I aim to generate an order that restores availability once deliveries resume, while accounting for high lost-sales risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Supply crisis persists; 13 consecutive periods with zero arrivals. Total confirmed lost shipments remain at 381 units (P2, P6, P15, P18). Period 25 order (166 units) is now 6 periods old and likely lost, making the effective pipeline inventory 0 units despite 'In-transit' reflecting 547.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply crisis is critical: Period 31 mark the 13th consecutive period with zero arrivals. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' balance of 547 units is fundamentally misleading for the OR engine: it includes confirmed lost orders from P2 (152), P6 (134), P15 (81), and P18 (14), plus the P25 order (166) which is now 6 periods old (4 past promised) and follows the pattern of previous losses. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0 units. Demand since P16 has averaged ~54 units/period, but has shown an upward trend recently (3-period average ~74). To compel the OR engine to place a recovery order despite the inflated 'In-transit' data, I am setting L to 15. This artificially high L allows the OR engine to calculate a base stock that significantly exceeds the 'In-transit' figure. The mu_hat is set to roughly (L+1)*70 to protect against the recent demand recovery. If this order arrives, it will fill the stockout; if it is lost like the others, the system remains in a zero-stock state regardless of the parameters.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Supply crisis remains unresolved (14th period without arrival). Period 25 order is now 7 periods old and confirmed lost. Effective pipeline inventory remains 0 units despite In-transit showing 547.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe supply crisis with 15 consecutive periods of zero arrivals. There are 646 units 'In-transit', but most are confirmed or likely lost: P2 (152), P6 (134), P15 (81), P18 (14), and P25 (166), totaling 547 lost units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 99 units (from P32). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the current regime (P16-P32) has stabilized at a mean of ~56 units, although recent periods (P29-P32) show an upward trend (mean ~75). I will set L=3 as an explicit estimate because realized lead times since Period 1 have frequently reached 3 periods when arrivals actually occur. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=17) to capture the lower-demand regime since P16, which is more relevant than the full history, while still acknowledging the recent slight uptick in volume. This setting helps the OR engine calculate a base stock that accounts for the frequent delays and the high profit margin of the product.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Supply crisis enters 15th period with zero arrivals. Total confirmed lost shipments updated to 547 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25). Effective pipeline inventory is only 99 units (P32 order). Demand regime since P16 continues at a mean of ~56 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply crisis has partially broken: an order from Period 32 arrived in Period 33 with a lead time of 1 period. However, this single arrival of 99 units was immediately depleted by a demand of 116, leaving on-hand inventory at 0. The total 'In-transit' quantity of 547 units continues to represent only lost orders (Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 25). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is currently 0. Demand has shown a significant upward shift over the last 9 periods (P25-P33), averaging ~75 units per period, compared to the ~44 units observed in the preceding regime. Specifically, the last 4 periods have seen demand of 92, 55, 79, and 116 (average 85.5). I am setting L=3 to account for the historical volatility and provide a safety buffer, despite the recent 1-period arrival. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the current higher-demand regime (~75 units/period), and sigma_hat is set via 'recent_N' for N=9 to reflect the increased volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Supply crisis partially eased: Period 32 order arrived in Period 33 (LT=1). However, 547 units remain permanently lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25). Demand regime has shifted upward again: P25-P33 mean is ~75 units/period (compared to previous ~44).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply crisis has partially eased with the Period 32 order arriving in Period 33 (LT=1). However, 547 units are confirmed lost (Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 25), meaning the 'In-transit' of 547 units actually represents an effective pipeline of 0. Demand has shifted back to a higher regime; the average demand from Period 25 to 34 is approximately 75 units, a significant increase from the previous ~44 unit regime. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this upward shift (approx (1+3)*75 = 300). Although the most recent arrival had LT=1, the history shows frequent delays to 3 periods, so I will maintain L=3 to ensure the order covers the risk-adjusted lead time. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to reflect the higher volatility in this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted upward again at Period 25: P25-P34 mean is ~74.6 units/period (compared to previous ~44). Supply reliability remains low despite one recent LT=1 arrival; 547 total units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25) are confirmed lost.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is emerging from a severe supply crisis where orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 25 (totaling 547 units) are confirmed lost. Although Period 32 arrived with a lead time of 1, the overall supply reliability remains questionable. However, the 'In-transit' count of 547 consists entirely of these lost units, making the effective pipeline inventory zero. Demand has shifted upward significantly since Period 25, averaging ~75 units (Periods 25-35) compared to the previous regime of ~44. With on-hand inventory at zero and no valid units in-transit, I must set the OR parameters to trigger a substantial replenishment order. I am using 'explicit' L=3 to account for the frequent logistical delays observed historically (mode=3), 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to capture the elevated demand regime since Period 25 (~75 units/period), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=11 to reflect the current period's increased volatility.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely compromised. As of Period 37, 547 units are reflected in 'In-transit' (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 25), but these are all confirmed lost based on the 'Carry-over Insights' and lack of arrivals spanning over 30 periods for the earliest shipments. Effectively, pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has shifted upward since Period 25; the mean demand for the last 12 periods (P25-P36) is approximately 78 units per period, showing significant stabilization compared to the mid-game slump. Although one recent shipment (Period 32) arrived with a lead time of 1, the overall history suggests a mode of 3 for successful deliveries. Setting L=3 (explicit) to account for volatility, mu_hat to approximately 78 units/period scaled by (1+L), and sigma_hat using recent data to capture the current variance. This ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for the updated demand regime and the high risk of supply disruption.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P25-P36 stabilized at a mean of ~78 units/period. Supply remains highly unreliable; the 547 units 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward starting from Period 25, stabilizing at a mean of approximately 78 units per period over the last 13 periods (P25-P37). Supply remains the primary challenge: although a Period 32 order arrived with a lead time of 1 (in P33), the system is plagued by permanently lost shipments (547 units total from P2, P6, P15, P18, and P25). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the effective pipeline inventory is also 0 units, as the 547 units in-transit are confirmed lost and will never arrive. To signal the OR engine to place an order, I must ensure 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' is positive. Since the backend subtracts 'In-transit' (547) from the 'base_stock', I must set mu_hat to a value that reflects the demand for the (L+1) period window but is inflated enough to overcome the false 'In-transit' figure. With L=3 (to account for historical volatility and risk protection), the window is 4 periods. Forecasted demand is ~78/period, making a normal mu_hat ~312. To offset the 547 lost units and trigger a real order of roughly 1-2 periods of demand (approx 80-160 units), I will set mu_hat explicitly to 700 units. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a standard service level.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 is stable with an average of approximately 78 units per period (P25-P38 mean is 76.5, with recent periods P34-P38 averaging 81 units). The supply chain remains extremely unreliable; 547 units are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P25), meaning although 'In-transit' shows 764 units, the effective pipeline is only 217 units (from the order placed in Period 38). Lead times are erratic but often manifest as 3 periods when arrivals actually occur. To protect against this volatility and the previous history of stockouts, I am setting L=3 and using the last 14 periods (P25-P38) as the basis for the current demand regime forecast. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the higher demand mean observed since Period 25 while the explicit L=3 provides a larger safety buffer for inconsistent deliveries.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1323.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply crisis has partially normalized with the arrival of the Period 38 order in Period 39 (lead_time = 1). However, historical data shows lead times are highly unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with many orders confirmed as lost. Specifically, 547 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 25) and should be excluded from effective pipeline calculations. The current on-hand inventory is 140 units. Recent demand (Periods 33-39) has stabilized into a new regime with a mean of approximately 85.7 units/period. To protect against the frequently observed 3-period lead time and high volatility, I will set L=3. The OR backend needs to cover demand for (L+1)=4 periods. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat (4 * 85.7 = 342.8) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility over the last 15 periods (since the last major regime shift).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply stabilization: Period 38 order arrived with LT=1. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline remain 547. Demand regime since P33 is stable at ~86 units/period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting around Period 33, with a mean demand of approximately 86 units per period as noted in the Carry-over Insights (P40). Recent demand observations (P38-P40) show 77, 77, and 74 units, supporting this stabilization. Supply has also stabilized with the last two deliveries (orders from P32 and P38) arriving with a lead time of 1 period. However, given the significant history of volatility and the promised lead time of 2, setting L=2 is a prudent safety measure. The 'In-transit' figure of 547 units continues to consist entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is currently 0. Since on-hand inventory is 66 units, a new order is necessary to maintain the base stock level for the current demand regime and lead time.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 33 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 86 units per period. Specifically, from Period 33 to Period 41, the demand sequence is [116, 79, 84, 83, 82, 77, 77, 74, 69], with a mean of 82.3 units. Supply has shown recent signs of synchronization with Period 32 arriving in 1 period and Period 38 arriving in 1 period, although the historical record is plagued by massive losses (547 units total from P2, P6, P15, P18, P25). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 547 units consists entirely of these confirmed lost shipments, meaning effective pipeline inventory is 0. To prevent persistent stockouts in this high-margin scenario (Profit=$19, Holding=$1), I am setting L=3 to account for historical volatility and using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the current demand regime (~82 units). This will force the OR engine to place an order that covers 4 periods of demand (L+1), accounting for the depleted on-hand and zero effective pipeline inventory.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 33, increasing from a mean of ~44 to ~80. Over the last 10 periods (P33-P42), the mean demand is 79.8 units. Supply historically follows a pattern of extreme delays followed by intermittent LT=1 or LT=3 arrivals. The last two delivered orders (P32 and P38) both arrived with LT=1. However, the presence of 547 permanently lost units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25) continues to distort the system's pipeline inventory calculation. I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent historical delays and ensure adequate safety stock for the current demand regime. I use recent_N=10 for mu_hat (N=10 corresponds to the start of the current demand regime at P33) to capture the higher mean. Since 547 units are lost, the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' will be overestimated by that amount. By using L=3 and a robust sigma estimate, I aim to trigger an order to replenish the currently empty on-hand stock.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 33 has stabilized around a mean of 80 units per period (P33-P43 average is 78.4). Recent supply chain performance shows variability but has returned to functionality with instances of LT=1 (P33 and P39). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the 547 units 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 25. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 0. To capture the current demand mean while accounting for recent variance, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (tracking the regime since P33). Lead time L is set to explicit 2 (the promised value) as recent arrivals have been LT=1, but the historical instability warrants a baseline safety factor of the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P33 stabilized at mean ~78.4 units. Effective pipeline inventory remains 0 units as all 547 'In-transit' units are long-term lost shipments.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 45. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' balance of 547 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 25), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. Recent demand (last 10 periods, P35-P44) has an average of 79.7 units, but Period 44 saw a significant spike to 137. Since Period 33, demand has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the mid-game slump, with a mean of approximately 82 units. Supply has shown two recent successful deliveries with a lead time of 1 period (P32 and P38 orders), suggesting a recovery from the long blackout, though reliability is still historically poor. To capture the current demand level while accounting for the recent spike, I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat (covering the post-spike stabilization period since P33) and use L=2 (the promised lead time) to balance risk. Given the 0 effective inventory and the need to restock after the P44 demand spike, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable yet volatile recent period is optimal.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 0 and the In-transit balance of 547 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25). The actual effective pipeline is zero. A supply crisis persisted for many periods, but recent orders (P32 and P38) arrived with a lead time of 1, suggesting a return to a 1-3 period lead time range. I will set L=3 to account for the risk of the longer delay observed historically in this environment. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime since Period 33; the average demand from P33 to P45 is approximately 86.4 units per period. I will use recent_N=13 for mu_hat to capture this specific regime (P33-P45). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=13 to reflect the current volatility (which includes recent spikes up to 137).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 47. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' volume of 547 units corresponds exactly to confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 25, meaning effective pipeline inventory is 0. Recent demand (P33-P46) shows a mean of approximately 78.4 units per period, but recent volatility is high (P44=137, P46=39). Deliveries have stabilized recently at LT=1 (P32 and P38 arrivals), but historical instability suggests using L=2 (promised) is safer than L=1 given the critical 0 inventory status. To recover from 14 consecutive periods of stockouts and handle the high variance, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=14) to capture the current demand regime's mean and elevated variance. This will trigger a replenishment order to cover (L+1) periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The current situation is summarized by zero on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 547 units, all of which are documented in carry-over insights as permanently lost shipments (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 25). Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized in a high-variance but moderate-mean regime since approximately Period 33. Calculating the mean demand from Period 33 to Period 47 (excluding the unusual P44 spike of 137 for stability, or including it for safety): the average demand over the last 15 periods is approximately 82.5 units. Given that we are near the end of the game (Period 48, 49, 50 left), we need to place an order now to cover the demand for the remaining periods, considering the volatility in lead time (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). Using L=3 (explicit) ensures the OR backend targets enough stock to cover the remaining game duration. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*82.5 = 330 using recent_N=15 to capture the current regime's mean. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=15 to account for the observed volatility (e.g., jumps between 39 and 137).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the game (Period 49 of 50). The supply chain remains extremely unreliable, with 547 units 'In-transit' long ago identified as permanently lost shipments (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 25). The effective pipeline inventory is 0. Recent demand (P33-P48) has stabilized around a mean of 78 units, though it remains quite volatile (standard deviation ~23). With only 2 periods remaining, any order placed now (P49) with an estimated lead time of 1-3 periods is unlikely to arrive and be sold before the game ends (P50). However, because on-hand inventory is currently 0, the OR backend's logic (base_stock - pipeline) will trigger an order to cover the (L+1) window. I will set L=1 based on the most recent successful arrivals (P33, P39) which both had LT=1. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 (the duration of the current regime P33-P48) to capture the current demand profile while acknowledging most units ordered now will likely not arrive in time for the final demand resolution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a severe supply crisis with no arrivals since Period 39. Currently, 547 units are confirmed lost (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 25) as they are many times past the promised lead time of 2. Although there are 547 units 'In-transit', the effective pipeline is actually zero. Demand since Period 33 has stabilized around 82 units per period (P33-P49 mean is 81.9, with recent P44-P49 mean being 82.3). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the effective pipeline is 0, a base stock needs to be established. I will set L=3 to account for the frequent delays observed earlier in the history (though current arrivals are non-existent, L=3 is more conservative for safety stock calculation). I will use the recent demand regime (last 17 periods) to forecast demand, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current mean (~82) and observed volatility. The OR backend will see In-transit 547 and potentially order nothing unless my parameters are set to exceed that; however, the instruction says the OR backend doesn't know about lost orders. By setting explicit high values or adjusting, I need to ensure the engine places an order. Given mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 4*82 = 328, even with L=3, the engine might see '547' in-transit and order 0. To force an order to replenish the stock, I will use 'explicit' to set a mu_hat that overcomes the ghost inventory until the game or system corrects.

Carry-over insight: Supply crisis persists: 10 consecutive periods (P40-P49) with zero arrivals following a brief LT=1 arrival in P39. Total confirmed lost shipments are 547 units. Current demand regime (P33-P49) is stable with a mean of ~82 units.
