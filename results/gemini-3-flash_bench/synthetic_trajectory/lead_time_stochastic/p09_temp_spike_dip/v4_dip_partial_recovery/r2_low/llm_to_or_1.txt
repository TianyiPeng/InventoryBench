Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 initialization. There is no historical data yet, and we are starting with 0 inventory. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods indicates a mean of approximately 95.6 (82, 89, 65, 106, 136). Since this is the first decision, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the provided sample data (95.6 * (1 + 2) = 286.8) and sigma_hat based on the standard deviation of those samples (~27.6 * sqrt(3) = 47.8). I'll use the 'explicit' method for the first period to ensure a strong initial order given 0 on-hand, then transition to more automated methods as observations conclude.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 141 units and faced a demand of 108 units. However, because the promised lead time is 2 periods, the order placed in Period 1 is not expected to arrive until the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Consequently, we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 141 units in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 108, which is higher than the historical sample mean (approx. 95.6). Since we have no historical lead time data yet to contradict the promise, I will use 'default' for L. For demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to weigh the recent samples (P3-P5 from historical data plus P1) more heavily, as demand seems to be trending slightly higher than the overall historical average. This helps the OR engine set a base stock that accounts for both the lead time and the current demand volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Looking at the history, we have placed two orders (P1: 141 units, P2: 145 units) totaling 286 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in P1 should arrive during P3's arrival resolution (after this decision phase) and will be visible in the P3 conclude message. Therefore, seeing 'arrived=0' in the P1 and P2 conclude messages is expected and does not yet indicate a delay. Demand for P1 and P2 was 108 and 144 respectively, but since on-hand inventory was 0, no sales occurred. With no historical sales data available but demand samples provided (82, 89, 65, 106, 136), I will use the recent demand trend to set the forecast. The average demand of all samples is ~95.6. Given the upward trend in the last few samples (106, 136), I'll use a recent N approach for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the recent scale. I will keep L at default as no evidence suggests the lead time is not the promised 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. Historical demand reflects a range [82, 136] with an average around 95.6 over 5 seen samples, though the 'game history' demand records show slightly higher values (108, 144, 142), suggesting a possible upward trend or variance. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 336 units in-transit. The in-transit units consist of orders from P1 (141), P2 (145), and P3 (50). The promised lead time is 2. Following the logic: P1 order (placed at start of P1) should arrive during resolution phase of P1+2=P3. We would see confirmation of this in 'Period 3 conclude' (read at start of Period 4). However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests a lead time delay (actual L > 2) or a lost shipment. Since the P1 order (141 units) didn't arrive in P3, and we have 0 stock to satisfy demand, we are experiencing stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture recent higher volume and 'explicit' L=3 to account for the observed delay from the P1 order.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical data for Period 5 is provided in the prompt (demand: 136). The game history shows that Period 4 concluded with an ending inventory of 107. Lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods (Period 4), while Period 3 order arrived in 1 period (Period 4). The Period 2 order (145 units) is still in transit as of the start of Period 5, meaning its lead time is at least 3 periods. Current demand shows a rising trend (82, 89, 65, 106, 136). To account for the recent increase in demand and the volatility in lead times, I am selecting recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples to capture the upward movement. I will stick to the promised lead time of 2 for 'L' to avoid over-ordering, as the backend will factor in the large 'In-transit' quantity (310) when calculating the order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the historical demand and lead-time performance for chips(Regular). Demand samples (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) from the pre-game and actuals from P1-P5 (108, 144, 142, 84, 55) show significant volatility. The mean across all 10 samples is approximately 101.1. Regarding lead time, the promised L=2 has shown variance: P1 order arrived in 3 periods, while P3 order arrived in 1 period. The P2 order (145 units) is currently overdue (placed P2, should have arrived by P4 conclude, but hasn't appeared). This suggests potential shipment loss or higher lead-time variance. Currently, we have 52 units on-hand and 310 in-transit (P2, P4 orders). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed 3 and 1. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (P1-P5) to capture the most recent demand level (avg 106.6), ensuring we cover (L+1) periods of demand while minimizing excess inventory due to the high holding cost.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 6. Historical demand (P1-P6) averages 104.5 units, though recent periods show high variability (142, 84, 55, 94). Observation of lead times: P1 order arrived in 3 periods; P3 order arrived in 1 period. This averages to 2 periods, matching the promised lead time. However, the order from P2 (145 units) is now overdue (it's been 5 periods since P2), suggesting it might be lost or significantly delayed. Total in-transit is 375, comprising P2(145), P4(165), and P6(65). If P2 is lost, effective pipeline is only 230. Since the OR backend cannot account for lost orders, I will set 'L' to 'calculate' to use the observed average (2) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent demand trend (avg ~77). Given the inventory stockout and potential lost shipment, I want a slightly higher safety stock, so I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture higher historical volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time for 'chips(Regular)' is unstable. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual observed lead times have been 3, 1, and 3 periods, averaging 2.33. The most recent order (Period 4) arrived in 3 periods. Demand has shown significant variability, ranging from 55 to 144, with a recent mean over the last 5 periods (Periods 3-7) of approximately 97.8. Given the lead time is frequently 3 periods, I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock covers a longer window (L+1=4 periods). I will use a recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~98/period) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 210, and on-hand is 51, totaling 261 units, which covers roughly 2.6 periods of demand. Adjusting L to 3 allows the OR engine to target a higher inventory level to buffer against lead-time delays and stockouts seen in Period 6.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is unstable (observed: 3, 1, 3); setting L to 3 to buffer against delivery delays. Demand avg (P3-P7) is ~98 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are managing regular chips with a profit and holding cost both at $1.00, implying a target service level of 50%. The current on-hand inventory is 1 unit. There are 341 units in transit (145 from P2, 65 from P6, 131 from P8). The shipment from P2 is now significantly overdue (7 periods since ordering), suggesting it might be lost. Observed lead times have been 3, 1, and 3 periods, making the 'promised' 2-period lead time unreliable. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for this instability and avoid stockouts. Historical demand since Period 3 shows a mean of 89.8 (samples: 142, 84, 55, 94, 114, 50). Using N=6 for mu_hat captures this recent range. Sigma_hat remains on 'default' to incorporate overall volatility. Total pipeline inventory is high (341), but because the P2 order (145 units) is likely lost, the OR's base-stock calculation needs to ensure sufficient ordering to cover the (L+1) window of 4 periods of demand (~360 units).

Carry-over insight: P2 order (145 units) likely lost: 7 periods elapsed with no arrival vs max observed lead time of 3.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the order from Period 2 (145 units) is definitively lost (8 periods elapsed since ordering). Recent lead times have been highly erratic, alternating between 3 periods (P1, P4) and 1 period (P3, P8). To protect against the 3-period delay and potential lost shipments, I am setting L to 3. Demand over the last 7 periods (P3-P9) has averaged 93 units per period (142, 84, 55, 94, 114, 50, 113). Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the expected demand over (L+1) periods. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility and mean demand, while setting L explicitly to 3 to ensure the backend accounts for the maximum observed lead time for safety.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (145 units) confirmed lost (8 periods elapsed). Lead time remains erratic; using L=3 for safety. Average demand (P3-P9) stable at ~93 units.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after stockout in Period 10. The historical lead times observed are 3, 1, 3, 1, showing significant variance compared to the promised 2 periods. Currently, 354 units are in-transit (orders from P6, P9, and P10). The P2 order (145 units) is confirmed lost as 9 periods have elapsed. Demand remains relatively stable; the mean demand from P3 to P10 is approximately 90.3 units. To account for the lead time instability and recurrent stockouts, I will use an explicit lead time L=3 to ensure the backend logic targets a 4-period demand window (L+1). For mu_hat, I will use a recent_N (N=8) to capture the stable demand regime since the initial periods, which averages ~90 units/period, resulting in mu_hat = 4 * 90 = 360. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=8) to capture current volatility.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (On-hand: 0). The history shows highly erratic lead times (observed: 3, 1, 3, 1 periods). Crucially, the P10 order (126 units) and P11 order (8 units) have not arrival yet; given the maximum seen lead time is 3, P10 should arrive by Period 13 conclude (viewable P14). The P2 order is definitively lost (10 periods elapsed). Demand remains relatively stable, with the average over the last 9 periods (P3-P11) being approximately 92.2 units. Given the lead time volatility and the current stockout, I will maintain L=3 to ensure the backend builds a sufficient buffer (covering L+1=4 periods of demand). I choose 'recent_N' with N=9 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the initial noise. Sigma_hat is set to 20 (explicit) to account for the standard deviation observed in the stable regime (~31) while balancing against high holding costs, as our stockout is currently driven by lead-time variance rather than demand spikes.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the on-hand inventory is 34 units with 225 units in-transit (orders from P11, P12, and potentially earlier untracked orders). Historical data shows highly unstable lead times (1, 2, and 3 periods). The order from Period 2 (145 units) is definitively lost after 11 periods. Average demand over the last 10 periods (P3-P12) is 94 units per period. Given the service level target (q = 0.5 since profit=1, holding=1) and the high volatility of lead times, I will continue to use an explicit lead time of 3 to provide a safety buffer. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 10-period average of 94 units is stable, so I will set mu_hat using the last 10 samples. Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 10 samples to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 13 (demand 149 vs. starting inventory 34). There are 342 units in transit (orders from P6, P11, P12, P13). Note that the Period 6 order (65 units) is now 8 periods overdue and definitively lost, which is subtracted from effective pipeline inventory assessment. Lead times remain volatile (1, 2, and 3 observed). I will continue using L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for potential delays. Recent demand (P10-P13) has averaged 109 units, showing a slight increase from the previous average of ~93. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this trend for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using a higher L estimate (3 instead of the promised 2) forces a higher base stock level to protect against stockouts given the recent history of lost shipments and variable delivery times.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (65 units) confirmed lost (8 periods elapsed). Demand regime shift detected at P12: avg demand (P12-P13) increased to ~130 units, though full sample (P10-P13) is 109.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 15. The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 429 units in-transit. Based on the history, lead times are erratic (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), and we've confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 and Period 6. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show a mix: P8(1), P9(3), P10(2), P11(3). I will continue using L=3 (explicit) to provide a safety buffer against these delays and potential stockouts. Regarding demand, Period 13 saw a spike (149), but Period 14 dropped significantly (64). The recent average demand (P12-P14) is approximately 107.7 units per period. The carry-over insight noted a shift at P12. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this latest regime including the spike and the drop. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current volatility.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and demand consistently exceeding available stock. In-transit inventory (424 units) comprises several orders (P13, P14, P15), but history shows significant volatility in lead times (ranging from 1 to 3 periods) and confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6). To protect against stockouts and lead-time variability, I am maintaining L=3 for the inventory position calculation. Demand has stabilized recently: the last 5 periods (P11-P15) show an average of 105.4 units, which is higher than the long-term average. Specifically, recent fluctuation (P13-P15) shows a mean of 103 units. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this slightly higher demand level and ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods. For sigma_hat, I'll also use recent_N=5 to reflect the current volatility in demand patterns.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-71.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand shows a significant drop in Period 16 (23 units) following a volatile period (P13-P15 avg: 103). Given the previous carry-over insight suggesting a regime shift at P12 (averaging ~130), the recent lower numbers (P14-P16 avg: ~61) suggest the spike was temporary or the demand is highly variable. The lead time (L) remains erratic (1-3 periods); I will maintain L=3 for safety to buffer against late deliveries. Current on-hand is 94, with 307 units in-transit (P14: 95, P15: 2, P16: 0, plus previous unarrived from P2 and P6 which are likely lost). Specifically, the P14 order (95 units) is expected to arrive in P17 (as L=3). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (avg ~69) to react to the recent lower demand while maintaining a buffer with sigma_hat recent_N=5 to capture the volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: avg decreased from ~110 to ~61 (P14-P16) compared to previous periods. Lead time remains consistently inconsistent, peaking at 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-77.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that demand has entered a lower regime. The average demand for the last four periods (P14-P17) is 60.0 units, contrasting with the much higher levels seen in P11-P13. The lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last five successfully delivered orders (P11, P12, P13, P14), confirming that L=3 is the appropriate lead time to use despite the promised L=2. The high on-hand inventory (133) and pipeline stock (212) stem from large orders placed during the previous higher-demand regime. To prevent further excess inventory and high holding costs in this lower-demand period, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current average and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the decreased volatility (std \u2248 30 in P14-P17). L is set to 3 to reflect the actual delivery pattern and protect against stockouts during the required coverage window (L+1 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 14: avg decreased to ~60 units (P14-P17). Lead time is now consistently 3 periods for the last 5 arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-101.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status: 117 units on-hand and 212 units in-transit. In Period 18, demand continued its downward trend, recording only 16 units. Analysis of the demand regime starting at Period 14 (P14-P18: 64, 97, 23, 56, 16) yields an average of 51.2 units per period, with significant variance. This is a substantial decrease from the previous average of ~110. Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last five successful arrivals (P11, P12, P13, P14 arrivals all took 3 periods). Given that 'Profit' and 'Holding Cost' are both $1.0, the Critical Ratio (service level) is 0.50, meaning the OR backend targets the median demand. I will set L to 3 to match the current lead time reality. mu_hat will use the recent_N method with N=5 (P14-P18) to capture the lower demand regime. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. With high pipeline inventory (212) and current low demand, the OR backend logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will likely result in a zero order, which is desired to digest the excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 refined: avg decreased further to ~51 units (P14-P18) from previous levels. Lead time remains stable at 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-59.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 14. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P14-P19) is approximately 47.5 units, which is a sharp decrease from previous averages (~93-110 units). Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (consistently observed for orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14), despite a promised lead time of 2. Currently, there are 88 units on-hand and 212 units in-transit (orders from P15 onwards). Given the low demand environment, the system is already quite long on inventory relative to the new consumption rate (212 in-transit + 88 on-hand = 300 units; at ~50 units/period, this is 6 periods of supply). I will set L to 3 to reflect the realized lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current low-demand regime (P14-P19), which prevents the OR backend from over-ordering based on old, high-demand data while still allowing the service level to adjust to the lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 confirmed and stable: avg demand (P14-P19) is 47.5 units, significantly lower than the previous ~100 range. Lead time is consistently 3 periods over the last four arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 14 is firmly established. For Periods 14-20, the demand samples are [64, 97, 23, 56, 16, 29, 61], yielding a mean of approximately 49.4 units per period. This is a significant drop from the previous average of ~100. Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last four successful arrivals (Periods 14, 15, 16, and 17), which is longer than the promised 2. I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the 4-period risk horizon (L+1). I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand, higher-variance state accurately while ignoring the older high-demand data. Current on-hand is 27 and in-transit is 212 (a very large pipeline compared to actual demand), so the OR backend will likely order 0, but these parameters ensure we right-size the inventory target for future periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 14 confirmed: mean \u2248 49.4 units (P14-P20), down from ~100. Lead time remains stable at 3 periods for recent arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime continues to be stable at a significantly lower level since Period 14. For the most recent 8 periods (P14-P21), the mean demand is 45.0 units. Current on-hand inventory is 13 units, and there is a high pipeline of 212 units (likely from orders placed in P15 or similar, though no orders were placed in P16-P21). Lead time for the last several successful arrivals (P11, P12, P13, P14) has been consistently 3 periods, although arrivals have ceased since P17 conclude. Given the inventory position (on-hand + pipeline = 225) versus the current demand rate (~45/period), the pipeline inventory covers approximately 5 periods of demand. I will maintain L=3 as the planning horizon and use recent_N=8 to capture the low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend correctly targets a lower base stock given the lower volume and high existing pipeline.

This averages to approximately 47.5 units per period. The inventory is currently 0 on-hand with 212 units in-transit. A stockout occurred in Period 22 as demand (68) exceeded the remaining 13 units. While 212 units are in transit, the lead time has consistently been 3 periods in recent cycles. To ensure sufficient service levels given the current stockout and the high holding cost (equal to profit), I am maintaining L=3 to reflect the actualobserved lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=9, covering the regime since P14) to capture this lower demand level and prevent over-ordering which results in high holding costs.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 14) remains significantly lower than the historical average. Demand from Period 14-23 is: 64, 97, 23, 56, 16, 29, 61, 14, 68, 28 (mean \u2248 45.6). Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for recent successful deliveries. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 212 units in transit, which far exceeds the current demand rate for a (3+1) period window (~182 units). Despite the stockout in P22-P23, no new orders are necessary as the arriving pipeline will soon saturate the current demand regime. L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using recent_N=10 to isolate the low-demand regime since Period 14.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 14 remains stable at a lower mean \u2248 45.6 units/period (P14-P23), compared to previous historical levels (~100). Lead time is stable at 3 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 14. For the most recent 11 periods (P14-P24), the average demand is 45.0 units per period. The on-hand inventory is exhausted (0 units), and the pipeline inventory is 212 units (consisting of orders from Period 15: 2 units and Period 12? - Wait, history shows orders placed at P15=2, P14=95, P13=117... but the current 'In-transit' is 212). Checking the history, orders from P17 through P24 were 0. The 212 in-transit units likely represent the batch of orders from P13 (117), P14 (95) and P15 (2) that have not arrived or were somehow delayed beyond the typical 3-period lead time. However, Period 16 conclude shows P13 arrived, Period 17 conclude shows P14 arrived. The 'In-transit' count of 212 is puzzling given the order history. Regardless, since on-hand is 0 and recent demand averages ~45, I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the low-demand regime and stick with L=3 to account for the consistently observed 3-period lead time, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 14 and has stabilized at a much lower level. Averaging from Period 14 to Period 25, the mean demand is approximately 43.8 units. The last four periods (P22-P25) have a mean of 41.5 units, confirming this low-demand state. The on-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), and there are 212 units in-transit. Given the in-transit volume of 212 and the current demand rate of ~44 units/period, the pipeline already covers nearly 5 periods of demand. Though lead time has historically been 3 periods, the current pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the replenishment cycle (L+1). My goal is to prevent overstocking as the OR backend would otherwise calculate a base stock based on historical averages that might exceed current needs. I'll use recent_N to capture the lower demand regime and explicit L=3 to match the observed stable lead time, allowing the backend to see that the pipeline inventory is already above the required base stock, thus suppressing unnecessary new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 14 stable at lower mean: avg demand (P14-P25) is 43.8 units. Recent 4-period avg (P22-P25) is 41.5 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 14. Prior to this, the mean demand was approximately 100 units/period, but since Period 14, the average demand has dropped to roughly 48.9 units (P14-P26). Most recently, Period 26 showed a spike to 112 units, which is a potential outlier or a returning trend, but it is insufficient to confirm a regime reversal yet. Regarding lead time, the system has stabilized at 3 periods for recent successful arrivals, which is longer than the promised 2. However, the current inventory situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and the previous orders from P15 to P26 have were largely not placed as the logic likely awaited the clearing of old pipeline stock or observed the drop in demand. The 'In-transit' quantity of 212 is highly suspicious as there have been no 'conclude' messages for arrivals since Period 17 (P14 order). Specifically, orders from P15 (2 units) and P13 (117 units - wait, P13 arrived P16) are mostly accounted for. The in-transit 212 units likely consist of old, lost shipments (like the P2 order of 145 units and P6 order of 65 units). Since these are lost, the pipeline inventory is effectively zero. I will set L=3 based on consistent historical delays. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=13 (P14-P26) to capture the lower demand regime while allowing the P26 spike to influence the variance slightly to prevent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 212 remains heavily inflated by lost orders from P2 (145 units) and P6 (65 units); effective pipeline is essentially zero. Demand regime since P14 remains at a lower mean (~49), despite a single spike in P26.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has stabilized at a significantly lower mean of approximately 48 units per period (P14-P27 average excluding the P26 outlier) compared to earlier periods. Period 26 showed a significant spike (112), likely noise or a one-off event. The current in-transit inventory of 212 units is entirely composed of lost orders from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (65 units), plus a tiny remnant from P15 (2 units). None of these are expected to arrive. Effectively, on-hand and pipeline inventory are zero. Recent historical lead times have clustered at 3 periods. To resume stock fulfillment for the current demand level, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR engine recognizes the actual lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set using the last 14 samples (since Period 14) to capture the lower demand regime and ensure the base stock calculation properly reflects the current state without being skewed by the very high initial demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 14 remains stable at a much lower mean (avg ~48 units) compared to the initial 13 periods (~100 units). Significant in-transit inventory (212 units) consists of verified lost shipments from P2 and P6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is zero and there is an urgent need to order as demand has depleted all stock. The 'In-transit' quantity of 212 is entirely composed of lost orders from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (65 units), which are confirmed lost as over 20 periods have passed since they were placed. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand shifted to a lower regime around Period 14; the average demand from Period 14 to Period 28 is approximately 53 units/period, despite occasional spikes like Period 26 and Period 28. Using recent_N=15 for mu_hat captures this current regime (~53 * (1+3) = 212). Lead time has been consistently 3 periods for the last several successful deliveries, so L is set to 'explicit' value 3 to handle the 212 units of phantom 'in-transit' inventory by essentially overwriting the OR engine's lead time perception to match the actual delay observed. This will trigger a replenishment order to cover the (L+1) window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 14. For the current period, the average demand from Period 14 to Period 29 is approx 53 units/period (total 840 over 16 periods). However, there's a localized upward trend in the last 4 periods (P26-P29: 112, 42, 108, 52) which averages ~78.5 units. Current on-hand is 0. The in-transit inventory of 212 units consists entirely of lost orders from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (65 units), which have not arrived in over 20 periods; therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. I am setting L=3 to account for the upper bound of observed lead times (1-3 periods). I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and slight increase in demand seen in the last few periods while the OR backend uses L=3 to cover the lead time + current period (1+L=4 periods total).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 14 shows increased volatility recently (P26-P29 mean ~78 vs P14-P25 mean ~45). Lost orders (P2: 145, P6: 65) still comprise the entire in-transit count of 212.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has averaged 49.2 units, but the last 5 periods (P26-P30) show a higher average of 77 units, suggesting a potential upward shift or increased volatility. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is listed as 314, but this is heavily distorted by lost orders from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (65 units), totaling 210 units. The effective pipeline is the Period 30 order of 102 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 3 periods for recent successful deliveries. To prevent stockouts during this suspected demand increase, I'm setting L=3 to account for the current lead time reality. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher demand (avg ~77) which is more relevant than the longer-term low average. This will result in a base stock calculated as (1+3) * 77 = 308, ensuring we cover demand while the OR backend subtracts the valid pipeline of 102 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely occurring: avg demand for P26-P30 increased to ~77 units from the previous P14-P25 average of ~44 units. Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 210 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2 and P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upwards again since Period 26. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 31 is approximately 74.8 units/period, compared to the ~44 units/period observed between Periods 14 and 25. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit inventory is listed as 314 units, but this is highly misleading: 145 units from Period 2 and 65 units from Period 6 are confirmed lost (totaling 210 units). This leaves an 'active' pipeline inventory of only 104 units (the order from Period 30). Based on recent history, lead time is most reliably estimated at 3 periods despite the promised 2. I will set L=3 as a buffer against these delays. For mu_hat, I will use a N=6 period window (P26-P31) to capture the recent higher demand level (avg ~75), resulting in (1+L)*75 = 300. For sigma_hat, I'll use the same 6-period window to capture current volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the actual active pipeline and the recent demand trend while ignoring the phantom 'lost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 26: avg increased to ~75 units (P26-P31) from ~44 units (P14-P25). Active pipeline is 210 units lower than reported due to lost orders from P2 (145) and P6 (65).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 33. The demand regime shifted at Period 14 (low mean ~45) and shifted again at Period 26. The new regime (P26-P32) shows a mean demand of 77.1 units per period (samples: 112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93). While in-transit is reported at 314, this includes 210 units of confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (65 units), plus the 102 units ordered in Period 30. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 102 units. The lead time has historically peaked at 3 periods, and the order from Period 30 is expected to arrive during Period 33 resolution (L=3). Since on-hand is 0 and we are facing a higher demand regime (approx 77/period), I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods using this recent average (77.1 * 4 = 308.4) and sigma_hat based on recent volatility. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat captures the regime starting at P26.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~44 to ~77 units per period. Effective pipeline calculation must exclude 210 units from P2 and P6 which are lost.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 26, increasing from an average of ~44 to ~77 units per period (P26-P33 avg: 76.4). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory is 314, but this includes 210 units from confirmed lost orders (P2: 145, P6: 65), meaning the active pipeline is only 104 units (from the order placed in P30). Lead time has historically varied between 1 and 3 periods, but using L=3 remains the safest approach for buffering and calculating base stock. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime (P26-P33). The OR backend will use these parameters to determine the current order while accounting for the active pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~44 to ~77 units per period (P26-P33 avg: 76.4). Pipeline inventory of 314 includes 210 units of lost shipments from P2 and P6; the only active order is from P30 (102 units).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is currently in a demand regime that shifted around Period 26. Since Period 26, the average demand has been approximately 76 units per period (P26-P34: 112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93, 69, 88). This is significantly higher than the low-demand period observed between P14 and P25. The current in-transit inventory of 314 units is deceptive; historical evidence strongly confirms that 210 of these units (from P2 and P6) are lost. Therefore, the true pipeline inventory is 104 units (the order from P30 plus any minor adjustments). Lead time has been historically erratic but most recently settled at 3 periods. To ensure availability given the 0 on-hand status and the recent demand spike, I will set L to 3 (explicitly addressing the observed delay). I am using 'recent_N' with N=9 for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime (P26-P34). Pipeline inflation will be managed by setting 'L' to 3 and 'mu_hat' to reflect the higher demand, which triggers the OR backend to order despite the inflated in-transit count.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand is ~76 units/period (P26-P34), up from ~44 units during P14-P25. Total lost shipments remain at 210 units (P2: 145, P6: 65), which incorrectly inflate the 'In-transit' figure.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting at Period 26. Analyzing the recent demand (P26-P35: 112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93, 69, 88, 92), the mean is approximately 79.1 units/period. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 314) is fundamentally decoupled from reality due to two confirmed lost orders: Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (65 units), totaling 210 units. Excluding these, the true active pipeline is 104 units (the order from P30 was 102 units, plus a small variance from order logic). Historical lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent recently (P12-P17 arrivals). To compensate for the 210 units of 'phantom' inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its calculations, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on L=3 (Review + Lead = 4 periods): 79.1 units * 4 periods \u2248 316. To this, I add the 210 units of lost shipments to 'trick' the backend into ordering the correct amount despite it subtracting the full 314 in-transit units. Adjusted mu_hat = (316 + 210) = 526.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 26, moving from a low of ~44 units/period to a higher average. Over the last 11 periods (P26-P36), the mean demand is approximately 77.7 units. The current reported 'In-transit' of 484 units is highly misleading: 210 units are confirmed lost from very early periods (P2 and P6), and the order from P30 (102 units) has now exceeded the historical maximum lead time of 3 periods (6 periods have passed), suggesting it may also be lost. The only likely active order is from P36 (170 units). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this higher demand regime while accounting for 312 units of likely lost stock (P2, P6, P30), I am using an explicit mu_hat representing the new mean of ~78 units across a 4-period window (L+1) and setting L to 3 to reflect the persistent delivery delays seen throughout the game. Recent demand (P34-P36) remains strong at 88, 92, and 64.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: P30 order (102 units) is likely lost (6 periods elapsed without arrival). Total estimated lost inventory in pipeline is now 312 units (P2: 145, P6: 65, P30: 102). Demand regime P26-P36 is stable at ~78 units/period.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 26, currently averaging approximately 76 units (P26-P37), up from the previous low of ~44. Lead time continues to be highly erratic: Period 36 order arrived in 1 period, but Period 30 (102 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is likely lost, joining the lost orders from P2 (145) and P6 (65). Total inferred lost pipeline inventory is now 312 units. The current reported 'In-transit' is 314, meaning the effective active pipeline is approximately 0 (only 2 units unaccounted for). On-hand inventory is 114. Given the lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods, plus frequent losses), I set L=3 to buffer against delays. For mu_hat, I use N=12 (P26-P37) to capture the current active regime. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the volatility in this period (std dev ~22).

Carry-over insight: Period 38: P30 order (102 units) confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Total confirmed lost units in pipeline inventory: 312 (P2: 145, P6: 65, P30: 102). Effective pipeline is currently 2 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (since Period 26) remains stable with an average demand of approximately 78.5 units/period (Calculated from P26-P38: 1021 units total / 13 periods). We are in Period 39 with 43 units on-hand. The recorded 'In-transit' of 314 units is misleading due to lost shipments. Based on history, the orders from P2 (145), P6 (65), and P30 (102) are confirmed or highly likely lost (312 units total). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is actually only 2 units (314 - 312). Lead times have been erratic, typically 3 periods, though the most recent order arrived in 1 period. To be safe, I will continue using L=3 to ensure sufficient stock for the (L+1) window. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 4 periods (L+1) at the current demand rate (78.5 * 4 = 314) and sigma_hat to reflect the observed volatility in this regime (std dev \u2248 20, so sqrt(4)*20 \u2248 40).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P26-P38 stable at avg 78.5 units. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline inventory: 312 (P2: 145, P6: 65, P30: 102).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is stable with a mean of approximately 78.5 units (P26-P39). On-hand inventory is 0 after Period 39. The reported 'In-transit' of 314 units is significantly inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (145 units), Period 6 (65 units), and Period 30 (102 units), totaling 312 lost units. The true effective pipeline is only 2 units. Lead time has been erratic but recently showed a 1-period arrival for the Period 36 order. To balance the risk of stockouts given the zero on-hand balance and the high probability of lost shipments, I am setting L=3 to maintain a safety buffer, as lead times have frequently reached 3 periods in the past. Mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=14) to capture the current demand regime starting at Period 26. Sigma_hat is also calculated based on this period to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Actual pipeline inventory is only 2 units; the remaining 312 units (P2: 145, P6: 65, P30: 102) are confirmed lost and should be ignored for ordering logic.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a second regime starting from Period 26, with a mean demand of approximately 78 units per period (P26-P40 average is 77.2). The current 'In-transit' figure of 314 units is misleading due to substantial historical lost shipments: P2 (145), P6 (65), and P30 (102), totaling 312 confirmed lost units. Consequently, the actual effective pipeline is only 2 units (residual from recent ordering cycles). With 0 on-hand inventory and an effective pipeline of 2, a significant order is required to reach the target base stock. I have set L=3 as a safety buffer despite a recent 1-period arrival, as history shows lead times are frequently 3 periods or lost entirely. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*78 \u2248 312, and sigma_hat reflects the standard deviation of the current regime (~18) scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 26 to a higher level, averaging 77.2 units (P26-P41). Recent demand (P36-P41) is slightly lower at 75.8 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 314 units is misleading because it includes 312 confirmed lost units (P2: 145, P6: 65, P30: 102). Only 2 units (ordered P36) were unaccounted for, but since P36 order was 170 units and 170 arrived, the actual active pipeline is currently 0. Lead time remains erratic (observed: 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1), so I will maintain L=3 as a safety buffer. I will use recent_N (N=16) for mu_hat to capture the regime since P26, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for current volatility. The OR backend needs to place an order to replenish the zero on-hand stock and account for the 312 unit discrepancy in pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Actual pipeline inventory is 0; 312 units (P2: 145, P6: 65, P30: 102) in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments. Current demand regime (starting P26) mean is ~77 units/period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the product chips(Regular) has 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 314 units is misleading because it includes confirmed lost orders from Period 2 (145 units), Period 6 (65 units), and Period 30 (102 units), totaling 312 lost units. The true available pipeline is only 2 units (the remainder of the 314). The demand regime that began in Period 26 is stable, with an average demand of approximately 77 units per period (P26-P42 avg \u2248 76.5). I am using 'explicit' L=3 to maintain a safety buffer against the observed historical lead time volatility (max observed = 3), and 'recent_N' with N=17 (P26-P42) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current, higher demand regime while ignoring the older, lower-demand data from P14-P25.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 is stable with a mean of approximately 76.4 units (calculated from Periods 26 through 43). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 314 is misleading: 312 units are confirmed lost (P2: 145, P6: 65, P30: 102), and the P44 order has yet to be placed, meaning the actual active pipeline is 2 units. Lead times have been highly erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will continue using an L of 3 to provide a safety buffer against the longest observed delay. With a profit and holding cost of $1.0 each, the target service level is 50%, making base stock equal to the mean lead time demand. I'm using recent_N (N=18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime that began at Period 26.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 26 remains stable at a mean of ~76 units (P26-P43). Total confirmed lost units in pipeline inventory: 312 (P2: 145, P6: 65, P30: 102).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 is stable with a mean of ~76.5 units/period (P26-P44 average). Recently, from P36-P44, the average is ~73.6. I will use the last 19 periods (P26-P44) for mu_hat (N=19) to reflect this higher demand compared to the low period (P14-P25). Regarding inventory, the reported 'In-transit' of 314 units is misleading. Historical analysis confirms 312 units are almost certainly lost: P2 (145), P6 (65), and P30 (102) have not arrived despite 43, 39, and 15 periods passing, respectively. The remaining 2 units in transit (likely a remnant) are also negligible. Effective pipeline inventory is zero, or near zero. Since current on-hand is 0 and lead time is typically 3 periods (with some volatility), I select L=3 and use recent_N to capture the current demand mean and variance. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the 4-period risk horizon (L+1) required to restart the supply chain after depletion.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 26 to a higher mean of approximately 76 units per period (the average from P26 to P45 is 76.25). The most recent demand at P45 was 73. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 314 units is misleading: 312 units are confirmed lost (P2: 145, P6: 65, P30: 102), and the remaining 2 units are from an unknown or negligible source. To ensure we meet demand for the remainer of the game, I am setting mu_hat using the last 20 samples (P26-P45) which reflect the current stable regime. Although recent lead times have been erratic, I will use L=3 to provide a safety buffer against the delivery delays observed earlier in the game. Using N=20 for sigma_hat captures the volatility of this specific regime.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 76 units per period. Recent demand (P40-P46) has shown a mean of 73 units. The reported 'In-transit' inventory of 314 units is significantly inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (145 units), Period 6 (65 units), and Period 30 (102 units), totaling 312 lost units. Therefore, the actual effective pipeline inventory is only 2 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. To meet demand for the remaining 4 periods of the simulation (through P50) and minimize stockouts during the lead time (L=3), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 304 (76 units/period * (1+L)) and sigma_hat to 30 based on recent volatility. This ensures the OR engine places an order to bridge the gap created by lost shipments and current stockouts.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 48 with 0 on-hand inventory. The reported 'In-transit' of 314 units is almost entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments: P2 (145), P6 (65), and P30 (102), totaling 312 lost units. The actual active pipeline is only 2 units. The demand regime starting at P26 remains stable with a mean of approximately 76 units/period (P26-P47 average is 76.2 units). Although recent lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods, I will continue to use L=3 to provide a safety buffer against the periodic delivery failures observed throughout the history. The decision to set L=3, combined with recent_N (N=22) for demand mean and volatility, will target a base stock level that covers the 4-period window (L+1) required to replenish the current zero-stock position while discounting the ghost inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 26 is stable: Mean \u2248 76.2 units/period (P26-P47). Pipeline inventory of 314 is 99% lost (312 units from P2, P6, P30); actual active pipeline is only 2 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 49 of 50. Demand has been in a sustained regime since Period 26 with a mean of approximately 76 units per period, although Period 48 saw a significant spike to 143. The on-hand inventory is 0 and the reported 'In-transit' of 314 units is effectively zero because 312 units are confirmed lost (P2: 145, P6: 65, P30: 102), with only 2 unidentified units potentially remaining. Since this is the penultimate period (Period 49), any order placed now with a lead time of 2-3 periods will not arrive before the game ends (after Period 50). Therefore, placing an order now would only incur inventory costs if it arrived on the very last resolution, and more likely, it won't arrive in time to be sold. However, the OR backend logic is a base-stock policy. To avoid unnecessary ordering that won't satisfy demand within the game's horizon, but still adhering to the request for parameters, I will maintain the current regime settings. Given the game ends at P50, L=3 ensures no order is likely to be triggered that wouldn't arrive in time, but I will provide the best estimates for the current regime: mu_hat based on the P26-P48 average (N=23) and L=3 for safety based on historical instability.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in Period 48 (143 units) noted, but overall regime since Period 26 remains stable around ~79 units/period. Final decision period logic applied: orders placed in P49 with L=2/3 will not arrive before game conclusion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final decision period of the simulation. Orders placed now will arrive after the game concludes (given the minimum lead time of 1-3 periods). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the actual pipeline inventory is essentially 0 (312 units are confirmed lost, and the small order of 1 from Period 49 will not arrive in time to satisfy Period 50 demand). Since any order placed now will only incur holding costs in the post-game state without the possibility of being sold to generate profit, the optimal strategy for the final period is to set parameters that result in a zero order. I will use 'explicit' values set to 0 to ensure no further units are committed to the system.
