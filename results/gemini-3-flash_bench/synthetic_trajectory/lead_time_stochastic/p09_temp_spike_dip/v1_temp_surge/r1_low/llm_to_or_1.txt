Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical performance data yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The historical demand samples (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) have a mean of 114.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 15.2. Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we must place an initial order to cover demand for the lead time plus the current review period (L+1 = 3 periods). I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to establish a baseline forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the promised lead time (L=2).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 141 units and faced a demand of 131 (based on provided historical data, though the conclude message reports 86 for Period 1 - I will prioritize the 'conclude' message for ground truth of Period 1 but note the historical context). There were 0 units on hand, leading to lost sales. The promised lead time is 2, so the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 3 and become visible in the Period 4 start message. As of now, there is no evidence to override the default lead time. I will use the 'default' method for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, since we only have one period of actual observed game demand (86) plus the 5 historical samples provided (131, 92, 118, 125, 106), I will use 'default' (which aggregates all samples) to establish a stable baseline. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) or 3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Observations from Period 1 and 2 show that we have had 0 stock on hand and zero sales because the initial order from Period 1 (141 units) is still in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 3's Arrival Resolution phase. Therefore, we should see the first units arrive in the 'Period 3 conclude' message which we'll read at the start of Period 4. Demand for the first two periods was 86 and 132 (Avg ~109). Historical data provided (periods 1-5) shows a mean demand of roughly 114.6. Given profit is $1 and holding cost is $1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand. Currently, pipeline inventory (141 + 140 = 281) covers roughly 2.4 periods of average demand. I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the early volatility and keep L at default (2) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a delay.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (141 units), Period 2 (140 units), and Period 3 (60 units). Following the lead time logic: the order from Period 1 should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the Period 3 conclusion. However, the Period 3 conclusion shows 'arrived=0'. This strongly suggests that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since we have no successful arrivals yet, I will explicitly set L=3 to account for this observed delay. Demand across the first three periods has been 86, 132, and 100 (mean ~106). Including the pre-game history (131, 92, 118, 125, 106), the overall mean is approximately 113.75. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand levels while setting L=3 to ensure the pipeline inventory calculation (which the OR engine uses) correctly reflects the longer cycle.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are reviewing a history of 5 demand samples (avg: 114.6). The promised lead time is 2 periods. However, looking at the 'Period 4 conclude' message, we see two arrivals: one ordered in Period 1 (arrived in Period 4, actual lead time = 3) and one ordered in Period 3 (arrived in Period 4, actual lead time = 1). This indicates significant lead-time variability around the mean of 2. Currently, we have 126 units on hand and 239 in transit (from Period 2 and Period 4 orders). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level will be q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed lead times (3 and 1), and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the current mean and volatility while avoiding overstocking due to the high holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we have 20 units on-hand and 274 units in-transit. Looking at the history, the promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have varied significantly (Period 1 order took 3 periods, while Period 3 order took only 1 period). This suggests supply-side volatility. Demand across the first 5 periods has a mean of 114.4 units (samples: 131, 92, 118, 125, 106). Since we are at the start of the game and have limited data, using the mean of all 5 available samples is appropriate. For lead time (L), the average of observed instances (3 and 1) is 2, which matches the promised lead time. Therefore, I will use the 'default' method for L (which defaults to promised 2), and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the full recent demand distribution. The base stock level needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand to prevent stockouts during the next ordering cycle.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 with 0 units on hand and 280 units in transit. Historical demand remains relatively stable around a mean of ~100 units/period (recent periods: 86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77). The promised lead time is 2 periods, but we have observed significant volatility: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3's arrived in 1 period. Currently, orders from Period 2 (140 units), Period 4 (99 units), Period 5 (35 units), and Period 6 (6 units) are outstanding. The oldest outstanding order (Period 2) is now 5 periods old, suggesting a potential delay or loss. However, since the pipeline (280) is enough to cover nearly 3 periods of average demand, and we have a high holding cost relative to profit ($1:$1, suggesting a 50% service level target), we should avoid over-ordering until arrivals stabilize. I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current regime of ~100 mean, and use 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend average the high variance observed (3 periods and 1 period).

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: Actual lead times varied between 1 and 3 periods (Promised: 2). Possible delayed/lost shipment for Period 2 order (5 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face significant supply chain instability. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show 1 and 3 periods (P1 arrived in 3, P3 arrived in 1, P4 arrived in 3). Most critically, the order from Period 2 (140 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be presumed lost. Current on-hand is low (32) following a stockout in Period 6. Demand remains stable, with recent samples (P4-P7) averaging 81.25 units, which is lower than the initial historical mean of ~114. Given the lead time volatility and lost shipment, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the risk of longer arrivals and ensure the 'mu_hat' covers (L+1)=4 periods. I'll use recent_N=4 for demand to reflect the current lower demand regime (~81/period), resulting in a targeted base stock that accounts for the missing units since 'In-transit' (285) technically includes the lost 140 units, but the OR backend's cap logic may otherwise under-order if it believes those units are coming.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 2 order (140 units) confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed vs promised 2). Lead time updated to 3 to reflect observed 3-period arrivals.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 44 units on-hand and 154 in-transit (orders from P6 and P8). Analysis of lead times shows high volatility: arrivals have varied between 1 period (P3, P7) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), while the P2 order is confirmed lost. Given that 3 periods is the maximum observed arrival time, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to allow the OR backend to account for a longer replenishment cycle. Demand has been relatively stable with a slight downward trend in the middle and a spike in the most recent period (P8: 127). Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average 90.4) captures the current mean while allowing for recent variability. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the moderate demand fluctuations witnessed lately (ranging from 67 to 127). This configuration aims to increase the inventory buffer to mitigate the risks seen in periods 1-3 when late/lost shipments caused stockouts.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 with 0 on-hand inventory and 278 units in-transit (orders from Period 6 and Period 9). The demand over the last 9 periods has averaged 98 units (total 880 / 9), but with significant volatility. Analyzing the lead times: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1, P4 in 3, P5 in 3, P7 in 1, and P8 in 1. The P2 order (140 units) is confirmed lost as 8 periods have passed since its placement. The mean lead time is 2 periods, but the inconsistency (1 vs 3) suggests we should maintain a buffer. Demand in the last three periods (P7-P9) was 67, 127, and 110 (avg 101.3). Using N=5 for demand captures the recent regime (avg 97.4). I will set L=2 (promised) but use recent statistics to ensure the base stock covers the lead time + review period variability. Pipeline inventory includes the P6 order (unlikely to arrive if following the P2 pattern, but still technically in-transit) and the P9 order.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 293 units in transit. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over 10 periods shows a consistent mean of approximately 99 units (samples: 86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67, 127, 110, 108). Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a confirmed lost shipment (Period 2 order). Specifically, recent arrivals (P7, P8, P9) showed lead times of 3, 3, 1, and 1 respectively. Using L=3 (explicit) is safer than the promised 2 to account for this volatility and prevent prolonged stockouts like the one currently observed (on-hand=0). Since there is no significant trend or seasonal change detected in demand, I will use all 10 historical samples (recent_N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the sample size is still small and the demand appears stable (mean ~99, SD ~20). Setting L=3 makes the base stock calculation cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand, providing a buffer against the observed lead-time variance.

Recent demand (Periods 8-11) has averaged 117.5 units, slightly higher than the overall average of 101. demand remains fairly stable (range: 67-132). Lead time analysis: Promised is 2, but observed lead times are [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1], with a mean of 2.0. However, the order from Period 2 (140 units) is confirmed lost, and recent orders from Period 9 (132 units), Period 10 (15 units), and Period 11 (103 units) are currently 'In-transit' totaling 396 units (which includes the lost P2 units). Subtracting the 140 lost units, the effective pipeline is 256. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to satisfy (L+1) demand, I will set L to 'calculate' (mean = 2.0) but use an 'explicit' mu_hat to account for the supply chain uncertainty and steady demand. Forecase: 115/period. For L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*115 = 345. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (approx std 28 * sqrt(3)) to maintain a robust service level given the high stockout cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13, the on-hand inventory is 15 units with 249 units in-transit. Demand has remained relatively stable, with the most recent samples showing a mean around 110-120 units. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P7: 1, P8: 1, P9: 3, P10: 2), and one order (Period 2) was definitively lost. Given this volatility, setting L explicitly to 3 ensures the OR backend calculations for mu_hat (covering L+1 periods) account for the max observed delay. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level of approximately 117 per period, which when scaled by (1+L=4) provides a coverage target of ~468 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility without over-penalizing the system for the earlier lost order's impact on service levels.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility persists: observed lead times vary consistently between 1 and 3 periods across P1-P10 orders. Order from Period 2 is confirmed lost (10+ periods elapsed).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing a stockout. Historical lead times show significant volatility (1, 2, and 3 periods), with a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2. The most recent deliveries (Period 12) showed lead times of 3 and 2. Given this variance and the current zero on-hand status, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to allow the inventory policy to account for the longest observed delay and ensure the base stock covers a wider protection window. Demand remains stable around an average of 105 units. I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand distribution (excluding the seeding samples) while filtering out the impact of the lost shipment's period. This approach aims to restore service levels and build a safety buffer against lead-time variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is very low (5 units) following a stockout in Period 13. The demand remains stable around a mean of ~103 units based on the last 14 periods. Lead time analysis shows significant variability: observed lead times are 1, 2, or 3 periods (average ~2.4), and the Period 2 order is confirmed lost. To prevent stockouts caused by this volatility, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of observed successful deliveries). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. mu_hat will use the mean of all samples (recent_N=14) scaled by (1+L). sigma_hat will also use recent_N to capture the standard deviation of this stable but slightly noisy demand.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 411 in-transit. Historic lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods: P1(3), P3(1), P4(3), P5(3), P7(1), P8(1), P9(3), P10(2), and P11(3). The order from P13 (139 units) is expected now (L=3), but hasn't arrived in the P15 conclude; P14 and P15 orders are also in flight. Demand for Regular Chips is relatively stable, fluctuating around a mean of ~102 units over 15 periods. I am setting L to 3 to account for the frequent maximum observed lead time, which ensures the base stock covers a longer pipeline. mu_hat will use recent_N=6 to capture the most recent demand average (~115 units/period) across the (1+L) period horizon. sigma_hat will use the same window to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $139.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a recent significant spike, with Period 16 jumping to 195 units from a prior average closer to 110. This indicates a potential seasonal or trend-based shift. Lead times are volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (e.g., Period 13 order arrived in Period 16), though technically ranging from 1 to 3. The Period 2 order (140 units) is permanently lost. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Given the high demand in Period 16 and the 3-period lead time observed for the most recent arrivals, I am setting L to 3. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=5 to capture the recent volume increase and ensure the base stock covers (1+L)=4 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely started at Period 16 (195 units vs previous avg ~110). Lead time is established as 3 periods for safety due to frequent delays, despite the nominal 2-period promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The demand for Period 16 was 195 units, and Period 17 jumped to 251 units, significantly higher than the earlier average of ~110 units. This surge is likely a seasonal peak or a structural shift. Our current on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 17 where we only sold 77 units against 251 demanded. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average is roughly 2.3). I will use L=3 for the inventory calculations to provide a safety buffer against the observed delays and the current stockout situation. For demand forecasting, I am applying a recent_N (N=2) strategy to mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sharp upward trend (averaging 223 units/period) while ignoring the older, lower-demand data points. Using q = 0.5 (as Profit=HoldingCost=$1), the OR backend will aim to cover the median demand over (L+1) periods, which is critical given the current zero-inventory state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-17 avg demand is 223 units (+100% vs prior periods). Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods), requiring L=3 for safety.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are in a persistent stockout (on-hand: 0) following a significant demand regime shift that began in Period 16. The average demand for the three most recent periods (P16-P18) is 211.7 units (195, 251, 189), compared to the baseline of ~110 units. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this +92% increase. Lead times remain highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Period 14 arrived in 3 periods, Period 16 arrived in 1 period, and Period 2's order is still missing). To maintain a safety buffer and prevent further stockouts during this high-demand phase, I will set L to an explicit value of 3. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the longest observed reliable lead time. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the increased volatility in this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Period 16-18 avg demand is 212 units (+92% vs prior periods). Current on-hand is 0; system depends on large in-transit pipeline (727 units) to recover.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is consistently sustained. Average demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) is 203.0 units (195, 251, 189, 177), which represents a ~90% increase from the previous baseline of ~107. Lead time remains erratic, with arrivals ranging from 1 to 3 periods; therefore, L=3 is maintained as an explicit setting to provide a safety buffer and account for the observed risk of delays. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we are heavily reliant on the pipeline (847 units). I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean and volatility of this new demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that reflects current market reality while managing the high holding cost risk.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly upward since Period 16. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 213.2 units compared to the pre-regime average of approximately 110 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Regarding lead time, the promised value is 2, but actual arrivals (P4, P7, P8, P12, P14, P16, P17) show lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a high frequency of 3. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for this volatility and ensure the pipeline inventory covers a longer horizon, especially since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are substantial in-transit orders (847 units) pending from P17-P19 that should arrive shortly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Period 16-20 average demand is 213 units (+94% vs Period 1-15 average of 110). Lead time volatility remains high, necessitating an explicit lead time planning value of 3 for stockout protection.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began at Period 16 is now firmly established. Period 16-21 demand significantly exceeds the initial periods, with an average of approximately 217 units compared to the early average of 110. Crucially, the system is currently stockout-locked with 0 on-hand inventory, struggling to recover due to lead-time variability. Observed lead times consistently hit 3 periods (e.g., P1, P4, P9, P11, P13, P14), despite occasional shorter arrivals. To protect against the current high-demand, high-variability environment and ensure the pipeline is sufficient to handle the (L+1) horizon, I am maintaining the explicit lead time estimation of 3. For demand forecasting, I am using recent_N=6 to capture only the new high-demand regime (Periods 16-21). This will set the base stock based on the higher mean and variance observed since the shift, allowing the backend to generate orders that bridge the current inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 16-21 average demand is 217 units (+97% vs Periods 1-15).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted to a new, higher regime starting at Period 16. The average demand for the last seven periods (P16-P22) is approximately 222 units (195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238, 250), which is more than double the initial average. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a large pipeline of 870 units. Although some orders are overdue (notably P15 and P17-P19), historical arrivals show lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average is roughly 2.3). For safety against this volatility and the current stockout situation, I will maintain L=3. mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=7) to capture the higher demand level (target mu approximately 222 * (1 + 3) = 888). sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=7) to reflect the increased variance observed in this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained: Periods 16-22 average demand is 222 units (+100% vs early periods). Significant stockouts continue due to arrival delays; pipeline of 870 units is pending.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~110 to ~216 units (+96%). Recent demand (P16-P23) averages 217 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 0. While a large in-transit pipeline (865 units) exists, arrivals remain erratic; orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 701 units) have not yet concluded, despite being past or at their promised lead time. A lead time planning value of L=3 is maintained for safety to reflect this volatility (arrivals have varied from 1-3 periods). mu_hat is set using a recent window (N=8) to capture the higher demand regime, resulting in a forecast of approximately 868 units (4 periods * ~217 avg). sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to account for the increased volatility.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. The average demand for the most recent 9 periods (P16-P24) is approximately 219 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~110 units. We continue to face extreme stockouts (on-hand is 0) despite a massive in-transit pipeline of 869 units. This is primarily due to several high-volume orders placed in Periods 17, 18, and 19 (194, 289, and 120 units respectively) which are currently overdue or at the limit of the observed 1-3 period lead time variability. Given the high parity between profit and holding costs (both $1.0), the ideal service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. I am setting L=3 explicitly to account for the frequent delays and protect against the high demand. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=9) to capture the high-demand regime of ~219 units/period. Over (1+L)=4 periods, this results in a mu_hat of ~876. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=9 period to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods 16-24 average demand is 219 units (+99% vs early baseline). Large pipeline clusters from P17-P19 remain undelivered at P25, causing extended stockouts.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. The average demand for Periods 16-25 is approximately 215 units, compared to the baseline of ~110 units. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have been experiencing significant stockouts due to highly volatile lead times (varying between 1 and 3 periods) and the fact that a large volume of orders from Periods 15-19 (approximately 700 units) has not yet successfully concluded. Specifically, orders from P15 (98), P17 (194), P18 (289), and P19 (120) remain 'in-transit'. Given that the promised lead time is 2, and we have seen actual lead times up to 3 for successful deliveries, the P15-P19 block is now significantly overdue (7-11 periods elapsed). It is highly probable these shipments are lost or severely delayed. To protect against the stockout gap and account for this unreliability, I will use an explicit lead time L=3. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~215), helping the OR backend set a target base stock that reflects the current market reality rather than the long-term historical mean.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment cluster confirmed: Orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 701 units) have exceeded 6+ periods of transit with no arrival, significantly beyond the 1-3 period observed lead time window.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe supply crisis. Since Period 16, a new demand regime has averaged ~210 units/period (doubling the earlier baseline). However, on-hand inventory is 0 because of a cluster of lost or significantly delayed shipments from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 701 units). These orders have now exceeded the maximum observed 3-period lead time window by 4+ periods. The current in-transit pipeline (861 units) is heavily distorted by these lost units; the OR backend assumes they will eventually arrive, but historical evidence suggests they are lost. To force the backend to place new orders and bridge the gap, I will use 'explicit' methods. I set L=3 as a safety buffer for lead time volatility. I forecast mu_hat based on the high-demand regime (210 units * (1+3) = 840) and set a high sigma_hat (100) to ensure the base stock is calculated high enough to ignore the 'phantom' pipeline inventory that will likely never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment cluster confirmed: Orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (701 units) are likely lost, creating a gap between 'pipeline inventory' and actual expected arrivals. Recent demand (P16-P25) stabilized at ~219 units/period, but P26 saw a sudden drop to 95 units; monitoring if this is a shift or an outlier.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the system is facing a severe supply crisis and a potential demand shift. Detailed analysis of history confirms a cluster of lost shipments: orders from Period 15 (98 units), 17 (194 units), 18 (289 units), and 19 (120 units) totaling 701 units are significantly overdue (8+ periods elapsed vs. observed max of 3) and must be treated as lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline is only 160 units (861 total in-transit - 701 lost), while current on-hand is 0. Demand has also dropped significantly in the last two periods (95 and 84 units) compared to the Period 16-25 average (~219 units). It is unclear if this is a permanent regime shift or a temporary dip. Given the lost shipments and the need to protect against both previous high demand and lead time volatility, I am maintaining an explicit lead time of 3 for the OR backend to increase safety stock. mu_hat is set using recent_N=12 (P16-P27) to capture the high-demand regime while factoring in the recent lower values. sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the variance observed during the high-demand period (approx 55 units per period) to ensure the backend raises the base stock sufficiently to account for the lost inventory that the OR engine incorrectly assumes is still arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing at Period 26: demand dropped to average ~90 units (P26-P27) from previous high-regime average of ~219 units. Total lost shipments confirmed: 701 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 analysis: We are managing a significant stockout situation (on-hand: 0). Recent demand history indicates a downward shift or return to baseline (avg P26-P28: ~100) after a high-demand regime (avg P16-P25: ~215). I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this lower demand trend quickly and avoid excessive over-ordering. Regarding inventory, the 'In-transit' balance of 861 is misleading because 701 units (from P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost (Carry-over Period 28). This leaves an actual effective pipeline of only 160 units (861 - 701). Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (861) from the base_stock, it will significantly under-order. To force the backend to place an order that covers the current demand despite the phantom 'lost' inventory, I will set an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand for (L+1) periods = 4 * 100 = 400. To offset the 701 lost units that the OR engine thinks we have, I set mu_hat to 1101 (400 + 701). Lead time L is set to explicit 3, reflecting the conservative planning needed for observed delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 26-28 average demand is 100 units, a 54% drop from the high-regime average of 219 units seen in Periods 16-25.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a new demand regime (Period 26-29) where demand has dropped significantly to an average of ~100 units/period, compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~219 units. In the status as of Period 30, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is listed as 1101 units; however, historical analysis confirms a massive lost shipment cluster from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 totaling 701 units. Subtracting these lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 400 units (Orders from P24, P25, and P29). Demand statistics for the new regime (N=4: P26-P29) show a mean of 99.5 and a standard deviation of 15.8. I am using recent_N=4 to capture this lower demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I am maintaining the explicit lead time of 3 periods to account for the observed volatility (1-3 periods) and to ensure a higher service level, as stockouts have been frequent due to delays and losses.

Carry-over insight: Sustained lower demand regime confirmed (Periods 26-29): average demand is ~100 units, a 54% decrease from the high-regime (P16-P25) average of 219 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the environment is characterized by a confirmed demand regime shift downward to ~103 units/period (avg of P26-P30) from the previous high of ~219. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit pipeline is 1101 units, but this metric is heavily skewed by a cluster of lost shipments from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 totaling 701 units. Accounting for these losses, the 'effective' pipeline is approximately 400 units (1101 - 701). The OR backend uses the full 'in-transit' value of 1101 for its base-stock calculation. When the OR engine computes 'final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory', it will see 1101 units in the pipeline and likely place an order of 0. Given our current on-hand is 0 and recent demand is ~103, we need to ensure the OR model doesn't over-order once the recent legitimate orders (like the 240 units from P29) finally arrive, while also acknowledging that the 701 lost units will never arrive. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the new lower regime P26-P30) to align the forecast with current demand of ~103. L is set to 3 to maintain a safety buffer against the observed lead time volatility (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: New lower demand regime (P26-P30) confirmed: average demand decreased to 103 units/period (-53% from previous regime).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has returned to a lower baseline, with an average demand of approximately 104 units over the last 6 periods (P26-P31), compared to the high-demand period average of 219. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the in-transit pipeline is extremely large (1101 units). However, a significant portion of this pipeline (701 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19) is confirmed as lost based on the 30+ period history of lead-time variability and the failure of these specific orders to arrive after 10+ periods. The actual effective pipeline is roughly 400 units (1101 total - 701 lost), which still exceeds the base stock requirements for the current demand regime. Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods), so I am maintaining L=3 for safety. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current lower demand level. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR backend due to the large (though partially ghost) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: New lower demand regime (P26-P31) stable: average demand is 104 units/period. Cumulative lost shipments confirmed: 701 units (from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable in its lower-demand regime which started at Period 26. The average demand for the last 7 periods (P26-P32) is approximately 104.8 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime (P16-P25) of 217+ units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a massive in-transit pipeline of 1101 units. However, as noted in previous carry-overs, a significant portion of this pipeline (approximately 701 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19) is confirmed lost, leaving a realistic pipeline of ~400 units. Lead times continue to be volatile (observed range 1-3 periods); therefore, I am maintaining an explicit lead time of 3 periods to ensure sufficient base stock coverage (L+1 = 4 periods of demand). With a targeted base stock based on a mean of ~105, the required inventory level is roughly 420 units. Since the realistic pipeline (~400) is close to this target and the on-hand is 0, the OR backend will decide if a small top-up is needed based on the z-score/sigma, but no drastic ordering is required given the current lower demand.

The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 26. The average demand for the most recent regime (Periods 26-33) is approximately 105 units per period. This is a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime (~219 units). On-hand inventory remains at 0 due to a cluster of lost shipments (701 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19) that has distorted the pipeline view. Despite the 'In-transit' count of 1101, much of this is likely unrecoverable or significantly delayed. Lead times continue to be highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, necessitating an explicit L=3 for safety. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to capture the new lower demand level (avg ~105) across the (1+L) planning horizon. sigma_hat is also calculated using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the current volatility of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: New lower demand regime (P26-P33) is stable: average demand is ~105 units/period. Cumulative lost shipments from P15/P17/P18/P19 (701 units) remain unarrived and are now considered lost by the planning logic.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting at Period 26. Since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 104 units per period (N=9: P26-P34), which is a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime (~219 units). Inventory is currently critical (on-hand: 0) due to massive delivery failures. Specifically, 701 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 are confirmed lost as they have exceeded the max observed lead time of 3 periods by more than 10 periods. The backend 'pipeline_inventory' includes these lost units, so parameters must adjust to ensure the OR engine triggers replenishment despite the phantom inventory. By setting L=3 (explicitly), mu_hat (recent_N=9), and sigma_hat (recent_N=9), we provide the engine with accurate demand statistics for the current regime. Note: The backend will still see a large pipeline (1101 minus lost units = 400 actual units), which means the OR engine might not order immediately until either the pipeline clears or the target stock is set high enough to counteract the 'lost' units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). The average demand from Period 26 to Period 35 is approximately 104 units. Currently, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and a massive in-transit pipeline of 1101 units. However, history confirms that a significant portion of this pipeline (701 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19) is lost. After adjusting for these losses, the 'true' pipeline is approximately 400 units (1101 total - 701 lost), which includes the order of 240 from Period 29. Given the observed lead time volatility (1-3 periods) and the fact that recent orders (since P29) have not arrived yet, I will use L=3 for safety. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current stable demand of ~104 units/period, forecasting (1+3)*104 = 416 units. sigma_hat is also based on recent_N=10 to reflect the volatility in this lower regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 26, stabilizing at an average of approximately 104 units per period (P26-P36). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline (1101 units) is significantly inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19, totaling 701 units. Reconciling the pipeline: 1101 (total) - 701 (lost) = 400 'real' units in transit. These 400 units are primarily from the Period 29 order (240 units) and other smaller recent orders. Since demand has returned to the ~100 units/period level and we have roughly 4 periods of supply 'effectively' in transit (400 units / 100 per period), the system is overstocked relative to the current low-demand regime, though actual arrivals are delayed. I will use N=11 (P26-P36) for demand forecasting to capture this sustained lower-demand regime. L is set to explicit 3 to account for historical volatility and ensure the base stock calculation covers the extended lead time observed.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly downward starting at Period 26. For the last 12 periods (P26-P37), the average demand is approximately 98.5 units/period, compared to the previous high-regime (P16-P25) of ~220. My current state includes an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit pipeline of 1101 units. However, I have confirmed that orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 701 units) are likely lost as they are more than 15 periods overdue. The actual 'live' pipeline is approximately 400 units (the order from P29), which should provide sufficient coverage for the current lower demand regime\u4e00\u65e6 it arrives. Lead times are volatile (1-3 periods), but many orders have stalled completely. I will set L to 3 to ensure safety against these delays and use N=12 for demand parameters to capture the current stable low-demand regime (Period 26-37).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lower demand regime continues: Period 26-37 average demand is 98.5 units. Total 'ghost' pipeline (lost orders) remains 701 units from P15/17/18/19.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level since Period 26, averaging approximately 100 units per period (N=13 for the current regime). There is a significant discrepancy between the recorded 'In-transit' balance (1101 units) and actual expected arrivals due to confirmed lost shipments from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 701 units). These orders are 19+ periods old and will not arrive. Subtracting these from the internal pipeline leaves 400 'real' in-transit units (specifically the order of 240 from Period 29 and other small recent balance adjustments). Since on-hand is 0 and the lead time remains erratic (up to 3 periods), I maintain an explicit lead time of 3 for safety. mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 13 to capture the current 100-unit/period demand trend. sigma_hat is also calculated based on this recent regime to reflect current volatility.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from Period 26. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 39 is approximately 100 units per period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, while the in-transit pipeline is reported as 1101 units. However, based on historical evidence (specifically confirmed in Carry-over Insights), a significant portion of this pipeline (701 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19) is lost and will never arrive. Additionally, orders from Periods 20-25 were small or non-existent, and the next significant order was 240 units in Period 29. Given the promised lead time of 2 (observed 1-3), the arrival of the Period 29 order is overdue or due momentarily. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 'ghost' pipeline (which it cannot identify as lost), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=14, covering the regime since P26) to accurately reflect the current lower demand. I am setting L to explicit value 3 to account for the frequent shipment delays observed in the history, ensuring a higher base stock to buffer against lead time variability.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 41, the system faces a critical inventory imbalance. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit 'pipeline' of 1101 units is severely inflated by 'ghost' orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 701 units), which are confirmed lost. Additionally, orders from P24 (4 units), P25 (10 units), and P29 (240 units) have not arrived, though the P29 order is nearing its expected lead time window (ordered 11 periods ago, but lead times have been erratic). Demand has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 26, with an average of approximately 100 units per period. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly assuming these lost 701 units will satisfy demand, and to trigger a necessary replenishment order, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly based on the recent demand regime (last 15 periods, P26-P40). I use an explicit L of 3 to provide a safety buffer against the observed lead-time volatility (1-3 periods). This configuration will force the OR engine to recognize the current shortfall relative to the required base stock for the 100-unit/period demand level.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a lower demand regime (avg ~107 units since Period 26) following a high-demand peak (Periods 16-25). On-hand inventory is 0, and there is a large 'ghost' pipeline of 1,101 units. Analysis reveals that 701 units from Period 15, 17, 18, and 19 are almost certainly lost (over 20 periods late). Additionally, orders from P29 (240 units) and P25 (10 units) are now significantly overdue given the historical maximum lead time of 3 periods. With no arrivals since Period 25 and 41 periods elapsed, the existing in-transit data is no longer a reliable indicator of future supply. To recover from this extended stockout, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for the frequent delays, and 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=16) to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 107 units/period) while ignoring the preceding high-demand spike. Although the pipeline shows 1,101 units, the OR engine will subtract this from the base stock; since the base stock for a 107 \u03bc limit with L=3 will be around 428, and the backend sees 1,101 in transit, it may not order. However, given the loss of nearly the entire pipeline, I must maintain consistent parameters so that if/when the backend reconciles the pipeline or the cap allow, replenishment triggers.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments now include P29 (240 units), further extending the supply gap beyond the initial 701-unit loss. Total likely lost pipeline: 941 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 26. Since Period 26, demand has averaged ~105 units. However, there is a massive supply deficit: on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline of 1101 units is severely corrupted by 'ghost' orders. Historical analysis confirms that 941 units (from Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, and 29) are almost certainly lost, as they are 13+ periods overdue. Subtracting these ghost units, the functional pipeline is effectively only 160 units (1101 - 941). To restore stock and compensate for the OR backend's inability to recognize lost shipments, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 105-unit demand regime with L=3 as (3+1)*105 = 420. To force the engine to order despite the 1101-unit pipeline, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the reported pipeline: 420 (target) + 941 (lost units) = 1361. Setting L to 3 for safety due to the historical volatility observed.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a secondary regime since Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). The current regime (P26-P43) averages approximately 105 units per period. Supply-side issues are the primary challenge: there is a confirmed cluster of lost orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, and 29 totaling 941 units. This creates a 'ghost' pipeline in the backend's eyes, making it believe inventory is plentiful when on-hand is zero and the physical pipeline is empty. At Period 43, I placed an order of 260 to restart supply. For Period 44, I continue to use L=3 to manage the observed lead-time volatility (1-3 periods). I use mu_hat based on the last 18 periods (N=18, covering P26-P43) to capture the current mean of ~105. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (1361 units) from the calculated base stock, and 941 of those units are lost, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that offsets this loss. Calculation: Target Base Stock for current regime \u2248 (1+3)*105 + safety stock \u2248 500. Backend formula: Order = Base Stock - In Transit. To get a positive order that covers current demand despite the 941-unit ghost pipeline, I set mu_hat to 1500. This ensures the backend sees a requirement, though it will be capped by the safety logic, preventing excessive over-ordering if the ghost units were to miraculously arrive.

Period 45 analysis: The product is in a sustained lower demand regime that began around Period 26. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 44 is approximately 104 units. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced a massive logistics failure with significant lost shipments. Cumulative lost orders include P15, P17, P18, P19 (701 units) and P29 (240 units), totaling 941 units. These are visible in the 1500 units 'in-transit' but will never arrive. To correct the OR backend's inventory calculation, I must use an 'explicit' L to account for the supply uncertainty and 'recent_N' for demand to lock into the current ~100 unit regime. Although huge orders were placed in P43 and P44, they haven't arrived yet. I maintain L=3 for the base stock calculation to ensure the target levels are high enough to cover the lead time + review period given the high history of delays.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of a 50-period game. Currently, on-hand inventory is 169 units with a massive in-transit pipeline of 1240 units. Since Period 26, demand has stabilized into a lower regime averaging approximately 104 units per period (Periods 26-45 avg: 104.2). A significant 'ghost' pipeline exists: orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, and 29 (total 941 units) are long overdue and confirmed lost. Subtracting these from the 1240 total 'In-transit' leaves 299 units (the P44 order of 139 plus remaining units from P43/earlier). With on-hand (169) and the valid pipeline (299), we have ~468 units available to cover the remaining 5 periods. Given the daily demand of ~104, this is nearly sufficient. However, I use explicit lead time L=3 for safety due to historical volatility and lost shipments. I set mu_hat based on the last 20 periods (the stable lower regime) and use a slightly higher sigma_hat to account for the recent variance and risk of further lost shipments, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level for the final days.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47. Currently, on-hand inventory is 43 units following a demand of 126 in Period 46. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 26, with the Period 26-46 average approximately 104 units. Lost shipments are a significant factor: orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, and 29 (totaling 941 units) are considered lost as they are far beyond the observed 1-3 period lead time window. While the 'In-transit' shows 1240 units, 941 of those are 'ghost' units, leaving an actual viable pipeline of 299 units (specifically, the P44 order of 139 units is expected to arrive imminently). The OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic will over-count the ghost units, so I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure it keeps ordering despite the inflated pipeline. I will set mu_hat based on 4 periods (L+1=4) of expected demand (approx 105 * 4 = 420). Given the profit/holding ratio (1:1), the target service level is 50%, making mu_hat the primary driver. We use L=3 for safety due to historical volatility.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable in the low-range (~100 units/period) since Period 26. Specifically, the recent average from P26 to P47 is approximately 104 units. Total in-transit inventory is currently 1240 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, at least 941 units are confirmed lost (Orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, and P29). This leaves an 'effective' pipeline of approximately 299 units (1240 - 941). On-hand inventory is 0. With L=3 (safety estimate for erratic lead times), the REQUIRED pipeline should cover 4 periods of demand (L+1). At ~104 units/period, target base stock is 416 units. Since the effective pipeline (299 units) is below the target, a small replenishment order is necessary. Setting mu_hat to the recent mean of 105 per period (over L+1 = 4 periods) and using recent_N for sigma to capture current volatility.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 49. The product is in a stabilized lower demand regime that began around Period 26. The average demand for the last 23 periods (P26-P48) is approximately 102 units/period. The pipeline inventory is currently 1,240 units, but a significant portion is comprised of 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, and 29), totaling 941 units. If these 941 units are subtracted from the 1,240 in-transit, the true actionable pipeline is 299 units (primarily from the Period 44 order of 139 units). With On-hand at 0 and a true pipeline of ~299 units, the system must bridge the gap to a base stock targeting (1+L) periods of demand. Using L=3 for safety due to historical volatility and a recent_N of 23 for mu_hat (approx 102 units/period), the target base stock is ~408 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1,240 'In-transit' figure it sees, I will use 'explicit' methods. I set L to 3, mu_hat to 408 (102 * 4), and sigma_hat to 40 (based on recent volatility) to ensure the system attempts to replenish to cover the stockout.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26, averaging approximately 103 units per period. Recent data (P43-P49) confirms this trend remains stable despite short-term fluctuations. Lead time remains volatile; while P43 arrived in 2 periods, the history is littered with lost shipments totaling 941 units (Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, and 29) which are now considered 'ghost' inventory. Because the OR backend includes these lost units in the 'pipeline inventory', it systematically under-orders. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that bridges the gap. The target inventory level (Base Stock) should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock. With L=3 (for safety) and mean demand ~103, the base stock should be ~412. However, the backend sees 1240 units in-transit. To force an order that compensates for the 941 lost units, I must set mu_hat high enough so that (mu_hat - pipeline_inventory) results in a meaningful order. mu_hat is set to 1500 (explicit) to trigger the replenishment logic despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative confirmed lost inventory: 941 units (P15, P17, P18, P19, P29). These units will likely never arrive, requiring explicit parameter inflation to bypass backend pipeline accounting.
