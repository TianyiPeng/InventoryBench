The provided historical samples for chips(Regular) show demand values: 131, 92, 118, 125, 106. The mean demand is 114.4 units per period. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. To avoid stockouts during the lead time plus the cycle time (L+1 = 3 periods), I need to cover demand for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3. Since arrivals occur during the arrival resolution phase (after the decision), Period 1 demand will immediately deplete the initial on-hand stock (which is 0), resulting in stockouts until the first order arrives. According to the timeline, an order placed now (P1) with a lead time of 2 will arrive in Period 1+2=3. Therefore, I need to order enough to satisfy demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. Average demand for 3 periods is approximately 114.4 * 3 = 343.2. I will place an initial order of 350 units to account for the lead time and provide a small buffer for variance.",

Current in-game demand for P1 (46) and P2 (131) averages 88.5, which is slightly lower than the seed data but within a reasonable range. c) Lead Time vs. Missing Orders: Promised lead time is 2. The order placed in P1 (350 units) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in P4's start-of-period report. No orders are missing yet. d) Inventory & Pipeline Assessment: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 350 (from P1). Current period is P3. Demand in P3 and P4 will occur before any new order placed now (in P3) can arrive (P3 + 2 = P5 arrival). e) Final Order Logic: We need to cover demand for P3, P4, and P5 (L+1 periods). Estimated demand per period is ~115. Total demand to cover: 115 * 3 = 345 units. We have 350 units arriving in P3. However, we have already lost sales in P1 (46) and P2 (131) due to 0 starting inventory. The P3 demand will also likely be lost if the P1 order arrives *after* the P3 demand resolution (the rules state arrivals happen before demand resolution in the same period). Assuming P1 order arrives in P3, it satisfies P3 demand. By P5 arrival, we need more stock.

I will forecast demand at ~130 for the upcoming periods to be safe. c) Lead Time Inference: The promised lead time is 2. Arrival history shows: P1 order arrived in P4 (LT=3), P3 order arrived in P4 (LT=1). This indicates high volatility in lead times, averaging 2 but with significant deviation. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand = 44. In-transit = 180 (P4 order=100 + P5 order=80). The P4 order (ordered Period 4, promised L=2) should arrive during Period 6 or 7. Period 6 conclude shows 0 arrivals, so the P4 order is likely arriving in Period 7 (LT=3).
