The promised lead time is 2 periods. Current inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. The OR recommendation is 141 units, calculated using the historical mean and a safety stock factor based on the profit/holding cost ratio (which is 1:1, implying a critical fractile of 0.5, or sticking close to the mean). Since there is no on-hand inventory and no in-transit orders yet, we need to establish a pipeline to cover the 2-period lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods). The OR recommendation of 141 units seems slightly conservative given the historical samples often exceed 120 units, but as this is the first period and we need to verify the actual lead time, following the data-driven OR baseline is a prudent starting point to avoid excessive holding costs if the lead time is short.",

Given the high penalty for stockouts relative to holding costs (implied by the lost sales in P1), and the fact that we have zero stock to cover Period 2 and potentially Period 3, I will follow the OR's capped recommendation of 155 to build a more robust pipeline.

Historical demand samples are 131, 92, 118, 125, 106 (average ~114). The demand reported in the 'conclude' messages for P1 (46) and P2 (131) suggests the historical samples provided in the instructions are the ground truth for our forecast. 3. Strategy: The goal is to cover demand for the lead time (2) plus the current period (1), totaling 3 periods. 3 * 114 = 342 units. Current pipeline is 296. We need roughly 46 more units to reach the base stock level. 4. OR Comparison: OR recommends 25 units. OR likely uses a lower mean because it sees the '0' sold units as part of the data or is heavily capping due to the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($1), which results in a critical fractile of 0.5 (z=0). However, entering Period 3 with 0 inventory after two periods of stockouts is critical.

The game history shows that orders from Period 1 (141 units), Period 2 (155 units), and Period 3 (50 units) have not yet arrived. Our promised lead time is 2 periods. For the Period 1 order, we should have seen an arrival in the Period 3 conclude message if lead time was 2 (ordered P1, arrive P1+2=P3). Since 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0, actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is lost. Lead-time inference: Period 1 order should arrive in Period 4 (visible in P5) if LT=3. Demand Analysis: Historical samples (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) suggest a mean of ~114. Recent demand in conclude messages (46, 131, 87) shows high variance but is generally within that range. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 units because the pipeline (346) is high compared to the base-stock level calculated from historical mean (approx 114 * 3 periods = 342). Since we have no on-hand inventory to satisfy demand right now and are waiting for arrivals, ordering more will only exacerbate holding costs once the pipeline clears.

However, the Period 3 order (50 units) arrived in the same Period 4 conclude (lead time: 4 - 3 = 1 period). This suggests significant lead-time variability or an erratic supplier, rather than a fixed shift to 3. The average observed lead time is 2, which matches the promised lead time.\n\n2. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 61. In-transit is 155 (which is the Period 2 order). Based on the Period 4 evidence, this order should arrive during Period 5 or 6. \n\n3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are [131, 92, 118, 125, 106]. The average demand is approximately 114 units per period. \n\n4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 106 units. This calculation uses the promised lead time of 2. Given that current inventory (61) + pipeline (155) = 216, and the base stock for (L+1=3) periods is approximately 342 (3 * 114), the OR is suggesting we order to bridge the gap while being capped by the safety logic. \n\n5. Strategy: Holding cost equals profit ($1.0), which makes stockouts as costly as overstocking. Since the pipeline (155) is likely to arrive this period (given the lead time range of 1-3), and current stock (61) might not cover Period 5 demand (~114), I will follow the OR recommendation of 106 to maintain a healthy pipeline and buffer against the observed lead-time volatility.",

Historical Lead Time: Based on concluded periods, P1 arrived in 3 periods and P3 arrived in 1 period. The P2 order (155 units) is currently missing (L=4), suggesting it may be significantly delayed or lost. Demand Analysis: The empirical mean demand is approximately 114 units per period (samples: 131, 92, 118, 125, 106; noting that sold units in early periods were capped by 0 inventory, but demand was recorded as 131, 87, 130, 105 in history). Strategy: The OR recommendation of 61 units assumes a lead time of 2 and includes the full pipeline (261 units) in its 'inventory position.' However, if the 155 units from Period 2 are lost, the actual inventory position is much lower. Since there is 0 on-hand inventory, we are currently stocking out.

Since 130 arrived in P8, the actual remaining in-transit is likely 120 (from P6) + 125 (newly ordered in P8, though history shows 0 ordered in P8). Re-evaluating history: P7 ordered 130 and it arrived in P8. P6 ordered 120 and it is still out. P5 ordered 106 and it arrived in P8. In-transit 275 likely includes P6 (120) and a residual from P2 (155), confirming P2 is lost. 3.

The OR recommendation is 0 because of the high pipeline count (275), but 155 of that is definitely lost. Following OR would lead to a stockout if P6 doesn't arrive soon.

Effective pipeline = 975 - 275 = 700 units. \n2. **Lead Time Inference**: Historical data shows lead times vary significantly (1 to 3 periods), with a mode around 3 periods.

Given the stockout (on-hand 0) and the high demand regime (~190/unit), I need to maintain the pipeline. Targeting a base stock for L+1 (4 periods) at ~190 units/period = 760 units.

This leaves a functional pipeline of 550 units (P24: 75, P25: 75, P27: 250, P28: 150). \nLead-Time Inference: Observed lead times recently are 2 periods (P26 arrived P28). The P24 order (75 units) and P25 order (75 units) are currently 4-5 periods old and may be delayed or lost, though they aren't fully confirmed as 'lost' yet compared to the 7-period benchmark. However, the lack of arrivals in P27 and late arrival for P26 suggest the supply chain is still unstable.\nDemand Analysis: Recent demand has cooled significantly. After a high-regime peak (avg ~186), the last three periods (P26-P28) averaged 106 units. \nStrategy: The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely influenced by the massive (but fake) 'In-transit' number. Given the functional pipeline consists of 250 units (ordered P27) and 150 units (ordered P28) expected to arrive in P29 or P30, adding 150 more units now ensures we maintain a buffer against the high loss rate.

Concluded lead times have varied from 1 to 3 periods, and multiple shipments (totaling 950 units) have been lost. The last successful arrival (Period 30) followed a 2-period lead time. \n2. **Inventory Analysis**: Current on-hand is 0. In-transit is 1200 units. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, 950 of these units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) are confirmed lost. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P29 (150 units), P30 (0), P34 (100). The P29 order (placed 6 periods ago) is now significantly overdue and likely lost as well. Therefore, the effective pipeline is likely just the P34 order (100 units).\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recently, demand has shifted from a high regime (~180) back to a moderate level. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P28-P34) is approximately 83 units. OR baseline calculates 0 because it likely accounts for the full 1200 'In-transit' quantity without discounting the 950+ lost units.\n4. **Strategy**: With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of only 100 units (expected in P36/P37), we are at high risk of stockouts. I need to replenish inventory to cover immediate demand. If demand is ~85 units/period and lead time is ~2-3 periods, a base stock of roughly 250-300 is needed. Currently, we have 0 on-hand + 100 functional in-transit = 100.

The 'In-transit' count of 1600 includes 1200 units previously identified as confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, and others).

The game is near conclusion (Period 48 of 50). We only need to cover demand for Periods 48, 49, and 50. \n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees a massive (but mostly lost) pipeline. However, with 0 on-hand and the functional pipeline (400 units) arriving over the next 1-3 periods, we are likely to stock out in P48 and potentially P49 if the P44 order (125 units) doesn't arrive immediately. Since we are at the end of the game, we must ensure we have stock for the final two periods without over-ordering and incurring holding costs at the very end.

Recent updates suggest the functional pipeline is much smaller.

Specifically, P44 is now 5 periods overdue (ordered P44, current P49, promised 2), which strongly suggests it might be lost based on previous patterns where orders exceeding lead time 3 are rarely delivered. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has averaged 92 units over the last 5 periods (P44-P48). With Period 50 being the final period, the goal is to satisfy Period 49 and Period 50 demand without over-ordering and incurring holding costs. Total expected demand for the remaining 2 periods is approximately 200 units. Functional pipeline (P45-P48) totals 375 units. Even if P44 is lost, the P45-P48 orders (if they arrive in time) should cover the remaining needs.
