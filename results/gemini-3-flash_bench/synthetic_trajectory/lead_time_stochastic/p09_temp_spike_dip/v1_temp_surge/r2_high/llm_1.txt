Orders placed in P1 arrive in P1+2=P3. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: Currently zero on-hand and zero in-transit. To cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (the L+1 window), I need to ensure sufficient stock for approximately 3 periods of demand + a small buffer for variance. (e) Final Order Logic: Target stock level ~115 (avg) * 3 = 345 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are 0, I will order enough to cover the immediate pipeline and start building inventory. However, placing a large order immediately balances the risk of stockouts in P2 and P3 vs. holding costs. Ordering 350 units targets an average of roughly 116 per period over the lead time window.",

The P1 order of 350 units should arrive DURING Period 3 and be visible in P4 start (which it isn't), or arrive DURING Period 4 and be visible in P5 start. Looking at 'In-transit: 500' (350 from P1 + 150 from P2), nothing has arrived yet. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives in P3 resolution and is visible at P4 start.

Lead times have shown significant volatility, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P9 arrived in 3, P10 in 2, P11 in 3).

The total pipeline is high, but given previous shipment losses (P2, P6) and lead time variability, maintaining a consistent incoming flow is safer than pausing. Since current inventory (75) + expected arrivals soon (P12 order) should cover immediate demand, but the pipeline already contains 625 units (enough for ~6 periods of demand), I will place a smaller replenishment order of 100 to maintain the flow without excessively increasing holding costs, as total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is currently 700 units against a 4-period demand target of ~450.",

Historically, the lead time has varied between 1-3 periods, but has recently been 1-2 periods. The current in-transit pipeline is significantly inflated (1590 units) due to massive over-ordering during previous periods of loss and high high demand; however, most of that pipeline originates from periods (P17-P19, P24-P25) confirmed lost in history or from Period 41 (80 units). Given the target is to satisfy demand for the next 3 periods (Period 42, 43, 44) while on-hand is 0, and noting the P41 order of 80 units is likely to arrive in Period 42 or 43, I need to place an order to ensure availability. However, looking at the in-transit amount of 1590, there are hundreds of units unaccounted for that may arrive and create significant holding costs. Given we are at Period 42/50, with 0 on-hand and the last demand being 87, I will order 120 units to cover estimated demand while considering the 80 units already in the immediate pipeline (P41) and the high probability of stockout if I rely solely on the unreliable 'in-transit' volume.",

Specifically, the Period 37 order (150 units) is now 6 periods old and likely lost. The Period 40, 41, and 42 orders (totaling 240 units) are the only reliable upcoming arrivals. Given the stockout in P41 and P42 and the high revenue-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), I will place an order of 120 units to maintain the pipeline against a projected demand of ~100-120 units/period, while monitoring the transition of the large in-transit balance to either arrivals or confirmed losses.",

To cover demand for the next 3 periods (Period 45, 46, and 47) at 110 units/period (Total 330 units) while accounting for the expected arrivals of 240 units (P42, P43), I will place a conservative order to rebuild on-hand safety stock without over-committing to an already bloated (though unreliable) pipeline.

However, more recent orders from P44 (100 units), P45 (120 units), P46 (100 units), and P47 (80 units) totaling 400 units are potentially viable.

In-transit pipeline includes orders from Period 44 (100 units), Period 45 (120 units), Period 46 (100 units), Period 47 (80 units), and Period 48 (50 units). Based on a conservative lead time of 3 periods, the P44 order (100 units) should arrive during Period 47's resolution, and the P45 order (120 units) should arrive during Period 48. However, looking at the 'Period 48 conclude' message, on-hand inventory is 0, meaning nothing arrived during Period 48 (orders from P45/P46 are not yet visible). Since this is Period 49 (the second to last period), the order placed now will arrive in Period 49+L. With a minimum lead time of 1 (arrival in P50) or 0 (arrival in P49), ordering is risky but necessary to capture remaining value if lead times are short. However, because the game ends at Period 50 and the current pipeline (450+ units) significantly exceeds the expected demand for the final two periods (~190 units), any further ordering would likely result in excess inventory and holding costs with no opportunity for sale.",
