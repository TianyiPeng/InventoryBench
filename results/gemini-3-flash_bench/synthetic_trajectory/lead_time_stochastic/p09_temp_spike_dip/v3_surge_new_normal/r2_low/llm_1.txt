On-hand inventory is currently 0. I will target a total pipeline (On-hand + In-transit + New Order) to cover approximately 3.5 periods of average demand (approx 400 units) to account for the L+1 window and a small safety stock buffer, given the high holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit ($1.0), suggesting a conservative inventory policy is prudent.",

In-transit is 400 (from P1). Current 'pipeline' (on-hand + in-transit) = 400.

Current on-hand inventory is 114 units. In-transit inventory consists of 150 units: 110 units from Period 12 (expected around P14-P15), and 40 units from Period 13 (expected around P15-P16). Specifically, the P12 order (110 units) is now at its L=3 lead time limit and should arrive in the Period 15 arrival phase. If both orders arrive as expected, I will have 114 (on-hand) + 110 (P12) + 40 (P13) = 264 units to cover demand for Period 15 and the lead time window. Given the current demand mean of ~85, 264 units covers approximately 3 periods of demand. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the penalty for overstocking is as high as the penalty for stockouts. I want to maintain a pipeline that covers (L+1) periods. With an inferred lead time of 2-3 periods, I need roughly 3-4 periods of demand covered (approx 255-340 units). My current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 264. I will place a small order of 30 units to nudge the total inventory position toward the higher end of that range, accounting for potential demand spikes, while remaining cautious of high holding costs.",
