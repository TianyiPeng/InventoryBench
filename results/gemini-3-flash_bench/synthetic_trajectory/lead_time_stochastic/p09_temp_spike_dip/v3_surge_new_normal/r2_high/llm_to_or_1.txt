Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no history to analyze yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Only 5 historical demand samples are available: [146, 110, 112, 150, 59]. Given the lack of confirmed regime shifts or seasonality evidence at this stage, I will leverage the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical data. This provides a stable baseline for the OR backend to calculate initial order sizes based on the mean (approx 115) and standard deviation (approx 36) of the sample set, scaled by (1 + L) where L=2.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (176 units) is in transit and is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase, which will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message at the start of Period 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 176 units in transit. Demand in Period 1 was 140. Historical demand samples are [146, 110, 112, 150, 59], but specifically for this run's Period 1, observed demand was 140. Given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR engine will naturally target a high service level. The samples provided in the context show a mean demand of approximately 115.4. For mu_hat, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture recent volatility while acknowledging the initial stockout. No lead time evidence exists yet to deviate from the promised 2 periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (176 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 349 units in transit (176 from P1 + 173 from P2). Demand for the first two periods was 140 and 136, but we have had 0 sales due to 0 starting inventory. The L parameter is set to default (2). For mu_hat, the historical mean demand is approximately 138 [(140+136)/2]. With L=2, the base stock should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to focus on the observed demand levels, which are stable. sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' for N=2 to capture the variance from these first observed periods.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3. According to the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message (read at the start of Period 4). However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests a potential delay or loss, but since the lead time is 'promised' and we only have 3 periods of history, it is too early to confirm a permanent shift. Currently, on-hand is 0 and we have 423 units in-transit (176+173+74). Demand samples are 140, 136, 92, and the provided prompt context mentions a Period 5 demand of 59 (though we are currently deciding for Period 4, I will use the history provided in the Game History). Mean demand is approx 122. Setting L to default (2). Mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent downward trend in demand (140->136->92).

Daily Reward (R_t): $910.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we received two shipments: the Period 1 order (176 units, lead time: 3) and the Period 3 order (74 units, lead time: 1). The Period 2 order (173 units) is still in transit (4 units in 'In-transit' are likely leftover logic or rounding, but looking at history: 176+173+74+21 = 444 total ordered, 176+74 = 250 arrived, 444-250 = 194 in-transit, which matches the status). The actual lead timings (3 and 1) average to 2, matching the promised lead time. Demand has been fluctuating: 140, 136, 92, 58, and now 59 in the latest sample. There is a clear downward trend in the last three periods. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this lower demand regime (avg ~70) while maintaining the default L=2 to ensure the OR engine covers the (L+1)=3 period window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2168.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 140, 136, 92, 58, 118 (mean \u2248 108.8). There is a significant downward trend or volatility, with the most recent sample at 118. Lead time (L) history shows variability: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period (average = 2). The promised L is 2. Currently, we have 74 units on-hand and 206 in-transit (orders from P2, P4, P5). Given the variability in lead time (1 to 3 periods), I will maintain the default lead time (2) but use recent demand data to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Period 4 demand was unusually low (58), potentially an outlier or a shift. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current mean and volatility, which provides a balance between the high early demand and the lower recent demand. This ensures the base stock calculation covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 6. Promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times vary (P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period). Orders from P2 (173 units), P4 (21 units), P5 (12 units), and P6 (144 units) are currently in-transit (Total 350). Period 1-6 demand shows significant volatility (140, 136, 92, 58, 118, 106). Period 5 was previously reported as 59 in the prompt's historical samples but summarized as 118 in the conclude message; I will prioritize the 'conclude' message data for forecasting. Average demand per period is approximately 108. Given the stockout and lead time variability, I will use a period of L=2 (promised) but use recent_N=4 for demand and sigma to capture the lower demand trend observed since Period 3 (avg ~94) compared to the initial periods, while maintaining a buffer for the observed lead time volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $399.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with 334 units in-transit. Demand analysis: Samples show mean demand ~110.6 units/period (P1-P7: 140, 136, 92, 58, 118, 106, 96). Lead time analysis: Observed lead times are P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3. Promised L=2, but the average is 2.33 and variability is high. Crucially, the order from Period 2 (173 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods elapsed, promised 2), suggesting it may be lost. Orders from P5 (12 units), P6 (144 units), and P7 (5 units) are within the lead time window. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for observed delays and protect against the high variability. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand forecasting to capture the recent trend (avg ~94) and avoid skew from the initial high samples, allowing the OR engine to calculate appropriate safety stock for the high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile (1 to 3+ periods) with a confirmed delay/loss of Period 2 shipment (173 units) after 5 periods.

Daily Profit: $323.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $323.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 observation: Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0). History shows significant lead-time volatility and lost/delayed shipments. Specifically, the Period 2 order (173 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be treated as lost. Observed lead times have been: P1 (3), P3 (1), P4 (3), P5 (3), P7 (1). The average observed lead time is 2.2 periods. Demand over the last 8 periods (Samples: 140, 136, 92, 58, 118, 106, 96, 122) averages 108.5. The recent demand (last 4 periods) is slightly more stable around 110.5. Given the high stock-out risk seen in Periods 6, 7, and 8, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and the high probability of delay. Mu_hat will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to better capture the current demand regime (~110 per period) scaled by (1+L). Sigma_hat will use recent volatility to allow for a higher safety stock to buffer against lead-time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 2 shipment (173 units) confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed (6 periods elapsed). Lead time distribution is bi-modal (1 or 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2103.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a highly volatile lead time environment. Historical arrivals show a bimodal distribution: three orders arrived with L=1 (Periods 3, 7, 8) and three orders arrived with L=3 (Periods 1, 4, 5). Critically, the Period 2 order (173 units) is confirmed lost as 7 periods have passed. On-hand inventory is dangerously low (6 units) with 368 units in-transit (Orders from P6 and P9). Recent demand (last 5 periods) has stabilized around an average of 110.6 units (118, 106, 96, 122, 111). Given the lead time risk, I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR engine calculates a base stock that covers the 'worst-case' 4-period window (L+1). I'm using recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the current regime and sigma_hat to account for recent variability. This conservative approach aims to rebuild inventory levels despite the lost shipment and lead time instability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 with zero on-hand inventory and 471 units in-transit. A review of the historical lead times shows a clear bi-modal distribution: orders either arrive in 1 period (P3, P7, P8) or 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), while the P2 order is confirmed lost. The average of observed successful lead times is (3+1+3+3+1+1)/6 = 2 periods. However, to account for the risk of stockouts given the zero on-hand balance and the high profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, I will set L to 2 (the promised and mean observed) but use a 10-period demand window to capture the recent high demand variability. Period 10 conclude confirms we stocked out with 0 ending inventory and 87 lost sales. The in-transit inventory includes orders from P6 (144 units, now overdue at L=4), P9 (51 units), and P10 (103 units). Setting L=2 and using recent_N for demand will help stabilize the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable around 100-110 units/period (mean of last 5 periods: 108). Lead time reliability is poor (50% probability of 1 period vs 50% probability of 3 periods; 1 out of 8 early orders lost).

In Period 12, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and high unsatisfied demand in Period 11 (102 units). My previous analysis shows a bi-modal lead time of 1 or 3 periods. Looking at the history: Order P8 (117) arrived P9 (L=1). Order P10 (103) has not arrived as of P12 start (2 periods elapsed). If it follows the 3-period pattern, it will arrive during P13 and be visible in P14. The P11 order (0 units) was a calculation error from the backend. The 'In-transit' quantity of 471 units suggests that P10 (103 units), P9 (51 units - likely delayed), and potentially other recent orders are coming. Given the stockout and the inconsistency of arrivals (50% chance of 1 vs 3 periods), I will set L to 3 to ensure the backend base-stock covers the maximum realistic lead time. Demand is stable around 100-110 units. I'll use recent_N (N=6) for demand to capture this stable regime (averaging 100-110). Using L=3 and recent_N for mu_hat will force the OR engine to target a higher inventory position to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Confirmed stockout for 2 consecutive periods (P10, P11). In-transit inventory is high (471 units), but arrival timing remains bi-modal (1 or 3 periods).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, two shipments (P9 and P10) arrived simultaneously (154 units total), ending the stockout. However, the Period 2 order (173 units) is now 11 periods past its order date and is definitively lost; I am excluding it from 'pipeline inventory' mental calculations. The lead time continues to show high variance, with observed arrivals occurring at 1, 2, or 3 periods (average is roughly 2.1). Demand has stabilized after the initial high-variance start; the last 5 periods (P8-P12) average 100.2 units. Given the bi-modal/volatile lead time (averaging ~2 but frequently 3), I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock covers the longer end of the arrival window. I will use the last 5 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 100 units/period) while protecting against the lead-time risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is confirmed volatile between 1 and 3 periods (Mean: 2.1, Observed: 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2). Period 2 order (173 units) is confirmed lost/retired after 11 periods. Demand regime stable at ~100 units (Last 5 periods mean: 100.2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1019.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, start on-hand inventory is 26 units with 382 units in-transit. Demand has stabilized at a lower level recently, with the last 5 periods (P9-P13) averaging 86.8 units, though the longer-term mean is closer to 100. The lead time remains highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.1 periods). The Period 2 order (173 units) is definitively lost. Pipeline inventory consists of orders from Period 13 (65 units) and remaining untracked legacy orders that have not arrived. Given the low on-hand stock (26) and a mean demand of ~87-100, we face a stockout risk if the Period 13 order takes 3 periods to arrive. To balance the service level against the bi-modal lead time and recent demand dip, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the current lower volume, while maintaining an explicit lead time of 2 to reflect the average observed delay. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the pipeline while being responsive to the most recent demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Last 5 periods average dropped to 86.8 units compared to earlier average of 110+; Lead time volatility persists with a bi-modal distribution of 1 and 3 periods (Mean 2.1).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 382 units in-transit. A stockout occurred again in Period 14 (demand 98, sold 26). The lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.1 periods), and the Period 2 order (173 units) is officially confirmed lost after 13 periods. In-transit inventory includes the orders from Period 13 (65 units), and earlier massive orders that are overdue. Demand has softened recently: the last 5 periods (P10-P14) averaged 84.4 units, down from the earlier average of ~110. To recover and manage this volatile lead time, I will set L to 3 (explicitly choosing the upper bound of the bi-modal distribution) and use a recent_N strategy for demand (N=5) to reflect the current lower demand regime, preventing over-ordering while aiming to clear the stockout once shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods 10-14 average is 84.4 units, confirming a ~25% decrease from the original mean of 110+. Lead time remains bi-modal (1 or 3 periods).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a significant in-transit pipeline of 402 units. Historical analysis reveals a demand regime shift that occurred around Period 10; the mean demand for Periods 11-15 is 81.0 units, contrasting with the earlier average of approximately 110. Lead times remain highly volatile and bi-modal, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average observed lead time is ~2.1). The Period 2 order (173 units) is confirmed lost. Because on-hand is zero and recent demand has stabilized at a lower level, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (Periods 11-15) to calculate a representative demand for the review and lead time window. L is set to calculated to reflect the actual average lead time experienced (~2), ensuring the OR backend considers the extended pipeline. This approach balances the need to replenish stock due to current stockouts while adjusting for the sustained lower demand regime to avoid future over-holding costs once the bimodal arrivals occur.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1235.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed a massive demand spike (305 units), which is significantly higher than the previous average (approx. 85-110 units). This suggests either a new high-demand regime or a one-time stock-up event. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 337 units in-transit, we must adjust parameters to account for this increased volatility and potential step-change in demand. Lead time remains bi-modal (1-3 periods); the Period 13 order arrived in 3 periods. The Period 2 order (173 units) is treated as lost. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to incorporate the spike while keeping some weight on previous levels, and use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high variance introduced by the 305-unit demand. L is set to calculate to reflect the experienced avg lead time of ~2.2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/spike at Period 16: demand jumped to 305 units, significantly above the previous 5-period average of 84.4 (+260%). Lead time remains bi-modal (1 or 3 periods).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a major demand surge (Period 16: 305, Period 17: 322) compared to the previous average of ~85. This matches a seasonal or trend-based 'spike' regime. I am targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of this new demand level. Although the promised lead time (L) is 2, the actual historical arrivals show a bi-modal distribution of 1 or 3 periods. To avoid stockouts during this high-demand phase, I will use an explicit L of 2 (to reconcile with the OR backend's logic) but set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods). Given the last two demand points (305, 322), I forecast a continued high demand of ~315 per period. 315 * 3 = 945. For sigma, I will estimate a standard deviation of 10% of the mean (~32) and scale it by sqrt(3) to account for volatility across the lead time.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Demand Spike confirmed: Period 16-17 demand average 313.5 (+270% over previous regime). Order P2 (173 units) remains lost after 16 periods. Lead time remains bi-modal between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime (Period 16: 305, Period 17: 322, Period 18: 219). The average demand of this 3-period spike is approximately 282 units/period, a massive increase from the previous baseline of ~84 units. On-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline contains 953 units (P15: 20, P17: 248, P18: 368, and earlier unfulfilled orders). Historically, arrivals follow a bi-modal lead time of 1 or 3 periods (average ~2.1 periods). The Period 2 order (173 units) is confirmed lost. My goal is to set parameters that recognize the new 282-unit demand mean and maintain a base stock that accounts for the 2-period promised lead time plus the review period (L+1=3). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the spike, 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility of the spike, and 'calculate' for lead time to use the observed history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: Average demand increased from ~84 to ~282 units/period (+235%) over 3 periods. Lead time remains bi-modal (1 or 3 periods).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted starting in Period 16, moving from an average of ~84 units/period to an average of ~260 units/period (last 4 periods: 305, 322, 219, 194). This necessitates a significant increase in the forecasting parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this higher volume and volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0, despite 1205 units in transit, because arrivals are lagging behind the demand spike. Lead time remains bi-modal (1 or 3 periods), though the promised lead time is 2. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat captures the current high-demand regime, while L=calculate allows the backend to incorporate the observed historical lead time instability (mean ~2.1 periods). These settings aim to restore service levels and prevent further massive stockouts observed since Period 14.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Demand Shift: Period 16-19 average demand is 260 units (+200% from previous regime). Lead time remains unstable/bi-modal between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a sustained high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The average demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) is approximately 255 units per period (305, 322, 219, 194, 235), contrasted with the previous regime of ~85 units. No inventory has arrived since Period 16, resulting in a stockout for the last four periods despite massive demand. There are 1,205 units in transit, but lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.1 periods). The Period 2 order (173 units) is confirmed lost. Because on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand is significantly higher than historical averages, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the new demand level (N=5). I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to use the historical average of observed lead times, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with the higher demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Sustained High-Demand regime confirmed (Period 16-20 avg: 255/period). Prolonged stockout (Periods 17-20) due to lead-time volatility and demand jump. Period 2 order (173 units) remains lost after 19 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a significant and sustained demand regime shift that began in Period 16. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is approximately 245 units, compared to the previous regime of ~85 units. Despite this, the system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.1 periods). High in-transit inventory (1205 units) reflects large orders placed in Periods 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 868 units) which haven't arrived yet. Based on the 3rd-period delivery pattern often observed, these should arrive in Period 20-22 conclusions. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime (approx. 245 * 3 = 735) and setting L to explicit 2 to reflect the promised and observed average lead time. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to account for the increased volatility in this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime shift confirmed (P16-P21): mean demand increased to approximately 245 units/period (+188% from previous baseline). Massive pipeline inventory (1205 units) pending due to lead time volatility (1-3 periods).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 16 onwards) has shifted to a significantly higher mean. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P16-P22) is approximately 246 units. Lead time remains bi-modal (1 or 3 periods) with an average around 2.1 periods. Although there is 1205 units in-transit, recent periods (P17-P22) have seen zero arrivals, resulting in a prolonged stockout. However, since the pipeline inventory (1205) is already far above the required base stock even for this high-demand regime, ordering more would lead to excessive holding costs once the 'logjam' of late shipments clears. My goal is to maintain the high service level once items arrive, using the last 7 periods to define the new 'high' demand mean (approx 246) and standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed massive arrival backlog\u2014zero units arrived between Periods 17 and 22 despite over 1000 units in transit. High-demand regime (P16-P22) mean is 246 units/period.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 240 units/period since Period 16 (P16-P23 avg: 241.6 units). We are facing a severe supply crisis: zero units have arrived since Period 16, despite having 1205 units in transit. The lead time is highly volatile (1-3 periods historically) and is currently experiencing a massive bottleneck or breakdown. Orders from P15 (20 units), P17 (248 units), P18 (368 units), and P19 (252 units) have all exceeded the maximum historical lead time of 3 periods, suggesting a systematic disruption. The OR backend uses a capped ordering policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), and since our pipeline (1205) is significantly higher than even a high-demand base stock (e.g., 250 units * 4 periods = 1000), the backend will place 0 orders regardless of my parameters. My primary goal is to set parameters that reflect the current high-demand reality so that when the arrival blockage clears, the system doesn't immediately stop ordering due to outdated low-demand stats. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the high-demand regime (P16-P23) and set L to 3 to account for the upper bound of the bi-modal lead time and the current delays.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment blockage confirmed: Zero arrivals from Period 17 through Period 23 despite 1205 units in transit. Multiple orders (P15 onwards) have now exceeded the historical max lead time of 3 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical state with zero arrivals recorded since Period 16 (last arrival was Period 13 order), despite 1205 units in transit. This indicates a systemic delivery blockage or a significant extension of lead times well beyond the promised 2 periods or historical maximum of 3 periods. Demand from Period 16-24 has stabilized into a high-demand regime, averaging ~241 units per period. Since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), and our pipeline (1205) already significantly exceeds the expected base stock for a 2-3 period lead time, the engine will not place new orders unless we adjust L significantly or use explicit parameters. However, the priority is clearing the existing backlog. I will set L to 'explicit' at 5 periods to acknowledge the delay while keeping mu_hat and sigma_hat focused on the recent high-demand regime (N=9, covering P16-P24) to ensure that once the blockage clears, the base stock levels are calibrated to the new ~240 units/period demand rather than the historical ~110 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment blockage persists: 0 units arrived from P17-P24 (8 consecutive periods) despite 1205 units in transit. High-demand regime (P16-P24) confirmed with a mean of 241 units/period, a ~120% increase from the P1-P15 baseline.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 26. The system is experiencing a severe shipment blockage; no units have arrived since Period 16 (for 9 consecutive periods), despite an in-transit inventory of 1521 units. The demand regime has shifted upward significantly starting at Period 16; the average demand from Period 16 to Period 25 is approximately 246.4 units per period. Because of the massive backlog (pipeline inventory is over 6x the recent average demand) and the total lack of arrivals, ordering more units will only increase the potential for future holding costs if the backlog clears all at once. The OR backend's capped policy will likely prevent further ordering anyway because pipeline_inventory (1521) far exceeds base_stock (typically ~750-800 for L=2). Since shipments have not moved for nearly 10 periods, the 'promised' lead time of 2 is not reflecting current conditions. I will set L to 10 to acknowledge the blockage, use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment blockage persists: 0 units arrived from P17-P25 (9 consecutive periods) despite 1521 units in transit. High-demand regime (P16-P25) mean is 246.4 units/period.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a severe shipment blockage. No units have arrived since Period 16 (10 consecutive periods), despite 1,844 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2, but the actual lead time for pending orders has now exceeded 11 periods (for the Period 15 order). Demand shifted at Period 16 from ~84 units/period to an average of ~234 units/period (P16-P26 average). Because on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory (1,844) dwarfs even the highest demand scenario (1,844 / 234 \u2248 7.8 periods of coverage), placing additional orders is counterproductive until the backlog clears, as it would only lead to massive holding costs once the 'dam breaks.' I will set L to 11 to reflect the minimum actual lead time observed for the oldest pending order, and mu_hat using recent_N=11 to capture the high-demand regime. However, the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline) will correctly yield a 0 order due to the massive in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment blockage confirmed: zero arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (P17-P26). Oldest pending order (P15) now at lead_time 11. High-demand regime (P16-P26) mean is 234.3 units/period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime (started Period 16) with a severe systemic supply chain blockage. No shipments have arrived since Period 16 (11 consecutive periods), despite an in-transit inventory of 2176 units. The cumulative demand since the last arrival in Period 16 is 2507 units, while only 65 units were sold. This indicates a massive backlog of unmet demand that will likely manifest as high sales the moment the blockage clears. The average demand for the high-demand regime (P16-P27) is approximately 227.7 units/period. Given the promised lead time (L=2) and the current 11-period delay, I will set an explicit lead time of 11 to reflect the reality of the blockage,\u867d\u7136 OR backend will cap the order. Since on-hand is 0 and in-transit (2176) is already very large compared to the expected base stock for a lead time of 2, the backend will likely not place a large new order, which is appropriate to avoid massive holding costs if all 2176 units arrive at once. I'll use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat to capture the current high regime.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment blockage persists: 0 units arrived from P17-P27 (11 consecutive periods) despite 2176 units in transit. High-demand regime (P16-P27) mean is 227.7 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3357.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The systemic shipment blockage that lasted from Period 17 to Period 27 has finally broken. In Period 28, a large shipment of 323 units (ordered in P26) arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, leaving 139 units on-hand. This confirms the supply chain is operational again, although the massive backlog of 2183 units (dating back to P15) is still pending and could arrive at any time. The demand regime from P16-P28 has a mean of 224.3 units. Given the high pipeline inventory (2183 units) relative to the current on-hand (139) and the mean demand (~225), the OR backend's capped policy will likely suppress new orders until the backlog clears. I am setting L to explicit 3 to account for the recent history of delays while recognizing the P26 arrival. mu_hat is set to the recent demand average (P16-P28) to reflect the sustained high-demand regime, and sigma_hat is adjusted for the observed volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Shipment blockage broken at Period 28: 323 units arrived (P26 order, LT=2). Massive pipeline backlog of 2183 units remains from P15 onwards. High-demand regime (P16-P28) sustained with mean ~224 units/period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The systemic shipment blockage that lasted from Period 17 to Period 27 has broken, with orders from P26 and P27 arriving exactly on the promised lead time of 2 periods. However, there is still a massive backlog of unfulfilled in-transit units (1,851 units) from historical orders (P15-P25) that are significantly overdue. If these 'ghost' units arrive all at once, they will cause massive holding costs. The current demand regime (P16-P29) has a mean of approximately 218 units/period, though the last few periods (P26-P29) have trended lower (~143 units). Given the high on-hand inventory (338 units) and the risk of a 'bullwhip' arrival of the 1,851 units in transit, I am setting parameters to prevent further ordering while the system clears. I will use the recent high-demand regime (last 14 samples) to set mu_hat, but the high pipeline relative to the base stock calculation will naturally result in a zero order from the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Shipment blockage broken at P28; lead time for recent orders (P26, P27) returned to promised 2 periods. Massive backlog of 1,851 units (P15-P25) remains in-transit and overdue by 4-14 periods, posing a significant holding cost risk if reconciled.

Daily Reward (R_t): $932.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics blockage has partially cleared with orders from P26-P28 arriving exactly on the promised lead time (L=2). However, a massive backlog of 1,521 units (from P15-P25) remains in the pipeline, overdue by 5 to 15 periods. These units pose a significant holding cost risk if they arrive simultaneously. Period 30 data shows a drop in demand to 80 units, following a peak regime; the current average demand for the high-demand regime (P16-P30) is 214 units, but the most recent 3 periods average only 132 units. Given the high on-hand inventory (588) and the large pipeline, I will set L to the default (2) as recent logistics have normalized, but I will reduce mu_hat to reflect the cooling demand and prevent over-ordering while the system digests the pending backlog. I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the recent cooling trend (avg ~131) while maintaining a buffer for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Recent arrivals (P26-P28) confirm an immediate return to a 2-period lead time for new orders, though P15-P25 orders (1521 units) remain unaccounted for. Demand has cooled from the ~280 peak to ~132 over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1032.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has stabilized after a massive supply-chain blockage and demand surge. Recent lead times for orders P26, P27, and P28 have returned to the promised 2 periods (arriving in P28, P29, and P30 respectively). Demand has notably cooled from the spike seen in Periods 16-25 (avg ~240) to a much lower level (avg ~98 over the last 4 periods: 113, 145, 184, 133, 80, 81). Current on-hand inventory is 507 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of current demand. Furthermore, there is a massive 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 1521 units from orders P15-P25 that are severely overdue (11+ periods). If these units were to arrive suddenly, we would face excessive holding costs. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime (last 10 periods to capture the cooling trend) while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 2. The OR engine will likely place zero orders given the high on-hand and pipeline inventory relative to current demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Last 5 periods (P27-P31) mean is 104.6, a ~57% decrease from the P16-P26 peak (~240). Lead time for new orders has returned to 2 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data (Periods 28-32) confirms that the shipment blockage that lasted from Period 17 to Period 27 has ended. New orders (P26, P27, P28) arrived with a consistent 2-period lead time. However, a massive historical backlog of 1521 units remains 'in-transit'. Based on Carry-over Insights (Period 9, 13, 21), a portion of this (at least the P2 order of 173 units) is likely lost. The larger risk is the potential for these 1521 units to arrive simultaneously, creating significant holding costs. Demand has cooled significantly from the P16-P26 peak (~240 units) to a 5-period average of 120.8 units (P28-P32). Given the current on-hand inventory of 381 units covers approximately 3 periods of this 'cooled' demand, and the 1521 units in pipeline (even if partially lost) represent over 12 periods of demand, I am setting parameters to prevent any new orders. Setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat to the recent 5-period average (scaled for L+1), and sigma_hat based on recent volatility captures the current regime while the backend's capped policy will see the high pipeline and refrain from ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed return to 2-period lead time for new orders (P26-P28). 1521 units remain in pipeline backlog (P15-P25), presenting high holding cost risk if reconciled suddenly. Demand cooling trend stabilized (P28-P32 mean: 120.8).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following the cooling from the Period 16-26 peak (~240 units). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is 110.6 units, returning close to the initial baseline after a significant spike. Lead times for new orders have stabilized at the promised 2 periods (as seen in P28-P30 arrivals). However, there is a substantial holding cost risk: 1521 units remain 'in-transit' from the blockage period (P15-P25). If these arrive unexpectedly, on-hand inventory will surge far beyond demand, incurring massive holding costs. Given current on-hand inventory is 248 units (covering ~2 periods of demand) and the massive pipeline backlog exists, mu_hat is set to reflect the current 110-unit mean using a recent_N of 5. L is set to default (2) as the shipping channel is clear again. No new orders are being triggered by the OR backend due to the large pipeline inventory (1521) already exceeding base stock levels, which is the correct defensive posture against the potential arrival of the backlog.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend stabilized: Mean demand from P29-P33 is 110.6 units/period, marking a return to the pre-spike baseline levels. Lead time for new orders remains consistent at 2 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized back to its historical baseline. The demand average from Period 29 to Period 34 is approximately 116 units/period, following a significant spike that peaked around Period 17-25. The lead time for new orders has returned to the promised 2 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P28-P30), although a massive backlog of 1521 units remains 'in-transit' from order periods P15-P25. This backlog represents a significant holding cost risk if it arrives suddenly. Given the on-hand inventory of 102 units and the expected cooling demand, the inventory level is currently sufficient to cover the next period's demand without a new order. I am utilizing 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=6) to capture the stabilized post-spike demand regime and 'default' for L and sigma_hat as lead time performance has normalized to the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend stabilized: Mean demand from P29-P34 is 116.5 units/period, confirming a return to pre-spike baseline levels. Lead time for new orders remains consistent at 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1938.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime following the massive spike between Periods 16-26. The mean demand for the last 7 periods (P29-P35) is approximately 115 units, which aligns with the pre-spike baseline. A return to the promised lead time of 2 periods was confirmed for orders placed in P26-P28. However, there is a massive pipeline backlog of 1521 units (from orders P15-P25) that has been in-transit for 10-20 periods. If these arrive suddenly, they pose a significant holding cost risk ($1/unit). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 35's demand. I need to order enough to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (Review=1), totaling 3 periods of demand. Given the 1521 units in 'In-transit', the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will likely result in a zero order unless I explicitly manage the parameters. Since the 1521 units are highly suspect (likely lost or indefinitely delayed), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current stable 115 unit/period demand, and L=2 to reflect the recent successful deliveries. The pipeline inventory will likely block new orders until it is manually reconciled or the stockout persists, but setting mu_hat based on recent data is the best statistical approach.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime after the Period 16-26 spike. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P29-P36) is approximately 117 units, reverting to pre-spike baseline levels. Lead time for new orders (P26-P28) confirmed a return to the promised 2 periods, while a massive backlog of 1521 units (from P15-P25) remains 'in-transit'. Given the 10-period blockage observed previously, these units are likely lost or delayed indefinitely. However, because the OR backend treats 'in-transit' as live inventory until delivered, it will not place new orders if 'pipeline inventory' (1521) exceeds the 'base stock'. Currently, on-hand is 0 and demand is ~117. Since the backend capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom 1521 units in transit, or accept a manual override. I'll use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) horizon (3 periods) plus the stuck pipeline, ensuring the backend orders enough to cover immediate demand (approx 120 * 3 = 360) plus a buffer, while recognizing the in-transit units are essentially invisible to physical stock availability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 29-36 average is 117.1 units/period. The 1521 units in-transit (P15-P25) have not arrived for 11+ periods and are effectively lost for operational planning, though still counted in system pipeline.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level following a significant spike (Periods 16-26). The average demand over the last 9 periods (P29-P37) is approximately 113.5 units/period, which aligns with pre-spike levels. Lead time for recent reliable orders (P26-P28) returned to the promised 2 periods; however, there is a massive 'ghost' pipeline of 1521 units (P15-P25) that are 12+ periods overdue and highly unlikely to arrive. These units inflate the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation, preventing new orders unless L, mu_hat, or sigma_hat are adjusted. To force necessary orders while on-hand is 0, I will use an 'explicit' L of 1 to reduce the required pipeline coverage and an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the current mean (~114) for a 2-period horizon (L+1=2) to bypass the systemic blockage in the backend's logic caused by the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable at the lower regime (P29-P37 mean: 113.6). Orders P15-P25 (1521 units) are confirmed as effectively lost for planning purposes as they have not arrived for 12+ periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~115 units per period over the last 10 periods (P29-P38 mean: 112.7), following the massive spike observed between P16 and P28. Lead time for new orders recently returned to the promised 2 periods (P26-P28 arrivals), though we currently face a massive pipeline of 1971 units. A major portion of this pipeline (1521 units from P15-P25) has not arrived for over 13 periods and is likely lost or indefinitely delayed. However, the system still 'sees' them in the pipeline inventory. Since we are at Period 39 with on-hand inventory at 0 and a recent order of 450 units (P37) expected to arrive in Period 39 or 40, we must be cautious. The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline) will prevent ordering if it sees the 1971 units as viable. To ensure we have stock for the final periods given the cooling demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current stable regime (last 10 periods) and use an explicit lead time of 2. I am capping mu_hat to reflect the ~115 average * (1+L) to avoid triggering massive orders while we wait for P37 to arrive.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime following the massive spike observed between Periods 16-26. The average demand for the most recent 11 periods (P29-P39) is approximately 115 units/period, which aligns with the pre-spike baseline. Regarding supply, we are currently facing a potential stockout as on-hand inventory is 0. Recent data confirms that new orders (P26-P28) are arriving with a standard lead time of 2 periods. However, there is a massive 'phantom' pipeline of 1,521 units (from orders P15, P17, P18, P19, and P25) that has been overdue for over 14 periods. If these units arrive suddenly, they would incur massive holding costs. However, since the system counts them in the pipeline, the backend OR policy (which uses pipeline inventory) will logic-gate new orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to overcome this 'in-transit' figure. Since we need to bridge the stockout but must be cautious of the 1,521-unit risk, I will set L to the promised 2 periods, mu_hat to an explicit value (600) to ensure a small order is triggered if the backend sees 'in-transit' as a hard constraint, though strictly speaking, 1971 units in-transit (including the P37 order of 450) far exceeds demand. The P37 order of 450 units is expected to arrive in Period 39 or 40 (concluding in P40/41). To maintain continuity and safety, I will use recent demographic data for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed for Period 29-39: Mean demand 115.6 (+/- 15%). Lead time for newly placed orders is confirmed at 2 periods (Observed: P26, P27, P28). Pipeline inventory contains 1,521 units (P15-P25) that are 14+ periods overdue and highly likely lost; these units currently distort the pipeline inventory calculation.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 115-120 units/period (P29-P40 mean: 115.6) after the logic-breaking massive spike in Periods 16-25. Lead time for recent active orders (P26-P28) was consistently 2 periods. However, the system is currently in a critical state due to massive 'In-transit' inventory (1971 units), of which 1521 units (from orders P15-P25) are over 15 periods overdue and effectively lost. The most recent order placed was P37 (450 units), which should have arrived during P39 or P40 based on the 2-period lead time, but has not yet concluded. This suggests either another blockage or a drift in lead time. Given the high in-transit value (1971) against a relatively low demand (115), the OR backend (base-stock policy) will not order more unless the pipeline is discounted. Since I cannot explicitly 'cancel' the 1521 lost units in the backend, I must maintain parameters that reflect the current stable demand regime (recent_N=12 for P29-P40) and standard lead time, while acknowledging that the on-hand stock is 0 and we are waiting for P37 to arrive. I will use 'default' for L (2 periods) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-spike stability.

Carry-over insight: Order P37 (450 units) is currently overdue (placed P37, expected arrival P39/P40, not concluded as of P41 START).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 115.6 units/period (P29-P41), following a massive spike that ended around P28. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (1971 units) is heavily distorted by 1521 units from orders P15-P25 which are 16+ periods overdue and effectively lost. Furthermore, order P37 (450 units) is now 4 periods overdue (expected P39), suggesting a return of lead-time instability (blockage). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (1971) from the base stock, it will not place a new order if I use 'default' L. To force an order and mitigate the stockout while acknowledging the likely loss of the bulk of the pipeline, I will set L to 'explicit' at 5 periods. This increases the base stock target. I will also set mu_hat to 'explicit' at 690 (representing a 115 mean * (1 + 5 periods)) and sigma_hat to 'explicit' at 70 to provide a protective buffer against the current arrival delay. This strategy aims to overcome the legacy pipeline distortion and current delivery blockage.

Carry-over insight: Lead time blockage re-emerging: Order P37 (450 units) is 4 periods overdue as of P42 start (promised 2), following a period of stability. Operational pipeline should ignore P15-P25 (1521 units) as they are >15 periods overdue.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a renewed shipment blockage. Order P37 (450 units) is now 5 periods overdue (placed P37, should have arrived by P39/P40), following a pattern similar to the blockage seen between P17-P27. On-hand inventory is 0, and the demand regime is stable at approximately 115-120 units per period (the P29-P42 average is 115.8). The in-transit inventory of 1971 units is heavily distorted: 1521 units (P15-P25) are over 15 periods overdue and effectively lost, while 450 units (P37) are delayed due to the current blockage. To force the OR backend to place a new order despite the high theoretical pipeline, L is set explicitly to 6 (reflecting the current delay of P37) and mu_hat is set to 805 (representing 115 units/period * (6+1)). This elevated mu_hat should overcome the 'phantom' pipeline inventory and trigger a necessary replenishment order given the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Second systemic shipment blockage confirmed: P37 (450 units) is 5 periods overdue as of P43 start. Operational planning continues to treat P15-P25 (1521 units) as lost/retired.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a critical logistical situation for chips(Regular). Analysis of the history reveals two key issues. First, there is a massive 'ghost' pipeline of 1,521 units (from orders P15-P25) that are now 18-28 periods overdue and almost certainly lost; if the backend includes these in its 'pipeline_inventory', it will consistently under-order. Second, a new shipment blockage is confirmed: order P37 (450 units) is now 6 periods overdue (placed P37, expected P39, currently P44 start), mirroring the blockage seen between P17-P27. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime (P29-P43 mean: 114.3 units) after the mid-game spike. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 'ghost' pipeline and the current delivery delay, I am setting L to 8 (explicitly accounting for the current delay of P37) and mu_hat to a very high 'explicit' value (1800). This 'explicit' mu_hat is designed to overrule the high in-transit count (1,971) by setting a base stock high enough to trigger an order (approx 1,800 + safety stock), ensuring we attempt to restock the currently empty shelves (on-hand: 0).

Carry-over insight: Second systemic shipment blockage confirmed: P37 (450 units) is 6 periods overdue as of P44 start. Operational demand baseline for P29-P43 remains stable at 114 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 concludes with zero arrivals, confirming a sustained shipment blockage. Order P37 (450 units) is now 7 periods overdue (placed P37, should have arrived P39/P40). Total in-transit is 1971 units, but 1521 units (P15-P25) are over 19 periods overdue and must be treated as lost. Consequently, the operational pipeline only considers P37 (450 units). Demand remains stable in the current regime (P29-P44) with an average of approximately 114 units/period and low variance. Due to the high risk of a supply-chain 'thaw' leading to a sudden inventory dump (and massive holding costs), and the fact that we have 450 units (roughly 4 periods of demand) already in the operational pipeline, I will not place new orders. Setting L to 8 explicitly to account for the current delay of P37, and mu_hat to reflect the 114 unit/period demand over this extended lead time to signal the OR engine to hold off on new orders given 'pipeline' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Second systemic shipment blockage persists: 0 units arrived from P38-P44; P37 (450 units) is now 7 periods overdue. Operational demand baseline remains stable at ~114 units/period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46. A second systemic shipment blockage is confirmed: order P37 (450 units) is now 8 periods overdue (placed P37, expected P39, currently P46 start and zero arrivals since P30). The operational pipeline is severely distorted by 1,521 units (P15-P25) and 450 units (P37) that are significantly overdue. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have been stocking out since Period 35. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the mean demand from P29 to P45 is approximately 115 units/period. Because current 'In-transit' (1971 units) far exceeds any reasonable base stock for a lead time of 2, the OR backend's inventory-position logic (base_stock - pipeline) will result in zero orders. However, since the pipeline is physically blocked, we must adjust L or mu_hat to trigger an order if we believe the blockage might clear, or maintain settings if we are avoiding holding cost risk from a 'sudden arrival deluge'. Given the persistent blockage (P38-P45), I will set L explicitly to a higher value to reflect the current delay and use recent_N for demand to capture the stable 115-unit regime. I will keep mu_hat and sigma_hat aligned with the recent stable period (N=17, covering P29-P45).

Carry-over insight: Second systemic shipment blockage extended: zero arrivals for 15 consecutive periods (P31-P45); P37 (450 units) is 8 periods overdue. Total 'ghost' pipeline inventory is 1971 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a secondary systemic shipment blockage. No units have arrived since Period 30, and the most recent order from Period 37 (450 units) is now 9 periods overdue (placed P37, expected P39). This mirrors the first blockage (P17-P27) where the pipeline became effectively 'ghost' inventory. Currently, 1971 units are in-transit (1521 units from P15-P25 and 450 units from P37), none of which are arriving. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the mean for Periods 29-46 is 114.3 units. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is stalled, I must keep L high to account for the blockage, but I avoid over-ordering because if the blockage clears suddenly (as it did in P28), the holding costs on 1971 units would be catastrophic ($1/unit/period). Given we are at Period 47 of 50, even if I order now, it is unlikely to arrive before the game ends if the blockage persists. However, I will set parameters to maintain a theoretical base stock that covers the stable demand, using an explicit L=10 to reflect the current delay and explicit mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the stable P29-P46 regime.

Carry-over insight: Second systemic shipment blockage confirmed: zero arrivals for 16 consecutive periods (P31-P46). Order P37 is 9 periods overdue. Current stable demand regime (P29-P46) mean: 114.3 units.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The environment is currently experiencing a severe systemic shipment blockage. No units have arrived since Period 30 (17 consecutive periods of zero arrivals). The oldest relevant pending order (P37 for 450 units) is now 8 periods overdue (10 periods since order), and historical 'ghost' pipeline units from P15-P25 (1521 units) are long-retired. Effective on-hand inventory is 0, and the actual lead time is currently infinite or unpredictable. Demand has stabilized in a regime of ~114 units/period (P29-P47 mean: 114.7). Because there are only 3 periods remaining in the game (48, 49, 50) and the current blockage suggests any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable recent regime but avoid placing new massive orders given the 1971 units already in the system pipeline which would trigger massive holding costs if they arrived, though they are likely lost. I will set L to an explicit high value (10) to reflect the current blockage and ensure the OR backend's cap logic doesn't over-order into a black hole while we are out of stock.

Carry-over insight: Second systemic shipment blockage confirmed: zero arrivals for 17 consecutive periods (P31-P47). Ongoing stockout since P35.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a second prolonged shipment blockage. Order P37 (450 units) is now 11 periods overdue relative to the 2-period promise. No units have arrived since Period 30. Operational on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity (1971 units) is comprised of 'ghost' inventory from P15-P25 (1521 units) and the blocked P37 order. Demand has been stable in the 'cooling' regime since P29, with a mean of 115.5 units/period (P29-P48). Because the blockage is systemic and there's no indication of when it will break, I will set L to 15 (recent observed delay length) to allow the OR backend to potentially trigger an order if the base stock calculation exceeds the current 'ghost' pipeline. However, given the high holding cost risk if all overdue units arrive at once, the 'explicit' mu_hat is set to reflect the current stable demand regime (approx 115/period) over the expanded lead time window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Second systemic shipment blockage persists: 0 units arrived from P31-P48 (18 consecutive periods). P37 (450 units) is 11 periods overdue. Demand regime (P29-P48) is stable at mean 115.5.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained second lead-time blockage. No units have arrived since Period 31 (18 consecutive periods of zero arrivals). Order P37 (450 units) is now 11 periods overdue relative to the promised 2-period lead time. Demand remains stable in a regime that returned to baseline levels around Period 29; the mean demand from Period 29-49 is approximately 115.7 units/period. The total pipeline inventory of 1,988 units consists of 1,521 units from P15-P25 (now 24-34 periods overdue and likely lost), 450 units from P37 (11 periods overdue), and 17 units just ordered in P49. Because the OR engine uses the total pipeline inventory (1,988) to calculate the order, and this figure is dominated by 'ghost' inventory that isn't arriving, the engine will not place any new orders unless base_stock exceeds 1,988. Given our current demand mean (~116) and a projected lead time (best estimated at 12 to account for the blockage), the base_stock calculation would be roughly (12+1)*116 = 1508, which is still below the ghost pipeline. Therefore, I will use an 'explicit' L to force a higher base stock and 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure we attempt to order enough to cover demand if and when the blockage breaks, while acknowledging that service level is currently impossible to maintain until arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Second systemic shipment blockage persists: 0 units arrived from P31-P49 (18 consecutive periods). P37 (450 units) is now 12 periods overdue. Operational demand baseline (P29-P49) is stable at mean 115.7 units/period.
