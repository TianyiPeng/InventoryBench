The order placed in P37 (150 units) is now at lead time = 3; if it does not arrive in Period 41, it is at high risk of loss. The in-transit pipeline is very high (2130) due to several past orders that are mathematically overdue but not yet officially 'concluded' as lost. To manage the current 125-unit demand regime while accounting for the high shipment failure rate, I will maintain a consistent ordering pattern of 150 units. This allows for a safety buffer for the next 2-3 periods of demand (approx 375 units) relative to the 44 on-hand and the expected P37/P40 arrivals.",

Our supply chain analysis shows that approximately 25% of orders are lost, with actual lead times for successful deliveries varying between 1 and 3 periods. To maintain a sufficient service level for the (L+1) horizon (3 periods of demand), we need roughly 375-400 units in the reliable pipeline.

Given the erratic lead time (1-3 periods) and the ~25% loss rate, the 150 units ordered in P44 and P45 are highly likely to arrive in P49 or P50. Even with a 25% loss rate, the sheer volume of the pipeline (over 2000 units including very late potentially lost orders) makes placing a new order for the final period unnecessary and risky due to holding costs.
