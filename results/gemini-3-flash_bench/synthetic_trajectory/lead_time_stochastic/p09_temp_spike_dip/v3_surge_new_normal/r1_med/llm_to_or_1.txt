Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0. We have no starting inventory (on-hand: 0) and no orders in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available: 146, 110, 112, 150, 59. The mean of these 5 samples is 115.4. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. To ensure we have enough stock to cover the current period and the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods), I will set mu_hat based on the mean of all 5 historical samples. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock approximately covering 3 periods of demand (3 * 115.4 = 346.2). Sigma_hat will be calculated using the default method (sqrt(1+L) * historical std) to capture volatility. Since this is the first period and no arrivals have been observed yet, L is set to default.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 176 units based on initial estimates, but since the promised lead time is 2 periods, those units haven't arrived yet. Consequently, 88 units of demand were lost in Period 1 because starting inventory was 0. The demand in Period 1 was 88, but the provided historical samples show a different sequence (P1: 146, P2: 110...). Reconciling this, I will use the historical samples to forecast. The mean of the historical samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) is 115.4. Given the lead time is 2, the review+lead period covers 3 periods (1+2). Thus, mu_hat = 3 * 115.4 = 346.2. Sigma calculation: the standard deviation of the samples is ~35.7. Sigma_hat = sqrt(3) * 35.7 \u2248 61.8. I will use the 'default' method for L (2) and explicit values for mu and sigma based on the full sample set provided to ensure we recover from the stockout as soon as inventory arrives in Period 3.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (176 units) and Period 2 (175 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period (1+2)=3 arrival resolution phase. The 'Period 2 conclude' message correctly shows arrived=0 for P1's order, which is expected. Demand history for the first five periods (pre-game data) shows a mean of 113.4, but recent game play (P1: 88, P2: 79) suggests a slight softening or stabilization at a lower level. With 0 on-hand and 351 in-transit, we need to maintain a base stock that covers demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. I will use recent_N for both mean and sigma to capture the lower demand observed in game play while still acknowledging the prior distribution.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders were placed in Period 1 (176 units) and Period 2 (175 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 3 and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0, and we have zero on-hand inventory, despite substantial demand (P1: 88, P2: 79, P3: 121). All demand so far has been lost. The 'In-transit' quantity of 351 units accounts for the orders from P1 and P2 (176+175). Since the P1 order is now overdue (it should have arrived by the start of P4), there is a delay in the supply chain. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for this delay and adjust mu_hat to cover the higher observed demand (mean of ~100) across the (L+1) window. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to capture the recent higher demand (121 in P3) while acknowledging the high variance.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are reviewing the history of chips(Regular). The promised lead time is 2 periods, but the first delivery (ordered P1, arrived P4) confirmed an actual lead time of 3 periods. Based on the provided demand data (P1: 146, P2: 110, P3: 112, P4: 150, P5: 59), the average demand is 115.4. However, there is a significant drop in Period 5 (59). Given the actual lead time of 3, the backend needs to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1). My parameters will use L=3 to account for the observed delay and recent demand samples. I will use 'recent_N' for demand to stay responsive to the latest fluctuations while smoothing the P5 outlier slightly.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived at start of P4, visible at P5 decision).

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of history shows that the actual lead time is 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 4), which is longer than the promised 2 periods. The Period 2 order (175 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's resolution phase and be visible now, but the 'Period 5 conclude' message shows 0 arrivals. This confirms a lead time of at least 4 periods for subsequent orders or a potential delay. However, looking at the sequence, P1 took 3 periods. If P2 also takes 3 periods, it should conclude in P5; since it didn't, we must adjust L to 4 to account for this observed stretch. Demand has been relatively stable, with the last 5 samples being 146, 110, 112, 150, 59 (Wait, the instructions provide a separate demand list: 146, 110, 112, 150, 59, but the Period History shows demand as 88, 79, 121, 103, 111. I will prioritize the Period History for forecasting). Mean demand (P1-P5) is ~100. With L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+4)=5 periods, approximately 500 units. I will set L=4 explicitly and use the full historical mean to stabilize the forecast, while increasing sigma_hat to handle the lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as at least 4 periods (P2 order placed in P2 has not arrived by end of P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. Demand has been relatively consistent, with a recent 6-period average of approximately 105 units/period (88, 79, 121, 103, 111, 130). However, the lead time is severely disrupted. The promised lead time was 2 periods. The P1 order arrived after 3 periods (Period 4). The P2 order (175 units) placed in Period 2 is now 4 periods overdue and has not arrived by the end of Period 6 (visible at P7 start). The In-transit total of 482 units accounts for orders from P2 (175), P4 (71), P5 (81), and P6 (155). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing stockouts, I must adjust the OR parameters to account for this longer-than-promised delivery schedule. I will explicitly set L to 4 based on the P2 order's current status and use Recent_N for demand to capture the slightly higher recent activity (mean of last 4 periods \u2248 116).

Carry-over insight: Lead time extended to at least 4 periods (P2 order not arrived by P7 start).

Daily Reward (R_t): $284.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing significant instability. While Period 4 and Period 7 conclusions show that orders from P1 and P4 arrived with a 3-period lead time, the orders from P2 (175 units), P5 (81 units), and P6 (155 units) are missing or significantly delayed. Specifically, the P2 order is now 6 periods late. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is consistently around 110-120 units, we are facing frequent stockouts. I will set L to 4 to account for the observed delays and missing shipments, effectively increasing the pipeline target. Due to the high volatility and missing orders, I will use a 5-period window (recent_N) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current mean of ~117 units, and explicit sigma to handle the high uncertainty and prevent under-ordering by the OR backend's inventory cap.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability: P2 order (175 units) is over 5 periods late and likely lost or severely delayed; P5 order (81 units) is also late. Lead time remains erratic but suggests a minimum of 3-4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $302.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe significant lead-time instability. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show a mix: P4 and P5 arrived in 3 periods, while P7 arrived in 1 period. Crucially, the P2 order (175 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost at this point, as it hasn't appeared since its P2 placement. Current on-hand is 102 units. The pipeline (411 in-transit) includes the P2 (175) order which is likely a ghost shipment, along with P6 (155) and P8 (81). Demand is relatively stable (8-period mean ~105). Given the inconsistent arrivals (ranging 1-3 periods and losses), I will set L=3 explicitly to force the OR engine to maintain more safety stock to cover the supply variance. For demand, I'll use a recent 5-period average (approx 113) to capture the trend while smoothing recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: P2 order (175 units) confirmed as lost shipment (overdue by 4 periods beyond max-observed LT). Actual lead time is erratic (varied between 1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent observations for 'chips(Regular)' show a significant shift in lead time performance. Orders from P7 and P8 arrived with a lead time of 1 period (observed at P9 and P10 start), contrasting earlier lead times of 3 periods and the lost shipment from P2. This indicates a recent stabilization at a faster arrival rate than the promised 2 periods. Demand has also seen a recent drop (P9: 56) compared to the historical mean (approx 100-110). Given the carry-over insight that P2 is lost, the in-transit total of 330 units likely contains 175 phantom units (330 - 155 from P6). To avoid over-ordering based on ghost inventory, I will set L to 2 (balancing the recent '1' with previous '3'). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent lower demand trend while maintaining safety stock, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of the recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has shifted again: Periods 7 and 8 both arrived with a lead time of 1 period, suggesting a possible acceleration or return to efficiency after early volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 105 units per period. Period 10 experienced a demand spike of 156 units, which exhausted the on-hand inventory. Lead time has been highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P7 and P8 orders arrived with LT=1, while P1, P4, and P5 orders took 3 periods). The P2 order (175 units) is confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but there are 330 units in-transit (orders from P6, P9, which may be delayed). To protect against the combination of stockouts and lead time uncertainty while accounting for the recent demand spike, I am setting L to 2 (averaging the recent volatility) and using a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the recent higher demand variance (94, 111, 101, 56, 156).

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Supply lead time remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (most recent arrivals were LT=1, but historical mean is closer to 2-3). Demand regime remains stable around 105 units/period despite a P10 spike.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (On-hand: 0) with a large pipeline (In-transit: 387). Demand remains relatively stable with the last 5 samples averaging 106.6 units, despite the P10 spike (156) and P9 dip (56). The primary challenge is lead-time volatility: we've seen LT=3 (P1, P4, P5) and LT=1 (P7, P8). Recent periods (P10, P11) have seen 0 arrivals, which is concerning. P6 (155 units) is now overdue (LT=5), suggesting it may be lost like P2. Between P6 and P11, we have 212 units in transit (excluding the likely lost P6). I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed LTs (1s and 3s), and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime of ~107 units/period. The OR backend will use these to calculate the base stock level required to cover (L+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (155 units) is now 5 periods late and potentially lost, similar to the P2 shipment.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable. P2 (175 units) and P6 (155 units) are confirmed or highly likely to be lost shipments, as they are well beyond the typical lead time window. While some orders (P7, P8) arrived with a lead time of 1, the historical volatility suggests an average lead time closer to 2 or 3 is safer for planning. Demand is relatively stable with a mean around 108 units across all periods, though stockouts are frequent due to delivery failures. With 0 on-hand and 452 units in-transit (some of which are the lost P2/P6 shipments), the inventory position is precarious. I am setting L to 'calculate' to let the OR adapt to the actual historical average lead time of received orders. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=7) to capture the demand mean post-volatility (approx 105-110), and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for recent demand spikes like Period 10.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (155 units) from Period 6 is now 6 periods late and confirmed lost, following the pattern of the P2 order. Total lost inventory to date: 330 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 452 units (P9-P13 orders) in-transit. Demand remains stable, with the average of the last 10 periods being approximately 104 units. However, supply chain reliability is the primary concern: orders from P2 (175 units) and P6 (155 units) are confirmed lost, and there have been no arrivals for the last 4 periods (P10-P13). The observed lead times (LT) have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods for successful deliveries. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the high pipeline inventory (which includes potentially delayed/lost units from P9-P11), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand regime (~104/period). I am setting L to 'explicit' with a value of 2 to align with the promised lead time while the pipeline is already saturated, forcing the backend to maintain a base stock level sufficient for 3 periods of demand (L+1). This balances the risk of further stockouts against the high volume currently in transit.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant stockout. The supply chain for 'chips(Regular)' is highly unstable: orders from Period 2 (175 units) and Period 6 (155 units) are confirmed lost, while actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. The most recent arrival (P11) had a lead time of 3 periods. Given the pipeline contains 395 units (P12 order [65] + any subsequent orders not yet visible as arrived), and we've lost 330 units historically, we must account for this instability. Demand has remained relatively stable (mean ~105, with occasional spikes/dips). I will set the lead time to 3 to reflect the most recent confirmed arrival and use a recent window (N=10) for demand estimation to capture the current regime more accurately (mean ~106). Since we have 0 on-hand and are coming off a series of stockouts, I need to ensure the parameters generate sufficient order pressure despite the large pipeline, as much of that pipeline might be late or compromised.

Daily Reward (R_t): $260.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 106 units per period over the last 10 periods (P6-P15). However, inventory availability has been poor due to erratic lead times and lost shipments. As of Period 16, On-hand inventory is 0. The current 'In-transit' of 405 includes the P15 order (75 units) and likely the P6 order (155 units). Following the pattern identified in earlier periods (P2 order lost), the P6 order (ordered on Period 6, now Period 16) is 10 periods overdue and confirmed lost. This means the functional pipeline is significantly lower than 405. To force the OR backend to order despite these 'ghost' units in-transit, I am setting an 'explicit' L of 3 (the most frequent successful lead time) and an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for (1+L) periods as 4 periods * 106 units/period = 424 units. By using an explicit mu_hat of 424 and an explicit L of 3, the backend will calculate a base stock that accounts for future demand while hopefully overcoming the inflated in-transit figure if the cap allows.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant spike in Period 16 (263 units), which is more than double the previous average of ~110 units. This may indicate a temporary surge or a new demand level. Lead times remain erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with several shipments (P2, P6) confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. With 469 units in transit, including orders from P15 (75 units) and P16 (64 units), the system needs to account for the high demand variation and lead-time instability (L=3). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent spike without overreacting entirely to a single outlier, while using 'explicit' for L=3 to mirror the most common actual lead time observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected: Period 16 demand (263) is 140% higher than the previous 15-period average (approx. 110). Continued logic for lost shipments: Orders overdue by >5 periods are considered lost (P2, P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $256.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16 (P16: 263, P17: 223). Prior to this, demand averaged ~110. The last two periods average 243 units. On-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory (687 units) includes two shipments confirmed as lost (P2 and P6, totaling 330 units) and one large order from P17 (282 units) which is not due yet. Lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.3). To protect against recent demand spikes and lead time uncertainty while accounting for the ~330 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (lost shipments), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected (L+1) demand. With L=3, (L+1)=4 periods of demand at ~240 units/period equals 960. By using an explicit mu_hat of 960, the OR backend will see it needs to raise inventory positions significantly above the actual (healthy) pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to 120 (sqrt(4) * 60) to account for high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~110 to ~240 (+118%) starting P16. Total lost stock remains at 330 units (P2: 175, P6: 155), requiring intentional over-ordering to compensate for the OR backend's inclusion of these units in pipeline inventory.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19. A significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 16, with demand increasing from ~110 to ~240 units per period (+118% shift). I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and sigma estimation to capture this new regime (Periods 16, 17, 18). Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.3). The 'In-transit' quantity of 1026 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments (P2: 175 and P6: 155), totaling 330 units. The OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the base stock. To compensate for the 330 units that will never arrive, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for the new regime (Avg Demand 243.6 * (L+1)) and ADD 330 units to 'trick' the backend into ordering the correct amount. Target Base Stock = (243.6 * 4) + 330 = 974.6 + 330 \u2248 1305. I set sigma_hat using 'recent_N' to ensure the buffer accounts for the high-demand volatility.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 status: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has undergone a significant shift starting at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~110 to ~237 (average of last 4 periods: 263, 223, 245, 218). I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new regime. Regarding lead time, the system is highly volatile with observed lead times of 1 and 3 periods, and two confirmed lost shipments (P2 and P6, totaling 330 units). The OR backend calculates pipeline inventory as 1339 units, but this includes the 330 lost units that will never arrive. To compensate and ensure an order is actually placed (since base_stock - pipeline must be positive), I will set L to 4. This increases the safety stock and the base stock target. By using L=4 and recent_N for mu_hat, the backend will target covering 5 periods of demand at the new higher rate, which helps offset the 'phantom' pipeline inventory and addresses the high stockout risk seen in recent periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted significantly from an average of ~110 units to ~240 units starting Period 16. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline (1339 units) includes TWO confirmed lost shipments: Period 2 (175 units) and Period 6 (155 units), totaling 330 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline from the base_stock calculation, it will under-order by 330 units unless corrected. I will set L=4 (explicit) to account for recent arrival instability and ensure the base_stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (~241/period). For sigma_hat, N=5 captures current volatility. To neutralize the 330 lost units in the pipeline, I use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Math: Target base_stock should be (L+1)*demand + buffer. With L=4, (1+4)*241 = 1205. To offset the -330 units from lost stock in the backend calculation, I must set mu_hat to approximately 1205 + 330 = 1535. This forces the engine to place an order despite the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and massive backorder pressure due to a sustained high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Recent demand (P16-P21) averages approximately 253 units per period, which is more than double the earlier average of ~110. The pipeline currently shows 1,570 units, but this includes 330 units confirmed lost (orders from P2 and P6) which the OR backend still calculates as 'in-transit'. This artificial inflation of the pipeline inventory causes the system to under-order. To counteract this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand, where L=3 based on historical volatility. With demand at ~253/period and L=3, the target inventory is roughly 1,012 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1,570 units in the 'ghost' pipeline, I set mu_hat significantly higher (explicitly 1,850) to offset the 330 lost units and the lag in arrivals from P17-P19. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture the increased volatility of the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed since Period 16: Mean demand is now ~253 (from ~110). Lost shipments (P2: 175, P6: 155) totaling 330 units continue to distort the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation, requiring explicit inflation of mu_hat to trigger necessary restocking.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 16 (avg ~250 units/period) following a significant baseline shift. We are currently facing a critical inventory stockout (On-hand: 0). The most significant issue is the 'Phantom Pipeline Inventory': the OR engine calculates the pipeline as 1908 units, but this includes lost shipments (P2: 175, P6: 155, totaling 330 units) and orders from P17-P19 (totaling 934 units) that are now overdue by 4+ periods, potentially indicating further shipment losses or severe congestion. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this inflated pipeline, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. I estimate the current target inventory level (base stock) needs to cover 4 periods (L=3 + 1) at 250 units/period plus a safety buffer, totaling approximately 1200-1400 units. To overcome the 1908 units pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a target base stock higher than the perceived pipeline + expected demand. I will also set L=3 as the effective lead time given recent delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Supply chain congestion or loss confirmed for P17-P19 orders (934 total units) which are now overdue by 4+ periods. This, combined with previously lost shipments (P2, P6), creates a 1264-unit phantom pipeline.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16, with the average demand for 'chips(Regular)' increasing from ~110 to ~252.6 over the last 8 periods. There is a severe supply chain crisis: multiple large orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are overdue and confirmed/likely lost, creating a massive 'phantom pipeline' of 1,264 units (P2: 175, P6: 155, P17: 282, P18: 339, P19: 313). These units are visible to the OR backend as 'In-transit', preventing it from placing new orders even though they will never arrive. To force the system to order, I must set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock to cover 3 periods of demand (L=2 + 1) at the current rate (~253 * 3 = 759) and add the 1,264 lost units to this value, totaling 2,023. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation triggers an order regardless of the phantom inventory. Lead time is set to 2 (promised), as P21 and P22 recently arrived within 1-2 periods, suggesting the logjam might be clearing for new placements even if old ones are lost.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Phantom pipeline of lost units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) reaches 1,264 units. These orders are overdue by 5+ periods (P2, P6) or 4+ periods (P17-19) and are considered lost in transit. Explicit inflation of mu_hat is required to bypass the OR engine's pipeline inventory check.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stabilized at a mean of ~250 units/period. However, the critical issue is a massive 'phantom pipeline' of lost shipments totaling 1,264 units (P2: 175, P6: 155, P17: 282, P18: 339, P19: 313). These orders are overdue by 5 to 22 periods and are highly unlikely to arrive. The OR backend subtracts the total In-transit (2085) from the calculated base_stock. If we use the actual demand (~250) and lead time (avg ~3), the base_stock would be ~1000, and with In-transit=2085, the OR engine would order 0 units, leading to a stockout. To force an order that covers the next cycle (L+1 = 4 periods) despite the phantom units, I must explicitly set mu_hat high enough to exceed the In-transit count. Target inventory = (Demand * 4) + safety stock + phantom stock. Estimating necessary cushion: ~1264 lost units + (250 * 4) = 2264. I set mu_hat to 2300 to ensure the engine places an order to replenish actual stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Phantom pipeline of lost units confirmed at 1,264 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). These units will never arrive but remain in the backend's pipeline inventory calculation indefinitely. Strategic inflation of mu_hat is mandatory to bypass the order cap and maintain actual on-hand stock.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stabilized at a mean of ~251 units/period (last 10 periods: 263, 223, 245, 218, 247, 324, 239, 248, 244, 263). The 'In-transit' count of 1529 units is heavily distorted by 1264 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2=175, P6=155, P17=282, P18=339, P19=313). These 1264 units are overdue by 6 to 24 periods and will not arrive. However, the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (1529) from its base stock calculation. With on-hand inventory at 560, the 'true' pipeline is only 265 units (P25=190 + some residual). To force the engine to place an order despite the 1264 'phantom' units, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean + z*sigma. For L=2, mean=251, target is ~1000-1100 units. To clear the phantom 1264 units, I set mu_hat to a value that ensures 'mu_hat - phantom_units' results in a sufficient target. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 2000 to overcome the pipeline subtractor and maintain stock for the upcoming periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a massive 'phantom pipeline' issue: a total of 1,264 units from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 are long-overdue and confirmed lost (overdue by 7-25 periods). The OR engine subtracts these 1,264 units from its order calculation, which is why 'ordered=0' appeared in P24 and P26 despite high demand. Concurrently, demand shifted significantly at P16: the mean demand from P1-P15 was ~108, but the mean from P16-P25 was ~241. Period 26 showed a sudden drop to 119, but given the sustained high levels previously, I treat this as a potential outlier or a minor cooling after a spike. To overcome the 1,264-unit phantom inventory bias, I must inflate mu_hat to ensure the backend actually places an order. Target safety stock (base stock) for a 3-period lead-time window at 240 units/period is roughly 960 units. To trigger this order against a 1,702 unit perceived pipeline (441 on-hand + 1,261 phantom), mu_hat must be set above 1,700. I set mu_hat to 2,000 units to force the OR engine to restock and cover the high demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Massive phantom pipeline confirmed totaling 1,264 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). These units are officially lost and will never arrive, but they persist in the backend's pipeline calculation, requiring forced inflation of mu_hat for the remainder of the game to maintain stock.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a massive 'phantom pipeline' of 1,264 units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). The OR engine subtracts this pipeline from the base stock calculation, preventing new orders. To maintain inventory for the current demand regime (~250 units/period), I must explicitly inflate mu_hat to offset these 1,264 units plus the required safety stock. Demand has softened slightly in the last two periods (119 and 135) but I will remain cautious and treat this as potential volatility rather than a full regime shift down, as the previous 10 periods averaged ~250. With current on-hand stock at 306, an order is needed soon to reach a target inventory of ~750 (3 periods of coverage). Setting mu_hat to 2200 (1264 phantom + 936 demand/safety stock) forces the OR backend to place an order despite the 1630 'in-transit' units.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand potentially softening (P26: 119, P27: 135), but maintaining current high-demand strategy until a sustained 3+ period trend is confirmed. Phantom pipeline remains fixed at 1,264 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $244.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter Period 29, the demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 121 units/period over the last three periods (P26: 119, P27: 135, P28: 110), following a high-demand peak of ~253 units/period between P16-P25. However, the system faces a massive 'phantom pipeline' of 1,264 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) which are confirmed lost but still deducted by the OR backend from the order quantity calculation. Because 'In-transit' is visible as 2,021 units while the reality is that 1,264 units will never arrive, the OR backend perceives a surplus that prevents ordering. To overcome this, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that equals the desired inventory level (~3 periods of demand at the new lower rate, which is about 360 units) PLUS the phantom pipeline (1,264). This results in an explicit mu_hat of 1,624. This ensures the backend calculates an order by seeing the current pipeline as insufficient relative to the inflated mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=3 to reflect the lower volatility of the current demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Demand softening confirmed over 3 periods (mean ~121). Phantom pipeline remains at 1,264 units. Explicit inflation of mu_hat is used to force orders despite the backend's false perception of incoming stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $343.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is in a stable demand regime following the softening observed since Period 26 (P26-P29 mean demand ~123 units). The primary operational challenge remains the 'phantom pipeline' of 1,264 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) which are confirmed lost but stay in the OR backend's pipeline calculation. This phantom stock prevents the backend from placing sufficient orders unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated. With on-hand inventory at 169 and actual demand around 123, and a lead time of 2-3 periods, the actual safety stock is low. Current total in-transit is 1,920 units, but 1,264 are dead weight, meaning only 656 units are actually coming. I will override mu_hat with an explicit value that covers the desired base stock plus the phantom pipeline to ensure a replenishment order is triggered. Target base stock = (1+L)*mean + z*sigma approx (3)*123 + 100 = 469. To force this through the pipeline check: 469 + 1264 = 1733.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed demand softening regime continues with mean approx 123 units per period (P26-P29). Phantom pipeline remains at 1,264 units, necessitating continued explicit inflation of mu_hat to bypass backend ordering restrictions.

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the environment is characterized by a significant 'phantom pipeline' of 1,264 units (from lost orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) which the OR engine counts as incoming stock, preventing new orders. Current on-hand inventory is 416 units. The demand has shifted from a peak of ~250 units/period (P16-P25) to a lower regime of ~128 units/period (P26-P30). To maintain availability against the phantom pipeline, I must continue to use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 1,514 (the phantom pipeline 1,264 + 2 periods of current demand at ~125 each) to ensure the backend logic results in a small net order or maintains the 'cap' safety. L is set to 2 (promised). Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to reflect the reduced volatility in the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand regime remains stable at ~128 units/period (recent 5-period average). Phantom pipeline persists at 1,264 units; explicit mu_hat inflation remains the only mechanism to force orders through the backend's inventory check.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 32. On-hand inventory is 337. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime (approx. 120-130 units/period) compared to the Period 16-25 spike. The 5-period average (P27-P31) is 119.2 units. The critical issue remains the 'phantom pipeline' of 1,264 units (P2: 175, P6: 155, P17: 282, P18: 339, P19: 313) which the OR backend perceives as incoming stock, preventing new orders. To maintain a safe inventory level (aiming for (L+1) * demand \u2248 3 * 125 = 375 units) while the backend subtracts 1,264 from its calculation, I must use 'explicit' values to force an order. Since current on-hand (337) is nearly sufficient for the immediate lead time, only a small replenishment is needed to offset upcoming demand. I will set mu_hat explicitly high enough to bypass the 1,264 phantom units and target a base stock high enough to trigger a small order (order = base_stock - (on-hand + phantom)). Setting mu_hat to 1,750 and sigma_hat to 150 will ensure the backend keeps the pipe full without excessive holding costs, adjusting for the fact that on-hand is already healthy.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33, the 'chips(Regular)' stock is at 211 on-hand units with an in-transit pipeline of 1,540 units. However, we have a massive confirmed phantom pipeline arising from lost shipments: P2 (175), P6 (155), P17 (282), P18 (339), and P19 (313), totaling 1,264 units. These units are overdue by 13+ periods (P2, P6) or 5+ periods (P17-P19) and will never arrive, but the OR backend subtracts them from its ordering logic. To counter this, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat to at least 1,264 + (expected demand for L+1 periods) to ensure any order is triggered. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 26; the most recent 7 samples (P26-P32) average ~120 units per period. With a lead time estimate of L=2 (recent arrivals were L=2), the targets for L+1 (3 periods) of demand would be ~360 units. Therefore, I set mu_hat to 1,624 units (1,264 phantom + 360 target) and use an explicit sigma_hat of 60 to reflect current low-regime volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Phantom pipeline remains at 1,264 lost units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Current demand regime is stable at ~120 units/period (P26-P32 average is 120.14).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a lower level (~120 units/period) following the P16-P25 surge. The recent 5-period average (P29-P33) is approximately 116 units. However, we are facing a persistent structural issue with the OR backend: there is a 'phantom pipeline' of 1,264 units (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) that are long overdue and confirmed as lost. These units will never arrive but are included in the backend's 'Pipeline Inventory' calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline Inventory). To force an order when on-hand inventory is low (currently 119), we must set mu_hat high enough to exceed this 1,264-unit phantom pipeline + actual on-hand stock. A target safety stock of ~400 units (approx. 3 periods of coverage) requires a base_stock of ~1800. I will set mu_hat to 1800 to ensure the backend places a replenishment order this period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment has a persistent 'phantom pipeline' of 1,264 units (orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19) which are confirmed lost but still included in the backend's in-transit calculation. To ensure the backend places any order, base_stock must exceed (in_transit + on_hand). Current in-transit is 1,713 and on-hand is 21, totaling 1,734. The demand regime has stabilized at ~120 units/period (P26-P34 mean is 118). To maintain stock and bypass the order cap, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. I will set mu_hat to 1350 (targeting a base stock slightly above the in-transit level to trigger small, frequent replenishment) and sigma_hat to a high value to increase the safety stock buffer. L is set to 2 as the recent deliveries (P27, P28, P32) have shown lead times of 2, 2, and 1 periods respectively.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand stabilized at ~120 units/period (last 9 periods). Phantom pipeline remains at 1,264 units, with total perceived in-transit at 1,713. Extreme mu_hat inflation is required to keep on-hand inventory above zero.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 120 units/period (average of the last 10 periods is 117.3). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The central challenge remains the massive 'phantom pipeline' of 1,264 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) which the OR backend incorrectly includes in its inventory position. The total 'In-transit' visible to the backend is 1,713, meaning it thinks only 449 units (1713 - 1264) are actually on the way. To force an order despite this 1,264-unit phantom stock, mu_hat must be set to exceed the current pipeline perception. Setting mu_hat to 2200 ensures the OR backend calculates a target stock that clears the 1,713 in-transit barrier, allowing for a fresh order to replenish the current stockout. L is kept at 2 as recent successful deliveries (P32 order) show a return to standard lead times.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at ~124 units per period (last 11 periods mean). However, the system faces a massive 'phantom pipeline' issue. The OR backend perceives 2,045 units in-transit (Period 37 snapshot). Based on history, at least 1,264 of these units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost as they are overdue by more than 15 periods. Additionally, the P36 order of 516 units is correctly in transit. The core challenge is that the backend subtracts these 2,045 units from the base_stock calculation. To force a new order of ~250-300 units (to cover 2 periods of lead time + the current period at 124 units/period), the base_stock must exceed the perceived pipeline. We set mu_hat to an explicit value of 2400. With L=2, the base_stock will be ~2400 (plus sigma buffer), allowing an order of roughly 2400 - 2045 = 355 units. This ensures we don't run out of stock despite the backend's false inventory data.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Phantom pipeline remains at 1,264 units (confirmed lost: P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Perceived in-transit is 2,045. Demand remains steady at ~124 units. Continued mu_hat inflation is necessary to bypass the backend's inventory deduction.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a secondary regime of approximately 124 units per period (the average from Period 26 to Period 37 is 123.8). However, a significant 'phantom pipeline' of 1,264 units (from lost orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) persists in the OR backend's calculations. These units are more than 15 periods overdue for the earliest ones and at least 18 periods overdue for P17-P19, confirming they will never arrive. Currently, the backend sees an 'In-transit' of 1,872 units, whereas only the order from P37 (343 units) is actually expected to arrive. To force the backend to place necessary orders and maintain on-hand inventory, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat to exceed this 1,264-unit phantom gap plus the required safety stock. Setting mu_hat to 1,900 ensures that (base_stock - phantom_pipeline) remains a positive, actionable number for the OR backend to continue restocking at the current demand rate.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~123 units per period (P26-P38 average: 124.9). However, a 'phantom pipeline' of 1,264 lost units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) remains in the OR backend's calculation. With a reported 'In-transit' of 1,872 units, and only 608 units (1872 - 1264) actually likely to arrive (from P37 and recent activity), the backend will refuse to order because it perceives we are overstocked (1872 in-transit + 318 on-hand = 2190 perceived units). To force the engine to order and maintain stock for the current demand (approx. 125 units/period), I must continue use of 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock level beyond the 2190 perceived units. Setting mu_hat to 2350 (target base stock) to trigger an order that covers current demand plus an safety buffer, effectively neutralizing the 1,264 unit inventory deficit.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Phantom pipeline remains static at 1,264 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime since P26 is stable at ~125 units/period. On-hand is currently 318, but backend perceives 2190 due to lost units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around 125 units per period since Period 26 (mean of last 14 periods is ~121). However, the primary challenge remains the 'phantom pipeline' of 1,264 units (orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) which the OR backend perceives as incoming inventory but are confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 211, but the backend sees a pipeline of 2,065 units (including the 1,264 lost units). To force the backend to place an order despite this massive perceived surplus, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. With a current real pipeline (arriving units from P37, P39) of approximately 536 units and on-hand of 211 (Total Real: 747), while the backend sees 211 + 2065 = 2276, I need to set mu_hat high enough to overcome this ~1500 unit discrepancy. I am setting mu_hat to 2500 to ensure the base stock levels trigger replenishment and account for the 3-period lead time coverage (1+L=3).

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns. Sustained demand at ~125 units/period. Phantom pipeline remains at 1,264 lost units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 125 units per period since Period 26 (recent 15-period average is ~123). However, the primary challenge remains the 'phantom pipeline' of 1,264 units (from lost orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). These units remain in the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, preventing it from placing new orders because it falsely believes over 2,000 units are arriving. To ensure a physical restock, the mu_hat parameter must be explicitly inflated to exceed this phantom pipeline plus the desired safety stock. With on-hand at 255 and needing to cover approximately 3 periods (L=2 + review), I aim for a target inventory of ~500. To force the backend to place an order despite a perceived 2,125 units in-transit, I set mu_hat to 2,625 (2,125 phantom/active pipeline + 500 target). Sigma_hat is set to its historical standard deviation (~70) scaled for the (L+1) horizon.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime with a mean of approximately 125 units per period over the last 16 periods (P26-P41). Current on-hand inventory is 131 units. However, the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation is severely corrupted by 1,264 units from five historically lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19), plus more recent orders (P40, P41) and the P37 order which is still in-transit. Total 'In-transit' as seen by the backend is 2,472 units. To force any order through the backend's (base_stock - pipeline) logic, mu_hat must be set to a value significantly greater than the phantom pipeline. I will continue to use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, targeting a value that compensates for the 2,472 in-transit units while aiming for a safety stock that handles a lead time of 2-3 periods. Setting mu_hat to 3,000 ensures that the backend places an order to replenish actual on-hand stock despite the phantom inventory. I will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to reflect the steady demand volatility observed in the current regime (std around 25).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state with a significant 'phantom' pipeline due to lost shipments in Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19, totaling 1,264 units. These units will never arrive but are included in the backend's pipeline inventory calculation, which prevents the OR engine from placing necessary orders. Period 42 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and unfulfilled demand. Recent demand (P26-P42) is stable in a regime of approximately 124 units per period. To maintain on-hand stock and overcome the 1,264-unit phantom pipeline plus current legitimate in-transit stock, I must use absolute inflation of mu_hat. The target is to force the OR backend to see a 'required' inventory level that exceeds the phantom pipeline (1,264) + current in-transit (2,912) + desired safety stock. I will use 'explicit' values to bypass the internal logic that is currently paralyzed by the lost units. I set L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to a high value to ensure a substantial order is triggered this period, and sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Phantom pipeline remains at 1,264 units. The backend's perceived in-transit (2,912) now includes several recent large orders intended to bypass the pipeline block. On-hand is 0, requiring continued mu_hat inflation to ensure flow.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 125 units/period (average since P26). However, the system is fundamentally broken by a 'phantom pipeline' of 1,264 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) that are confirmed lost but are still counted by the OR backend as 'In-transit'. As of P44, the perceived pipeline has grown to 4,193 units due to recent aggressive ordering to bypass this block. With 145 units on-hand and 100-150 units of demand per period, we must continue to force the 'mu_hat' parameter to a very high value. This prevents the backend's subtraction (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) from resulting in zero or negative values, which would stop all new orders. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 5,500 to ensure the backend continues to place orders despite the massive perceived inventory. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual arrival performance (range 1-3 periods).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 125 units per period (the average for P26-P44). However, a significant 'phantom pipeline' of 1,264 lost units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) persists in the backend calculation, as these units were never recorded as 'arrived' or 'lost' by the engine. As of the start of Period 45, the backend perceives a total pipeline of 5,036 units (which includes the phantom units plus recent large orders P42-P44 totaling 3,164 units). To ensure the OR engine actually places an order despite this massive perceived surplus, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat to a value exceeding the perceived pipeline plus the desired base stock. With the goal of maintaining service levels for a demand of ~125 and a lead time of ~2-3 periods, I am setting mu_hat to 6,000 units to bypass the backend's inventory check and pull in stock to cover actual demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1689.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory has increased significantly to 2,193 units following the arrival of P42 and P43 orders (totaling 1,974 units arriving in P45). This large arrival occurred because I previously used 'explicit' mu_hat inflation to bypass the 'phantom pipeline' of 1,264 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) that the backend incorrectly perceives as in-transit. The current demand regime is stable at approximately 125 units/period (mean of last 20 samples is ~125.7). However, the backend currently perceives a pipeline inventory of 3,711 units. When combined with the 2,193 on-hand, the backend sees 5,904 units available, which is far beyond any reasonable base stock for a lead time of 2 and demand of 125. Since the game is ending in Period 50, and current on-hand inventory (2,193) covers over 17 periods of demand at the current rate, additional orders are unnecessary and would only increase holding costs. Therefore, I am returning the parameters to 'default' or neutral settings. The backend's perceived inventory will prevent any new orders from being placed, allowing the excess stock to satisfy remaining demand through Period 50.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: On-hand inventory (2193) now exceeds total remaining game demand, following large-scale arrivals triggered by previous mu_hat inflation. No further ordering is required to finish the game.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47, there are 4 periods remaining in the game (47, 48, 49, 50). Current on-hand inventory is 2051 units. Given that the recent demand regime (since Period 26) is stable at approximately 125 units per period, the total expected demand for the remainder of the game is approximately 500 units (125 units/period * 4 periods). Since the on-hand inventory of 2051 units significantly exceeds this projected total demand, no further ordering is necessary. Further orders would only increase holding costs and reduce total reward without increasing sales. We set all parameters to default and allow the inventory to wind down naturally.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1466.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the game (Period 48 of 50). The current on-hand inventory is 1,934 units. Given that the demand regime has stabilized at approximately 125 units per period starting from Period 26, the total expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, and 50) is roughly 375 units. Since 1,934 units vastly exceeds this requirement (a safety cushion of over 1,500 units), no further orders are necessary. The priority now is to minimize holding costs for the remaining turns by ensuring the OR backend produces an order of zero. We achieve this by setting L to 'default' and using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with the smallest possible N (3) to reflect the current stable demand while letting the massive on-hand and pipeline inventory (totaling 5,645 units perceived by the backend) naturally suppress any new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1369.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 1821 units, which significantly exceeds the maximum possible demand for the remaining two periods (P49 and P50), given that the average demand since the P26 softening is approximately 125 units per period. The backend perceives a massive in-transit pipeline of 3711 units, but this is irrelevant because our goal is to minimize holding costs while ensuring we don't stock out. Since our on-hand stock is more than enough to cover all remaining demand, we set parameters to prevent any further ordering. Setting L to the promised 2 periods and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 0 effectively ensures the base stock calculation remains below the on-hand inventory level, resulting in zero units ordered.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision period of the simulation. The current on-hand inventory is 1,688 units. Historical demand has stabilized at approximately 125 units per period. Since there are no more periods left in the game after this decision, the current inventory is more than sufficient to cover any remaining demand resolution. Any additional ordering would only increase potential holding costs (although this is the final turn, it's best practice to maintain the zero-order strategy established in Period 46). There is no need to adjust parameters for future periods as the game is concluding.
