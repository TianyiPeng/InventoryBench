Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical demand or lead time data beyond the provided samples. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) show significant variance, with a mean of 115.4 and standard deviation of approx 35. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we are starting cold, I will use a conservative approach. My goal is to set parameters that cover the review period plus lead time (1 + L = 3 periods). Using 'default' methods will allow the backend to use all provided samples. Given Period 5 dropped to 59, there might be a downward trend, but with only 5 points, it's too early to confirm a regime shift. I will stick to 'default' to capture the full sample variance until more observations arrive.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 176 units based on some initial logic, but as expected with a promised lead time of 2, nothing arrived (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude). We lost 88 units of demand because on-hand was 0. The current in-transit is 176. The historical demand samples provided are: P1: 146 (likely the total potential demand, though 'conclude' says 88, I will use the history provided in the prompt), P2: 110, P3: 112, P4: 150, P5: 59. However, looking at the 'GAME HISTORY' section, Period 1 demand was actually 88. Since I only have one period of actual game history, I will use a conservative estimate. The mean of the provided samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) is 115.4. With L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+2)=3 periods. 115.4 * 3 = 346.2. I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the backend to use all available historical samples provided in the prompt (n=5) to establish a baseline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Observations from Period 1 and 2 show a total demand of 167 units, but 0 sales because on-hand inventory remains at 0. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (176 units) is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3. This arrival will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message, which I will read at the start of Period 4. Currently, 333 units are in-transit (176 from P1 + 157 from P2). The mean demand over the first 5 samples provided in the prompt is 113.4, though the actual recorded demand in P1 and P2 was slightly lower (88 and 79). Given the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we aim to meet the median demand. I will use the 'default' lead time (2) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the initial variability while allowing the OR engine to use the provided historical samples.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 order (176 units) was placed with a promised lead time of 2. Based on the sequence, it should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed/lost. The demand for the first three periods was 88, 79, and 121 (mean ~96). Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 333 (176 from P1 + 157 from P2). Since P1 has not arrived yet, I will explicitly set L to 3 to account for the observed delay. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), the samples provided in the prompt (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) differ from the 'Game History' demand (88, 79, 121); I will prioritize the Game History as it reflects the current state. Mean demand is ~96. With L=3, the review+lead period is 4. mu_hat = 4 * 96 = 384. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the backend covers the safety stock needed for the lead time extension.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed to be at least 3 periods (Period 1 order of 176 units not arrived by end of Period 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we finally see the arrival of the Period 1 order (176 units) with an actual lead time of 3 periods, confirming that the lead time is longer than the promised 2 periods. On-hand inventory is now 73. The demand over the first 4 periods was 88, 79, 121, 103 (Mean: 97.75). Period 5 demand is 59 (Wait, the data provided shows Period 1-5 as 146, 110, 112, 150, 59, but the Game History 'conclude' messages show demand realizations of 88, 79, 121, 103 for P1-P4). I will prioritize the 'Game History' demand: 88, 79, 121, 103. Current Lead Time (L) is confirmed at 3. To prevent stockouts given L=3, the target base stock needs to cover L+1 = 4 periods of demand. mu_hat should reflect (1+L) * mean. Using explicit L=3 and recent_N=4 for demand to capture the realized volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 4). Realized historical demand mean is approx 98 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (On-hand: 0) due to a lead time extension. The promised lead time is 2, but Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 3). Period 2's order (157 units) was placed in Period 2 and, at a lead time of 3, should have arrived in Period 5 (concluded), but it did not. This suggests either a lead time of 4+ periods or a lost shipment. However, following the sequence, Period 2's order is currently 1 period overdue relative to the observed 3-period lead time. Historical demand over 5 periods is [88, 79, 121, 103, 111], averaging 100.4 units/period. The provided samples [146, 110, 112, 150, 59] seem to be a different data set or 'seed' data; I will prioritize the actual game history (mean ~100) for forecasting. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the confirmed shift from the promised 2. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the stable demand around 100 and scale it for (1+L)=4 periods. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5).

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains volatile: P2 order (157 units) missing as of P6 (expected P5 if L=3), suggesting L may be 4+ or shipment lost.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 5 and no arrivals occurred in Period 6. The carry-over insights indicate significant lead time volatility. While Period 1 arrived with L=3, the order from Period 2 (157 units) has not arrived as of the end of Period 6, meaning its lead time is at least 4 periods or the shipment is lost. Given this uncertainty and the current stockout, I am explicitly setting L=4 to ensure the OR backend accounts for a longer replacement cycle. Demand remains relatively stable; the mean of the 6 available samples is ~105 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current demand distribution while acknowledging the stockouts in history might have masked some demand potential (though the environment provides actual demand samples). A (1+L) factor with L=4 will target a pipeline that covers 5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as at least 4 periods: Period 2 order (157 units) not arrived by end of Period 6 (expected P5 if L=3).

Daily Profit: $51.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with a significant portion of demand being lost due to stockouts. Analyzing lead times: Order P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), Order P4 arrived in P7 (L=3). Crucially, Order P2 (157 units) and Order P3 (no order) were followed by P5, P6, and P7 arrivals. Since P2 (ordered Period 2) has not arrived by the end of Period 7, it is 2 periods overdue based on an L=3 assumption and 5 periods since placement. This suggests Order P2 is likely lost. Excluding the lost order, the current pipeline consists of P5 (110 units), P6 (84 units), and P7 (125 units). Demand over the last 7 periods averages ~106 units/period (88, 79, 121, 103, 111, 130, 111). I will set L to 3 (the last observed successful lead time) and mu_hat to (1+3)*110 = 440 to ensure the base stock calculation targets enough inventory to cover the lead time plus the review period, accounting for recent demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Shipment from Period 2 (157 units) confirmed lost (not arrived by end of Period 7, 5 periods since order). Demand stable around 105-110 per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-33.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that demand has stabilized around a mean of 105 units. Most crucially, lead times are highly variable but showing a frequent value of 3 periods (P1 arrived in 3, P4 arrived in 3, P5 arrived in 3), while one shipment (P2) was lost and one (P7) arrived abnormally fast in 1 period. To protect against the stockouts observed in P5-P7, I am setting the lead time L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and using recent demand history. The mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the stable demand around 105-110. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. Since on-hand is 134 and in-transit is 241, and target base stock (L+1=4 periods) would be roughly 420-450, the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order to cover the pipeline gap caused by the lost P2 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is predominantly 3 periods (confirmed by P1, P4, and P5), despite variations. One shipment (P2) confirmed lost after 5 periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe an on-hand inventory of 78 units. Analyzing lead times: P1, P4, and P5 orders all arrived with lead_time=3. P7 arrived early (lead_time=1), while P2 is confirmed lost. P6 (84 units) has not arrived yet despite being 4 periods since the order, suggesting it may also be lost or seriously delayed. Currently, in-transit units are 311 (P6: 84, P9: 70, plus orders from P7/P8). The historical data (samples and game history) shows a mean demand of approximately 106 units per period. Since promised L=2 but actual experienced L is predominantly 3, I set L=3. I will use the last 5 samples (P5: 59, P6: 130, P7: 111, P8: 101, P9: 56) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they capture the recent variability and help recalibrate after the low demand in P9.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are at stockout (ending on-hand in P10 was 0) after a high demand spike of 156 in Period 10. Lead time history shows high volatility: P1, P4, and P5 arrived with L=3. P7 arrived with L=1. P2 was lost. The current in-transit (330 units) consists of orders from P6 (84), P9 (70), P10 (19) \u2014 total 173 \u2014 suggesting there may be a calculation discrepancy or a hidden backlog from P6. Given lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3, I will set L to an explicit 3 to be conservative regarding the replenishment cycle. Demand has shifted recently; while the long-term mean is lower, the last 4 periods average 106 units (101, 56, 156, and P11 prior sample 59). I'll use recent_N (N=4) to capture this volatility. mu_hat needs to cover (1+L) periods, so the OR backend will calculate 4 * recent_mean. Recent standard deviation is high due to the P10 spike, which justifies a higher sigma_hat to maintain service levels in the face of lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is confirmed highly volatile (range 1-3 periods, one lost shipment at P2). Demand regime remains variable with a high spike of 156 at Period 10.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are currently facing zero on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 11. Analysis of lead times (L) shows high volatility: observed L values for successful arrivals are 3, 3, 3, and 1, while the Period 2 order was confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' quantity of 424 consists of orders from Periods 6, 9, 10, and 11. The Period 6 order (84 units) is now 6 periods old, which strongly suggests it is lost, as the maximum successful L recorded is 3. I will set L=3 as a conservative planning horizon for the OR backend. Demand has been variable, averaging approximately 106 units over the last 11 periods, with a recent spike of 156 in Period 10. Given the high stockout risk and lead time uncertainty, I will use a 5-period average (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility and demand levels while accounting for the (L+1) planning window.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Shipment from Period 6 (84 units) likely lost (6 periods elapsed, max successful lead time is 3). Total pipeline inventory effectively reduced by 84 units for planning purposes.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received orders from Period 9 (LT=3) and Period 10 (LT=2). Examining the pipeline (In-transit=338 units), we have orders from Period 6 (84 units), Period 11 (94 units), and Period 12 (3 units) plus the 157 units from Period 2. As previously noted, the Period 2 (157 units) and Period 6 (84 units) shipments are almost certainly lost, having exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a significant margin. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 97 units (94 from P11, 3 from P12). Current on-hand is 0. Demand remains volatile but centered around 100-110 units. Given the frequent stockouts and the loss of significant pipeline volume, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the median observed delay and use the recent 5 samples for mu_hat (which includes the high of 156 and more moderate recent values) to ensure the base stock calculation properly accounts for the need to replenish the depleted inventory buffer.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 6 (84 units) is confirmed lost as of Period 13 (7 periods elapsed, max successful LT is 3). Effective pipeline inventory is only 97 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we face another stockout (On-hand: 0). History analysis confirms significant lead-time volatility and shipment loss. Confirmed lead times are: P1 (3), P4 (3), P5 (3), P7 (1), P9 (3), P10 (2). Shipments from P2 and P6 are confirmed lost (7+ periods elapsed). Currently, 'In-transit' shows 420 units, but subtract the lost P6 order (84 units), leaving an effective pipeline of 336 units (P11=94, P12=3, P13=82, plus the new P14 order). The mean lead time of successful deliveries is (3+3+3+1+3+2)/6 = 2.5 periods. Demand remains relatively stable around a mean of 110 units (recent samples since P8: 101, 56, 156, 109, 103, 92; average 102.8). I will set L to 3 to account for the most frequent lead time and use recent demand data (N=6) to capture the current volatility (especially the P10 spike) for safety stock calculation. The goal is to recover from the stockout while accounting for the high probability of delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Correction: Period 6 shipment (84 units) confirmed lost; subtract from 'In-transit' for all logic. Average successful lead time is 2.5 periods (Range 1-3). Demand mean stable at ~103 (last 6 periods).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 context: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is reported at 326 units. However, based on Carry-Over Insights, the shipment from Period 6 (84 units) is confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 242 units (326 total - 84 lost). The confirmed arrivals follow a Lead Time (L) pattern of 1-3 periods (Average ~2.5). I will set L=3 to be conservative given the history of stockouts and zero on-hand inventory. Demand over the last 7 periods (P8-P14) has a mean of 102. Demand since Period 1 has a mean of 103, showing stability. I will use the recent_N (N=7) method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility (which includes the P10 spike) while adjusting for the effective lead time. This approach ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for the (L+1) risk window and compensates for the lost shipment which the OR backend would otherwise count as incoming stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Pipeline Correction confirmed. Current effective pipeline is 242 units (excludes 84 units from P6). Demand mean since P8 is stable at 102.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face an critical stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' quantity of 405 units contains a confirmed lost shipment of 84 units from Period 6, making the true effective pipeline 321 units (P13: 82, P15: 82, plus others from P11/P12/P14 periods). Historical lead times for successful deliveries are 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3 periods. This averages roughly 2.45 periods. I will use L=3 to remain conservative against stockouts given the recent history of lost orders. Demand has been relatively stable since Period 8, with a mean of ~106 units per period (samples: 101, 56, 156, 109, 103, 92, 97, 128). I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this current regime (avg ~105). Setting L to 3 and mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (average ~105 * (3+1) = 420) will signal the OR backend to restore the inventory position above the current effective pipeline of 321.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline clarification: Total In-transit (405) includes 84 units from Period 6 confirmed lost; effective pipeline is 321 units. Successful lead times average 2.5 periods (observed range 1-3). Demand regime P8-P15 mean is 105.3 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has spiked significantly (Period 16 demand was 263, compared to the previous stable average of ~105). This suggests a potential demand regime shift or a extreme outlier that needs to be buffered. The 'In-transit' count is 339 units, but based on historical tracking, 84 units from Period 6 are confirmed lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is 255 units (339 - 84). History shows successful lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.5 periods. I will set L to 3 (explicitly choosing the upper bound of successful lead times to ensure coverage) and use recent_N for mu_hat (N=9, covering Period 8 to Period 16) to capture the recent mean and the high spike in Period 16, which will raise the base stock level to protect against continued high demand and lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 16 (263 units), representing a 150% increase over the previous 8-period mean (105.3). Monitoring if this is a sustained regime shift or a one-time outlier. Effective pipeline confirmed as 255 (In-transit 339 - 84 lost from P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand was 223, following 263 in Period 16. This confirms a significant demand regime shift (average ~243 over last 2 periods), possibly due to a seasonal event or promotion, as the previous mean (P8-P15) was ~105. On-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 476, but 84 units (ordered P6) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 392 units. Observed lead times recently range from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.5). I will set L=3 to be conservative. To respond to the high demand spike without overreacting to potential outliers, I'll use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent trend including the demand shift. Sigma_hat is set to explicit (100) to account for the heightened volatility during this high-demand period and to ensure a high service level while minimizing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed at Period 17: Mean demand for P16-P17 is 243, more than double the P8-P15 mean of 105. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 263, 223, and 245, yielding an average of 243.6 units per period. This is a significant shift from the previous average of ~105. Regarding lead time, the observed range is 1-3 periods. Although the promised lead time is 2, the historical average for successful deliveries is approximately 2.5 periods. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 763 includes 84 units from Period 6 which are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 679 (763 - 84). We will set L to 3 to account for the upper end of the volatile lead time. We set mu_hat using the explicit method to (1+L) * mean_demand = 4 * 243.6 \u2248 974. We use explicit sigma_hat based on the recent volatility (std dev of {263, 223, 245} is approx 20, so sqrt(1+3)*20 = 40). These parameters will signal the OR backend to order more units to match the new demand level while accounting for the lost shipment and lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: P16-P18 mean is 243.7 (previously 105.3). Successful lead times average 2.5 periods (Range 1-3). P6 shipment (84 units) confirmed lost; effective pipeline is (In-transit - 84).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, we are in a sustained high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is 237.25 (263, 223, 245, 218). The previous mean (P8-P15) was ~105. Actual lead times range from 1 to 3 periods, averaging 2.5 periods (I will use L=3 to be conservative). Currently, On-hand is 0. The Pipeline Inventory (In-transit) is 975 units. However, we must reconcile this: total ordered from P14-P19 is 82 (P15) + 16 (P16) + 153 (P17) + 287 (P18) + 212 (P19) = 750. Adding the confirmed lost 84 units from P6 and the 141 units from P7-P13 that likely also failed (as they haven't arrived in 6+ periods), the 'In-transit' count in the system includes significant phantom inventory. Specifically, the pending orders that should logically arrive are: P15 (82), P17 (153), P18 (287), and P19 (212). The order from P16 (16 units) already arrived in P17. I will set L=3, mu_hat = 4 * 237.25 = 949, and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the recent spike's volatility (~20 per period, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=2). Standard stock logic will attempt to order up to this base stock level. Because the pipeline of 975 is likely inflated by lost shipments, the OR engine might under-order; however, with L and mu_hat both elevated, it should continue to flow orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P16-P19 mean confirmed at 237.25 units. System 'In-transit' (975) is significantly inflated by lost shipments (P2, P6, and likely several between P7-P13), making the effective pipeline closer to 734 units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 239.2 units, a significant shift from the earlier mean of ~105. On-hand inventory is 0, and the system reports an In-transit pipeline of 975 units. However, history confirms that shipments from Period 2 (157 units) and Period 6 (84 units) were lost. Furthermore, orders from P17 (153 units), P18 (287 units), and P19 (212 units) are still outstanding. If we assume a maximum observed lead time of 3 periods, the P17 order is now 'overdue' (P21 start), but given the high volatility (L=1 to 3), we treat the pipeline carefully. The effective pipeline (excluding confirmed lost units P2 and P6) is 734 units. I will set L to 3 (observed max) and mu_hat to 957 (4 periods * 239.25) to satisfy the current high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to 36 to account for the volatility in this high-demand stage.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed: P16-P20 mean demand is 239.2 units. Effective pipeline is 734 units after subtracting confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (157) and Period 6 (84) from the reported In-transit value of 975.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is approximately 253.3 units (263, 223, 245, 218, 247, 324), a sharp increase from the previous average of ~105. Period 21 alone reached 324 units. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this sustained high-demand regime. Lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.5 periods for successful deliveries. However, a major issue persists with 'In-transit' inventory: 975 units are reported, but history confirms that orders from Period 2 (157 units) and Period 6 (84 units) are lost. Furthermore, orders from P17 (153), P18 (287), and P19 (212) totaling 652 units have not arrived yet. Since P17 was 5 periods ago and the maximum observed lead time is 3, P17 and likely P18 shipments are also lost. This leaves the 'effective' pipeline much lower than the reported 975. By setting L to 'explicit' at 3 and keeping mu_hat/sigma_hat focused on the recent high-demand window, I aim to force the OR backend to recalculate a higher base stock to compensate for the lost pipeline and meet the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-21 mean demand is 253.3 units (+140% vs P8-P15). Pipeline integrity compromised: Orders from P2, P6, and P17 are confirmed/highly likely lost; reported In-transit of 975 includes at least 394 units that will never arrive.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began at Period 16 (P16-P22 mean: 251.3 units). The reported 'In-transit' of 1014 units is significantly inflated by lost shipments: P2 (157 units), P6 (84 units), and likely P17 (153 units) which is now at L=5 with no arrival (max successful L is 3). The effective pipeline is approximately 620 units (1014 - 157 - 84 - 153). Lead times remain volatile, ranging between 1-3 periods, with an average of 2.5. To capture the current specific regime and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the inflated (zombie) pipeline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (P16-P22). I am setting L to 3 to provide 4 periods of demand coverage (L+1), ensuring sufficient safety stock for the high-demand environment and accounting for the unreliable delivery schedule.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand regime P16-P22 mean is 251.3 units (+140% shift). Pipeline integrity further degraded: P17 shipment (153 units) is highly likely lost (L=5 surpassed). Effective pipeline is (In-transit - 394 units).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 24. Since Period 16, demand has shifted significantly to a new high-demand regime, with the mean demand for Periods 16-23 being approximately 251.1 units per period. Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with several shipments confirmed or highly likely lost (P2, P6, P17). The reported 'In-transit' of 975 units is significantly inflated by these losses; specifically, we subtract 157 (P2), 84 (P6), and 153 (P17) to arrive at an effective pipeline of 581 units. However, given that on-hand inventory has been 0 for almost the entire high-demand period and the current on-hand is 0, the goal is to increase the base stock level to capture the lost sales. I am setting L=3 to account for the upper end of the volatile lead time. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*251.1 = 1004.4 and sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of demand from the last 8 periods (~30 units) scaled by sqrt(1+L), yields 60. I use 'explicit' to ensure the OR backend utilizes these specific regime-adjusted values to overcome the pipeline noise and the extreme stockout situation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P16-P23 mean confirmed at 251.1 units. Effective pipeline integrity continues to degrade: P17 shipment (153 units) is now fully confirmed lost (L=7 elapsed). Total confirmed/highly likely losses in pipeline: 394 units (P2: 157, P6: 84, P17: 153).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a high mean of approximately 250 units (P16-P24 mean: 250.4 units), representing a 140% increase from the previous baseline. Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a high incidence of lost shipments. The reported 'In-transit' of 1005 units is significantly overstated due to confirmed lost shipments: Period 2 (157), Period 6 (84), and now Period 17 (153) are all confirmed lost (surpassing max observed lead time of 3 significant by several periods). Total confirmed losses equal 394 units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 611 units (1005 - 394). Using L=3 (most frequent realistic lead time) and recent_N=9 for mu_hat (to capture the sustained high-demand regime since P16), the OR engine will target a base stock sufficient for (3+1) periods of high demand. Stockouts have been persistent due to the pipeline integrity issues and the sudden demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high-demand regime (P16-P24) mean: 250.4 units. Total confirmed pipeline loss: 394 units (P2: 157, P6: 84, P17: 153). Effective pipeline is (In-transit - 394).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16, with the mean demand for Periods 16-25 being 250.9 units, a +140% increase from the previous baseline. Lead times remain highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a confirmed breakdown in pipeline integrity. Specifically, shipments from Period 2 (157), Period 6 (84), and Period 17 (153) are lost (totaling 394 units), making the effective pipeline approximately 611 units (1005 - 394). The current on-hand inventory is 0. To compensate for the inflated pipeline and satisfy the new high-demand regime, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set based on the last 10 periods (N=10), capturing the regime shift. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time. Using an explicit mu_hat with the 10-period mean (250.9) * (1+L=3.5) = 878 would be cautious, but let the backend use recent_N to dynamically weight the current high-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P16-P25) mean confirmed at 250.9 units. Pipeline integrity remains compromised: shipments from P2, P6, and P17 (total 394 units) are confirmed lost. Effective pipeline is reported In-transit minus 394.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we observe a significant drop in demand to 119 units in Period 26, compared to the mean of 250.9 units established since Period 16. While this might be a single-period fluctuation, it necessitates caution. The reported 'In-transit' of 1005 units is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments: P2 (157), P6 (84), and P17 (153), totaling 394 lost units. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 611 units (1005 - 394). There have been no arrivals from the large orders placed in P18 (287) and P19 (212), which are now at lead times of 9 and 8 periods respectively, far exceeding the typical range of 1-3 periods. This suggests a systemic breakdown in the supply chain or additional lost shipments. Given we have 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 611 (which is essentially pending historical orders that are extremely late), I will set mu_hat based on the high-demand regime (N=11, covering P16-P26) to ensure the target base stock reflects recent reality, while keeping sigma_hat high to account for the extreme lead-time volatility and demand uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop in Period 26 (119 vs 250 avg). Supply chain suspected systemic failure: P18 (287 units) and P19 (212 units) have not arrived after 8+ periods, well beyond the 3-period max lead-time previously observed.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a systemic collapse. Promised lead time is 2 periods, but history shows massive volatility and widespread losses. Specifically, orders from P2 (157), P6 (84), P17 (153), P18 (287), and P19 (212) are now confirmed or highly likely lost (L > 8 periods). The 'In-transit' count of 1005 is heavily inflated by these 893 units which will never arrive. The effective pipeline inventory is approximately 112 units (1005 - 893). Demand has also shifted again: after a high-demand regime (P16-P25 mean ~250), the last two periods (P26-P27) saw a sharp drop to a mean of 127. I am forecasting based on this more recent, lower demand level to avoid excessive holding costs if the trend continues, while setting L=3 to account for the typical upper bound of successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: Orders from P18 (287 units) and P19 (212 units) confirmed lost (L=9+ elapsed). Total confirmed losses (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) equal 893 units. Demand mean shifted down to ~127 (P26-P27) from previous ~250.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a systemic failure with extreme lead time volatility and high shipment loss rates. Confirmed lost shipments include Period 2 (157), Period 6 (84), Period 17 (153), Period 18 (287), and Period 19 (212), totaling 893 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 1005 units contains only 112 'live' units (1005 - 893), which is insufficient for current demand. Demand has also shifted from a high-regime (~250 units/period, P16-P25) to a lower regime (~121 units/period) over the last three periods (P26-P28). I will set L to 4 to account for the increased lead time uncertainty and potential delays. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a forecast of 127 units per period (the mean of P26-P28) multiplied by (1+L), totaling 635. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the volatility of this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure confirmed: Ships from P18 and P19 (total 499 units) confirmed lost after 9+ periods. Cumulative confirmed lost pipeline: 893 units. Demand regime shifted down to ~121 units/period since Period 26.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has sustained a significant drop starting at Period 26, shifting from a mean of ~251 (P16-P25) to approximately 109 units per period (P26-P29: 119, 135, 110, 128). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new lower regime. For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N=4 to reflect the current variability. Regarding lead time, the supply chain is experiencing systemic failure. Total In-transit is reported at 1005 units, but history shows 893 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). The effective pipeline is only 112 units (1005 - 893). Since the OR backend uses the full 'In-transit' value and cannot adjust for losses, I must artificially increase L to account for the 'inflated' pipeline. By setting L to 4 using the 'explicit' method, the base stock calculation (which involves (1+L)) will increase enough to trigger an order despite the phantom inventory in the backend's calculation. This compensates for the lost 893 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed at Period 26: mean dropped from ~251 to ~123 (P26-P29). Cumulative confirmed pipeline losses total 893 units (P2: 157, P6: 84, P17: 153, P18: 287, P19: 212).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P26-P30) has stabilized at a lower mean of 127.2 units/period following a significant peak. Supply chain reliability remains a major concern: orders from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 893 units) are confirmed lost based on the established maximum successful lead time of 3 periods. The current system reported 'In-transit' of 1005 units contains these 893 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 112 units (1005 - 893). To ensure service levels for the next (L+1) periods (approx 3-4 periods) under a 50% service level target (Profit $1 = Holding $1), the OR engine needs to target a base stock around (L+1) * 127.2. However, the OR engine is unaware of the losses and assumes the full 1005 units are coming. We must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite the 1005 units 'in-transit', or set L explicitly. Given the high stockout risk and the 'In-transit' accounting error, I am using an explicit mu_hat to ensure a replenishment order is generated to cover current demand and replenish safety stock, while setting L to 3 to reflect the typical successful lead time.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand downshift confirmed at Period 26: mean dropped from ~251 to 127.2 (P26-P30). Cumulative confirmed pipeline losses total 893 units (P2: 157, P6: 84, P17: 153, P18: 287, P19: 212).

The supply chain has experienced systemic failure: orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 are confirmed lost, totaling 893 units. Given the 'In-transit' report of 1100 units, the effective pipeline (excluding confirmed losses) is 207 units (orders from P22, P24, and P31). Successful lead times consistently range between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.5 periods. I will set L to 2.5 (explicit) to reflect this, and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand level while the backend accounts for the inflated pipeline by leveraging my explicit L and mu_hat settings.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level (P26-P31 mean: 119) following systemic supply chain losses. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline: 893 (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at a lower mean of 120.1 units (P26-P32). The supply chain remains systemically unstable: out of the reported 'In-transit' quantity of 1005 units, 893 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). This leaves an effective pipeline of 112 units (1005 - 893). Although the promised lead time is 2, recent successful arrivals (P16, P22, P31) showed a lead time of 1, but historically it ranges up to 3. I will use L=2 and recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current demand downshift. I will use 'explicit' for L to maintain a conservative coverage window given the frequent stockouts and lost shipments.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 26, stabilizing at a mean of approximately 120 units (P26-P33 mean = 118). Pipeline integrity remains the primary concern: of the 1005 units reported as 'In-transit', 893 units (from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost based on having exceeded the maximum observed successful lead time (3 periods) by a significant margin. The effective pipeline is therefore 112 units (1005 - 893). Lead times for successful deliveries range from 1 to 3 periods, with recent orders arriving in 1 period (P31 order arrived P32). I will set L to 3 (recent conservative maximum) and use a recent_N of 8 for demand (P26-P33) to align with the current lower demand level while the system attempts to recover from successive stockouts caused by the systemic supply chain failure.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 35. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime starting at Period 26, with a mean demand of approximately 116 units (P26-P34). The system shows a systemic supply chain failure with multiple historical orders confirmed lost: P2(157), P6(84), P17(153), P18(287), and P19(212), totaling 893 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 1005 units consists mostly of these lost units; the actual evidence-based pipeline is likely only 112 units (1005 - 893). Lead times for successful deliveries continue to range from 1 to 3 periods (Average 2.5). I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat based on the recent stable demand of ~116 per period over a 3-period lead time, and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility in this period. I set L to 2.5 to reflect the observed successful average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P26-P34) mean confirmed at 115.8 units/period. Persistent supply chain failure: Cumulative confirmed pipeline losses total 893 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Reported In-transit is significantly inflated.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean since Period 26. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P26-P35), the average demand is approximately 117.3 units per period. The supply chain has experienced significant systemic failure with a massive number of lost shipments. Confirmed/highly likely lost units in the pipeline include P2 (157), P6 (84), P17 (153), P18 (287), and P19 (212), totaling 893 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 1005 units is therefore misleading; the functional pipeline is only 112 units (1005 - 893). Lead times have been volatile (1-3 periods for successful arrivals). To stabilize the stock amidst these losses and the lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current mean of ~117. The OR backend uses (1+L) * mu, and with L=2, this creates a base stock target that accounts for the current period plus lead time. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. The L parameter is kept at 'default' (2) as recent successful arrivals (P31) show the system can still deliver within 1-3 periods, although reliability is poor.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic supply chain failure: Cumulative lost shipments total 893 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Functional pipeline is (In-transit - 893). Demand regime since P26 is stable at mean ~117 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 26, averaging approximately 117 units per period (P26-P36 range: 79-144). There is a significant discrepancy in the 'In-transit' count (1005 units) due to systemic supply chain failures where orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 893 units) are confirmed lost. The effective pipeline inventory is therefore approx 112 units (1005 - 893). Although the promised lead time is 2, most successful deliveries recently have had lead times of 1 or 3 periods; I will continue using L=3 to ensure the inventory position (IP) covers the longer end of the delivery cycle. Setting mu_hat to cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand at the current average (117 * 4 = 468). Sigma_hat is calculated manually based on recent volatility in this regime (approx 20 units/period * sqrt(4)).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean since Period 26. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 37 is approximately 123.5 units per period. The supply chain has experienced significant systemic failure with a high volume of lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (157), P6 (84), P17 (153), P18 (287), and P19 (212) are confirmed lost, totaling 893 units. Additionally, recent orders from P24 and later have not arrived, suggesting the system is still unreliable. The current 'In-transit' of 1005 units includes these 893 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 112 units (1005 - 893). To compensate for the inflated pipeline and ensure the OR backend places an order to meet the current demand regime (mu_hat ~ 124, (1+L)mu_hat ~ 372), I will use 'explicit' parameters. I set L to the promised 2, and mu_hat to a value that reflects the current mean (approx 124) plus an adjustment to account for the ~893 'ghost' units in the pipeline that the OR engine incorrectly thinks are coming. However, given the capped policy and the backend's logic, providing a very high mu_hat or sigma_hat is the only way to trigger an order when 'pipeline' is high. I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 12-period regime (P26-P37) to maintain stability while the system hopefully clears the backlog.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P26-P37 mean is 123.5 units. Total confirmed pipeline losses (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) remain at 893 units; any inventory planning must subtract this from reported In-transit.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 122 units per period (P26-P38 mean = 122.7). The supply chain is severely compromised by systemic failures; cumulative confirmed lost shipments total 893 units (P2: 157, P6: 84, P17: 153, P18: 287, P19: 212). The reported 'In-transit' of 1005 units is heavily inflated. Subtracting the 893 lost units yields an effective functional pipeline of only 112 units. This functional pipeline (112 units) is slightly less than one period of demand. Given a Lead Time (L) average of 2.5 periods (observed range 1-3), we need to maintain a base stock covering approximately (L+1) = 3.5 periods of demand (~430 units). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 to capture the current stable regime and 'explicit' for L=3 to account for the volatility and potential delays. Sigma is set using 'recent_N' to reflect current variance.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, demand remains in the lower-level regime established at Period 26 (mean ~121 units). The supply chain remains systemically broken: shipments from P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 are confirmed lost (total 893 units). Subtracting these from the reported 'In-transit' of 1005 units leaves an effective pipeline of only 112 units. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the effective pipeline is insufficient to cover the demand across the review and lead-time period (approx (2.5+1) * 121 = 423 units), significant ordering is required. I set L to 3 to account for historical volatility (observed range 1-3). I use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stabilized demand regime since Period 26. The backend will calculate base stock using these parameters and subtract the (inflated) 1005 units in-transit, but since the mu_hat will be set high enough to cover the target stock level, this should trigger the necessary replenishment.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26, with a mean demand of approximately 123.4 units (P26-P40). On-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory of 1005 units is heavily distorted by systemic supply chain failures. Specifically, shipments from Period 2 (157), Period 6 (84), Period 17 (153), Period 18 (287), and Period 19 (212) are confirmed lost, totaling 893 units. Additionally, recent orders from P24 (30 units) and P15 (82 units) are now extremely overdue (L=16 and L=26 respectively) and must also be considered lost. This makes the functional pipeline inventory essentially zero (1005 - 893 - 30 - 82 = 0). I will set mu_hat to reflect the current 15-period demand mean (~123.4 units/period) across the review+lead time window (L+1). Given lead time remains volatile (Range 1-3), I will use L=3 to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers enough demand, effectively triggering an order to compensate for the failed pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Reported In-transit (1005) is entirely non-functional; confirmed lost units now total 1005 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Demand regime since P26 is stable at 123.4 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we are dealing with a systemic supply chain failure and a stabilized demand regime. The reported 'In-transit' of 1005 units is composed entirely of confirmed or highly probable lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). With on-hand inventory at 0 and the actual functional pipeline also at 0, new orders must be placed to satisfy current demand. Since Period 26, demand has stabilized at a lower level with a mean of 123.4 units (P26-P41). Lead times have been highly volatile (1-3 periods), but the OR backend needs a stable estimate. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat (N=16, covering the stable regime since P26) and sigma_hat (N=16) to capture this recent behavior. For L, I retain the default promised lead time of 2 as recent successful arrivals (like P31) show short L is possible, though reliability is poor. The OR backend will see 0 effective pipeline inventory because it will calculate 'base_stock - 1005', leading to a massive order; however, the 'cap' mechanism in the OR engine will limit this order to a safer amount, preventing over-ordering while trying to restart the flow.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure confirmed: In-transit of 1005 units is 100% lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Demand regime since Period 26 is stable at mean 123.4 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 123.4 units per period (P26-P42: 119, 135, 110, 128, 144, 79, 126, 103, 98, 131, 129, 144, 109, 107, 149, 124, 143). The current 'In-transit' of 1005 units consists entirely of historical orders that have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24), and are confirmed lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. With on-hand inventory also at 0, the OR backend must place a significant order to satisfy demand across the review and lead period (L+1). I keep L=3 to account for historical maximum successful lead times. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 17 periods (N=17, starting from the shift at P26), I ensure the order reflects the current lower demand regime and prevents over-ordering while trying to restore stock levels.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 43, the reported In-transit value of 1005 units is 100% lost shipments. Effective pipeline is zero. Total lost shipments list: P2(157), P6(84), P15(82), P17(153), P18(287), P19(212), P24(30). Total lost = 1005.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a total supply chain failure. The reported 'In-transit' of 1005 units consists entirely of lost shipments from Period 2 (157), P6 (84), P15 (82), P17 (153), P18 (287), P19 (212), and P24 (30). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26, with a mean of approximately 123.5 units (P26-P43). Because current on-hand and effective in-transit are both zero, I must set the OR parameters to trigger a large enough order to cover the (L+1) period demand window. I will use 'explicit' values to bypass the backend's reliance on the inflated 'In-transit' figure and the long-term historical average, focusing exclusively on the current 123.5 mean and accounting for the zeroed functional inventory.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a total supply chain collapse. As of Period 45, the reported In-transit inventory of 1005 units consists entirely of shipments that are confirmed or highly likely to be lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24). Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is also zero. Since Period 26, demand has stabilized at a lower regime with a mean of approximately 123.4 units and a standard deviation of about 19.8 units. To maximize profit while maintaining a high service level in this precarious environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 19 periods (P26-P44) to reflect this stabilized demand. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to account for the historical maximum successful lead time, ensuring the base stock calculation covers enough demand to buffer against the ongoing delivery reliability issues.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: Reported In-transit (1005 units) is 100% lost shipments. Effective pipeline is zero. All previous orders (up to P24) are confirmed lost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46, we are in a state of systemic supply chain failure. The reported 'In-transit' of 1005 units consists entirely of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24), and no orders have been placed or arrived since Period 32. Effective pipeline inventory is zero. Demand since Period 26 has stabilized in a lower regime compared to the Period 16-25 peak, with a mean of approximately 124 units (P26-P45 mean = 124.6). To resume operations and attempt to capture remaining demand in the final 5 periods of the game, we must place new orders. Given the history of lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods (excluding lost shipments) and the high probability of further losses, I am setting L explicitly to 3 to ensure the OR engine targets enough stock to cover the likely delay. mu_hat is set to 496 (approx 124 * (1+3)) using recent_N (N=20) to capture the stable demand regime since Period 26. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=20) to reflect the current volatility of this regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed as of Period 45: All reported In-transit units (1005) are documented losses from periods 2 through 24. Effective pipeline is zero. Stable demand regime (P26-P45) mean established at 124.6 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain exhibits a total collapse with systemic losses. The reported In-transit of 1005 units consists entirely of known lost shipments from Period 2 to Period 24 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). The inventory system is non-functional; arrivals have basically ceased since Period 32, which was the last recorded arrival. Demand has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 26, with a mean of 124.6 units per period. Since the game is ending at Period 50 and the effective pipeline (In-transit - 1005) is zero, I must restart ordering to satisfy the remaining 4 periods of demand. I use 'explicit' for L=2 to match the promised lead time and 'recent_N' with N=21 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture the post-spike stabilized demand regime (P26-P46).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 48, the supply chain remains in a state of collapse. The reported In-transit inventory of 1005 units consists entirely of orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 24, all of which are confirmed lost as their elapsed lead times far exceed the historical maximum successful lead time of 3 periods. Consequently, the functional pipeline is zero and on-hand inventory is zero. Since Period 26, demand has stabilized into a lower regime with a mean of approximately 124.2 units and a standard deviation of roughly 18.5. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50) and a confirmed lead time range of 1-3 periods, any order placed now is unlikely to arrive in time to be sold, or would arrive so late (P50 arrival resolution) that its utility is minimal compared to the risk of holding costs. Therefore, no new orders are placed to maximize the final reward by avoiding ending inventory costs in a broken supply chain scenario.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 47, supply chain remains non-functional. All 1005 units in reported 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Demand regime P26-P47 is stable at mean 124.2 units (std 18.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The supply chain has effectively collapsed as evidenced by the fact that all 1005 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from earlier periods (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 26, with a mean of approximately 124.2 units and a standard deviation of 18.5 (calculated over P26-P48). Although the promised lead time is 2, successful arrivals (albeit rare) have historically varied between 1 and 3 periods. Given that this is the penultimate period (P49 of 50), any order placed now must arrive in Period 50 to have any value. Therefore, the effective L for this decision must be treated as 1 (to arrive in P50). I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable P26-P48 regime to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the remaining demand, while accounting for the zero effective pipeline.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the environment continues to experience a systemic supply chain failure. The reported 'In-transit' of 1005 units consists entirely of orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 24, all of which are confirmed lost. The effective pipeline inventory is zero. Demand has been stable since Period 26, with a mean of approximately 124 units. Because the OR engine uses pipeline inventory to offset orders, and it does not know these units are lost, I must use 'explicit' parameters to force an order that bypasses the inflated in-transit value. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost inventory (since base_stock = mu_hat + safety_stock, and the engine calculates order = base_stock - in_transit). Target Base Stock = (1+2)*124 + 1.645*(sqrt(3)*19) \u2248 426 units. To ensure the engine orders despite 1005 units being in-transit, I set mu_hat = 426 + 1005 = 1431.
