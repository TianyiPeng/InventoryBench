Historical demand samples provided are 146, 110, 112, 150, and 59. Excluding the latest Period 5 (which seems like a significant outlier or partial period), the average demand is approximately 130 per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. This means an order placed now (P1) will arrive in Period 3's arrival phase and be available for sale in Period 3. Therefore, I need to cover demand for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 (L+1 = 3 periods). Total expected demand for 3 periods is approximately 390 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are both 0, I will order 390 units to establish a stock position that covers the lead time and provides a baseline buffer, despite the high holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4).",

The mean demand across the first 5 historical periods is 115.4 units. To maintain an adequate pipeline while accounting for the lead time (L=2) and the current period (L+1 = 3), I need approximately 345 units in total pipeline (3 * 115). Currently, there are 390 units in transit which covers the next 3.3 periods of average demand. Since 0 units arrived in Period 1 (consistent with L=2) and I am at the start of Period 2, the 390-unit order is still the only stock expected. To avoid over-ordering and incurring holding costs ($1/unit) while waiting for the initial large shipment to arrive, I will not place an additional order this period.

Based on the rules, it should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in Period 4's start. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'.

On-hand is currently 0, leading to stockouts. With P4 demand around 150 and P5 demand around 60, the expected demand over the lead-time window (P4, P5, P6) is roughly 150 + 60 + 100 = 310.

Pipeline analysis: The order from P14 (100 units) and P15 (100 units) are in transit. Based on the variable lead time history (1\u20133 periods), the P14 order is expected to arrive at Period 17 (lead time 3) and the P15 order at Period 18.

This implies there may be a backlog or the P16 order was triggered just before. Checking the history: P14=100, P15=100, P16=0. 100+100 = 200.

The 'In-transit' figure of 2730 units is highly inflated by historically lost shipments (P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33). The actual effective pipeline consists only of the Period 37 order (150 units) and the Period 40 order (120 units). However, the Period 37 order is now 4 periods old; based on our established logic that orders over 3-4 periods old during this supply chain's behavior are likely lost, P37 is now suspect. To maintain a service level covering (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods), we need roughly 345 units (115 * 3). On-hand is 99. If P37 arrives, we have 249. If P40 arrives, we have more.

Based on recent history (P38-P40), the actual lead time has been 1 period, although P41's arrival was not reflected in the P41 conclude message, implying it should arrive during P42. I expect P40's order to arrive during P42 (at the latest) and P41's order to arrive during P43. To cover demand for the next 3 periods (P42, P43, P44) with a safety margin (3 * 115 = 345 units), and accounting for the 240 units currently in the 'effective' pipeline, I need to order enough to reach a target inventory position of roughly 460 (4 periods of coverage). However, given the extreme volatility of the supply chain shown in 'Carry-over Insights', I must maintain a constant flow of orders. Calculating target: (Demand * (Lead_time + 1)) + Safety Stock.
