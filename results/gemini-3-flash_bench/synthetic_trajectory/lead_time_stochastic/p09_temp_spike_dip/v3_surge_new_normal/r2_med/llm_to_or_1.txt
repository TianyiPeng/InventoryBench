Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. With no historical data or cycle context yet, I will use the baseline samples provided (Periods 1-5 mean and standard deviation) to initialize the forecast. Historical demand samples: 146, 110, 112, 150, 59. Mean = 115.4, Std = 35.8. Since promised lead time is 2, the planning horizon is (L+1) = 3 periods. mu_hat = 3 * 115.4 = 346.2. sigma_hat = sqrt(3) * 35.8 = 62.0. Using 'explicit' to ensure the backend captures the provided baseline samples instead of starting from zero since this is Period 1.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 175 units with a promised lead time of 2. As expected according to the 'CRITICAL TIMING EXAMPLE', the Period 1 conclude message shows arrived=0 because an order placed in Period 1 with L=2 is only expected to arrive during Period 3 and become visible in Period 4's conclude message. Demand in Period 1 was 140, but since on-hand was 0, zero units were sold, resulting in lost sales. I will use the 'default' lead time (2) and calculate parameters based on the first observed demand sample. Since only one sample (140) is currently fully concluded in the history (matching the 'Period 1 conclude' message), I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 to capture the most recent demand level effectively for the backend calculation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Orders were placed in P1 (175 units) and P2 (197 units), making the 'In-transit' total 372. According to the timing rules, the P1 order (L=2) should arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in the START of P4. Currently, on-hand is 0, resulting in lost sales for P1 and P2. Demand has been 140 and 136 (avg ~138). P3 demand is pending. I will maintain the default lead time of 2. I'll use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=2 to capture the early stable demand trend (140, 136). The inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) is 372, and the backend base stock will be roughly (1+2)*138 = 414. This will trigger a small top-up order to ensure coverage for the next cycles.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0 for chips(Regular). This indicates a delay or that the actual lead time is longer than 2 periods. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and have recorded 0 sales due to the lack of stock, it's critical to ensure the pipeline is sufficient. Looking at historical demand (P1: 146, P2: 110, P3: 112), the average demand is approximately 123 units per period. I will maintain the lead time parameter at 'default' (2) for now to see if the P1 order arrives in the next conclusion, but I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the early baseline. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0), so the OR backend needs to maintain the pipeline inventory (currently 419 units, which includes orders from P1, P2, and P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Historical demand for the last four periods has been 140, 136, 92, and 58, showing a significant downward trend (mean ~106.5). On-hand inventory is 164 units (from Period 4's arrivals). Lead time observations from Period 4 conclude show high variability: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period. The promised lead time is 2. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 197 units (from Period 2). Because demand has dropped sharply in the last two periods (92 and 58), using a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will better capture this downward shift and prevent excessive holding costs. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variability (1 and 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $426.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, current on-hand inventory is 46 with 284 units in transit. Reviewing the history: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, and the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period, suggesting variable lead times around the promised L=2. The demand across the first 5 periods has been [140, 136, 92, 58, 118], with an average of 108.8. Period 4 showed a potential dip (58), but Period 5 rebounded to 118. Given the high volatility and lead time instability, I will use recent history (N=5) to estimate demand and set L=2 (default) as the backend calculates base stock using (1+L). The current lead time average (3+1)/2 = 2, which matches the promised lead time. I'll stick with recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high variance seen in the first 5 samples.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 6 where 60 units of demand were lost. Historical demand for the last 6 periods averages 108.3 units, but significantly dropped in Period 4 and spiked back up, with the last two periods averaging 112. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show high variance: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 order took 1 period, and the P2 order (197 units) is currently overdue (it should have arrived in P4 or P5). Including P2, total In-transit is 331 (P2: 197, P5: 87, P6: 47). Since the P2 order is significantly overdue and the SKU is stocked out, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the reliability issues observed. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the more recent demand stabilization (avg ~93.5), but maintain standard volatility tracking.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1 period, and P2 is overdue (>4 periods).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The current status shows on-hand inventory is 0, with 428 units in-transit. Historical demand analysis reveals a mean of approximately 110 units (Periods 1-7: 140, 136, 92, 58, 118, 106, 96). There is significant lead time instability: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P2 (ordered Period 2) is now 6 periods late, indicating it is likely lost. Orders from P5, P6, and P7 are still within reasonable windows but haven't arrived. Due to the high stockout risk (on-hand 0) and the lost shipment (P2), I am setting the lead time L to an explicit 3 to account for the observed maximum successful lead time, rather than the promised 2. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=4) to capture the demand stabilization around 95-100 units observed in the last 4 periods (58, 118, 106, 96), adjusted for the L+1 period window. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a sufficient safety buffer given the supply-side volatility.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (197 units) confirmed lost: 6 periods elapsed since order without arrival.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we received orders from P5 (L=3) and P7 (L=1). Order P2 (placed in P2) is officially missing/lost after 6 periods. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 246, which includes P6 (47 units, 2 periods ago) and P8 (2 units). Demand over the last 8 periods has averaged ~108.5 units. Specifically, recent demand (P5-P8) averages 110.5. Lead times are highly variable, with observed values of 3, 1, 3, and 1 (averaging 2). Since we just restocked in P8 and have 62 on-hand, we need to maintain a safety stock to handle the L=3 risk. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (N=4) and L=2 to stabilize the base stock calculation, allowing the OR backend to account for the pipeline.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have 374 units in transit (ordered in P6 and P9). Historical demand across 9 periods shows a mean of 108.7 units. Lead times have been highly volatile: P1=3, P3=1, P5=3, P7=1, P8=1, while P2 was lost and P6 is currently overdue (placed in P6, today is P10, so elapsed is 4 periods). This volatility (alternating between 1 and 3+ periods) suggests we should plan for a longer lead time to maintain service levels, especially since we are currently stock-out. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use recent_N for demand to capture the current regime more accurately (last 4 periods mean = 109.25). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the current pipeline of 374 units.

Carry-over insight: Lead time pattern remains unstable with alternating 1 and 3-period arrivals; P6 order is now officially overdue (4 periods elapsed).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product is out of stock (On-hand: 0). Demand across the last 10 periods has been relatively stable, averaging 107.2 units per period (Std Dev ~25). The lead time is highly erratic: observed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 1, and 1 periods. Specifically, orders from P1 (LT 3), P3 (LT 1), P5 (LT 3), P7 (LT 1), and P8 (LT 1) have concluded. However, orders from P2 and P6 (placed 9 and 5 periods ago respectively) are effectively lost, while P9 (130 units) is still in-transit but only at L+2. Given this unreliability, I will use 'explicit' lead time of 3 to account for the longest typical delay, and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 to capture the current stable consumption rate while acknowledging the stockouts are due to supply, not demand shifts. This creates a higher base stock to buffer against the demonstrated supply chain risk.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain unreliability confirmed: shipments from P2 and P6 (spanning 7+ periods) are lost; successfully arrived shipments alternate between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a conservative lead time assumption of 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unstable. We have confirmed multiple lost shipments (P2 and P6) and an alternating lead time pattern (1 or 3 periods). As of Period 12, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced back-to-back periods with zero sales due to stockouts. The demand has stabilized around a mean of 105 units after an initial high period. To calculate the OR parameters: I set L (Lead Time) to 3 (explicit) to account for the longest successful delivery cycle and the high risk of delay. For mu_hat, I use a sample of the last 7 periods (approx. 104.5 units per period) multiplied by (1+L), totaling roughly 418. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the standard deviation of this stable regime. This conservative approach aims to rebuild the pipeline and protect against the high risk of stockouts given the zero on-hand balance.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is relatively stable, with an average of approximately 104 units per period across the last 12 periods. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable. We have confirmed losses for orders placed in Period 2 and Period 6. Observed actual lead times for successful deliveries have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P5: 3, P7: 1, P8: 1, P9: 3). To protect against the 3-period lead time and frequent shipment losses, I will set L to 3 (explicit). This increases the coverage period (L+1) to 4 periods. With a mean demand of 104, mu_hat is set to 416 (4 * 104). Pipeline inventory currently contains 96 units (from P11, expected arrival P12-P14) and 244 units (from P13, though not yet placed in this sequence), though the 'In-transit' figure 340 suggests the backend tracks the P11 order (96) and a projected need. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full demand history while using an explicit L=3 to ensure the backend calculates a sufficient base stock for the unreliable lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (2 units) following a period of 55 units of demand. History shows a highly unstable lead-time environment: shipments alternate between 1 and 3 periods (P9 arrived in 3 periods at P12; P11, ordered 2 periods ago, has not arrived), while shipments from P2 and P6 were lost entirely. Therefore, L=3 is the safest estimate to cover the pipeline risk. Demand has softened recently: the last 3 periods averaged 76.6 units (93, 102, 73, 55), while the full history average is ~104. Given this downward trend, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture this shift without overreacting to the single low point of 55, and recent_N for volatility (sigma_hat) to reflect the recent demand variability. The backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers (3+1) periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $392.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 11-14) shows values of 102, 73, 55, and 98, demonstrating a slight downward shift or higher variance compared to the early-game average (~115-120). I will use a recent N of 10 to capture the current mean while smoothing out the volatility of the last few periods. Regarding Lead Time (L), the delivery history shows a consistent pattern of alternation between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1, P9:3, P11:3). Orders from P2 and P6 are confirmed lost. Given that the most recent shipments (P9 and P11) both took 3 periods, and there is high unreliability, I will use an explicit L of 3. This ensures the base stock calculation covers a logic-based (L+1) horizon of 4 periods, which is necessary to avoid stockouts given the current zero on-hand inventory condition.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face an on-hand inventory of 0 and a pipeline of 424 units. Historical data reveals a highly unstable supply chain with frequent lost shipments (Period 2, Period 6) and actual lead times alternating between 1 and 3 periods. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has shown a slight downward trend compared to the initial periods (avg ~81 vs ~110). Given the high loss rate and lead time volatility, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the maximum observed lead time, providing safety against the frequent 3-period arrivals and minimizing stockouts. For demand forecasting, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower mean, which avoids excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer against the high variability (std ~18 in recent periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed a massive demand spike (305 units), which is approximately triple the recent average. Given this SKU is 'chips(Regular)', this may signal a seasonal event or promotion. I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use EWMA with a high gamma (0.7) to rapidly adapt to this potential new regime while maintaining awareness of the recent history. Lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with several confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6). I will maintain an explicit lead time of 3 periods to cushion against this unreliability and ensure the target base stock covers the current spike. On-hand is 0, and we have 486 units in transit (including Period 15's 121 and Period 17's new order), which is necessary to recover from the stockout caused by the Period 16 demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected at Period 16: demand surged to 305 units (+200% over recent mean). Monitoring if this is a sustained trend or a one-time outlier.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe a significant demand surge for chips(Regular), with the last two periods showing demand of 305 and 322 units, compared to the previous average of ~100. This represents a confirmed demand regime shift. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 686 units in transit (comprising orders from P15: 121 and P17: 321, plus the likely lost order P6: 47 and P2: 197). Historical arrivals show a toggle between 1 and 3 periods; since P15 (121 units) has not arrived after 3 periods, we must assume the upper end of lead time variability (L=3) to maintain service levels. For mu_hat, I am setting an explicit value based on the new demand level of ~315 units/period multiplied by (1+L=4), totaling 1260 units. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the massive recent demand spike while considering the significant pipeline already in the system (excluding known lost orders).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 16: demand increased from an average of ~100 to ~315 (+215%).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The average demand over the last three periods (P16-P18) is approximately 282 units (305, 322, 219), compared to the earlier baseline of ~100 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have significant in-transit orders (1227 units) to account for the supply chain's unreliability. History shows lead times alternate between 1 and 3 periods, with some shipments (P2, P6) lost entirely. Given that we see arrivals for P9, P11, and P13 all took 3 periods, I am explicitly setting L=3 to ensure the backend base-stock calculation covers a sufficient time horizon (L+1 = 4 periods) to prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the new high-demand regime, and for sigma_hat, N=3 captures the recent volatility accurately.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' surged from a mean of ~100 to ~315 (+215%). The last four periods (16-19) recorded demands of 305, 322, 219, and 194. While demand dipped slightly in the most recent two periods, it remains significantly elevated compared to the pre-P16 history. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this shift. Lead times are highly unreliable, with confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6) and successful arrivals alternating between 1 and 3 periods. Given that P15 (121 units) and P17 (321 units) have not yet arrived, I must assume a conservative lead time (L=3) to account for the frequent 3-period delays and the high risk of a stockout during this peak. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, so we are entirely dependent on incoming pipeline inventory.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a significant regime shift starting in Period 16, increasing from a historical mean of ~100 to a recent mean of ~255 over the last 5 periods (305, 322, 219, 194, 235). Stockouts have been persistent due to this surge and supply chain instability. Looking at lead times, we observe an alternating pattern of 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P11 took 3, P13 took 3). Since P15, P17, and P18 orders (totaling 983 units) are currently in-transit and haven't arrived by P20 (making P15 and P17 overdue if target was L=2), I will set L to 'explicit' value of 3 to account for the frequent delays and lost shipments observed in the carry-over history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime, and N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this new period of high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains elevated: mean for P16-P20 is 255 units. Supply chain reliability is low; orders from P15 onwards are pending, confirming that a lead time of 3 is more realistic than the promised 2.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is 245 units, a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~100. Additionally, the supply chain is experiencing extreme instability: the 'In-transit' balance is 1227 units, with no arrivals since Period 16. Orders from P15 (7 periods ago), P17 (5 periods ago), and P18 (4 periods ago) are all past the promised lead time of 2. Historical data shows successful arrivals alternate between 1 and 3 periods, but current delays suggest shipments may be lost or significantly delayed. To ensure the OR backend aims for a high enough base stock to cover this new demand level and the extended lead time, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) and mu_hat to cover 4 periods (1+L) using the recent high-demand regime (N=6). Sigma_hat is also calculated over this recent period to capture increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Critical supply chain failure: No arrivals observed for 6 consecutive periods (P16-P21) despite 1227 units in-transit. Demand regime (P16-P21) confirmed at mean ~245 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of crisis with zero arrivals for the last seven periods (P16-P22), despite 1227 units being in-transit. Based on historical data, multiple shipments are currently overdue or potentially lost (P15, P17, P18). The demand regime has shifted significantly since Period 16, with a new average mean of approximately 246 units per period (P16-P22), compared to the previous ~100. Because the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is highly unreliable, I am setting the lead time (L) to 4 periods to account for the ongoing severe delays. I am using the 'recent_N' method (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime that started at Period 16, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock that reflects the current high-demand, high-uncertainty environment while attempting to clear the inventory deficit once arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse: 7 consecutive periods (P16-P22) with zero arrivals despite high in-transit volume; Lead time estimate increased to 4. Demand regime (P16-P22) mean is 246 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe supply chain crisis with 8 consecutive periods (P16-P23) of zero arrivals, despite a high in-transit volume of 1326 units. The promised lead time of 2 is decoupled from reality; our last successful delivery was in Period 16 (ordered in Period 13), and we have multiple orders (P15, P17, P18, P23) seemingly stalled or lost in the pipeline. Demand shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~100 to ~245 (P16-P23 mean is 241.6). Because the OR backend uses a pipeline inventory deduction logic (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline), and our pipeline is huge (1326) relative to any reasonable base stock, the backend will likely order 0. To force the backend toward a higher base stock that accounts for both the increased demand and the extreme delivery delays, I am setting L to 5 (the longest realistic delay before assuming complete loss) and using an explicit mu_hat based on the new demand regime (245 units/period * (1+5) periods = 1470). Sigma remains high to account for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse continues: 8 consecutive periods (P16-P23) with zero arrivals. Lead time estimate increased to 5 periods to reflect the extreme delay/loss of the P15-P21 order block. Demand regime (P16-P23) mean stabilized at ~242 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of extended failure. We have seen zero arrivals for the last 9 consecutive periods (P16-P24), despite having 1571 units in transit (orders from P15, P17, P18, P23, P24). The inventory on-hand is 0. Demand has stabilized in a high-regime state since P16, with an average of approximately 241 units over the last 9 periods (305, 322, 219, 194, 235, 195, 252, 211, 237). Because the promised lead time of 2 is clearly not being met and multiple orders appear stuck or lost, I am increasing the explicit lead time estimate to 6 to account for the growing backlog and to force the OR backend's pipeline inventory requirements higher. For \u03bc\u0302, I am using the mean of the recent high-demand regime (N=9) to reflect the shift from ~100 to ~240 units. This approach aims to trigger large replenishment orders once the backend recognizes the pipeline isn't sufficient to cover the extended lead time at this new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse worsening: 9 consecutive periods (P16-P24) with zero arrivals. Lead time estimate increased to 6 periods to reflect the backlog of orders from P15-P24. Demand regime (P16-P24) mean is 241 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, a shipment finally arrived (ordered in P23, lead time = 2), ending a 9-period drought and indicating the supply chain is partially recovering or clearing the backlog. However, over 1,600 units remain in-transit, including older, likely lost orders (P15-P18) and more recent orders (P24-P25) that are still within reasonable delivery windows. The demand regime remains highly elevated following the shift at P16; the mean demand from P16 to P25 is approximately 256 units. Given the recent arrival followed the promised lead time of 2, but previous history showed significant instability and losses, I will adjust L down to 3 (from 6) to reflect a cautioius improvement. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=10 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (mean ~256). sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to capture the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain activity resumed in P25 (P23 order arrived with L=2) after a 9-period drought. Demand regime (P16-P25) mean is confirmed at 256 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand dropped significantly to 113 units, compared to the sustained high-demand regime (P16-P25) which averaged ~256 units. This drop may signal either a return to the lower baseline or a one-time outlier; however, given the extremely high in-transit position (1691 units) and zero on-hand inventory, cautious parameter setting is required. The supply chain provides mixed signals: while the P23 order arrived with L=2 in Period 25, the massive block of orders from P15 onwards remains missing. I will use a conservative lead time estimate (L=4) to account for potential delays and set mu_hat based on the recent elevated demand regime (last 11 samples, P16-P26, mean ~243) rather than just the last period's drop, to ensure we don't under-order if the drop was temporary. Sigma is set based on this same regime to capture the recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop observed in Period 26 (113 units) following a 10-period high-demand regime (avg ~256). Monitoring if this is a shift or an outlier.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift. Between Periods 16-25, demand averaged ~256 units. However, Periods 26 and 27 recorded 113 and 145 units respectively. This suggests the high-demand regime has ended or softened. I will estimate the new demand mean by averaging the last 5 periods (P23-P27: 211, 237, 294, 113, 145), which is approx 200. Regarding supply chain, we saw a brief resumption in Period 25 (L=2), but no arrivals in Periods 26 or 27. The in-transit pipeline is extremely bloated (1691 units) due to the large orders placed during the drought (P17-P18 orders of 321 and 541 units still missing). Given the high pipeline and recent zero-stockout arrival in P25, the OR backend's capping mechanism will naturally limit ordering if pipeline > base_stock. I will set L to 3 (observed maximum excluding lost orders) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient window, and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the cooling demand while maintaining enough coverage to recover from the stockout once the massive pipeline arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease: Mean demand dropped to ~129 over last 2 periods (P26-P27) compared to previous mean of ~256 (P16-P25). Supply chain remains erratic; P15-P21 mass orders (approx 1000+ units) are still missing or significantly delayed, while P23 arrived within 2 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 context: Demand has stabilized at a lower level following a surge; the average for the last three periods (P26-P28) is 147 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime (P16-P25) of ~256. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable: only one order (P23) has arrived in the last 12 periods, while a massive block of orders (P15-P21, totaling ~1200 units) remains missing. However, the last recorded lead time was 2 periods. Given the high in-transit volume (1691 units) against an on-hand of 0, ordering more would likely lead to massive overstock and holding costs if the backlog arrives at once. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the high probability of delay seen in history, but reducing the demand forecast to the recent_N (3 periods) of 147 units/period for the mu_hat calculation. This helps lower the target base stock to account for the demand cooling off while still acknowledging the supply risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 26-28 mean is 147 units (-42% from P16-P25 mean). Massive supply backlog of ~1200 units (P15-P21) remains unresolved, posing significant overstock risk.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30. Significant demand shift: After a high-demand period (P16-P25 avg ~256), demand has settled into a lower regime (P26-P29 avg 143.75). The supply chain remains extremely unreliable; while a recent order (P23) arrived in 2 periods, a massive block of older orders (P15-P21 totaling ~1200 units) is either lost or severely delayed. With 1691 units in-transit and 0 on-hand, we face an extreme overstock risk if the backlog arrives simultaneously. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (P26-P29) to match the new lower demand regime. I am keeping L at 'calculate' to let the backend average the erratic observed lead times, but since pipeline inventory (1691) is much higher than the calculated base stock for the current demand, the OR engine will correctly suppress any new orders to avoid compounding the overstock risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease stabilized: Period 26-29 mean is 144 units (-44% from previous regime). Supply chain backlog remains the primary operational risk with 1691 units in-transit against current demand of ~144.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has definitively shifted to a lower level; the mean demand from Period 26 to 30 is 131 units, which is significantly lower than the ~250 units seen in the previous high-demand regime (P16-P25). Supply chain variability remains the dominant risk. While Period 25 saw an arrival (P23 order, L=2), there hasn't been another arrival since, and a massive 'lost' block of orders from Periods 15-21 (approx 1200 units) remains in-transit. On-hand inventory is zero. Total in-transit is 1691, which far exceeds the 1+L demand coverage required for the current regime (approx 524 units at L=3). To prevent the OR backend from ordering more and compounding the impending overstock (whenever the pipeline clears), I am setting L to 3 (observed reality) and mu_hat to a value that reflects the current mean demand (131 * 4 = 524). Because in-transit (1691) > mu_hat (524), the backend will correctly place zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease stabilized: Period 26-30 mean is 131 units, representing a -49% shift from the P16-P25 high-demand regime.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime, with a mean of 131 units over the last 5 periods (P26-P30), which is a significant drop from the previous peak of ~240. The primary operational challenge continues to be the breakdown in the supply chain: despite ordering over 1200 units between P15 and P21, nothing has arrived from that block for over 10 periods, while a single more recent order (P23) arrived in 2 periods. Currently, 1691 units are in-transit, which is more than 12 times the current weekly demand. If the backlog from P15-P21 arrives now, it would result in massive holding costs. Therefore, I am maintaining zero orders by keeping mu_hat aligned with the current lower demand and setting L to the promised lead time (2) to reflect the recent arrival (P23), ensuring baseline stock doesn't exceed pipeline inventory. No order will be triggered because (pipeline=1691) > (base stock target).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a critical stockout situation (on-hand: 0) with a massive pipeline inventory (1691 units) that has failed to arrive for multiple periods. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 26. The mean demand for the last seven periods (P26-P32) is approximately 123 units, significantly lower than the P16-P25 peak of ~256. Given the huge in-transit volume (1691 units vs. a projected 3nd-period demand of ~400-500), the OR backend will naturally set orders to 0 as pipeline inventory far exceeds any reasonable base stock level. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=7) to capture the lower demand regime and use the calculation method for L to reflect historical volatility, though the primary constraint remains the massive undelivered backlog.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed and stabilized: Period 26-32 mean is 123 units. Severe lead time extension/blockage continues: 1691 units in-transit (orders from P15-P25) have not arrived for 7+ periods, despite one anomalous arrival in P25.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is currently in a state of severe disruption. There is a massive pipeline inventory of 1,691 units (consisting of orders from Period 15 through Period 25), yet there have been no arrivals for the last 8 periods (since Period 25), and zero arrivals between Periods 16 to 24. This suggests a systemic blockage rather than simple lead-time drift. The demand regime has clearly shifted downward from the Period 16-25 peak (avg ~256) to a new, lower mean. Over the last 8 periods (P26-P33), mean demand is approximately 124 units. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 but the in-transit quantity (1691) already covers nearly 14 periods of current demand (1691 / 124 \u2248 13.6), any further ordering would be reckless. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the new, lower demand regime, but I am setting L to 15 (explicitly) to reflect the ongoing delivery failure. This high L combined with the enormous in-transit inventory will signal the OR backend to stop ordering, protecting against a catastrophic overstock event if the backlog eventually arrives at once.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: mean for P26-P33 is 124 units. Total pipeline inventory is 1691 units, representing over 13 periods of safety coverage; however, supply chain blockage persists with no arrivals for 8 consecutive periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has effectively collapsed. No arrivals have occurred for 9 consecutive periods (since P25). There is an enormous pipeline inventory of 1872 units, which includes a massive backlog from P15-P21 and more recent orders. Current demand has stabilized in a lower regime; the average demand from P26 to P34 is approximately 127 units per period. With 1872 units in-transit, we have over 14 periods of demand coverage already 'ordered' if they ever arrive. Ordering more at this stage only increases the catastrophic risk of a massive overstock and associated holding costs once the blockage clears. I am setting L to 6 to reflect the severe lead time extension (though even this is conservative given the 9-period drought) and using a recent_N of 9 for mu_hat (P26-P34) to capture the current lower demand level. However, because pipeline inventory (1872) far exceeds the calculated base stock, the OR backend will correctly result in an order of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease stabilized: Period 26-34 mean is 127 units. Supply chain blockage reached critical levels with 9 consecutive periods of zero arrivals; total pipeline inventory (1872 units) represents ~14 periods of demand coverage.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is in a state of severe prolonged disruption. We are currently in Period 36. There have been no arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (P26-P35), even though the P23 order arrived in P25. On-hand inventory is 0, and in-transit inventory is massive at 1872 units, which represents over 14 periods of demand at the current consumption rate (~127 units/period). This suggests a 'blockage' where orders are either being held up en masse or have been lost. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 26 (P26-P35 mean is approximately 127). Given the extreme pipeline (1872 units) compared to the demand forecast for the promised lead time (L=2), the OR engine will naturally minimize or zero out new orders to avoid overstocking once the blockage clears. I will maintain the lead time estimate at 7 to reflect the ongoing delay, as the last successful arrival was 11 periods ago (for P23). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high risk of stockout while acknowledging the excessive pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain blockage persists: 10 consecutive periods (P26-P35) with zero arrivals. Estimated lead time for the current backlog (P15-P34) is now effectively 7+ periods. Demand regime (P26-P35) remains stable at mean ~127 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has shown a flicker of recovery with the Period 34 order arriving in Period 36 (L=2), despite the catastrophic backlog of 1691 units (from Periods 15-25) still being missing for over 20 periods. We are currently in a lower-demand regime that stabilized around Period 26. The mean demand for the last 11 periods (P26-P36) is approximately 125 units (sum=1379). With 54 units on-hand and an massive 1691 units in-transit (even if partially lost), our 'pipeline inventory' is extremely high relative to current demand. The OR backend's base-stock calculation will naturally suppress new orders because (on-hand + in-transit) significantly exceeds the required base stock. I will set L to 2 to reflect the most recent successful delivery, and use the last 11 samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current lower demand regime. This strategy prevents unnecessary ordering while we wait to see if the massive backlog either arrives (creating an overstock crisis) or is officially written off.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain partially resumed: P34 order arrived with L=2 in P36. However, the massive P15-P25 backlog (1691 units) remains missing for 11+ periods and is now treating as likely lost or severely blocked. Demand regime since P26 is stable at mean ~125 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we observed a partial resumption of the supply chain with the arrival of the Period 34 order (L=2). However, a massive backlog of 1691 units (from orders placed between Period 15 and 25) remains missing for over 12 periods. While these units are technically 'in-transit', they are highly likely lost or severely blocked. If they were to arrive simultaneously, they would cause a massive holding cost spike. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26, with a mean of approximately 125 units per period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Given the high in-transit balance (1691) and the OR backend's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), the system will not place new orders unless I explicitly adjust the parameters. To ensure we meet current demand while account for the unreliable pipeline, I will set L to 2 (the most recent successful lead time) and use a recent_N for mu_hat (N=12, covering the low-demand regime since P26). I will keep sigma_hat at default to allow the backend to handle volatility. No new ordering is expected this period due to the existing 1691 units in-transit, but the parameters reflect the current demand environment.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level since Period 26, with a mean of approximately 125 units (mean of P26-P38 is ~125). The supply chain remains highly unreliable. While the P34 order arrived normally (L=2), a massive block of units (1691 units from P15 onwards) remains missing for over 13-20 periods. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand is ~125, we need to restart ordering to meet immediate demand, as the 1691 'in-transit' units are likely lost or permanently stalled. If we treat the 1691 units as active pipeline, the OR backend will order nothing. To trigger an order, I must bypass the default pipeline logic. Since I cannot explicitly 'cancel' in-transit units in the backend, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat and a high L to force a base stock calculation that outweighs the stalled pipeline, or sets a target based on the current regime. I will set L=3 (the conservative realistic lead time observed for successful deliveries) and mu_hat to 125 * (1+3) = 500. However, because in-transit (1691) > 500, the capped policy will still result in zero orders. To fix this, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat that accounts for the current demand plus the 'missing' pipeline units, effectively 'offsetting' the stalled inventory to ensure the product is actually ordered for the next 3-4 periods. Target base stock should be (L+1)*Demand = 4 * 125 = 500 units. To get a ~500 unit order through the (BaseStock - 1691) calculation, mu_hat needs to be set to ~2200.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Pipeline inventory of 1691 units (P15-P25) is confirmed as 'stalled/lost' for over 14 periods; current operational decisions must assume this stock is unavailable to meet immediate demand. New demand regime (P26-P38) mean is ~125.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is stable with a mean of approximately 125 units (Period 26-39 mean = 124.6). The supply chain remains highly unreliable: while Period 34 arrived with L=2, a massive block of 1691 units (ordered Period 15-25) has been stalled for 14+ periods and is effectively lost or permanently blocked. Including these units in our 'pipeline inventory' would prevent the OR engine from ordering, resulting in perpetual stockouts. To force the engine to maintain service levels despite this phantom inventory, I am setting an 'explicit' L of 3 (more conservative than the promised 2) and an 'explicit' mu_hat of 500. This mu_hat (calculated as (1+L)*mean = 4 * 125) represents the required base stock for a 3-period lead time plus the review period at current demand levels. By using explicit values, we override the OR engine's reliance on the total pipeline count and ensure enough fresh orders are placed to cover the current real demand. We ordered 559 in Period 39; this should cover immediate needs if it arrives within 2-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bifurcation: Recent orders (P23, P34) show L=2, but the P15-P25 backlog (1691 units) remains 'stalled/lost' for 15 periods. Decisions must ignore the 1691 units and focus on new order cycles.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a lower-demand regime that stabilized around Period 26, with a mean of approximately 125 units (Period 26-40 mean is ~124 units). In Period 40, an order placed in Period 39 for 559 units arrived (Lead Time = 1), leaving us with 449 units on-hand. This inventory is sufficient to cover nearly 4 periods of the current demand mean. The 'In-transit' figure of 1691 units consists of the massive block of orders from Periods 15-25 that has been stalled for 15+ periods and is effectively lost or permanently blocked; including them in the OR backend calculation would prevent any necessary new orders. I will use the 'explicit' method for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to maintain the current inventory buffer without triggering massive unnecessary orders or stockouts while we monitor the reliability of the recent L=1 arrival. Setting mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods with the current mean (~125) and sigma (~35), adjusted for the current on-hand position.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower mean since Period 26. The mean demand for the last 15 periods (P26-P41) is approximately 119 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~250. Inventory management is currently dominated by the 'stalled' backlog of 1691 units from periods 15-25, which has not arrived for over 16 periods. As previously established, this pipeline stock is treated as lost/unavailable to avoid halting replenishment based on phantom inventory. Recent successful arrivals from P34 (L=2) and P39 (L=1) suggest the supply chain has recovered for new orders. On-hand inventory is 350 units, which covers approximately 3 periods of demand at the current rate (350 / 119 \u2248 2.94). With an estimated lead time of 2, the pipeline is sufficient for now. I will use recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower-demand regime while using calculation for L to account for the restored (though historically erratic) lead times.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P26-P41) average is stable at 119 units. The massive 1691-unit backlog (P15-P25) is now 16+ periods overdue and confirmed as non-operational for planning purposes.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 119 units per period (P26-P42 aggregate). The massive 'stalled' pipeline inventory of 1691 units from Periods 15-25 remains 17+ periods overdue and is non-operational for inventory planning. Recent order cycles (P34 and P39) arrived in 1-2 periods, suggesting the supply chain has resumed service for new orders, though reliability is historically poor. Current on-hand inventory is 207 units. Given the target mean of ~119, the current stock covers approximately 1.7 periods of demand. With a lead time of 2, we need about 3 periods of coverage (L+1) to minimize stockouts. Inventory is currently sufficient for the immediate period, but a replenishment order should be triggered soon. I am setting L=2 (promised/recent) and mu_hat based on the recent 17-period regime (N=17) to match the sustained lower demand level (~119/period) and avoid over-ordering into a potential backlog arrival and high holding costs.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 119-125 units (mean of P26-P43 is ~123). Current on-hand inventory is 113 units. The 1691 units in-transit (from Periods 15-25) are now over 18 periods overdue and are confirmed 'stalled/lost' for planning purposes; including them in the OR backend's pipeline calculations would lead to zero orders being placed indefinitely. Recent successful orders (P34 and P39) arrived with lead times of 2 and 1 respectively, suggesting that current supply chain performance for *new* orders has returned closer to the promised L=2, even though the massive mid-game block remains. I am setting L to 2 (promised) to stabilize order frequency. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=18) to capture the stable demand regime starting at P26. sigma_hat is also calculated over this period. Despite on-hand inventory, I am monitoring because the game ends in Period 50, and we must avoid carrying excess stock into the final period while ensuring we don't stock out in the short term.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P26-P43) mean is stable at 123 units. Supply chain remains bifurcated: old 1691-unit backlog (P15-P25) is lost/ignored, while new orders arrive in 1-2 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime (P26-P44) with a mean of approximately 123 units, following a high-demand period. Supply chain conditions are bifurcated: a legacy backlog of 1691 units (P15-P25) remains missing for 20+ periods and is considered lost or permanently stalled for planning purposes. Recent arrivals (P34 and P39) have arrived in 2 periods and 1 period respectively, suggesting the current logistical path is functional. Period 44 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 units sold (stockout), while pipeline inventory ONLY consists of the stalled 1691 units. Since these units are not expected to arrive, I must place a new order to replenish stock. I will use L=2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering given the legacy units still 'technically' in-transit, and set mu_hat based on the stable 19-period low-demand regime (N=19) to ensure 3 periods of demand coverage.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Mean demand for P26-P44 is 123 units. Legacy 1691-unit backlog (P15-P25) is definitively non-operational for planning.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a new regime since Period 26, with a mean of approximately 123 units per period. The massive backlog of 1691 units from Periods 15-25 remains 'stalled/lost' (15+ periods overdue) and is ignored for safety logic to prevent perpetual stockouts. Recent order arrivals (P34 and P39) arrived in 1-2 periods, suggesting the supply chain is functional for new orders. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Given we are at Period 46 of 50, and recent demand is ~123, I need to replenish base stock to cover the remaining periods while accounting for the ~2 period lead time. Since on-hand is zero and the 1691 units in-transit are unreliable, I will use an explicit L=2 and mu_hat focused on the recent regime (last 20 samples covers P26-P45) to trigger a replenishment order. sigma_hat is also set to the recent regime to reflect current volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 of 50. The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, with a mean demand of approximately 123 units. Recent periods (P44-P46) show demand of 118, 130, and 106. The supply chain situation remains bifurcated: a legacy backlog of 1691 units (from P15-P25) has been stalled for 22+ periods and must be treated as lost or unreachable for the remainder of the game. Recent successful orders (P34, P39) arrived with lead times of 1-2 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Given the high stockout risk and the short game remaining (4 periods left), I will place an order to cover the remaining periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the post-P26 regime mean (~123). To handle the supply uncertainty without over-relying on the 1691 stalled units (which the OR engine sees as pipeline), I must use the 'explicit' method for L. By setting L to 1, I signal a tight lead time for the next order while mu_hat covers 2 periods of demand (1+L).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 is part of the final stretch (ending at Period 50). Demand since Period 26 has stabilized in a lower regime with a mean of ~123 units and moderate variance. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and while 'in-transit' shows 1691 units, these are from the historical supply chain blockage (P15-P25) and are confirmed as lost or non-operational for planning. Recent operational shipments (P34, P39) arrived with L=2 and L=1 respectively. I will aim for a base stock that covers the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50) given the 1-2 period lead time. Since this is the end-of-game scenario, overstocking is as risky as understocking due to holding costs. I'll use recent demand (N=22, since P26) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and assume an explicit lead time of 2 to ensure coverage for the final periods without counting the 'ghost' inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 49, with only 2 periods remaining in the simulation (P49 and P50). The primary context is the long-standing supply chain 'bifurcation' and a stable demand regime. Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 124 units since Period 26. The 1691 units in-transit (orders from P15-P25) have been missing for over 20 periods and are confirmed non-operational for planning. Recent ordering history (P34 and P39) showed lead times of 1-2 periods. However, the system is currently at zero on-hand inventory and the only pipeline units are the stalled/lost 1691 units. Since this is the penultimate period (P49), we must place an order that can arrive in time for the final period (P50). Given recent successful arrivals had L=1 or L=2, an order placed now (P49) with a target lead time of 1 would arrive during P50. To set mu_hat, I use the regime average of 124 units. To ensure the OR backend generates an order despite the 1691 units in the pipeline, I use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target a total base stock that accounts for the fact that those pipeline units don't exist, while keeping L at 'default' (2) to reflect the promised window, or 'explicit' if I want to force the math. However, the most robust way to trigger the order given the backend formula (base_stock - pipeline) is to set an explicit mu_hat that is high enough to overcome the 1691 ghost units, but since the game ends at P50, a massive order won't yield profit for periods beyond P50. Actually, since P50 is the last period, we only need enough to cover P49 (already passed) and P50. Target for P50 is ~130 units. To bypass the 1691 units in-transit in the OR backend's calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must set mu_hat explicitly to (~130 + 1691) = 1821.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0 after several periods of stockouts following the depletion of the Period 39 order. The current demand regime (P26-P49) is stable with a mean of approximately 124 units. The massive 1691-unit 'stalled/lost' backlog (P15-P25) is ignored for calculation purposes as it is over 25 periods overdue. However, a recent order from P49 (156 units) is in-transit. To restore availability while accounting for lead time variability (which has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods), I set L to be the promised 2 periods (as recent successful orders arrived in 1-2 periods). Mu_hat is set based on the recent 24-period mean (P26-P49) of approximately 124 units per period, resulting in a target for (1+L) periods. Sigma_hat is calculated from the same period to reflect current volatility.
