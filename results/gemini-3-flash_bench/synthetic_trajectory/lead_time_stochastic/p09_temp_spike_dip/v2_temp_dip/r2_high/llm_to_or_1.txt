Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical data or 'conclude' messages to infer the actual lead time, so I will rely on the promised lead time (L=2). The initial demand sample for Period 1 is 118. Given the total lead time plus review period (L+1 = 3), I need to forecast total demand for 3 periods. Using the mean of the available sample (118), the default mu_hat calculation would be 118 * 3 = 354. However, since I have other samples provided (130, 72, 58, 121), the 'default' method in the OR backend will calculate the mean across all and multiply by (1+L). I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to establish a baseline while the system gathers more data. No lead time data is available yet, so 'default' (promised L=2) is appropriate.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 154 units with a promised lead time of 2. Following the 'Period 1 conclude' message, that order has not arrived (which is expected as L=2 orders arrive in Period 3 and are visible in Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 0, meaning we lost sales in Period 1 (demand 114 vs. sold 0). The pipeline inventory is 154. Historical demand across the first 5 sample periods was approximately 100 (avg: 99.8). Based on the formula 'base_stock = (1+L) * mu', and with L=2, we need to cover 3 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and standard deviation to capture the initial variance while sticking with the promised lead time of 2 periods to ensure the OR backend properly calculates the base stock level against the existing pipeline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Observations from Period 1 and Period 2 show zero arrivals, which is consistent with the promised lead time of 2 periods (orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive during P3 resolution and will be visible in the P4 conclude message). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 306 units in-transit (154 from P1, 152 from P2). Demand is relatively stable (P1: 114, P2: 117), though the provided sample history (P1: 118, P2: 130, P3: 72, P4: 58, P5: 121) shows some volatility. Since we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 2 periods, I will stick to 'default' for L. For demand forecasting, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the provided samples) to better capture the initial demand distribution for the (L+1)=3 period window.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (154 units), Period 2 (152 units), and Period 3 (67 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This indicates the actual lead time is likely longer than 2 periods or the shipment is delayed. Consequently, we have had 0 sales because on-hand inventory has remained at 0 despite demand. The demand for the first three periods was 114, 117, and 103 (mean ~111). I will set the lead time to an explicit value of 3 to reflect the delay observed (P1 order hasn't arrived by the end of P3). For demand (mu_hat), I will use the mean of the 5 historical samples (~99.8) and project it over (1+L) periods. Since we have a 'stockout' situation due to delivery delays, the OR backend needs to account for the larger pipeline and the likely arrival of 373 units soon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1899.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two orders arrived simultaneously in Period 4: the Period 1 order (154 units, lead time = 3) and the Period 3 order (67 units, lead time = 1). The Period 2 order (152 units) is currently missing/overdue based on the promised lead time of 2 (should have arrived in Period 4). Current on-hand is 115, with 280 units in-transit (Period 2's 152 + Period 4's 128). Demand has been relatively stable, averaging 110 units across the first 4 periods. Since the actual lead times have fluctuated (1 and 3) and an order is missing, I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to average observed performance and 'recent_N' with N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stable but slightly fluctuating demand pattern. This will help the OR backend adjust for the variability in both supply and demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed lead times of 1 and 3 periods deviate from the promised 2; Period 2 order is currently overdue.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2185.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we face an critical stockout (On-hand: 0) and high demand (Period 5 demand: 132). The historical demand average is approximately 114.4 units per period. The supply chain has shown significant instability: of the five orders placed, two arrived (P1 with LT=3, P3 with LT=1), while P2 (152 units) is currently overdue by 4 periods, and P4 and P5 are still within reasonable windows. Total in-transit is 347. Based on the Carry-over insight, the lead time is volatile. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed arrivals (LT=3 and LT=1, average 2). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (all periods) to capture the trend of 114.4 units/period, scaled by (1+L). The OR backend uses a service-level target (q) of 19/(19+1)=0.95, which is appropriate for a high-profit item to minimize stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed lead times of 1 and 3 periods deviate from the promised 2; Period 2 order (152 units) is overdue by 4 periods (as of P6 start).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 with 0 units on-hand and 481 in transit. The demand mean is approximately 108.6 units (Std Dev ~18). There is a critical supply chain issue: the order from Period 2 (152 units) is now 5 periods old (exceeding the promised 2 and the previously observed max of 3), suggesting it may be lost. Other orders from Periods 4, 5, and 6 are still within reasonable windows but haven't arrived. Since on-hand is 0 and we've experienced stockouts for two consecutive periods (sold 0 in P6, sold 115 vs 132 in P5), we must assume a higher effective lead time for safety. I am setting L to 3 (recent observation max) to force the OR engine to cover a 4-period demand window (L+1). mu_hat is set to (1+3) * 108, and sigma_hat is set to sqrt(1+3) * 18 to manage this volatility.

Carry-over insight: Critical: Period 2 order (152 units) likely lost, now 5 periods since order date. Lead time is highly unstable, ranging from 1 to 3+ periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1312.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The Period 2 order (152 units) is now 6 periods past its order date and is officially considered lost; it has not arrived despite a promised lead time of 2. Historical 'concluded' lead times are 3, 1, and 3 periods, averaging 2.33. On-hand inventory is 56. The pipeline (In-transit) is 364, but subtracting the lost 152 units leaves a functional pipeline of 212 units (Orders from P5, P6, P7). Demand has been relatively stable: Period 1-5 mean ~114, Period 6-7 mean ~76. The last 3 samples average 94.6. To account for the lost stock and lead time instability, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use recent_N=3 to capture the recent lower demand trend while remaining responsive. Sigma_hat is set to the default to capture full historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 2 order (152 units) confirmed lost (6 periods since order). Functional pipeline inventory is 212 units. Lead time is unstable, settling at an average of 3 periods for the last two arriving orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2066.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the on-hand inventory is 24 units. Reviewing the history, the Period 2 order (152 units) is now 7 periods old and is confirmed lost, as reflected in the carry-over insights. Total in-transit is reported as 328 units, but removing the lost 152 units leaves a functional pipeline of 176 units (134 from P6, 42 from P8). Observed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1. The average of these observations is 2.2 periods. To account for the lost shipment and the volatility, I am setting L to 2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering through the OR engine's formula, but adjusting mu_hat explicitly. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (132, 80, 72, 110, plus some unrecorded variance) averages around 100. However, the first 3 periods averaged 110. Using all 8 periods, the mean is approximately 105. To ensure we cover demand during the lead time (L+1=3) while the pipeline is thin due to the lost order, I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*105 = 315 and sigma_hat to 45. This conservative approach balances the risk of stockouts after the recent stockout in P5/P6 without over-committing given the high holding cost relative to the risk of another lost shipment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1254.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are out of stock (ending on-hand 0). The Period 2 order (152 units) is confirmed lost (8 periods since placement). Current in-transit is 316, but excluding the lost Period 2 order, the functional pipeline is 164 units (134 from P6, 30 from P9). Demand has been relatively stable but fluctuating around a mean of ~100. Observed lead times have been 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1. I will set the lead time (L) to 2 (recent average) and use a recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture recent lower trends (mean ~88 in last 5 periods) while maintaining a high service level to recover from stockouts. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Demand remains volatile (mean ~88, range 72-110 in last 5 periods). Transitioning to 3-period lead time coverage as recent arrivals suggest a bimodal pattern of 1 or 3 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 with 0 on-hand inventory and 357 units in transit. Demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) has averaged 87.6 units. The lead time is extremely unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Recent arrivals: P4-ordered P1 [3], P1-ordered P3 [1], P7-ordered P4 [3], P8-ordered P5 [3]/P7 [1], P9-ordered P8 [1]). With the Period 10 arrival being zero, we are currently experiencing a stockout. The pipeline inventory (357 units) consists of orders from P6 (134), P9 (30), and P10 (41), plus the likely-lost P2 order (152 units). Excluding the P2 order, the functional pipeline is 205 units. To buffer against the high lead-time variability (which behaves like L=3 for safety purposes) and frequent stockouts, I will use an explicit L of 3. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation: Functional in-transit is 205 units (P6, P9, P10 orders); Period 2 order (152 units) remains lost after 9 periods. Average lead time for 'late' arrivals is 3 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. The Period 2 order (152 units) is now 10 periods old and must be treated as permanently lost. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P6 (134), P9 (30), P10 (41), and P11 (35), totaling 240 units. Observed lead times follow a bimodal distribution of 1 or 3 periods (Average ~2). Because we are currently stock-out and lead times are unstable, I will set L to 3 to ensure coverage for the longer possible delay. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 88.6 units over the last 5 periods (P7-P11). Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) and L=3 will target a base stock sufficient to cover the 4-period window (L+1), while the OR backend's pipeline deduction (total in-transit minus the lost P2 order) should trigger a replenishment order to bridge the current gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Period 2 order (152 units) confirmed lost (10 periods since order). Functional pipeline is 240 units (orders from P6, P9, P10, P11). Demand mean over last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 88.6 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the system is at zero on-hand inventory following another stockout in Period 12. Total in-transit is 335 units, but 152 units from Period 2 are definitively lost (11 periods overdue), leaving a functional pipeline of 183 units (from P6, P11, and P12 orders). Lead times remain highly erratic, with recent arrivals occurring at 1, 2, and 3 periods; I will continue using an explicit lead time of 3 to ensure sufficient coverage for the longest probable delay. Demand has stabilized somewhat but remains high, with a mean of 90.2 units over the last 5 periods (P8-P12). I am setting mu_hat to 360 (approx. 4 periods of 90-unit demand) to recover from the stockout and account for the pipeline correction, as the OR backend's calculation of base stock (base_stock - pipeline) will see 183 units in transit. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for demand volatility and lead-time-induced variance.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline correction: Period 2 order (152 units) is confirmed lost and should be excluded from future functional inventory calculations. Functional pipeline currently stands at 183 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand remains steady but volatile (average ~90). The total in-transit is 426 units, but reconcile follows: Period 2 order (152) is lost (12 periods old), and Period 6 order (134) is now 8 periods old with no arrival, strongly suggesting it is also lost. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P11 (35), P12 (14), and P13 (91), totaling 140 units. Observed lead times recently are 2 and 3 periods; I will set L=3 to ensure the OR engine covers a longer horizon given the high stockout frequency and supply instability. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (approx mean 93) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the higher demand periods from the start of the game.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Period 6 order (134 units) is now 8 periods old and confirmed lost alongside the Period 2 order. Functional pipeline inventory is 140 units. Effective lead time for parameter calculation remains 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $665.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant reporting mismatch in pipeline inventory. Historically, multiple orders have been lost: Period 2 (152 units) and Period 6 (134 units). Excluding these 286 units from the reported 'In-transit' of 391 reveals a functional pipeline of only 105 units (P12 order: 14, P13 order: 91). Lead times are highly volatile, switching between 1 and 3 periods, so I am setting L=3 to ensure sufficient coverage for the longer tail of delivery. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 91 over the last 5 periods (P10-P14: 89, 96, 99, 85, 86). To account for the stockouts and the unreliable pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) and L=3 to target a base stock covering 4 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed loss of Period 6 order (134 units) in addition to Period 2 loss (152 units); total permanent pipeline loss is 286 units. Functional pipeline is currently 105 units. Demand mean stabilized at ~91 units over last 5 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 2 (152 units) and Period 6 (134 units) are permanently lost, totaling 286 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The reported In-transit of 377 units includes these losses; therefore, the functional pipeline is actually 91 units (91 from P13, 0 from P14/P15). Demand has stabilized with a 5-period mean of 97.6 units (P11-P15), though P15 saw a significant spike to 134 units. Observed lead times follow a bimodal distribution of 1 or 3 periods (average ~2.3, effectively requiring coverage for 3 periods). Setting L to 3 and using the most recent 5 periods for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent spike and compensate for the lost inventory units that the OR backend incorrectly assumes are still arriving.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed stockout (on-hand 0). Functional pipeline is 91 units; total lost units (P2 and P6 orders) is 286. Setting parameters to cover a 3-period lead time window to account for historical delivery variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $709.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the on-hand inventory is 51 units. Historically, we have confirmed the loss of orders from Period 2 (152 units) and Period 6 (134 units), totaling 286 lost units. The 'In-transit' figure of 375 includes these lost units, so the functional pipeline is actually 89 units (the order from Period 16). Lead times are highly variable but frequently hit 3 periods. To ensure adequate coverage and compensate for the lost inventory that the OR backend still believes is coming, I am setting L=3 and using an explicit mu_hat. Over the last 5 periods (P12-P16), the average demand has been approximately 89 units. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods, which is 4 * 89 = 356 units. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility while maintaining a buffer against stockouts which have occurred frequently.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Functional pipeline reconciliation: Total in-transit (375) minus lost units from P2 (152) and P6 (134) leaves a functional pipeline of 89 units. Recent 5-period demand mean is 88.8 units.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we have an on-hand inventory of 107 units. Analyzing the pipeline, the total In-transit is 327 units. However, we have confirmed losses of 286 units (Period 2: 152 units, Period 6: 134 units). Therefore, the functional pipeline is 327 - 286 = 41 units (the order from Period 17). The total effective inventory (on-hand + functional pipeline) is 148 units. Demand has shown a downward trend in the last two periods (40 and 33 units), but the 5-period mean prior to these was ~91. Given the volatility, I select N=5 for demand to balance the recent dip with the established mean. For lead time, while the promised is 2, arrivals consistently fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock formula (L+1) covers a 4-period demand window, providing safety against the frequent delivery delays observed in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1233.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19, the demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent decrease, with the last two periods (P17, P18) recording 33 and 67 units respectively, significantly lower than the P7-P16 mean of approximately 88 units. This requires a downward adjustment in mu_hat using a recent window (N=5) to avoid overstocking. Regarding lead times, the history shows a bi-modal pattern (mostly 1 or 3 periods). The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals (P16, P14, P12) frequently take 3 periods. I will set L to 3 to ensure sufficient coverage for these delayed deliveries. Pipeline reconciliation: Total in-transit is 330 units. However, orders from P2 (152 units) and P6 (134 units) are now 17 and 13 periods old respectively, and are definitively lost. Functional in-transit is 330 - 152 - 134 = 44 units (from P17, P18). The OR backend's cap is intended to limit over-ordering; by setting L=3 and using a recent demand mean, the base stock (approx 4 * 70 = 280) should trigger an appropriate order to refill the pipeline even with the 'phantom' lost stock in the inventory view.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand cooling observed (P17-P18 avg ~50 vs previous avg ~91). Functional inventory analysis confirms 286 units permanently lost (P2, P6 orders), leaving 44 units in the valid pipeline.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a demand cooling phase (P17-P19 average ~49). The current in-transit inventory is 382 units, but this includes 286 units confirmed lost (Period 2 order of 152 and Period 6 order of 134). Eliminating these results in a functional pipeline of 96 units (from orders in P17, P18, and P19). Lead times remain highly variable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue using an explicit lead time of 3 to ensure safety coverage. Demand has shifted from a mean of ~90 units to ~50 units over the last three periods. To avoid over-ordering during this 'cool' phase while still buffering for the stockout, I'll use a recent window of N=5 to capture the downward trend in demand mean and volatility. Setting L to 3 and using 'recent_N' for demand parameters helps bridge the gap between promised lead time and actual delivery instability while adjusting to the current lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: mean shifted from ~91 to ~50 over periods 17-19. Functional pipeline remains 96 units after accounting for 286 total lost units (P2: 152, P6: 134).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean of approximately 50 units (last 4 periods: 33, 67, 46, 62). We account for historical lead time variability by setting L to 2, which is the promised lead time and consistent with recent observations (though arrivals remain irregular). Pipeline reconciliation shows current In-transit is 392 units. Subtracting the confirmed lost shipments (Period 2: 152 units; Period 6: 134 units), the functional pipeline is 106 units. This includes orders from P17 (41), P18 (3), P19 (52), and P20 (10). Given the on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has cooled significantly, we set mu_hat to 150 (3 * 50) and sigma_hat to reflect the volatility witnessed across the cooling period to prevent over-ordering while maintaining availability.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Period 21 saw a significant demand bounce back to 85 units after a three-period cooling phase (avg ~50). This suggests the cooling was temporary or demand remains highly volatile. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this return to higher demand levels by using a 5-period average (P17-P21 mean = 58.6), while maintaining L=3 based on historical arrival patterns (ignoring lost units). The functional pipeline calculation is critical: total In-Transit is 392, but we must subtract the lost orders from Period 2 (152) and Period 6 (134), leaving a functional pipeline of 106 units (consisting of orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20). Setting L=3 and using a larger sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5 covers the peak and the valley) will help the OR backend rebuild stock to handle the observed volatility and the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: following a cooling period (P17-P19), Period 21 demand spiked back to 85 units, indicating a high-variance regime rather than a sustained lower mean.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant total in-transit of 392 units. However, based on historical evidence (Carry-over insights), 286 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost. The functional pipeline is therefore only 106 units (392 - 152 - 134). The actual lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a 3-period lead time being the safest planning horizon to prevent stockouts given the 'late' arrival pattern. Demand has entered a high-variance regime: after a cooling period (P17-P19), it spiked to 85 (P21) and dropped to 40 (P22). Over the last 6 periods (P17-P22), the mean demand is ~55 units, but the broader post-P13 average is closer to 64. To balance the risk of sustained demand recovery against recent cooling, I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat (covering the last 10 periods) and an explicit 3 for lead time (L) to ensure the backend calculates a base stock sufficient for the realized delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Functional pipeline verified at 106 units after subtracting 286 lost units (P2: 152, P6: 134). Demand is in a high-variance state with a 6-period mean of ~55 units vs. a 12-period mean of ~70 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The functional pipeline currently contains 96 units (382 total - 152 lost from P2 - 134 lost from P6). Recent demand has stabilized into a high-variance regime with a mean of approximately 55 units over the last 7 periods (P17-P23) following a spike in Period 21. Actual lead times consistently hit 3 periods for 'late' deliveries. To ensure the backend OR logic accounts for this extended lead time and the current stockout (on-hand is 0), I am setting L to 3 and using a 7-period demand window to capture the recent high-variance cooling/stability. This will help the base-stock calculation reach a level that accounts for both the 3-period lead time and the 1-period review cycle (4 periods total demand coverage), while correctly adjusting for the significant number of lost units in the pipeline.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory Status: On-hand is 0. Total In-transit is 382 units. Pipeline Reconciliation: From the Carry-over insights and history, Period 2 (152 units) and Period 6 (134 units) orders are confirmed lost (286 units total). Functional In-transit = 382 - 286 = 96 units. These functional units consist of orders from P17 (41 units), P18 (3), P19 (52), and P20 arrived in P23. Since P17-P19 orders have not arrived yet and are at least 6 periods old, they may also be at risk, but for now, we treat the functional pipeline as 96. Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P20-P24) is 62, 85, 40, 46, 79, averaging ~62.4 units. This is higher than the previous 'cooling' average of 50 but lower than the historical 90. Strategy: Set L=3 to account for the frequent 'late' arrival pattern. Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat (N=8 covers P17-P24, capturing both the cooling and the recent volatility) to provide a localized mean that balances the recent 40-79 range. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=8 to capture the current high variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Functional pipeline remains 96 units; orders from P17, P18, P19 are now potentially overdue (6+ periods), following the loss pattern of P2 and P6.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has exhibited high variance recently, settling into a lower-mean regime of approximately 50-60 units after Period 17, with occasional spikes. Pipeline Analysis: Total in-transit is 382. However, multiple orders are confirmed or likely lost: Period 2 (152 units) and Period 6 (134 units) are definitively lost (286 total). Furthermore, orders from P17 (41 units), P18 (3 units), and P19 (52 units) are now 7-9 periods old and have not arrived, while the P20 order arrived in 3 periods. This suggests P17, P18, and P19 (96 units) are also likely lost. Total functional pipeline is effectively 0 (382 total - 286 P2/P6 - 96 P17-P19). Lead Time: Observed lead times are consistently 3 periods for 'late' successes. Forecasting: I will use a recent_N of 9 (P17-P25) to capture the current lower demand regime (mean ~52). Parameter choice: I will set L to 3 to cover the observed delivery window and use recent_N for mu and sigma to reflect the current demand environment while the OR engine attempts to rebuild the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19 (total 96 units) are now over 7 periods old without arrival and are classified as likely lost, joining previously lost orders from P2 and P6 (286 units). Total confirmed/likely lost inventory in pipeline is 382 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe state of supply failure and persistent stockouts. On-hand inventory is 0, and the entire reported in-transit quantity of 382 units matches exactly the sum of orders identified as likely lost in the carry-over insights (P2: 152, P6: 134, P17: 41, P18: 3, P19: 52; total = 382). Therefore, the 'functional' pipeline inventory is effectively zero. Demand has returned to a higher variance state with a recent peak of 114 in Period 26. To recover from this stockout and provide adequate coverage given the demonstrated lead-time instability (actual lead times often hitting 3 periods), I will set the L parameter to 3. For demand (mu_hat), the last 10 periods (P17-P26) reflect a mix of cooling and spikes (avg ~52), but historical averages prior to the stockout were closer to 90. Given the current 0 on-hand status and 0 functional pipeline, I will use a conservative recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while the OR backend attempts to refill the depleted pipeline. By treating the 382 units as lost (effective pipeline = 0), the backend will trigger a substantial recovery order.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Absolute pipeline failure. All 382 units in-transit (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed/likely lost. Functional pipeline inventory is 0. Demand remains in a high-variance regime with a recent spike of 114 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has encountered a total collapse. As of Period 28, there is 0 on-hand inventory and the in-transit balance of 382 units consists entirely of orders from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19, which are all significantly past their expected arrival dates and are deemed 'lost' based on historical data. No new orders have been placed since Period 20, and the only recent arrival was a small order from Period 20 that arrived in Period 23. Functional pipeline inventory is therefore 0. Demand remains highly volatile, with recent observations of 114 and 100 units following a period of 0 (likely a data anomaly or report error) and earlier lows of 40-46. Given the unreliability of the supply chain (frequent losses and variable lead times of 1-3 periods), I am setting L=3 to ensure a wider safety window. mu_hat is set to cover 4 periods (1+L) of demand; using the last 10 periods (excluding the outlier '0') suggests an average demand of roughly 70-80 units per period. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 320 (80 units/period * 4) and sigma_hat at 120 to account for high volatility and stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total pipeline failure confirmed. Functional pipeline is 0 units; all 382 units in-transit (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are permanently lost. System must re-build inventory from scratch.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is emerging from a catastrophic inventory state where 5 major orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) totaling 382 units were confirmed lost. This resulted in a prolonged stockout period. Total in-transit is currently 518 units, of which 382 are lost, leaving a functional pipeline of 136 units (the order placed last period). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has exhibited extreme volatility recently (ranging from 0 to 117), but the 10-period average is approximately 68 units, while the peak demand periods reach ~115 units. Given the historic unreliability of the supply chain (observed lead times of 1-3 periods and frequent losses), I am setting L to 3 to ensure the backend calculates coverage for a full 4-period window (L+1). mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current high-variance regime. Although functional in-transit is only 136, the backend's capped policy will look at the total in-transit (518), likely preventing a new order this period. This is appropriate as we must wait to see if the P28 order (136 units) arrives or is also lost before committing more capital to a potentially broken lane.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Pipeline reconciliation: Total in-transit 518 units includes 382 units confirmed lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Functional pipeline is 136 units (P28 order). Demand remains in a high-variance regime (mean ~68, peak ~115) with frequent stockouts due to supply failure.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the system is in a critical stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, the pipeline has suffered massive reliability issues, with 382 units (from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19) confirmed or likely lost. The total In-transit of 518 units consists of these 382 lost units and a recent order of 136 units from Period 28. Therefore, the functional pipeline is 136 units. Following the rule that L+1 periods of demand must be covered (using L=3, so 4 periods), and given the recent high-variance demand (P26-P29 mean ~98, historical peak ~134), we need a robust base stock. I will use L=3 to reflect the consistent upper range of delivery times. mu_hat is set to cover 4 periods of demand at a conservative mean (~90 units/period) to recover from the stockout and buffer against lost shipments. sigma_hat is set to capture the high volatility seen in recent spikes (range 0 to 117).

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Functional pipeline reconciliation confirms 382 units permanently lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Only the P28 order (136 units) remains functional. Demand has shifted back to a high-volume/high-variance regime, averaging ~98 over the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2524.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the environment is characterized by a significant recovery from an extended period of supply failure. Demand has returned to a high-volume regime, with a 4-period mean of approximately 102.75 units (P27-P30). The Period 28 order (136 units) arrived in Period 30 (lead time = 2), leaving 3 units on-hand. Pipeline inventory reconciliation is critical: the current In-transit total of 386 units includes 382 units confirmed/likely lost (P2: 152, P6: 134, P17: 41, P18: 3, P19: 52). Only the P30 order (4 units) is functional. To protect against the high demand variance and historical lead time instability (which ranges from 1 to 3+ periods), I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend targets coverage for a 4-period window (L+1). mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 4 to capture the current high-demand surge, and sigma_hat is set using 'explicit' at 25 to account for the high volatility (61 to 133 units) seen recently, ensuring a robust safety stock to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand regime confirmed at high-volume (4-period mean ~103). Final confirmation that 382 units of pipeline inventory (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are permanently lost and should be ignored for functional stock calculations.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to battle significant pipeline instability. As of Period 32, 450 units are marked 'In-transit', but historical data confirms that orders from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 382 units) are permanently lost. The functional pipeline consists only of orders from Period 30 (4 units) and Period 31 (64 units), totaling 68 units. The order from Period 28 arrived in 2 periods, but the overall history shows mean lead times closer to 3 periods for successful deliveries. Demand has returned to a high-volume regime, averaging 103.5 units over the last 4 periods (P28-P31). To recover from a current stockout (on-hand = 0) and high functional deficit, I am setting L to 3 and using a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat. This targets a base stock that covers the 3-period lead time plus the decision period (L+1=4) against the current demand surge. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a wide enough buffer for the high variance observed (range 61-133 in the last few active periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed high-volume (4-period mean ~104). Functional pipeline reconciliation: Total in-transit (450) includes 382 units confirmed lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Functional pipeline is only 68 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently recovering from a long period of pipeline failure. On-hand inventory is near zero (2 units). Analysis of recent 'concluded' orders (excluding confirmed lost shipments) shows that the logistics environment is volatile but potentially faster than promised: Period 28 arrived in 2 periods, Period 31 arrived in 1 period, and Period 30 (4 units) is currently in-transit. Based on the Carry-over Insights, we must continue to treat orders from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 382 units) as permanently lost. The functional pipeline consists of the Period 30 order (4 units) and the Period 32 order (52 units), totaling 56 units. Demand has returned to a high-volume regime; over the last 5 active periods (P28-P32), the average demand is 91.4 units. To ensure availability given the 2-period promised lead time and historical variance, I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of this higher demand regime and use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline recovery in progress: Recent arrivals (P28, P31) show lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively, suggesting improved logistics despite previous mass losses. Functional pipeline (excluding 382 lost units) is 56 units. Demand has stabilized at a high-volume mean (~91 units).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is recovering from a massive supply chain failure where 382 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) were confirmed lost. Current 'In-transit' of 386 units contains those 382 lost units and 4 units from P30. Effectively, the functional pipeline is 4 units. Recent lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods (P28 arrived in 2, P31 in 1, P32 in 1). Demand is in a high-volume regime but showed a slight cooling in the last two periods (62, 58). I am using a demand window of N=7 to capture the recent high-volume regime (averaging ~88.5 units) while acknowledging the recent volatility. Setting L to 2 periods to provide a safety buffer against the historical 'late' arrivals (3 periods) vs recent 'early' arrivals (1 period).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Recent three orders (P28, P31, P32) arrived with lead times of 2, 1, and 1 periods respectively. Functional pipeline is very low (4 units) due to 382 units being permanently lost.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is slowly recovering from massive historical losses. I am tracking 382 units as permanently lost (from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19). The current 'In-transit' of 386 units contains those 382 lost units, plus only 4 units from the Period 30 order. Consequently, the functional pipeline is just 4 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has transitioned into a high-volume regime; while recent samples show 58 and 93, the rolling 5-period mean is approximately 86 units. Lead times for the last three arriving orders were 2, 1, and 1 periods, suggesting a return to the promised lead time of 2. I am setting L=2 and using 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime, ensuring the backend calculates a base stock sufficient to rebuild inventory while accounting for the significant stockouts experienced.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Orders from P28, P31, P32 arrived with lead times of 2, 1, and 1 respectively. Functional pipeline calculated as total in-transit minus 382 lost units. Demand regime remains high-volume (avg ~86 over last 5 periods).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with recent lead times of 1-2 periods (Periods 28, 31, 32). However, 382 units from periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19 are definitively lost and must be excluded from functional pipeline calculations. Current in-transit is 386, meaning functional pipeline is 386 - 382 = 4 units (the order from P30). On-hand is 0, leading to a stockout. Demand has remained high, averaging 86.2 units over the last 5 periods (P31-P35). To recover from the stockout and maintain service levels, I will use an explicit L of 3 to provide a safety buffer against the historical volatility and set mu_hat to cover this window based on the recent high-demand regime (approx 90 units/period * (1+3) = 360). This aggressive base stock will force an order that compensates for the lost 382 units and historical stockouts.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a 1-2 period lead time (P28, P31, P32 arrivals), but a massive backlog of 382 units (from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) is confirmed lost. My functional pipeline calculation is: Total In-transit (454) - Lost Units (382) = 72 units (the P36 order). On-hand is currently 0, leading to a stockout in Period 36. Demand has returned to a high-volume state, with the last 5 periods (P32-P36) averaging 71.8 units and the last 10 periods averaging 81.3 units. To recover inventory and meet this demand, I will set L to 2 (promised) and use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current high-variance demand regime while filtering the extreme volatility of the mass loss period. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand across the lead time and the current period (L+1) without being skewed by the lost 382 units.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilized at 1-2 periods lead time after Period 28. Functional pipeline reconciliation: 382 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed permanently lost. Only orders from Period 36 onwards are considered valid inventory. Demand remains high-volume (10-period avg ~81).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we have an on-hand inventory of 6 units and a nominal 'in-transit' of 386 units. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights, 382 units (from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed permanently lost. Therefore, the functional pipeline is 386 - 382 = 4 units. Since the last arrival (P36 order) arrived in P37 (LT=1), supply seems to have stabilized at a shorter lead time (1-2 periods). Demand has entered a high-volume/high-variance regime since Period 30, with a recent 10-period mean near 81 units. I will use L=2 to provide a safety buffer against the historical lead time instability, despite recent 1-period arrivals. For demand, I'll use a recent 8-period window (P30-P37) which captures the current high-volume regime (mean ~87), ensuring mu_hat covers (1+L) periods. Sigma_hat is set to the same window to capture the observed high variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Functional pipeline verified at 4 units after adjusting for 382 lost units. Recent lead times (P31, P32, P36) have consistently been 1 period, suggesting a potential shift from the promised 2 periods, though instability remains a risk.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 39. On-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 386 units, but history confirms that 382 units (from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19) are permanently lost. Therefore, 'functional' pipeline inventory is only 4 units (from Period 30, though Period 30 conclude says 4 units were ordered, which means total functional in-transit is likely 0 or 4). Recent arrivals (P28, P31, P32, P36) show an actual lead time shifting towards 1 or 2 periods (1, 1, 2, 1), which is shorter than the promised 2. However, based on the backend's base-stock formula, setting L=1 might lead to under-ordering given the history of lost shipments and volatility. I will use L=2 (promised) to ensure the OR backend targets a 3-period demand window (L+1). Demand has returned to a high-volume regime; the mean of the last 10 periods (P29-P38) is approximately 80.5 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this current high-volume state, while sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to account for the high variance (range 52-133).

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Functional pipeline remains near zero after adjusting for 382 units permanently lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Recent successful lead times are 1-2 periods. Demand stabilized in a high-volume regime (10-period avg ~81).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a predictable lead time of 1-2 periods for recent successful arrivals (P28, P31, P32, P36). However, the system is burdened by 382 units of permanently lost inventory (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) which masks the true functional pipeline. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and total in-transit is 386 units, meaning the functional in-transit inventory is only 4 units (386 - 382). Demand has returned to a high-volume regime, with recent samples (P38: 105, P39: 112) indicating a mean near 90-100. I will set L to 2 to ensure coverage for the promised lead time while accounting for the recent high demand. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat is necessary to bypass the backend's inclusion of lost units in its pipeline logic, aiming for a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~300 units total).

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Functional pipeline reconciliation: Total in-transit (386) minus confirmed lost units (382) leaves only 4 units of valid functional inventory. Demand remains high-volume (avg ~90-100 units).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a critical supply-chain challenge. 382 units (from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed/likely lost based on the 40-period history. The current In-transit total of 386 units contains those 382 lost units plus the 4 units from P30 (which arrived but we track net in-transit against placed orders). Thus, functional on-hand is 0 and functional in-transit is effectively 4. Demand has returned to a high-volume regime, averaging 94.75 units over the last 4 periods (P37-P40). To address the stockout and persistent pipeline loss, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to provide a wider safety buffer for inventory accumulation, given the history of lost and delayed shipments. mu_hat is set to the recent average multiplied by (1+L) to capture the current high-demand state (~380 units for 4 periods). sigma_hat is set explicitly high to handle the high demand variance and ensure the OR backend generates a substantive order to replenish the depleted system.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is recovering from a long period of low orders and pipeline failure. We are currently in a high-volume demand regime (Period 36-41 demand: 94, 62, 105, 112, 104, 129), with the most recent 5-period average at approximately 103 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is currently 503 units, but 382 units (from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19) are confirmed permanently lost, leaving a functional pipeline of 121 units (the order from P41 plus a residual 4 units from P30). Lead times have stabilized recently between 1 and 2 periods. To ensure coverage against the current high-demand regime and lead time variability, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods and L to the promised 2 periods to maintain a safe base stock, allowing the OR engine to order enough to meet demand and rebuild safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed high-volume: 5-period mean (P37-P41) is 102.4 units. Functional pipeline reconciliation remains critical: 382 units are permanently lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Current valid pipeline is 121 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently high-volume and high-variance, with the last two periods showing a spike to 129 units. The 5-period mean (P38-P42) is 115.8 units. The supply chain remains unreliable: 382 units from earlier periods (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost and must be excluded from the functional pipeline. The current 'In-transit' of 503 units includes these 382 lost units, leaving a functional pipeline of 121 units (from P41). Since on-hand inventory is 0, the OR backend must account for the high demand and the significant portion of the pipeline that will never arrive. I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect the recent high demand (approx 116 units/period) across a 3-period lead time window (L+1=3) to ensure sufficient stock-up, while using an explicit L=2 to match promised lead time despite recent 1-period arrivals, as a safety buffer against the historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand spike confirmed (P41-P42 avg=129). Functional pipeline remains 121 units after subtracting 382 lost units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44, the inventory situation is critical. We have 0 units on-hand and 503 units in-transit. However, 382 of those units (from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed/likely lost based on the persistent lack of arrival messages over many periods. The only valid functional inventory is the 117 units ordered in Period 41 and 4 leftover units from P40, totaling 121 units of functional pipeline. Recent demand (P41-P43) has spiked significantly, with values of 129, 129, and 104 units respectively, averaging ~120 units. This is a clear regime shift from the previous 80-90 range. To account for this, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples and explicit sigma_hat to handle the heightened volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to provide a conservative buffer, despite some recent 1-period arrivals, as historical instability is high.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Demand regime shift confirmed to high-volume (P41-P43 average 120.7 units). Functional pipeline is only 121 units after accounting for 382 units permanently lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is in a high-demand regime with a 5-period average of 110 units (P40-P44). Currently, on-hand inventory is 33 units. Functional pipeline reconciliation is critical: total in-transit is 386 units, but 382 units (from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost based on historical data. Thus, the actual functional pipeline is only 4 units (from the P30 order, though that order should have arrived by now, the P41 order just arrived in P44). Lead times have been highly variable, recently observed at 3 periods (P41 order). To ensure stock availability in this volatile supply/demand environment, I am setting L to 3 and targeting a demand mean (mu_hat) based on the recent high-volume regime (approx 110 units/period). This results in a mu_hat of 440 (110 * (1+3)). Sigma_hat is set to capture the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Demand regime confirmed high-volume (recent 5-period mean ~110). Functional inventory remains constrained by the 382 units permanently lost in the pipeline; only orders from P41 onwards have shown successful arrival. Lead time remains erratic but currently requires planning for 3 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we face a stockout (on-hand 0). The demand regime is confirmed high-volume, with a recent 5-period average (P41-P45) of 114.8 units. The supply chain remains unreliable: while the promised lead time is 2, arrivals like the P41 order (arriving P44) show that 3 periods are frequently required to ensure availability. The functional pipeline inventory is 85 units (Order from P45), as 382 units (from Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed permanently lost. To recover from the stockout and cover the demand through the extended lead time (L=3), I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the high-volume regime (~110 units/period) across the (L+1) window, and sigma_hat to account for the high variance (std ~20).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed high-volume: 5-period mean (P41-P45) is 114.8 units. Supply chain remains erratic; planning for a 3-period lead time is necessary due to periodic delays (e.g., P41 order).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0). The demand regime is confirmed high-volume, with a recent 5-period average (P42-P46) of 112.8 units. The supply chain remains erratic; although the Period 41 order arrived (lead time 3), it only partially covered demand. Our current in-transit inventory is 506 units, but 382 units (from periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19) are confirmed permanently lost, leaving a functional pipeline of only 124 units (Orders from P45: 85, P46: 35, and a residual 4 units). Since lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation covers the risk of delay. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*113 \u2248 452 to match the current high-demand regime, and sigma_hat is maintained at a level that accounts for the high historical variance observed during these spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 48, the system is in a critical stockout state (on-hand: 0). The demand regime is in a sustained high-volume phase, with a recent 10-period average of approximately 101 units and a 5-period average (P43-P47) of 107.2 units. Supply chain reconciliation remains the primary challenge: out of 523 units in-transit, 382 units (from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are permanently lost. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P45 (85 units), P46 (35 units), and P47 (17 units), totaling 137 units. Given the erratic lead times (P41 arrived in 3 periods) and the confirmed history of mass losses, I am setting L to 3 to ensure coverage across potential delays. mu_hat is set to 440 (reflecting a 4-period window at an average demand of 110) and sigma_hat is set at 40 to provide a robust safety buffer against the high volatility observed in this regime. This aggressive parameterization aims to force the OR backend to rebuild inventory despite the deceptive 'In-transit' count caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: High-volume demand regime stabilized with a 10-period mean of ~101 and 5-period mean of ~107. Lead time remains unstable (recent P41 order took 3 periods). Functional pipeline is only 137 units; the remaining 386 units in-transit are confirmed lost.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the simulation (Period 49 of 50). The supply chain remains unreliable with a significant portion of in-transit inventory (386 units) confirmed lost from previous mass failures (Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19). The current functional pipeline consists of orders from P45 (85 units), P46 (35 units), and P47 (17 units), totaling 137 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has settled into a high-volume regime, with a 5-period mean (P44-P48) of approximately 102.6 units and a 10-period mean of ~102 units. Lead times are erratic, recently oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, requiring a planning horizon (L) of 3 to ensure coverage against delays like that seen with the Period 41 order. Given this is the penultimate decision period and the objective is to maximize total reward, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 10-period high-volume regime to ensure sufficient stock for the final demand resolution, while acknowledging that orders placed now may not arrive before the game ends (L=3 means arrival in P52). However, maintaining a consistent policy is safer for the OR backend's logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Functional pipeline confirmed at 137 units; the remaining 386 units of the 523 in-transit are permanently lost from historic supply failures (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime stable at high-volume (mean ~102).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 50, the environment is characterized by a stable but high-volume demand regime and a highly unreliable supply chain. Demand has averaged approximately 102 units over the last 10 periods (range 81\u2013129). Inventory reconciliation shows 523 units in-transit, but 382 units (from orders in Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19) are confirmed lost based on historical lack of arrival. Four additional units are likely also lost/negligible. Only orders from Periods 45, 46, and 47 (totaling 137 units) are considered functional. Lead times remain erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; recent arrivals (P41) took 3 periods. To ensure availability given current zero on-hand units and the history of pipeline failure, I am maintaining a 3-period lead time parameter (L=3) to cover the risk. I am using the recent 10-period average for demand (mu_hat) to avoid overreacting to the P48-49 slight cooling, while setting sigma_hat based on the high-variance context of the last 10 periods (N=10) to protect against stockouts.
