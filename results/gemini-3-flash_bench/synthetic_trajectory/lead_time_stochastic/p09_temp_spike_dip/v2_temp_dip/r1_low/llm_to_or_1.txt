Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of the simulation (Period 1). The product is 'chips(Regular)'. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero, we need to establish a baseline order to meet the upcoming demand. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (samples provided) are: 118, 130, 72, 58, 121. The mean of these samples is 99.8. Because we are at Period 1 and don't have enough runtime data to detect a regime shift yet, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to estimate the mean and standard deviation for the backend OR logic. This will allow the backend to calculate the base stock level (mu + z*sigma) considering the review + lead time window (L+1 = 3 periods).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 154 units with a promised lead time of 2. As expected per the 'Critical Timing Example', the 'Period 1 conclude' message shows 0 arrivals because an order placed in Period 1 with L=2 arrives during Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1 (demand 89, sold 0). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) shows a mean of 99.8. I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the baseline demand statistics while keeping L at the promised lead time of 2. This will allow the OR backend to calculate the base stock needed to cover (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Our promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders were placed in Period 1 (154 units) and Period 2 (140 units), totaling 294 in-transit. Based on the 2-period lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (visible in the next period's observe). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 due to 0 starting inventory. Historically, demand for the first 5 periods (including provided pre-game data) was 118, 130, 72, 58, 121. The game history for P1 and P2 shows realized demand of 89 and 41, which is actually lower than the pre-game context but still significant. Since we are in the initial setup phase and waiting for the first lead-time cycle to complete, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent fluctuations while relying on the default promised lead time.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (154 units) and Period 2 (140 units). Following the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message, which we would see now. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates the shipment from Period 1 is delayed or lost. Because on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we have experienced 100% lost sales for 3 periods, we must be aggressive to recover. Demand has fluctuated (89, 41, 91) with an average of approximately 74. Since lead time appears longer than 2 periods or unreliable, I will set L explicitly to 3 to increase the base stock calculation and use recent history (N=3) for demand to capture the current mean, while keeping sigma default to handle volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (visible at the start of P5), meaning the actual lead time was 3 periods, one period longer than the promised 2. The pipeline inventory is currently 141 (ordered in P2) and 1 (ordered in P4). Demand for the first five periods has been 118, 130, 72, 58, and 121 (averaging ~100). However, the 'conclude' messages show 'demand' values of 89, 41, 91, and 95, which are consistent with the historical samples provided. I will adjust the lead time parameter to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect the observed delay. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' as the current sample size is small and demand appears relatively stable without a clear regime shift yet.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (including actual demand from Game History) is 89, 41, 91, 95, 97. The mean demand is approximately 82.6 units per period. Crucially, the 'conclude' message from Period 4 confirms that the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 4, establishing an actual lead time of 3 periods (L=3), which deviates from the promised L=2. Currently, inventory is 0 on-hand with 281 units in-transit (orders from P2, P4, and P5). Since L=3, the P2 order (140 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's resolution and be visible now, or arrive during Period 6. Given the stockout in Period 5 (sold 59, demand 97), we must ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. I will set L=3 explicitly and use the recent demand trend (excluding the P2 outlier of 41 if possible, but recent_N=4 covers 91, 95, 97 well) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time was 2, but the only concluded shipment (ordered P1, arrived P4) shows an actual lead time of 3 periods. This delay caused a stockout starting in Period 5 because the order from P2 (ordered P2, expected P5 given L=3) has not arrived yet. Since we have 0 on-hand and 324 units in-transit (orders from P2, P4, P5, and P6), we must account for the lengthened lead time. The demand history across 6 periods has stabilized around a mean of ~85-95 units (P1: 89, P2: 41, P3: 91, P4: 95, P5: 97, P6: 96). Discarding the outlier (P2: 41), the recent average is ~95. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect reality and use recent_N=4 for demand to ignore the low P2 value, helping the OR backend calculate a safer base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations from Periods 4 and 7 confirm a consistent lead time of 3 periods (P1 arrived P4, P4 arrived P7). The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a demand of 112 in Period 7, and it has 378 units in transit (orders from P2, P5, P6, and P7). Demand has shown a steady increase since Period 4 (95, 97, 96, 112), moving away from the lower values seen in Periods 4 and 5 of the historical data (58, 121). Given the stockout and the lead time of 3, I am setting L=3 explicitly. For demand (mu_hat), I am using the mean of the last 4 periods (approx 100 per period) extrapolated for L+1 (4 periods) to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for current demand levels and the longer lead time. Sigma is calculated based on the recent 4 periods to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently observed at 3 periods (Confirmed by P4 and P7 arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-15.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent observations confirm a shift in supply chain performance. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time for the bulk of regular shipments (P1, P4, P5) has consistently been 3 periods. Although P7 arrived in 1 period, this appears to be an outlier or early arrival after a backlog, and to ensure adequate stock across the lead time (L+1), I will set L to 3. Demand has shown relative stability with an average around 90-100 units per period (Avg over 8 periods is 89; last 4 periods average 98.7). I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this recent demand level while accounting for the lead time extension. With on-hand at 105 and 205 in-transit (P6 and P8 orders), we are building a buffer to recover from the previous stockouts caused by the initial lead time delay.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: while 3 periods is the dominant lag (P1, P4, P5), P7 arrived in 1 period; planning for L=3 to remain conservative.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 with 0 on-hand inventory and 265 units in transit. Historical demand shows a mean around 95.2 units per period, with a recent spike in Period 9 (141 units). In terms of lead time, we've seen arrivals with lags of 3, 3, 3, 1, and 1 periods. Specifically, the orders from P1, P4, and P5 took 3 periods, while orders from P7 and P8 took only 1 period. This suggests lead time is unstable or potentially shortening. To avoid excessive stockouts while maintaining caution against high holding costs (which equals profit), I will use L=3 for the lead time parameter to ensure the pipeline covers the longer observed lag, but I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to weight the observed averages. For demand, I'll use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent upward trend in variance and mean, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat accordingly. This configuration aims for a service level that balances the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: P7 and P8 orders arrived in 1 period, whereas earlier orders (P1, P4, P5) took 3 periods. Demand showed a significant spike in Period 9 (141 vs avg ~90).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation for chips(Regular) shows stockouts due to lead time variability and a recent demand spike. While the promised lead time is 2, historical data shows arrivals at both 1 period (P7, P8) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5). In Period 10, no units arrived, including the order from Period 9 (which would be L=1) or Period 7 (which already arrived). The order from P2 (ordered 140) and P6 (ordered 43) are still missing and likely lost, as they are well past the 3-period max observation. I will use L=3 to be conservative given the stockout risks. For demand, the last 4 periods (P7-P10) show a higher mean of 110.75 compared to the earlier periods (~94), specifically boosted by a spike of 141 in P9. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this elevated demand level and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is highly unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with evidence of lost shipments (P2, P6 orders missing after 5+ periods). Demand shifted from ~94 to ~110 starting Period 7.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and has faced significant stockouts in periods 10 and 11 despite high in-transit levels (443 units). Analysis of lead times shows extreme volatility: early orders (P1, P4, P5) arrived in 3 periods, whereas later orders (P7, P8) arrived in 1 period. Crucially, orders from P2 and P6 appear lost as they are now 10 and 6 periods old respectively, well beyond the observed 3-period max. Recent demand has stabilized around a higher mean: the last 5 periods (P7-P11) average 106 units/period, compared to the earlier average of ~85. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the longer observed lead time and ensure the base stock calculation covers enough safety period. I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent shift to ~106 units/period, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current demand volatility, which is essential given the high profit/holding cost parity (q=0.5), requiring a balanced service level.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments confirmed: Period 2 and Period 6 orders have not arrived after 10 and 6 periods respectively (well beyond the max observed 3-period lag).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received orders from Period 9 (LT=3) and Period 10 (LT=2), but orders from Period 2 and Period 6 are officially considered lost. The lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L=3 as an explicit value to maintain a conservative buffer against this instability. On the demand side, a clear upward shift is visible starting Period 9: the average demand over the last 4 periods (P9-P12) is 120.75, compared to the overall historical mean of approximately 99.8. To adapt to this higher demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat. I will also use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to accurately capture the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level. The on-hand inventory is currently 71, and we have 36 units in-transit (from P11); setting L=3 ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the likely 4-period window (L+1) required to bridge the lead time gap and satisfy the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 9: avg demand increased to 121 (up from ~94).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 13. Demand has shifted higher, averaging ~121 units/period since Period 9 (141, 100, 89, 153, 130). Previous insights confirm that shipments from P2 and P6 are likely lost. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1, 2, and 3 periods (P9 arrived in 3, P10 in 2, P8 in 1). To ensure stability amid stockouts and unreliable deliveries, I will set L=3 as a conservative measure. For mu_hat, I'm using N=5 to capture the recent higher demand regime (avg ~123). I'll also use N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this higher demand period, ensuring the OR backend builds a sufficient safety stock buffer.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) despite recent arrivals, due to high demand and inconsistent lead times. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with most recent orders (P9, P10, P11) arriving in 2-3 periods. I will set L=3 as a conservative upper bound to ensure the pipeline covers the longer possible delay. Demand has shifted into a higher regime starting around Period 9; the average of the last 6 periods (P9-P14) is approximately 118.3, compared to the earlier average of ~90. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture this higher demand level. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect the increased volatility seen in this window (demand peaks of 141 and 153). This combination aims to rebuild inventory and protect against stockouts during the 3-period lead time window.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) despite a high volume in-transit (474 units). Analysis of lead times (L) shows high variability, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with historical evidence of lost shipments (P2 and P6 remain missing). The most recent arrival (P11) occurred in Period 14 with L=3. To be conservative and prevent further stockouts given the volatility, I am setting L=3 explicitly. Regarding demand (mu_hat), a regime shift was identified around Period 9. The average demand from Period 9 to 15 is approximately 113.4 units per period. Using a recent_N approach with N=7 captures this higher demand regime. Sigma_hat is also calculated using recent_N=7 to account for the increased variance seen in recent periods (ranging from 84 to 153).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-86.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift starting around Period 9, with average demand increasing to approximately 115-120 units, though the most recent demand (Period 16) was significantly lower at 43. Given the service level target (critical ratio = 0.5 because profit=holding=1.0), the goal is to align base stock with the median demand. Lead times continue to be highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P13 took 3 periods, P11 took 3, P10 took 2, P9 took 3). I will use L=3 to remain conservative against stockouts, especially since demand has been higher in the recent regime (avg ~110 over the last 8 periods). mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher demand regime while smoothing the recent low outlier. sigma_hat is also calculated over recent_N=8 to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-151.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory reconciliation: On-hand is currently 190. In-transit consists of orders from P15 (19 units). Two historical orders (P2, P6) are confirmed lost and ignored. Lead time shows a dominant value of 3 (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P13, P14), despite occasional 1-2 period arrivals. I will use L=3 for safety. Demand analysis: There was a significant regime shift between P9 and P13 (avg ~121), but the last two periods (P16=43, P17=39) show a sharp decline, likely a return to lower demand or a new seasonal trough. Since holding costs and profit are equal ($1.0), the service level target (critical ratio) is 0.5. To avoid excessive holding costs during this apparent downturn while respecting the 3-period lead time, I'll use a recent window (N=5) to capture both the peak and the recent drop, adjusting the forecast downward.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 16: demand dropped from an average of ~121 (P9-P13) to ~41 (P16-P17), a decrease of over 60%.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a significant regime shift. Between Periods 9 and 14, demand averaged ~121 units. Since Period 16, demand has dropped sharply, with Period 16-18 values being 43, 39, and 78 (avg ~53). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect this lower demand environment. Lead times remain unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Period 13 and 14 orders arrived in 3 periods). Using L=3 (explicit) is the safest approach to maintain stock during this uncertainty, although current inventory (On-hand: 112, In-transit: 202) is quite high relative to the new demand level. Setting L=3 and updating mu_hat with recent_N=3 will correctly signal the OR backend to restrict further ordering until the pipeline inventory clears, reducing holding costs while protecting against the observed lead-time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 16: avg demand decreased to ~53 (down from ~121).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-26.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 50 units (P16: 43, P17: 39, P18: 78, P19: 43). The current on-hand inventory (69) plus the significant in-transit pipeline (202) is more than sufficient to cover this lower demand, especially considering the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0). Lead times remain erratic, varying between 1 and 3 periods, with some orders (P2, P6) confirmed lost. I will set L to 3 to remain conservative against lead-time volatility. For demand forecasting, I will use a recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand level (P16-P19), which prevents over-ordering while the system clears existing pipeline inventory. The high pipeline relative to current demand will naturally lead the OR backend to order 0 units to minimize holding costs.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. The average demand dropped from ~121 (P9-P15) to approximately 51 over the last five periods (P16-P20: 43, 39, 78, 43, 51). Simultaneously, lead times have been unpredictable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with some shipments (P2, P6) clearly lost. The current in-transit inventory is high (202 units) relative to the new, lower demand level. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the last 5 samples to capture the lower demand regime and use an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the upper bound of observed variability. With 18 units on-hand and 202 in-transit, the OR engine will likely place no order this period, which is appropriate given the current excess pipeline relative to a ~50 unit/period demand.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to 21 (43, 39, 78, 43, 51, 57), the mean is approximately 51.8. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 0). There is a significant pipeline of 202 units, which includes orders from Period 15 (19 units) and likely overdue/lost units from earlier periods (P2: 140, P6: 43). Based on the lead-time history, actual lead times range from 1 to 3 periods, with L=3 being the most reliable conservative estimate for planning. The backend needs to account for the lowered demand to avoid excess holding costs while ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) periods. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound skip seen in the history, mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current lower demand regime, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect current volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, dropping from an average of ~121 to ~53. Recent demand (P19-P22) has stayed consistently low (43, 51, 57, 42), averaging approx. 48 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 208 units in-transit (orders from P15 onwards, though many are likely lost based on historical patterns of missing shipments P2 and P6). Given the confirmed lead time volatility (switching between 1 and 3 periods), I maintain L=3 for the backend to calculate the appropriate safety buffer. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat correctly captures the lower demand regime while disregarding the high-demand period prior to P16. Sigma_hat is also calculated over recent periods to reflect the current reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand since Period 16 is ~50 units, a >50% drop from the previous period's average of ~121.

The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 16. Since Period 16, the average demand is 54.1 units (samples: 43, 39, 78, 43, 51, 57, 42, 80). The current in-transit inventory is 202 units, which likely includes the missing orders from Period 2 (140 units) and Period 6 (43 units), now presumed lost as they are 22 and 18 periods late respectively. However, even if those are lost, the 19 units ordered in Period 15 are still in-transit. On-hand is 0. Lead time continues to be volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Period 22 order arrived in 1 period). Since Profit=1 and Holding=1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, implying we should target the median demand (z=0). I will set L=3 as a conservative measure to guard against the longer lead time observations. Demand is stabilized at the lower level, so I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current mean (~54) and variance.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the on-hand inventory is 0 while there are 217 units in-transit. These in-transit units represent several orders placed between Period 15 and Period 24 that have not yet arrived. Historical data shows lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with some orders (P2, P6) potentially lost. Since Period 16, demand has significantly dropped, stabilizing around 50 units (average of P16-P24 is ~52.2). Despite this, the system shows 217 units in pipeline inventory, which is more than enough to cover over 4 periods of the current demand regime. Adding more orders now would lead to excessive holding costs once the pipeline clears. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the low-demand regime since P16) to align with the current lower demand level. I am using an explicit lead time of 3 to reflect the high-end of observed lags, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the maximum expected wait, though the existing pipeline is already sufficient.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting at Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 50.6 units per period (Periods 16-25). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 217 units in-transit. Based on history, we have confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15) and highly volatile lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods. However, the current in-transit amount (217) is very high relative to the new demand levels (~50 units/period). Even if we assume a conservative lead time of 3 periods, the required base stock (L+1 * demand) would be around 200 units. Since 217 units are already in-transit, ordering more now would likely lead to excessive holding costs, especially considering the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0). Therefore, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent demand drop (N=10) and utilizing an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the most frequent delay, allowing the OR engine to reconcile the high pipeline inventory.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean of approximately 56 units per period since Period 16 (avg of P16-P26 is ~58). However, we have experienced stockouts for the last four periods (P23-P26) because no inventory has arrived. The 'In-transit' quantity of 217 units represents several older orders (likely including the large orders from Periods 15 and possibly others that were deferred or represent internal lead-time accounting). Calculating lead time: Recently, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with a few shipments potentially lost (P2, P6). The current 'In-transit' of 217 is significantly higher than the needed pipeline for a 58-unit demand regime with a 3-period lead time (which would require ~232 units total inventory). Since we are currently at 0 on-hand and 217 in-transit, and demand has shown a slight uptick in the last two periods (68, 106), I will set mu_hat based on the last 11 periods (P16-P26 regime) and L=3 (explicit) to account for the upper end of observed arrival lags. This will help the OR backend determine if the 217 in-transit units are sufficient or if a small top-up order is needed given the recent stockouts.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant shift. After a sustained low-demand regime averaging ~50 units (P16-P23), demand has spiked over the last four periods (P24: 34, P25: 68, P26: 106, P27: 125), with an average of 83.25. The most recent two periods (106 and 125) suggest a return to higher historical levels or a new uptrend. Lead times remain volatile, ranging between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.4). I will set L to 3 to remain conservative against stockouts, as on-hand inventory is currently 0. mu_hat will use the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture the recent upward trend while acknowledging the previous low-demand floor, resulting in a forecast that bridges the gap between the 50-unit and 120-unit regimes. sigma_hat will also use N=12 to properly reflect the increased volatility during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: demand spiked from ~50 average (P16-P25) to >100 units (P26: 106, P27: 125).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the item 'chips(Regular)' is facing a demand spike that began at Period 26. Demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) was 106, 125, and 107 (average ~113), compared to the previous regime's average of ~50. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 256 units in-transit. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average is roughly 2.3). To address the demand shift, I am setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current spike. Based on our history of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15) and delivery lags (P13 took 3 periods), I will use an explicit L=3 for safety. This conservative lead time setting helps the OR engine maintain a higher base stock to bridge the gap until in-transit orders arrive, minimizing stockouts during this high-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 26, with demand increasing from ~50 to ~114 units (avg of P26-P29). We are currently at zero on-hand inventory and have 370 units in-transit, largely driven by a high order of 131 in P29. Lead times remain unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with recent arrivals at 2 periods (P27 order arrived P29). Since Period 30 has zero inventory and demand is high, the priority is maintaining a sufficient base stock level. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current spike and explicit L=3 to remain conservative against lead-time volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current regime's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: average demand increased from ~50 to ~114 (+128%) based on P26-P29 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant upward shift starting at Period 26. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 30 is 114.2 units, compared to the previously observed low-demand regime of ~50 units (P16-P25). Consequently, mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using recent_N (N=5) to capture this new elevated regime. Regarding lead time, the promised lead time is 2 periods, but historical data shows volatility between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with some lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P24). The arrivals for orders placed in P27 and P28 both showed a lead time of 2 periods. To be conservative and ensure sufficiency across the lead time and the order period, I am setting L explicitly to 3, as this has been the maximum observed lead time for successful arrivals. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and although there is significant in-transit inventory (432 units), much of this consists of potentially lost or very late shipments from before Period 27 (e.g., P15, P19 are long overdue). New orders from P29 and P30 are expected in P31 or P32.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 26, increasing from an average of ~50 to ~114 units (+128%). The last four periods (P28-P31) show sustained high demand (107, 116, 117, 148), with P31 reaching 148. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with recent arrivals (P27, P28) taking 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and 457 units are in-transit, mostly from large orders placed in P29 (131) and P30 (84). To prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase while accounting for the high lead-time volatility, I am setting L=3 (recent max) and using recent_N (N=6, covering P26-P31) for demand and volatility to capture the new high-volume regime. The profit and holding cost are equal, suggesting a target service level of 50%, but with high volatility and potential for lost shipments, maintaining a higher base stock via the current high demand average is prudent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31 confirmed: average demand increased from ~114 (P26-P29) to ~121 (P26-P31) with P31 recording a peak of 148.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a higher regime starting from Period 26, currently averaging approximately 117 units per period (P26-P32). Period 31 saw a peak of 148, and Period 32 demand was 98. I am using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime while excluding the previous low-demand period (P16-P25). Lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will set L to 2 (the promised lead time) using the 'calculate' method, as the backend will average observed values. With zero on-hand inventory and 455 units in-transit, the system is attempting to satisfy significant backlog and the current high demand regime. The high pipeline is likely due to recent large orders (P29, P30) not yet arriving (P29 was for 131, P30 for 84).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 117 units (calculated from P26-P33). The most recent period (P33) demand was 114 units. Lead times remain unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with recent arrivals (P31, P32) showing a 1-period lead time, but historical data and carry-over insights confirm that we must plan for up to 3 periods to ensure coverage during delays. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 432 units in-transit (P29: 131, P30: 84, P31: 25, P32: 23). The backend base-stock calculation will use L=3 to cover the review and lead time. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current high-demand regime (~117 units/period). sigma_hat is set to default to capture the variance of the entire history, providing a safer buffer given the recent volatility.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 26, with an average of approximately 119 units per period (P26-P34). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and while there are 466 units in-transit, many of these are likely from older, potentially lost shipments or delayed orders (e.g., the large orders from P29-P30 of 131 and 84 units have not arrived yet). Lead times remain highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods recently, though the most recent arrivals (P31, P32) occurred in 1 period. To remain conservative against both stockouts and the unreliable pipeline, I am setting L explicitly to 3 to account for the upper end of the observed lead time variance. For demand (mu_hat), I am using the last 9 periods (N=9, from P26 to P34) to capture the current high-demand regime (+120 units/period). Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=9 period to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable since Period 26 at ~119 units/period. Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 119 units since Period 26 (P26-P35 average: 112.9; P31-P35 average: 114). The lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P31 and P32 arrived in 1 period, but earlier orders often took 3). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 despite a massive in-transit pipeline of 468 units. This pipeline likely contains several delayed or potentially lost shipments, as recent periods (P34, P35) have seen no arrivals. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we aim for the median demand over the lead time. I will set L to 3 to account for the longest typical delay observed, ensuring the base stock covers 4 periods of demand (L+1). mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current high-demand regime (~113/period), and sigma_hat also uses the recent regime to reflect current volatility.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 119 units per period since Period 26 (P26-P36 average is 112, but removing the high/low fluctuations, the previous regime assessment of ~119 remains a solid target). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 434 units in-transit. A review of recent arrivals shows lead times of 1, 2, and 2 periods (P31, P32, P34), suggesting the lead time has stabilized closer to the promised 2 periods than the earlier fluctuations of 3+ periods. However, several earlier orders are likely lost or severely delayed (P2, P6, P15, P24). The current pipeline (434 units) is significantly higher than the expected demand for the lead time coverage (approx 3 * 119 = 357 units), but given that actual stock-outs have been frequent and on-hand is zero, maintaining a robust pipeline is necessary. I will set L to 2 (promised/recent average) and mu_hat using recent_N (N=11, covering the period since the demand spike at P26) to reflect the current high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to capture current volatility.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high regime starting from Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 110-120 units. Lead times continue to be volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a conservative lead time estimate (L=3) to avoid stockouts. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a significant quantity in-transit (432 units). These in-transit units likely include large orders from Period 29 (131 units) and Period 30 (84 units), which are now reaching the 8-9 period mark without arrival, suggesting they may be lost shipments similar to P2 and P6 earlier in the game. To compensate for potentially lost pipeline inventory and meet the high demand regime, I will set mu_hat using the recent 12 periods (P26-P37) to capture the current high-demand average (~112 units/period) and maintain L=3. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high demand over the full replacement cycle.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 26, averaging approximately 114 units per period (P26-P38). Most recently, demand has centered around 100-110. Lead times continue to be volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a historical mode of 3. Crucially, internal system data shows 435 units 'in-transit', despite only 131+84+0+34+2+3=254 units being ordered between Periods 29-38. This indicates a massive pipeline inventory (likely from the Period 29 order of 131 units and Period 30 order of 84 units) that is significantly overdue, given the promised lead time of 2 and maximum observed of 3. Because on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is extremely high (435 units vs a 3-period demand of ~342), the OR backend's capped policy will likely prevent further ordering. I will set L=3 to remain conservative against shipping delays and use recent_N=13 for mu_hat to capture the stable demand since the Period 26 shift (P26-P38).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 113 units per period (P26-P39). Although there was a slight decrease in P36 (67), it quickly recovered to over 100 in recent periods (P38: 108, P39: 126). I will use recent_N with N=14 to capture this current regime (P26-P39). Lead time remains erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P38 arrived in 1, P34/P35 in 2, earlier ones in 3). Several large orders (notably from Period 29: 131 units and Period 30: 84 units) are significantly delayed or potentially lost, as they are now 10+ periods late. To account for this lead time uncertainty and to ensure the backend targets a sufficient base stock for the (L+1) horizon, I will set L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) using the explicit method. This conservative approach is necessary because on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we must rely on the incoming pipeline to satisfy current demand.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 114-119 units per period. The most recent demand (P40: 124, P39: 126, P38: 108) confirms this level continues and remains high. Lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a conservative inventory target. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 440 units in-transit. The OR backend uses a capped policy based on the base stock minus pipeline inventory. Given that the pipeline (440) is significantly higher than the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (approx 120 * 4 = 480), the OR controller will likely place a small or zero order. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent high demand (N=15 covers the period since the last major shift) and set L=3 to ensure the system accounts for the potential 3-period delay observed in history.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 26, averaging approximately 111 units/period (P26-P41). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and while in-transit inventory is high (443 units), the pipeline is likely inflated by lost or significantly delayed shipments (like the P29 order of 131 units which is now 12 periods overdue). Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, so I will continue to use an explicit L=3 to remain conservative against stockouts. I will use recent_N (N=16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the statistics of the current demand regime (P26-P41) while filtering out the previous low-demand period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 119 units per period since Period 26, though recent periods show some fluctuation (e.g., 78 in P41). Since Period 43 is nearing the game's end (P50), managing the massive in-transit pipeline of 443 units is the priority. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The actual lead time has been fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with recent observations of 1 and 2 periods. Setting L to 2 (the promised lead time) remains the most balanced approach. For demand forecasting, I am using recent_N with N=17 to capture the stable period from P26 to P42. Given the large in-transit balance (approximately 3.7 times the average demand), the OR backend's capped policy will likely yield small or zero orders, which is desirable to avoid excessive ending inventory costs as we approach Period 50.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 435 units in-transit. Historically, multiple large orders from the earlier 'high-demand' regime (like the 131 units from P29 and 84 units from P30) have not concluded despite the lead time typically being 1-3 periods. Because these orders (placed >10 periods ago) are likely lost, the 'In-transit' figure of 435 is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory. Demand has been stable around ~100-110 units since Period 36, though it fluctuated higher earlier (P26-P35 avg ~119). I will set L to 3 to be conservative given the history of 3-period lags. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=18 (covering Period 26 onwards) to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing recent volatility. Since the pipeline inventory is perceived as 435 but much is lost, the OR backend's capped policy might prevent ordering; however, settings L=3 and a robust mu_hat based on the current regime ensures the base stock level remains high enough to trigger replenishment once 'clogged' logic clears or if actual arrivals occur.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged missing shipments: Orders from Period 29 (131 units) and Period 30 (84 units) are confirmed lost/overdue after 14+ periods. Pipeline inventory (435) is significantly inflated by these non-arriving units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at an average of approximately 110-120 units, despite a slight softening in the last three periods (P42-44). Lead times for recently arrived orders (P34, P35, P38, P40, P41) fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, confirming the continued instability noted in carry-over insights. A critical issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 432 units, which is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Period 29 (131 units) and Period 30 (84 units), totaling 215 phantom units. To compensate for these non-arriving units and low on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat using the last 15 periods to reflect the current high-demand regime (~106 avg), and use 'explicit' for L=3 to remain conservative against lead-time volatility. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat allowing for a manual override to bypass the backend's faulty pipeline calculation (which includes lost orders) by setting a base stock target high enough to trigger an order despite the 432 in-transit units. Given the game is ending in 5 periods (P50), I need enough stock now to satisfy the remaining demand.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory correction: 215 units from Period 29 and 30 are confirmed lost and no longer expected to arrive, despite appearing in 'In-transit'.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46. The demand regime starting around Period 26 is stable with a mean of approximately 105-110 units, although there is considerable variance. The pipeline inventory is heavily distorted by lost shipments from Period 29 (131 units) and Period 30 (84 units). As identified in Period 45, these 215 units are confirmed lost and will never arrive, but they remain in the system's 'In-transit' count (637). To correct for this, I must set parameters that effectively ignore these phantom units. The actual effective pipeline is 637 - 215 = 422 units. Lead time is highly variable, ranging between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue to assume an explicit L of 3 to ensure the inventory level covers the longest likely delay. Since the system calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline', I use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a targeted inventory level that accounts for the phantom 'In-transit' units. Target levels are based on (1+L) * mean demand (approx 110) plus a safety buffer, adjusted upwards by the 215 lost units to force the OR engine to place an order.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is stable at an average of approximately 110 units. Recent periods (P43-P46) show slightly lower demand, but given we are at on-hand 0, maintaining a stock level for the ~110 average is necessary to avoid stockouts. Lead time persists between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue using L=3 for conservative planning (explicit value 3). pipeline_inventory is 655 units, but 215 units from P29 and P30 were previously confirmed lost, and several other small recent orders are theoretically in-transit. The OR backend uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to order. To ensure the backend doesn't significantly under-order due to the phantom 'In-transit' units, I set mu_hat using the recent 21 periods (P26-P46) to capture the higher demand regime, and sigma_hat similarly to cover the volatility.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains stable in the high-demand regime established at Period 26 (avg ~110-120). Recent demand (P45-P47) is consistently strong (130, 97, 122). Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with a history of lost shipments (most notably the P29 and P30 orders). In Period 45, I placed a large order (205 units) to recover from the pipeline correction where lost units were removed; this order is expected to arrive between Period 46 and Period 48. Since current on-hand is 0 and we are in Period 48, I expect a large arrival during this period's resolution (either from P45 or P46). I set L=3 as a conservative measure due to the historical volatility and the risk of empty shelves. For demand forecasting, I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current regime's mean (starting from Period 26) and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. Analysis of demand shows a stable regime since Period 26, averaging approximately 104 units per period (N=23). Recent demand (P45-P48) has averaged 107 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=23) to capture this stable regime. Performance is currently hampered by lost shipments and lead time volatility. Historically, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 3 to be conservative and ensure the pipeline covers the longest likely duration. The 'In-transit' figure of 655 units is significantly inflated by lost shipments (P29, P30, and likely others from the P31-P44 gap where only 11 units arrived despite much higher placement). Although Carry-over Period 45 notes a partial correction, the current 655 still feels unrealistically high given the consistent '0' starting on-hand inventory. Setting L=3 and a corresponding mu_hat allows the base-stock logic to attempt to refill the pipe, while the OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent excessive over-ordering if the system still thinks those units might arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Pipeline inventory remains heavily inflated by unreceived orders from Periods 29-44. Despite 655 units 'in-transit', stockouts have been continuous since Period 45.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a chronic stockout state (on-hand: 0) despite a high 'In-transit' figure of 655 units. My previous analysis from Period 44 and 45 confirms that at least 215 units from Periods 29-30 are lost. Since Period 45, new orders (P45: 205, P46: 18) were placed but haven't arrived yet. Given the observed lead time fluctuation (1-3 periods), the P45 order is now at the 5th period of its lifecycle (P45, P46, P47, P48, P49) and has not arrived, suggesting further shipment instability or loss. Demand remains stable in the ~110-120 range (P26-P49). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I will use 'explicit' values for L and mu_hat. I am setting L=3 based on the conservative historical maximum, and mu_hat to 480 (calculated as 120 demand * (1 + 3) periods) to ensure the target base stock is high enough to trigger new procurement while accounting for the likely loss of the 655 units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Continued non-arrival of Period 45 (205 units) after 5 periods strongly suggests either further severe lead time extension or additional lost shipments, causing total stockout since Period 45.
