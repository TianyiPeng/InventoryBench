Historical demand over the first 5 periods averaged ~99.8 units (118, 130, 72, 58, 121), with significant volatility (high of 130, low of 58). The promised lead time is 2 periods. To maximize reward, I need enough stock to cover demand until an order placed now arrives. Following the (L+1) rule, I need to cover Periods 1, 2, and 3. Average demand for 3 periods is approximately 300 units. Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I must place an order immediately. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and moderate profit margin ($1.0), I will aim to cover the expected mean demand with a small buffer for the initial high demand seen in early periods (118, 130). I will order 320 units to ensure I don't lose sales in the first three periods while observing actual lead time and demand patterns.",

Orders from P44 (110 units), P45 (40 units), P46 (40 units), P47 (40 units), and P48 (60 units) are in-transit. Based on a 2-3 period lead time, P44 and possibly P45 should arrive in Period 49 to satisfy Period 49 demand. Because Period 50 is the final period, any order placed now (P49) would only arrive in Period 50 or 51. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), and the game ends after Period 50, placing a large order now is risky if it arrives and stays as ending inventory in Period 50. However, if the current pipeline (P44-P48) is insufficient for Period 50 demand, a small safety order is justified. Pipeline analysis: P44(110) + P45(40) + P46(40) + P47(40) + P48(60) = 290 units. Demand for P49 + P50 is approx 220 units. The pipeline of 290 units is likely enough to cover the remaining two periods, provided they arrive.
