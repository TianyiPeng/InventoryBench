The shipment from Period 2 (147 units) has not arrived after 7 periods and is confirmed lost. 2. Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P4-P9) averages 105.1 units, significantly higher than the initial history. Period 9 saw a spike to 141 units. 3. Inventory Position: Currently 0 on-hand. In-transit consists of P6 (94 units) and P9 (100 units). P6 is likely arriving this period (Period 10) if lead time is 3 or 4. 4. OR Recommendation: OR suggests 27 units based on promised L=2 and likely utilizing all historical samples. However, with the lost P2 shipment and high recent demand, the pipeline is thinner than simple subtraction suggests. Pipeline (excluding lost P2) = 341 - 147 = 194. Targets: We need to cover demand for (L+1) periods. Using L=2 (actual varies, but 2 is the average/promise), we need ~315 units (105 * 3). Current reliable pipeline is 194. Gap = 121.

The current effective pipeline of 304 units covers approximately 3 periods of demand (304 / 104 \u2248 2.9). 4.

Effective total coverage = 143 units. 3. Demand Analysis: Demand has dropped significantly. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is 51.8 units. The OR baseline recommends 0 because it likely sees the high 'In-transit' number as sufficient coverage for this lower demand regime. 4. Decision: With ~143 units effective stock and an average demand of ~52, we have approximately 2.7 periods of coverage. Given the lead time variability and the risk of further lost shipments, the current coverage is actually quite lean for a (L+1) horizon.

These are the orders from P44 (120), P45 (100), P46 (100), and P47 (120), which totals 440 units actually. Wait, let's re-sum: P44(120)+P45(100)+P46(100)+P47(120) = 440. Total In-transit (1466) - Recent Orders (440) = 1026 units lost. My previous 'lost' count was slightly off, but the logic holds: only orders from P44 onwards are likely to arrive. \n4. **Demand & OR**: OR recommends 0 because it sees 1466 in transit.
