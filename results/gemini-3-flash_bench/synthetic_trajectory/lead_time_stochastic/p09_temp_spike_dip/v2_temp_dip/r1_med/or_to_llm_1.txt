Given that current on-hand inventory is 0 and there is nothing in-transit, we need to establish the pipeline immediately. While 154 covers the OR's calculated safety level, the initial demand (118, 130) samples are higher than the more recent ones (72, 58).

There is a slight downward trend compared to initial samples, but volatility is high. 4.

However, given the lead-time instability and the fact that we have no orders placed in Period 4, a small buffer is wise.

The OR recommendation is 0 because the pipeline (even with losses) covers this low demand regime.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: If P15 is lost, the pipeline drops to 165 units.

As of Period 44 conclude, the total lost stock in-transit is calculated at 1,054 units (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 24, 25, 29, 30, 33, and 37). The current total 'In-transit' of 1,504 units includes these 1,054 units of dead stock, meaning the functional pipeline consists only of: P40 (250, arrived), P41 (150, arrived), P42 (150), P43 (150), and P44 (150). Total functional pipeline = 450 units. While the OR recommendation is 0, it likely overestimates the utility of the massive, mostly lost, in-transit figure. Current on-hand inventory is 277 units. Recent demand has cooled from ~120 units to ~60-70 units per period over the last 3 periods. With 277 on-hand and 450 functional units in transit (excluding orders already confirmed arrived), we have 727 units to cover the remaining 5 periods. At a high estimate of 100 units/period, we need 500 units. Our current coverage is sufficient despite the high failure rate.

Given the transition to a more moderate demand regime (averaging ~65-70 despite the Period 45 spike), this stock will likely cover roughly 6 periods of demand. Pipeline Analysis: The 'In-transit' total of 1254 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments. Cumulative lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P24, P25, P26, P29, P30, P33, P37) total 1054 units. Therefore, the functional pipeline consists only of the Period 44 (150 units) and Period 45 (50 units) orders, totaling 200 functional units.

Orders placed now (P48) would arrive in Period 50 (P48+2). However, given the extreme historical unreliability of the supplier (approx. 60% failure rate) and the fact that we already have 228 units on-hand, we only need about 72 more units to satisfy the forecast for the remainder of the game. Total in-transit inventory is 1,254, but at least 1,054 units are confirmed lost. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P44 (150 units) and P45 (50 units). Even if these do not arrive, we have enough stock on-hand to cover roughly 2.3 periods of demand.\n\nStrategy: The OR recommendation is 0 units. Since we are in the final stages (Period 48 of 50) and have sufficient on-hand inventory (228) to cover nearly all remaining expected demand, placing more orders would risk high holding costs or units arriving after the game ends.
