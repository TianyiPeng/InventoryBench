The product is 'chips(Regular)', and looking at the provided historical demand for the first 5 periods (118, 130, 72, 58, 121), the average demand is approximately 100 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To maximize reward, I need to cover demand for the lead time duration plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods). Since arrivals for an order placed now (Period 1) will land in Period 3 (L=2), and I currently have 0 units on hand or in transit, I must order enough to cover the expected demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3.

Current pipeline is 300 units, which covers roughly 3 periods of average demand (~300 units).

This is a sharp drop from the previous average of ~100. (c) Lead Time: Recent history shows lead times of 3 periods (P11, 12, 13, 14) and 1 period (P16). The promised lead time is 2, but actual volatility fluctuates between 1 and 3. I will plan for a 3-period lead time to ensure coverage. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 114.

Recent arrivals (P38 arrived in 1 period, P39 arrived in 1 period) show that when shipments do arrive, they arrive quickly (1-2 periods), while late shipments (like P40 and P41, now at 3 and 2 periods respectively) have a high probability of never arriving at all based on the historical pattern. As of P43 START, on-hand inventory is 0. Reliable in-transit pipeline: P40 (120), P41 (120), and P42 (120).
