Historically (based on the sample data provided), the average demand is approximately 100 units (samples: 118, 130, 72, 58, 121; Mean=99.8). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the logic of covering (L+1) = 3 periods of demand to avoid stockouts while arrivals are in flight, I need to account for approximately 300 units of demand. Since on-hand inventory and in-transit units are currently 0, I will place an initial order to cover this pipeline. I will aim for a slightly higher safety stock (350 units) given the initial 0-stock position and the variability observed in the historical data (SD ~33).",

Historical demand for the first 5 periods was [118, 130, 72, 58, 121], averaging roughly 100 units per period. I need to ensure that the total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) covers the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods). 3 periods of demand at ~100 units/period equals 300 units. Since I already have 350 units in transit, I am sufficiently covered for the immediate arrival window. I will place a small order of 50 units to maintain a buffer and account for the high demand seen in early samples (P1 actual demand was 114, slightly above the historical mean), ensuring I don't stock out immediately after the first shipment arrives.",

Sample history data provided suggests higher volatility (Period 1-5: 118, 130, 72, 58, 121), but recent game history shows steady demand around 110. c) Lead time: Promised is 2. The order placed in Period 1 (350 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0. Per the game rules, an order placed in N with lead time 2 arrives in N+2 (Period 3) and is visible in the Period 4 start message. The 'Period 3 conclude' message is exactly what I read at the start of Period 4. It shows arrived=0, meaning the Period 1 order (L=2) has NOT arrived yet.

The average demand is approximately 112 units per period. c) Lead Time Assessment: The promised lead time is 2. Arrival data shows P1 (ordered 350) arrived in P4 (LT=3) and P3 (ordered 80) arrived in P4 (LT=1). P2 (ordered 50) is still missing and appears delayed or lost. This indicates lead time variability. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 324. In-transit consists of P2 (50 units) and P4 (30 units). Given average demand (~112), the current stock covers nearly 3 periods (324 / 112 = 2.89). We need to cover (L+1) periods, where L=2 (promised), so 3 periods. Target inventory = 112 * 3 = ~336 units. e) Final Order Logic: Current inventory (324) + in-transit (80) = 404 units. This is currently above the target for the next 3 periods. However, given the lost/delayed shipment in P2 and potential LT variability, I will place a small order to maintain the pipeline without incurring excessive holding costs.
