Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available (118, 153, 211, 153, 155), showing an average of 158 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 2), and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the initial demand profile. This will calculate mu_hat as (1+2) * 158 = 474 units, ensuring we order enough to meet demand until the first shipment arrives.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 213 units. Since the promised lead time is 2, we expect this order to arrive in Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as the Period 1 demand (138) could not be met. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including current data point 138) shows values from 118 to 211. Due to the inventory stockout, the priority is establishing a base stock that covers the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (Review+Lead = 3 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the initial surge seen in historical data (P1-P5) while moving toward a steady state.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, the order placed in Period 1 (213 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 422 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Historical demand for the first two periods was 138 and 121, while the pre-game samples showed a mean of ~158. Period 1 and 2 demand were slightly lower than the initial samples, but with only 5 pre-game points and 2 history points, there is no sustained regime shift yet. I will use the 'default' methods to allow the backend to use all available historical data (7 samples total) to estimate the mean and volatility, and stick to the promised lead time of 2 as no arrivals have been confirmed yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 should have arrived during Period 3 and been visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0', which indicates the order from Period 1 is delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. Given the high demand (mean ~130-150 based on provided samples) and current zero on-hand inventory, there is a significant stockout. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 495, which covers approximately 3.3 periods of average demand. I will set the lead time to 3 to account for the observed delay and use the last 5 samples (including the user-provided historical data) to estimate demand. Since the historical mean is roughly 158 units per period, and we are currently seeing slightly lower demand in the first three periods (~124), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most relevant trend while ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) horizon.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 118, 153, 211, 153, 155. The mean demand is approximately 158. In Period 4, we received shipments from Period 1 (lead time 3) and Period 3 (lead time 1). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variability (1 and 3 periods). My pipeline inventory is 290 units (from Period 2, 4, and 5 orders). Using all 5 demand samples (default or all samples) gives a stable mean of ~158. Since the lead time average (3+1)/2 = 2, using the 'calculate' method for L is appropriate. For demand, the last 4 periods (excluding the first outlier or considering the cluster) are relatively stable. I'll use N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full recent history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $498.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the last 5 periods has been [118, 153, 211, 153, 155], with an average around 158 units. However, looking at the lead time history, we see significant variability: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods (Period 4), while Period 3's order arrived in 1 period (Period 4). The promised lead time is 2. Currently, we have 70 units on-hand and 321 in-transit (orders from Period 2, 4, and 5). Note that Period 2's order (209 units) is now overdue (3 periods passed), suggesting potential transit delays or a higher actual lead time. I will maintain a lead time estimate of 2 but use all 5 demand samples to calculate my mean demand, as there's no clear regime shift yet. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using all available samples (N=5) to ensure we cover the risk associated with the lead time uncertainty and the recent jump in demand observed in Period 3.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0 after selling out last period. Total in-transit is 323 units (orders from P2: 209, P4: 81, P5: 31, P6: 2). Reviewing the lead time history: P1 order arrived in 3 periods, P3 order arrived in 1 period. This suggests high variance and potential batching or carrier inconsistency compared to the promised 2 periods. The current in-transit backlog from P2 (209 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods since order). I will use L=explicit with value 2 to reflect the promised expectation, but keep stock targets robust. For demand, historical samples (118, 153, 211, 153, 155 from user prompt; 138, 121, 113, 74, 142, 157 from context) show a mean around 130-140. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent volatility (e.g., P6 demand spike to 157) while calculating targets over (1+L) periods.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with 330 units in-transit. Looking at the arrival history: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 in 1 period, and Period 4 in 3 periods. The arithmetic mean of observed lead times is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. This suggests lead time is volatile and potentially longer than the promised 2 periods. Demand has been relatively stable but consistently exceeds on-hand supply, leading to stockouts in P6 and P7. Average demand over all samples (P1-P7) is 125.2. Using L=2.33, the target mu_hat should cover (1+2.33) * 125.2 = 417. Since we are out of stock and have missed sales, I will use 'explicit' for L to account for the observed average delay, and 'default' for mu/sigma to leverage the full history which is stable.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is unstable (avg 2.33, range 1-3). Demand mean is consistent around 125 units per period.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 395 in-transit. Demand has been fairly stable, though it peaked at 184 in Period 8. The mean demand across all observed periods (including training data) is approx 139 units/period. Over the last 4 periods, mean demand is 153.75. Lead times are highly variable: observations of 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 demonstrate that 'average' lead time (approx 2.2) mask the risk of stockouts during 3-period lags. I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longest observed delay, preventing further stockouts. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the slightly higher demand seen in the game history compared to initial samples, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods; setting L=3 is necessary for safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $511.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 45 units. Looking at the history, demand has averaged approximately 133 units across the last 9 periods (141 units over the last 5). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P7: 1, P8: 1). To prevent stockouts, I am setting L to 3 (the observed maximum), which forces the backend to calculate base stock for (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. I will use the mean of the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the slightly higher recent demand trend (~150 units/period) and adjust sigma to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: Actual lead times vary significantly between 1 and 3 periods (range 1-3). Demand mean is stabilizing ~140 units over the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing a stockout situation because the order from Period 9 (186 units), which was expected to arrive between Period 10 (L=1) and Period 12 (L=3), has not arrived yet. Looking at historical arrivals, lead times oscillate wildly between 1 and 3 periods (P1 took 3, P3 took 1, P4 took 3, P5 took 3, P7 took 1, P8 took 1). Because there is a heavy risk of orders arriving late (L=3), setting the parameters to cover a 3-period lead time is crucial. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is approximately 129.4 units. I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the maximum observed lead time. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility (which includes a spike of 184 in P8 and a dip to 85 in P10).

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly unpredictable (bimodal distribution of 1 or 3 periods). Significant stockout risk persists due to this lead time variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12. The system reports on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 619 units in-transit. Comparing this to the game history, we are missing arrivals from Period 2 (ordered 209), Period 6 (ordered 2), Period 9 (ordered 186), Period 10 (ordered 185), and Period 11 (ordered 37). The Period 2 order is now 10 periods past due, suggesting it is lost. The lead time is extremely volatile, showing a bimodal distribution of 1 or 3 periods (e.g., P8 ordered 184 and arrived in P9, while P4 arrived in P7). Since we have 619 units in pipeline but 0 on-hand, we must assume some orders are lost or significantly delayed. To stabilize safety stock, I am setting L=3 (the observed upper bound). Demand mean has slightly increased, with the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaging 132.8 units. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent increase and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for recent demand volatility (~37).

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Order from Period 2 (209 units) is confirmed lost (10 periods elapsed). Pipeline inventory of 619 is inflated by this loss; actual usable pipeline is closer to 410 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the supply chain remains volatile. We have confirmed a lost shipment from Period 2 (209 units), meaning the effective 'In-transit' is 39 units (248 units minus the assumed-lost 209). Historically, actual lead times rotate between 1, 2, and 3 periods without a clear trend toward the promised 2. To avoid stockouts given this variance and the lost shipment, I am setting L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer risk horizon. Since Period 6, demand has been fairly stable but slightly higher than the start; I will use N=7 for mu_hat to capture the recent mean of approximately 134 units across the 1+L period. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to reflect the recent demand volatility (std ~34), which helps the OR engine maintain a sufficient safety buffer against both demand spikes and lead-time delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Confirmed pipeline adjustment; Period 2 order (209 units) is lost, reducing effective 'In-transit' from 248 to 39. Actual lead times continue to range between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 173 and reported in-transit is 314. However, historical evidence from previous periods (Carry-over Insight Period 12 and 13) confirms that the order for 209 units from Period 2 is lost. Therefore, the effective usable pipeline is 314 - 209 = 105 units. Lead times are highly variable, ranging between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue to use an explicit lead time L=3 to ensure sufficient safety cover. Average demand over the last 10 periods (P4-P13) is approximately 112.6 units. Given the recent stockout events and the variability in lead times, I will set mu_hat for the (L+1) window (4 periods) slightly higher than the historical average to buffer against lead time uncertainty, settling on an explicit mu_hat of 500 (125 * 4). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Usable pipeline confirmed: Reported in-transit (314) includes 209 lost units from P2; effective in-transit is 105 units.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we have 136 units on-hand. The recorded 'In-transit' of 349 includes the 209-unit order from Period 2, which is long lost (effectively reducing usable in-transit to 140 units, from orders in P13 and P14). Lead times are highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average observed: 2.2). Recent demand (last 5 periods) has stabilized lower than the early periods, averaging approximately 94 units per period. To prevent stockouts caused by lead time uncertainty, I'm setting an explicit L=3 to ensure the OR engine calculates a base stock covering the maximum likely delay. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (covering periods 10-14) to reflect the recent lower demand trend (mean ~94), while sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 44 units on hand. The system reports 349 units in-transit, but based on historical tracking (Carry-over insights), the order of 209 units from Period 2 is lost. Therefore, the effective usable pipeline is 140 units (349 - 209). This means the 'In-transit' figure known to the OR backend (349) is significantly overstated, which would cause it to under-order or not order at all. To correct for this, I must set the mu_hat explicitly higher to force the base stock level above the inflated pipeline. Lead times observed range from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.2); I will use an explicit L=3 to ensure a higher safety stock given the volatility and previous stockouts. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has averaged ~90 units/period (93, 74, 92, 105, 114). A standard target for (1+L)=4 periods would be ~360 units. However, because the backend subtracts the phantom 209 units from the base stock, I will set mu_hat to approximately 570 (360 + 210) to ensure the engine places an order to maintain service levels. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the current demand volatility.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are managing a situation where the reported 'In-transit' quantity of 451 includes a confirmed lost shipment of 209 units from Period 2. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 242 units (451 - 209). Adding the 30 units on-hand, the total usable inventory is 272 units. Demand has stabilized recently; the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P7-P16) is approximately 110 units. Observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, so I will set L=3 as an 'explicit' value to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the maximum realistic delay, providing a safety buffer against stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime. Setting L to 3 (effectively 4 periods of protection including the current one) with a mean demand of ~110 suggests a base stock around 440-500. With 272 units of effective inventory, the backend should place an order to bridge this gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Effective pipeline inventory remains 209 units lower than reported due to the lost P2 shipment. Recent 10-period demand mean is ~110 units, lower than the initial periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 189 units. The reported in-transit inventory is 227 units, which includes 209 units from the Period 2 order that has been confirmed lost (now 16 periods since placement). Therefore, the effective usable pipeline is only 18 units (227 - 209). Lead times remain volatile, ranging between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode of 3. I will set L to 3 to provide adequate safety stock for the backend calculation. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean than the initial periods; the last 10 periods (P8-P17) show an average demand of approximately 109 units. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current demand regime. Setting L to 3 and using 'recent_N' for demand ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the maximum observed lead time and the current lower demand level while discounting the phantom lost inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $231.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 105. The reported in-transit is 287 units, but this includes a 209-unit order from Period 2 that is confirmed lost (17 periods elapsed). Therefore, the effective usable pipeline is 287 - 209 = 78 units (consisting of the Period 17 order of 16 units and the Period 18 order of 60 units, plus any residual variance). This gives an effective total position of 105 + 78 = 183 units. Demand has shifted downwards; the average of the last 10 periods (P9-P18) is approximately 105 units. To compensate for the lost shipment inflating the OR engine's pipeline view, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I target a base stock level that covers 3 periods of demand (L=2 + 1 current) plus safety. Calculating 3 periods * 105 mean = 315, plus safety stock. To force the OR backend to order the gap (~130 units), I set mu_hat to 400 (which is approximately (1+2)*133). Using 'calculate' for L as the average lead time (approx 2.4) is sufficient given the explicit buffer in mu_hat.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the current on-hand inventory is 67. The reported 'In-transit' of 327 includes the shipment from Period 2 (209 units), which is confirmed lost after 18 periods. Thus, the effective pipeline is 327 - 209 = 118 units. To compensate for this phantom inventory in the OR engine's capped policy calculation (Final Order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)), I must adjust mu_hat or L to ensure the 'base_stock' target accounts for the deficit. Historically, lead times are highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.33). I will use L=3 to protect against the high side of this range. Demand has cooled significantly over the last 10 periods, averaging approximately 93 units (down from ~130 earlier). Therefore, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect this current demand regime and L=3. To specifically counteract the 209-unit loss being counted in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value: (1+L) * Mean_Demand + Lost_Units. Calculation: (1+3) * 93 + 209 = 372 + 209 = 581. This ensures the OR engine places a large enough order to bridge the gap created by the lost Period 2 stock.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 506 units. Historically, we confirmed that the order from Period 2 (209 units) is lost, as it has not arrived after 19 periods. Subtracting this from the reported pipeline (506 - 209) gives an effective pipeline of 297 units. Period 20 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout (sold 67 of 82 demand). Lead times are highly variable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Average: 2.2). To protect against this volatility and the current stockout, I am setting L explicitly to 3 to ensure the OR backend calculates a base stock level that covers 4 periods of demand (L+1). Demand has seen a slight downward trend over the last 10 periods; therefore, I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower mean (~89 units/period) and its associated volatility. This strategy aims to replenish inventory quickly while acknowledging the lost units and unpredictable delivery schedule.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Reported In-transit (506) continues to include the lost Period 2 shipment (209 units); the effective usable pipeline is 297 units. Demand Mean for the last 10 periods has stabilized at approximately 89 units, lower than the game-start average.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 506 units and 0 'On-hand' inventory. However, historical evidence from Period 12 onwards confirms that the Period 2 order of 209 units is lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 297 units (506 - 209). At the start of Period 22, we are in a stockout (Ending On-hand in P21 was 0). Orders from P18 (60 units), P19 (40 units), and P20 (179 units) are still within the observed lead time window (1-3 periods) and are expected shortly. Lead time is highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, so I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to ensure the inventory target covers the maximum expected delay. Demand has trended downwards from an initial ~130 to a more stable ~88 over the last 10 periods (P12-P21 average is 80.5, P1-P11 average was 127). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand regime while providing protection against stockouts.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 23 and experiencing a stockout (On-hand: 0). The reported In-transit of 506 includes the lost Period 2 order (209 units), which never arrived after 21 periods. Thus, the effective usable pipeline is 297 units (506 - 209). This effective pipeline includes orders from Period 18 (60 units), Period 19 (40 units), and Period 20 (179 units). Given that the maximum observed lead time is 3 periods, the Period 18 order is now overdue (5 periods since ordering), suggesting it might also be lost, but I will remain cautious one more period. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean; the average of the last 10 periods (P13-P22) is approximately 76.7 units. To account for the stockout and the lost Period 2 shipment, I am using L=3 (to capture the upper range of variability) and mu_hat = (1+L) * 76.7 \u2248 306.8. I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to provide a slightly higher safety buffer due to the recent volatility and stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Continued stockout. Effectively, the usable pipeline is 297 units (Reported 506 minus lost P2 order of 209). Order from Period 18 (60 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost or significantly delayed.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the available on-hand inventory is 124 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 327 reflects two key discrepancies confirmed in history: the lost Period 2 order (209 units) and the now likely lost Period 18 order (60 units, 6 periods ago). This leaves an effective usable pipeline of 58 units (orders from P19 and P17 appear to have arrived based on the P23 conclude). Demand has significantly cooled; the average for the most recent 10 periods (P14-P23) is 72.8 units, compared to much higher initial demand. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, but skewed toward 3. To prevent over-ordering due to 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I am setting \u03bc\u0302 explicitly to cover the effective lead cycle (L+1=4) based on the lower demand regime (~73 * 4 \u2248 292). L is set to explicit 3 to account for the high variance and ensure the engine uses a 4-period horizon for safety stock calculation. \u03c3\u0302 is maintained near the recent standard deviation to handle variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Confirmed second lost/severely delayed order from Period 18 (60 units). Cumulative lost pipeline: 269 units (Period 2: 209, Period 18: 60). Effective in-transit is 58 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The reported 'In-transit' of 327 includes two confirmed lost shipments: Period 2 (209 units) and Period 18 (60 units). The effective usable pipeline is therefore 327 - 269 = 58 units. On-hand inventory is critically low at 17 units. Recent demand over the last 10 periods (P15-P24) averages approximately 83 units, showing a downward trend from the initial 120+ range. To prevent further stockouts, I must account for the lost inventory. By setting L to 'explicit' at 3, I am directing the backend to use the maximum observed lead time for safety. I am using mu_hat 'explicit' to calculate (1+L)*mean_demand, but adjusted to offset the 269 phantom units currently in the pipeline. Specifically, the base stock targets approx 332 units ((1+3)*83). With 17 on hand and an effective pipeline of 58, the engine would normally order ~257. However, because the backend 'thinks' there are 327 in transit, I must inflate the mu_hat to ensure the actual order is placed. To override the 269 unit phantom inventory, I set mu_hat explicitly high: (1+3)*83 + 269 = 601.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory: 269 units (P2: 209, P18: 60). Effective in-transit as of P25 is 58 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). Reported in-transit is 509 units, but this includes two confirmed lost shipments: Period 2 (209 units) and Period 18 (60 units), totaling 269 units of 'ghost' inventory. Thus, the effective usable pipeline is 240 units (509 - 269). The order placed in Period 25 (182 units) is part of this effective pipeline and is expected to arrive between Periods 26-28 based on the observed lead time variance (1-3 periods). Recent demand (last 10 periods) has stabilized lower than the initial average, around 75 units per period. I will set mu_hat to cover 4 periods (L=3 + 1) at this lower rate. By using an explicit L=4 for the mu_hat calculation (since mu_hat = (1+L)*mean), I ensure the base stock accounts for the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods plus the current period's demand. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to manually account for the lost shipments that the OR backend cannot see.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Cumulative lost pipeline remains 269 units (P2: 209, P18: 60). Effective in-transit is 240 units. Recent demand mean is ~75 units (10-period avg).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 'In-transit' of 509 units, but this includes two confirmed lost shipments: P2 (209 units) and P18 (60 units), totaling 269 phantom units. The true effective pipeline is 240 units (which matches the sum of orders from P25 [182 units] and P19 [40 units] and P20 [179 already arrived, wait... checking P20: arrived P23. Correcting calculation: In-transit is P19 (40) + P25 (182) + P27's order calculation. Wait, reported 509 - 269 lost = 240 units truly in transit. These are likely the P19 (40), P25 (182), and something else? No, 509 - 209 (P2) - 60 (P18) = 240. The 240 units are the remaining open orders). Demand has been volatile but averaging ~75 units over the last 10 periods (10-period mean is 79, recent 5-period mean is 91). L is set to explicit 3 to account for the frequently observed maximum lead time and provide a safety buffer against the high variance and lost shipments. mu_hat is set to explicit 360 (approx 90 units/period * (3+1) periods) to ensure we cover the lead time + current period demand, accounting for the frequent stockouts.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 509 units. However, historical performance confirms that the order from Period 2 (209 units) and likely the order from Period 18 (60 units) are lost, totaling 269 units of 'phantom' inventory. Therefore, the effective usable pipeline is 509 - 269 = 240 units. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to recent stockouts. Demand has stabilized but shown recent volatility, with a 10-period average around 88 units and a 5-period average around 99 units. Given the lead time variability (range 1-3 periods), I am setting L to 3 to ensure the safety stock covers the worst-case lead time scenario. I will use the recent_N method (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand regime while smoothing out the Period 26 spike, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for recent volume volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Effective in-transit is 240 units (Reported 509 minus lost P2 [209] and P18 [60] shipments). Demand mean is approximately 95-100 units over the last 7 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 509 units in transit, but historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 2 (209 units) and Period 18 (60 units) are lost, totaling 269 units of 'phantom' inventory. The effective usable pipeline is 240 units (509 - 269). Demand has shown a recent uptick, with an average of approximately 132 units over the last 3 periods (P26-P28), compared to a lower 75-unit average earlier in the month. On-hand inventory is currently at 0, and we are experiencing consecutive stockouts. With a reported In-transit of 509 units and the OR backend's formula (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), the backend will perceive a significant surplus and likely place an order of 0 unless parameters are adjusted. To force an order and bridge the stockout gap while accounting for the lost units, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an 'explicit' method. I am estimating L=3 based on the historical upper bound of the lead-time distribution. My mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * 115 (a conservative forecast combining recent spikes and the overall mean) = 460. This value, combined with a robust sigma_hat, is designed to ensure the base_stock calculation exceeds the inflated in-transit figure enough to trigger a necessary replenishment order.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The reported 'In-transit' of 532 units includes two confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (209 units) and Period 18 (60 units), totaling 269 phantom units. Therefore, the effective usable pipeline inventory is only 263 units (532 - 269). Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue to use L=3 to account for the upper bound of delivery variability. Recent demand has shown a significant uptick over the last 5 periods (mean ~130), contrasting with the lower levels observed in Periods 19-24. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike and prevent further lost sales once arrivals resume. Setting a high N for mu_hat ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current demand regime and the 3-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 25: 5-period mean increased to ~130 units from a previous 5-period mean of ~80 units. Effective usable pipeline remains 269 units lower than reported (Lost: P2 209, P18 60).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 576 units in-transit. However, based on the history and previous carry-over insights, the orders from Period 2 (209 units) and Period 18 (60 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 269 units of 'phantom' inventory. Subtracting these from the reported 576 units results in an effective usable in-transit (pipeline) of 307 units. Recent demand has also shifted; since Period 25, demand has averaged ~135 units per period (139, 105, 152, 166, 115), compared to the prior lower regime. Lead times remain unstable, frequently hitting 3 periods. To account for the current stockout and the new demand level, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' for the last 6 periods (including the current high-demand phase) and adjusting L to 3 to ensure the safety stock calculation covers the maximum observed lead time. Using an explicit mu_hat would be roughly 4 periods (L+1) * 135 = 540; the 'recent_N' method with N=6 will approximate this demand shift effectively for the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 25: 6-period mean increased to ~130 units. Effective usable pipeline is 269 units lower than reported due to lost shipments from P2 and P18.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe inventory shortage due to a string of lost or delayed shipments and a recent demand regime shift. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 576 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments: Period 2 (209 units) and Period 18 (60 units), totaling 269 units. This leaves an effective usable pipeline of 307 units. Recent demand (last 6 periods) has stabilized around an average of 133 units, up from the previous average of ~80. The lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.5). To restore service levels following the demand spike and inventory losses, I am setting L to 3 to ensure safety stock covers the maximum observed delay. I will use the last 7 samples (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand regime (~133/period) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the associated volatility.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 576 units in-transit. However, history confirms two lost shipments: Period 2 (209 units) and Period 18 (60 units), totaling 269 phantom units. Additionally, the order from Period 25 (182 units) is now 7 periods old and significantly exceeds the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods; I am now treating this as a third lost shipment. Therefore, the effective usable pipeline is 576 - (209 + 60 + 182) = 125 units (these are the orders from P29 and P30). The demand regime has shifted upward since Period 25, with the last 8 periods averaging approximately 131 units (range 105-166). To address this, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 4 periods (L=3 + 1) at this new average (~524 units) and set L to 3 to ensure the OR engine accounts for the maximum observed delay, while the effective pipeline gap will naturally trigger the required replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Order from Period 25 (182 units) is confirmed lost/severely delayed (7 periods elapsed). Total lost pipeline: 451 units (P2: 209, P18: 60, P25: 182). Effective usable in-transit is 125 units. Demand regime since P25 remains stable at ~131 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 576 units in-transit. However, based on the historical concluding messages, 451 of these units are confirmed lost or severely delayed (Period 2: 209, Period 18: 60, Period 25: 182). Thus, the effective usable pipeline is only 125 units (576 - 451). Demand has shifted significantly since Period 25, averaging approximately 131 units over the last 9 periods. With a promised lead time of 2 and an actual lead time often reaching 3, I am selecting L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for (L+1)=4 periods of demand. I use an explicit mu_hat of 524 ((1+3)*131) and sigma_hat of 45 (recent volatility) to trigger an order that compensates for the lost inventory and current stockout.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 576 units in-transit. However, historical analysis identifies three shipments that are significantly past the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods and are confirmed lost: Period 2 (209 units), Period 18 (60 units), and Period 25 (182 units). Total lost pipeline is 451 units. Subtracting these from the reported 576 units leaves an effective usable pipeline of 125 units (from orders placed in P29 and P30). The demand regime has shifted since Period 25, moving from an average of ~80 to ~130 units per period. Lead times are highly volatile (1-3 periods), so I use an explicit L of 3 to ensure the OR engine provides enough safety stock. I set mu_hat to 524 (1+L=4 periods * 131 avg demand) to reflect this new regime and compensate for the exhausted inventory and lost shipments.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 576 units. However, historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 2 (209 units), Period 18 (60 units), and Period 25 (182 units) are lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 451 units of 'ghost' inventory. Thus, the effective usable pipeline is only 125 units (576 - 451). Demand has shifted since Period 25, averaging approximately 131 units per period. With zero on-hand inventory and a demand regime of ~131, the OR backend must be significantly pushed to place a new order to cover the (L+1) window. I will set L to 3 (the upper bound of observed lead times) to ensure the backend calculates base stock for a 4-period window. I will use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime that started at Period 25 (P25-P35 = 11 samples). This will signal a mean demand of ~131. Combined with the corrected pipeline of 125, this should trigger a substantial order to replenish the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory: 451 units (P2: 209, P18: 60, P25: 182). Effective usable in-transit as of P36 is 125 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 576 units in-transit. However, based on longitudinal history, three shipments are definitively lost: Period 2 (209 units), Period 18 (60 units), and Period 25 (182 units), totaling 451 phantom units. This leaves an effective usable pipeline of 125 units (576 - 451). Demand underwent a regime shift around Period 25, increasing from ~80 units to a sustained mean of ~130 units (12-period average). Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, necessitating a pessimistic L=3 for the inventory policy to ensure sufficient safety stock during this high-demand, low-inventory state. I setting mu_hat using recent_N=12 to capture the higher demand regime, and L=explicit to account for the consistent risk of 3-period lead times.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Total lost inventory remains 451 units (P2: 209, P18: 60, P25: 182). Effective usable in-transit is 125 units. The high-demand regime (~130 units/period) starting at P25 is now sustained for 12 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports In-transit inventory of 576 units, but analysis of history confirms a significant portion is lost. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (209 units), Period 18 (60 units), and Period 25 (182 units) are well beyond any observed lead time (max 3 periods) and must be considered lost. Total lost pipeline = 451 units. Effective usable in-transit = 576 - 451 = 125 units. As On-hand is 0, the supply position is critical. Demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 25, averaging approximately 126 units per period over the last 12 periods. To recover from the stockout and account for the unreliable lead times (which fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods), I am setting L to an explicit value of 3 to ensure the OR backend targets a safety stock level covering the worst-case lead time. mu_hat is set using recent_N=12 to capture the current high-demand regime (approx. 126 * 4 = 504), and sigma_hat is also calculated based on this recent high-volatility period to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to trigger a corrective order.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 576 units in-transit, but based on historical analysis, a significant portion is lost: Period 2 (209 units), Period 18 (60 units), and Period 25 (182 units), totaling 451 lost units. The effective usable in-transit inventory is only 125 units (from recent orders), and on-hand inventory is 0. Demand shifted around Period 25 to a higher regime, averaging approximately 126 units over the last 14 periods (P25-P38). Lead times are unstable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, so I am explicitly setting L=3 to ensure the base stock covers the maximum likely lead time and prevents further stockouts. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=14) to capture the higher demand regime, and sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=14) to reflect current volatility.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to manage inventory for chips(Regular). Analysis of the history reveals a severe logistics failure: no inventory has arrived since Period 23, and on-hand inventory has been zero since Period 25. The 'In-transit' count of 576 includes significant lost shipments: P2 (209 units), P18 (60 units), and P25 (182 units). This totals 451 units that will never arrive. The effective usable pipeline is only 125 units (576 - 451). Demand shifted at Period 25 to a higher regime of approximately 130 units/period (P25-P39 mean is ~125). With 0 on-hand inventory and the lead time being highly unreliable (max 3 periods), I must set parameters to force the OR backend into a significant recovery order. I will use 'explicit' for L and mu_hat to ensure the backend recognizes the high-demand regime and the long lead time risk, setting mu_hat based on the 130 unit forecast over a 4-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Cumulative lost pipeline remains 451 units (P2: 209, P18: 60, P25: 182). Effective usable in-transit is 125 units. Stockout has persisted for 15 periods due to non-arrival of orders. Demand mean is stable at ~125 units since P25.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' balance of 576 units. However, based on historical evidence, three shipments are definitively lost: Period 2 (209 units), Period 18 (60 units), and Period 25 (182 units), totaling 451 units of 'phantom' inventory. Subtracting these from the reported 576 units leaves an effective usable pipeline of only 125 units (the orders from Period 29 and 30). With on-hand inventory at 0 and a sustained demand regime averaging ~125 units per period since Period 25, the current effective inventory position is severely insufficient to cover the lead time. I am setting L=3 to account for the observed maximum lead time and choosing mu_hat explicitly to account for the (1+L) periods of demand required at the 125 units/period rate, while ignoring the lost units in the pipeline calculation by providing a higher base stock target via mu_hat.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reflects a persistent stockout state since Period 25 (17 consecutive periods) because no orders have arrived since Period 23. The 'In-transit' count of 576 units is highly inflated by lost shipments. Analysis of the history confirms three likely lost orders: Period 2 (209 units), Period 18 (60 units), and Period 25 (182 units), totaling 451 lost units. This leaves an effective usable pipeline of only 125 units (from orders in P29 and P30). Demand was in a high regime (~131 units/period) from P25 to P39, but has dropped significantly in the last two periods (P40: 70, P41: 58). Given the significant lead-time failures and the likelihood that current pipeline inventory is also stuck or lost, I must set parameters to trigger a replenishment order. I will use L=3 to reflect the historical upper bound of lead time and a recent_N strategy for mu_hat (N=7, covering the recent demand drop and the late high-demand phase) to balance the forecast against the recent slowdown. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for the reality of lost pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed multi-order loss/delay. Total lost pipeline: 451 units (P2: 209, P18: 60, P25: 182). Effective usable in-transit is 125 units. Demand showed a sharp drop in P40-P41 (avg 64) compared to the P25-P39 regime (avg 125), suggesting a possible regime shift or seasonal end.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 analysis: The inventory situation remains critical with 0 on-hand units and an 'In-transit' balance of 576 units. However, based on longitudinal history, 451 units of this pipeline are confirmed lost (P2: 209, P18: 60, P25: 182). This leaves an effective usable pipeline of only 125 units (from P29 and P30). From P25-P39, demand averaged ~130 units/period, but the last 3 periods (P40-P42) show a significant drop to an average of 72.3 units. Given the game ends at P50 and lead times are volatile (1-3 periods), I will reset mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this lower demand regime and ensure we don't over-order into a potential end-of-game seasonal decline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to maintain a safety buffer against the high variance seen in the previous regime. Lead time is set to explicit=3 to account for the frequent delays used for safety stock calculations.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand regime shift confirmed from ~130 units (P25-P39) to ~72 units (P40-P42). Total confirmed lost inventory: 451 units (P2: 209, P18: 60, P25: 182).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted from a high-demand regime (~130 units/period, P25-P39) to a lower regime (~70 units/period) starting at Period 40. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P40-P43) is 70.0. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this shift. Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods). A significant portion of the reported 'In-transit' inventory (576 units) is comprised of lost shipments: P2 (209 units), P18 (60 units), and P25 (182 units), totaling 451 lost units. The effective usable pipeline is therefore only 125 units (576 - 451). Since On-hand is 0 and we are approaching the end of the game (P44/50), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the upper end of the observed lead time, ensuring the OR backend targets enough inventory to cover the remaining periods and the volatility. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*70=280 using the recent low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand dropped from ~130 to ~70 units starting at P40 (4-period avg: 70.0). Total cumulative lost pipeline: 451 units (P2: 209, P18: 60, P25: 182).

We have identified three lost orders: P2 (209 units), P18 (60 units), and P25 (182 units), totaling 451 'phantom' units in the reported in-transit inventory of 576. This leaves an effective usable pipeline of only 125 units (576 - 451). Furthermore, no orders have arrived for 21 periods (since P23), representing a complete supply failure. Starting at P40, demand shifted downward from ~130 units to ~67 units (5-period mean of P40-P44: 70, 58, 89, 63, 55). At P45, with only 5 periods remaining in the game and considering the persistent lead time failure, the goal is to stop placing new orders. Any new order placed now (L=2 promised) wouldn't arrive until P48 or later, leaving almost no time to sell the stock and risking high holding costs at game end. The effective pipeline of 125 units, if it ever arrives, is sufficient to cover the remaining periods at the current lower demand regime. I will set parameters to prevent the OR engine from triggering new orders while using the most recent lower demand regime for future calculations.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: No arrivals since Period 23 (21 periods). Total lost pipeline verified at 451 units (P2: 209, P18: 60, P25: 182). Effective pipeline is reported in-transit minus 451.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of extended failure, with no arrivals since Period 23 (22 periods ago). I have identified a cumulative loss of 451 units (P2: 209, P18: 60, P25: 182) from the reported in-transit of 576. This leaves an effective usable pipeline of 125 units (from orders in P29: 23, P30: 44, P16: remainder/other). Demand has shifted significantly downward starting at P40; the mean demand for the last 6 periods is 62.0 units, compared to the previous ~130 unit regime. Given the nearing end of the game (P50) and the extreme lead time uncertainty (calculated effectively as >20 for lost units, though promised as 2), I will set L to 3 to maintain a conservative safety buffer while using the recent low-demand regime (N=6) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This prevents over-ordering in the final periods while acknowledging the lower demand profile and current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift: Mean demand dropped from ~130 to ~62 units starting at P40 (6-period avg: 62.0). Supply chain remains non-functional with 22 periods of no arrivals; cumulative lost/indefinitely delayed pipeline is 451 units (P2, P18, P25).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains entirely non-functional. No shipments have arrived since Period 23 (24 periods ago). The total confirmed lost pipeline is 451 units (P2: 209, P18: 60, P25: 182). The reported in-transit of 576 units, after subtracting these 451 units, leaves an effective usable pipeline of only 125 units (from P16, P17, P19, P20 orders that somehow stayed in 'In-transit' or more recent small orders like P29, P30). Effectively, the system is in a permanent stockout state. The demand regime has clearly shifted downward starting at P40; the mean demand for the last 7 periods (P40-P46) is roughly 64 units per period. I am setting L to explicit 3 to account for the maximum observed lead time, though it is currently irrelevant given the supply block. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the lower demand regime and using the standard deviation of that same period (N=7) for sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain deadlock: No arrivals for 24 consecutive periods. Effective usable pipeline is 125 units (Reported 576 minus 451 confirmed lost). Demand remains in the lower regime (avg ~64) since P40.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of failure with no arrivals for 24 consecutive periods (since P23). The reported in-transit quantity of 576 includes 451 units from shipments confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (P2: 209, P18: 60, P25: 182). This leaves an effective usable pipeline of 125 units (from P29 and P30 orders). Demand continues in the lower regime that began at P40; the mean demand for the last 8 periods (P40-P47) is approximately 66.6 units. Given the extreme lead time uncertainty and the supply chain deadlock, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) and using recent_N=8 to capture the current lower demand regime. The goal is to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the lower demand while attempting to recover from the prolonged stockout, despite the ongoing non-arrival of shipments.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain deadlock: 24 consecutive periods with zero arrivals (P24-P47). Demand regime P40-P47 stabilized at a mean of ~67 units/period.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period. The supply chain has effectively failed, with no arrivals since Period 23 (26 consecutive periods). Total confirmed lost inventory is 451 units (from orders in P2, P18, and P25). The reported in-transit of 576 units minus these 451 lost units leaves an effective usable pipeline of 125 units (from orders in P16, P17, P19, P29, and P30, although these are significantly overdue and likely lost as well). Demand has shifted to a lower regime beginning at P40, with a current mean of approximately 64 units per period (P40-P48 average). Given the game ends in Period 50, any order placed now (P49) with a lead time of 1+ periods will not arrive in time to be sold. With on-hand inventory at 0 and the supply chain deadlocked, no further revenue can be generated. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime (N=9 for P40-P48) and an explicit lead time to account for the systemic delays, although it will not impact the final outcome.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain deadlock: 26 consecutive periods (P24-P49) with zero arrivals confirms complete logistics failure for this SKU. Demand regime P40-P48 stabilized at a mean of 63.3 units/period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has effectively collapsed, with no arrivals recorded since Period 23 (27 consecutive periods of zero arrivals). The 'In-transit' figure of 576 units is highly unreliable, as it includes confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed shipments: Period 2 (209 units), Period 18 (60 units), and Period 25 (182 units), totaling 451 lost units. This leaves an effective usable pipeline of only 125 units (from orders in P29 or later). Demand has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 40, with a mean of approximately 68 units (P40-P49 average is 68.1). Given the total lack of reliable supply and the fact that this is the final period of the game (Period 50), placing a large order is futile as it will never arrive to satisfy demand within the game horizon. I will set parameters to reflect the lower demand regime and maintain the maximum possible safety buffer for any phantom arrivals, while acknowledging the logistics failure.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed pipeline: 451 units (P2: 209, P18: 60, P25: 182). Logistics failure persists with 27 periods of zero arrivals. Demand regime P40-P49 remains stable at ~68 units.
