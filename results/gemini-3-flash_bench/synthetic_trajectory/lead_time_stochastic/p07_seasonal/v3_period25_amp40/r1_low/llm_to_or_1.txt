Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (samples provided) shows a mean of 158 and a standard deviation of approximately 34.6. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since there is no prior 'conclude' message or replenishment history, I will use the established average demand (158 units) and the promised lead time (L=2) to set the initial base stock. Using L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*158 = 474 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+2)*34.6 \u2248 60. The OR backend will calculate the optimal base stock to balance the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, an order of 215 units was placed, which is currently in-transit. Because L=2, we expect this order to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. In Period 1, demand was 64 units, but since starting on-hand was 0 and no arrivals occurred (as expected), 64 units of demand were lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Based on the 5 historical samples provided [118, 153, 211, 153, 155], the mean demand is 158. The Period 1 demand (64) appears low compared to history, but with only one data point in the live game, I will transition to using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the historical average while weighting the recent samples. Since L=2, mu_hat should target (1+2)=3 periods of demand. Using the historical mean of 158 * 3 = 474 units. Sigma_hat will use recent_N (N=5) to capture historical volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. No inventory has arrived yet, resulting in lost sales for Period 1 (demand: 64) and Period 2 (demand: 87) since on-hand was 0. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (215 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 3 (this period) and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message at the start of Period 4. The order placed in Period 2 (227 units) is expected in Period 4. Currently, 442 units are in-transit. Demand samples (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggest a mean of ~158. However, actual demand in the first two periods was lower (64, 87). I will use a recent_N approach to capture the actual observed demand while acknowledging the promised lead time. Since the system calculates base_stock as (1+L) * mean, and L=2, mu_hat will cover 3 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order (215 units) was placed with a promised lead time of 2 periods. According to the timing rules, an order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message (which we read at the start of Period 4). However, the Period 3 conclusion shows 'arrived=0', and on-hand inventory remains 0 despite demand occurring. This indicates a delay or loss of the first shipment. The current in-transit inventory is 442 units (215 from P1 + 227 from P2). Demand has been increasing steadily: 64 to 87 to 134 (and external samples suggest 118, 153, 211, 153, 155). The average demand across all samples is ~155. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and the first shipment is late, I will set L to 3 (explicitly accounting for the observed delay) and use recent_N for demand to capture the current upward trend while the OR engine attempts to bridge the inventory gap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Examining the history: Orders placed in Period 1 (215 units) arrived in Period 4, confirming an actual lead time of 3 periods, one period longer than the promised 2. This resulted in stockouts for Periods 1-3. Current on-hand inventory is 88 units, with 260 units in-transit (from Periods 2 and 4). Demand data shows a steady increase: 64, 87, 134, 127, and 155 (forecasted/recent avg around 113). Since actual lead time is consistently longer than promised, I will explicitly set L=3. To account for the upward demand trend while maintaining stability, I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the higher volume observed since Period 2. The backend OR engine will calculate a base stock level for 4 periods (L+1) and subtract the 260 units already in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 4). Demand shows a significant upward trend from ~60 to ~130-150 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show a lead time of 3 periods (P1 order arrived in P4). Order placed in P2 (227 units) has not yet arrived as of the P5 conclude message, which is consistent with L=3 (expected in P6 resolution). Currently, inventory is 0 on-hand with 324 in-transit (P2: 227 + P4: 33 + P5: 64). Demand has shifted significantly from the initial samples (avg ~75) to a higher regime (avg ~130 since Period 3). I am using L=3 to match the actual lead time and N=3 for demand statistics (Periods 3-5) to capture the current high-demand regime of ~132/period (total mu_hat for L+1 = 132 * 4 = 528).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~132 units/period since Period 3. Lead time remains confirmed at 3 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 132 units over the last four periods (P3-P6: 134, 127, 134, 125). The actual lead time is confirmed at 3 periods (observed in P4 from P1 order). This differs from the promised 2 periods. The pipeline inventory (463 units) consists of orders from P2 (227), P4 (33), P5 (64), and P6 (139). Based on L=3, the P2 order should arrive during Period 5 (it hasn't yet, showing a delay or loss), the P4 order in Period 7, and P5 in Period 8. Due to the discrepancy in the P2 arrival (estimated arrival was Period 5, now Period 7 and still 0 on-hand), the OR engine needs to account for a cycle of (L+1) = 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to 528 (4 * 132) and L to an explicit 3 to ensure the base stock covers the longer lead time. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the variance of the current stable regime.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (227 units) is overdue (Expected P5 based on L=3, still not arrived by P6 conclude). Potential shipment loss or lead time instability.

Daily Profit: $33.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Analyzing the history: The P2 order (227 units) placed in Period 2 should have arrived in Period 5 or 6 (given L=3). As of Period 7's conclusion, it has not arrived, nor has the P3 order (though P3 was 0 units). Interestingly, the P4 order (33 units) arrived in Period 7 (L=3), skipping over the P2 order. This strongly suggests the P2 order is lost or significantly delayed. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at a higher level; the last 5 periods (P3-P7) show a mean of 133.6 units. Since the backend's default L is 2 but observed L is 3, I will explicitly set L=3. To account for the lost P2 order and recent demand levels, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to ensure the pipeline inventory is calculated against the current higher regime. The OR engine will see the 495 in-transit (P2=227, P5=64, P6=139, P7=65) and subtract that from the base stock. If P2 is indeed lost, the physical pipeline is actually only 268 units. By setting L=3 and using recent demand, I provide the backend with the correct lead time and demand parameters to trigger a replenishment order that compensates for the stockout and the missing units.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: P2 order (227 units) confirmed likely lost or skipped as P4 order (33 units) arrived first. Demand stable at ~134 units/period (P3-P7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 6 periods (P3-P8) around a mean of 132.33 units. Lead times are volatile: P1, P4, and P5 orders arrived with L=3, while the P7 order arrived extremely fast with L=1. Critically, the P2 order (227 units) is now 4 periods overdue based on the L=3 observation and 6 periods past its original promised date, confirming it is likely lost. The P6 order (139 units) and the P8 order (40 units) are currently in-transit. Given the lead time instability (ranging from 1 to 3), I will set L=3 as a conservative measure to ensure sufficient base stock. mu_hat is calculated using recent_N=6 (P3-P8) to capture the stabilized high-demand regime, while sigma_hat is also based on the same period to reflect current volatility. These parameters aim to maintain a high service level despite the missing P2 stock and lead time variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is highly unstable: most orders arrive in 3 periods, but P7 arrived in 1 period. Period 2 order (227 units) is confirmed lost/skipped.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand from Period 3 through Period 9 is relatively stable, averaging 126.4 units per period (samples: 134, 127, 134, 125, 148, 126, 91). Lead times have been highly inconsistent: 3 periods (P1, P4, P5) and 1 period (P7, P8), with P2 confirmed lost. Because the OR backend uses a pipeline inventory count that includes the lost P2 order (227 units) which will never arrive, the 'In-transit' figure of 487 is inflated. To force the backend to place an order despite this ghost inventory, I am setting an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for the more frequent longer lead time, and an 'explicit' mu_hat. mu_hat should ideally cover (L+1) periods of demand; with L=3, we need to cover 4 periods. 4 * 126 = 504. To compensate for the 227 units of 'ghost' inventory that the OR engine thinks is coming, I will adjust mu_hat upward to 731 (504 + 227). This allows the OR engine to 'see' a need for 504 units while its internal math subtracts the 227 units of dead stock. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=7 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Compensating for lost Period 2 order (227 units) by inflating mu_hat. Total in-transit (487) includes 227 units that will never arrive. Lead time is volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). The Period 2 order (227 units) is confirmed lost, yet it remains in the OR backend's pipeline calculation, leading to consistent under-ordering. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target inventory level by the amount of the lost shipment (227 units). This forces the backend to place an order despite the phantom pipeline inventory. Historical demand has stabilized around 130-140 units since Period 3. Choosing L=3 as the explicit lead time to be conservative, given the volatility (observed lead times range from 1 to 3). The base forecast for a (3+1) period window at 135 units/period is 540. Adding the 227 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 767. This high value will bridge the gap created by the lost units until the pipeline resolves or cycles out.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Continuing to inflate mu_hat to offset the lost Period 2 order (227 units) which is still erroneously counted in pipeline inventory by the OR engine.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Period 2 order (227 units) is confirmed lost/skipped as multiple later orders have arrived while it remains in-transit. The OR engine includes these 227 phantom units in its 'pipeline inventory' calculation, causing it to under-order. To compensate, I must artificially inflate the base stock target (via mu_hat) by approximately 227 units. Current demand has stabilized around 125 units per period. The lead time (L) is volatile, with observed values of 1 and 3 periods; I will set L=2 for the backend calculation, reflecting the average. To calculate mu_hat: (1+L)*demand + compensation = (1+2)*125 + 227 = 602. Given the stockout (ending inventory 0 for three consecutive periods), an aggressive target is necessary to recover service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Maintaining mu_hat inflation of ~227 units to offset the lost Period 2 shipment still residing in pipeline inventory. Demand remains stable ~125 units/period.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, P9 and P10 orders finally arrived (333 units), leaving us with 292 on-hand. The total 'In-transit' is 434, which is composed of the lost P2 order (227 units), the P6 order (139 units), and the P11 order (68 units). The P6 order is now significantly overdue (7 periods since ordering), suggesting it is likely lost as well. To ensure the OR backend orders enough, I must continue to inflate mu_hat to offset these ghosts in the pipeline inventory. The lost P2 order is 227 units. If P6 (139 units) is also lost, the total 'ghost' inventory is 366. Standard demand is stable around 125 units. With L=2, base mu_hat should be (1+2)*125 = 375. Adding the 366 units to bypass the pipeline deduction, mu_hat = 741. I will use 'explicit' to force this correction. Sigma_hat is kept at a default level based on recent history to maintain a standard safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: P6 order (139 units) is now highly likely lost (ordered P6, not arrived by P12 conclude). Total ghost inventory (P2 + P6) is 366 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we face a significant 'ghost inventory' challenge. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (449 units) from the base stock. However, analysis of 'Period 13 conclude' confirms that Period 2 (227 units) and Period 6 (139 units) orders are lost, totaling 366 'ghost' units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I must inflate mu_hat. The true demand is stable around 120-130 units (mean=118 over last 10 periods). With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the backend expects to cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand (~360-390 units). By setting mu_hat explicitly to the sum of 3 periods of demand plus the ghost inventory (375 + 366 = 741), I ensure the net order calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline) remains positive and sufficient to maintain service levels. L is set to 'calculate' to capture the volatility between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed ghost inventory increased to 366 units (P2=227, P6=139). Both orders are well beyond even the maximum 3-period observed lead time and are considered lost in the pipeline.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 500 units in-transit. Based on historical data, Period 2 (227 units) and Period 6 (139 units) orders are considered lost as they are significantly beyond the maximum 3-period lead time observed. This creates 366 units of 'ghost inventory' that the OR engine incorrectly subtracts from the order quantity. To compensate, I must increase the mu_hat parameter. Forecasted demand is stable at approximately 110-120 units per period. Using a 3-period lead time (L=3), the required base stock covers 4 periods. Base mu = 115 * 4 = 460. Adjusted mu_hat = 460 + 366 (ghost inventory) = 826. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), so I set L=3 to ensure sufficient safety stock during longer delays.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory confirmed at 366 units (P2: 227 units, P6: 139 units). These orders are lost but remain in the pipeline inventory calculation, necessitating an uplift of 366 units to the mu_hat parameter.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 110 units over the last 10 periods (P6-P15). The primary operational challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline: Order P2 (227 units) and Order P6 (139 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 366 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 'In-transit' amount (675 units) from the base_stock, and 366 of those units will never arrive, the system will under-order unless we compensate. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculation: Target base stock for (L+1) periods + Ghost Inventory. With average demand \u2248 110 and L=3 (most frequent actual lead time), base stock needs to cover 4 periods. Target = (4 * 110) + 366 = 806. I will use 806 to ensure the backend places an order that accounts for the missing 366 units. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has recently softened, averaging approximately 80 units over the last 4 periods (P13-P16), down from the previous stable regime of ~134 units. However, the critical operational issue remains 'ghost inventory'. Currently, 'In-transit' is reported as 727 units. Based on historical data, we identify three 'lost' orders that will never arrive: P2 (227 units, overdue since P5), P6 (139 units, overdue since P9), and now P14 (119 units, ordered P14, not arrived by P16 conclude despite P13 arrival in 3 periods; while potentially only late, the logic must offset it to trigger an order if needed). Total Ghost Inventory = 227 + 139 + 119 = 485 units. The OR backend uses a Base Stock policy: Order = Base Stock - (On-hand + In-transit). Because In-transit (727) includes 485 ghost units, the engine thinks we are overstocked. To force a replenishment order, we must inflate 'mu_hat' by this ghost amount. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * average_demand + Ghost_Inventory. Predicted demand (1+L) periods is approx (1+2)*80 = 240. mu_hat = 240 + 485 = 725. I will use 'explicit' to ensure this exact offset is applied.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory increased to 485 units (P2=227, P6=139, P14=119). These units are permanently stuck in 'In-transit' and must be offset by adding their sum to mu_hat. Demand has shifted down to ~80 units/period since Period 13.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 13, averaging approximately 80 units per period. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this current regime. The primary challenge remains 'ghost inventory'. Pipeline inventory is reported as 541 units, but this includes lost shipments: Period 2 (227 units), Period 6 (139 units), and Period 15 (175 units). Although Period 14 and 16 arrived, Period 15 is now overdue based on the typical 3-period lead time. Total confirmed lost/stagnant inventory is now 541 units (227+139+175). Since pipeline inventory is used by the OR engine as 'on-hand + in-transit', the engine thinks we have plenty of stock coming. To force an order, I must increase mu_hat by the amount of this ghost inventory. Calculation: (1 + L) * Expected_Demand + Ghost_Inventory. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 80) + 541 = 781. Sigma remains at recent_N to handle the moderate volatility observed in the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Total ghost inventory increased to 541 units (P2=227, P6=139, P15=175). These units are permanently stuck in 'In-transit' and are no longer expected to arrive. Adjusted mu_hat must absorb this total to counteract the OR engine's overestimation of pipeline inventory. Current demand regime since P13 is ~80 units/period.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary challenge is the 'ghost inventory' - lost orders that the OR engine still subtracts from the order quantity (P2: 227, P6: 139, P14: 119 - corrected: P14 arrived at P17, but P15: 175 is now lost). Let's re-verify losses: P2 (227) is lost. P6 (139) is lost. P15 (175) was ordered P15, and based on max L=3, should have arrived by P18 conclude; it did not, so it is likely lost. Total ghost inventory = 227 (P2) + 139 (P6) + 175 (P15) = 541 units. Demand has shifted to a lower regime starting Period 13; the mean of periods 13-18 is (119+90+87+64+114+60)/6 = 89 units. L is volatile (1 to 3), so I will use L=3 for the calculation. The OR engine formula is 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. To bypass the 541 units of ghost inventory in the 'pipeline_inventory', I must add 541 to the 'mu_hat' value. Base demand (1+L) * 89 = 4 * 89 = 356. Total mu_hat = 356 + 541 = 897. Sigma_hat is calculated using the recent regime (last 6 periods, std dev ~22), sqrt(1+3)*22 = 44.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory increased to 541 units (P2=227, P6=139, P15=175). These units are permanently stuck in 'In-transit' and are no longer expected to arrive. Current demand regime since P13 is ~89 units/period.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 13-19) shows a distinct downward shift to an average of approximately 81 units per period (samples: 119, 90, 87, 64, 114, 60, 57). The current pipeline inventory of 870 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' orders that have not arrived and are likely lost: P2 (227), P6 (139), and P15 (175), totaling 541 units. To counteract the OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), I must uplift the mu_hat parameter by this ghost total (541 units). The base demand forecast component is (1+L) * average_demand. With a target lead time (L) of 3, and average demand of 81: (1+3) * 81 = 324. Adding the 541 ghost units results in a mu_hat of 865. I set L to an explicit 3 to reflect the most frequent actual lead time and stabilize the ordering cycle.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The focus for Period 21 is managing a significant pipeline discrepancy. The total 'In-transit' inventory reported is 870 units. Based on historical data, several orders are effectively lost: P2 (227), P6 (139), and P15 (175), totaling 541 units of 'ghost inventory'. Additionally, P18 (153) and P19 (176) are still within a reasonable, albeit volatile, lead time window. Demand has shifted to a lower regime starting around P13, averaging approximately 81 units per period (P13-P20). To adjust for the 541 ghost units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes are arriving, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The calculation is: (1 + L) * average_demand + ghost_inventory. Using an expected L=3 and average demand of 81, the base expectation is 324. Adding the 541 units of ghost inventory leads to a mu_hat of 865. This ensures the backend places an order by overcoming the false pipeline inflation. L is set to explicit 3 to reflect the most frequent lead time observed for successful arrivals. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=8 to capture the volatility of this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Ghost inventory remains at 541 units (P2: 227, P6: 139, P15: 175). Demand regime stable at ~81 units/period since Period 13.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 13 is approximately 81 units/period (mean of samples P13-P21). The 'In-transit' quantity of 870 units is severely inflated by 'ghost inventory' - orders that are confirmed lost but still counted by the OR engine. These lost orders are: Period 2 (227 units), Period 6 (139 units), and Period 15 (175 units), totaling 541 units. Additionally, the orders from Period 18 (153 units) and Period 19 (176 units) are now at L=3 and L=2 respectively with no arrival yet; while lead times are volatile (1-3 periods), the current on-hand inventory is 0. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 870 units in pipeline, mu_hat must be set to (1+L)*Demand + Ghost Inventory. With average L=2, expected demand over (L+1) is ~243. Adding 541 units of ghost inventory gives a target mu_hat of ~784. However, to ensure we actually trigger an order to replenish stock for immediate demand, I will set mu_hat to 850. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed 1-3 period lead times.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory remains at 541 units (P2: 227, P6: 139, P15: 175). These orders are lost but remain in the pipeline calculation.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P13-P22) has shifted significantly downward to an average of ~78 units/period. The total in-transit quantity of 870 units includes 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments: P2 (227), P6 (139), and P15 (175), totaling 541 units. These 541 units are permanently stuck in the pipeline and will likely never arrive, yet the OR backend subtracts them from the base stock calculation, leading to consistent under-ordering. To correct this, I am manually inflating mu_hat. Base mu_hat (L=3 scenario, (1+3)*78) = 312. Adding the 541 ghost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 853. I set L to 3 to reflect the most frequent actual lead time and sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent demand volatility (~25) across the lead time cycle.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit inventory of 870 units. Based on historical data, multiple shipments are confirmed as lost or 'ghost inventory': P2 (227 units), P6 (139 units), and P15 (175 units), totaling 541 units. Furthermore, the orders from P18 (153 units) and P19 (176 units) are now overdue (P18 is at L=6, P19 at L=5), while the maximum observed successful lead time is 3 periods. This suggests they are either significantly delayed or also lost. The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from its target base stock; to prevent it from placing zero orders due to this 'ghost' pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat by the amount of lost inventory. The demand regime since Period_13 has stabilized at a lower average of approximately 80 units per period. I will use L=3 to reflect the common upper bound of the actual lead time. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * 80 + 541 (ghost inventory) = 861. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture the current lower-demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P18 (153 units) and P19 (176 units) are now critically overdue (6 and 5 periods respectively), suggesting a potential increase in ghost inventory beyond the confirmed 541 units (P2, P6, P15).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a critical stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a massive pipeline of 870 units. However, historical evidence indicates that a significant portion of this in-transit inventory is 'ghost inventory' (orders lost or severely delayed). Confirmed ghost orders: P2 (227), P6 (139), and P15 (175), totaling 541 units. Additionally, orders P18 (153) and P19 (176) are now overdue (7 and 6 periods since ordering, respectively), suggesting they are also likely lost. Total suspected ghost inventory is now 870 units (the entire current in-transit amount), meaning effectively zero units are expected to arrive. Since Period 13, the demand regime has shifted lower, averaging ~81 units per period (last 12 periods). To trigger an order from the OR backend, I must offset this ghost inventory by setting mu_hat to cover both (L+1) periods of demand and the non-existent pipeline. Predicted demand for L=3 (review + lead) = (1+3) * 81 = 324. To nullify the 870 ghost units in the backend's calculation, mu_hat must be set to 324 + 870 = 1194. This forces the OR engine to see a deficit and place an order despite the 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: All 870 units currently in-transit (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) are categorized as ghost inventory/lost, as they have exceeded the max observed lead time of 3 periods significantly. Total offset required to mu_hat is 870 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 1194 units in-transit. Based on historical data, several large orders are definitively lost (ghost inventory) because they haven't arrived within the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. These include: P2 (227), P6 (139), P15 (175), P18 (153), and P19 (176). Since P18 and P19 were ordered 7 and 8 periods ago respectively, they are now confirmed lost. This brings total ghost inventory to 870 units. The remaining 324 units in-transit are from the P25 order, which is still within a plausible lead time window. To prevent the OR backend from seeing these 870 lost units as available pipeline inventory and suppressing new orders, I must uplift mu_hat. The demand regime since Period 13 reflects a lower mean of approximately 80 units/period (average of P13-P25 is 78.6). For the OR calculation (1+L)*demand, assuming L=3, the base requirement is (1+3)*80 = 320. Adding the 870 units of ghost inventory to the base requirement results in an explicit mu_hat of 1190. For sigma_hat, I will use recent volatility (N=13) to capture the variance of this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed ghost inventory increased to 870 units (P2: 227, P6: 139, P15: 175, P18: 153, P19: 176). These units are permanently lost and must be offset in mu_hat to bypass the OR engine's pipeline calculation. Demand regime stabilized at ~79 units/period since Period 13.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently reporting 1194 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 870 of these units (from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) are significantly overdue (5+ periods) and are confirmed lost 'ghost inventory'. Additionally, the order from P25 (324 units) is still within a plausible lead time but has not arrived yet. Since the OR engine subtracts all 1194 in-transit units from the base stock calculation, we must offset this by inflating mu_hat. Demand since Period 13 has averaged approximately 79 units/period. Therefore, we set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of real demand plus the ghost inventory (870 units). Setting L to 3 (observed max stable lead time) results in: mu_hat = ((1+3) * 79) + 870 = 1186. Sigma_hat is calculated using a recent window of 14 periods (P13-P26) to capture the lower-demand volatility (std ~24.5), resulting in sqrt(4) * 24.5 \u2248 49.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently plagued by extreme supply chain failures. I have identified 1194 units currently in-transit, all of which are 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments): P2 (227), P6 (139), P15 (175), P18 (153), P19 (176), and now P25 (324). P25 was ordered 2 periods ago; given the frequent shipment loss and the fact that on-hand inventory remains 0 despite a promised lead time of 2, I am categorizing all current in-transit units as lost. The OR backend subtracts the pipeline (1194 units) from its base stock calculation. Since actual demand since P13 has been steady at approximately 80 units/period, I must set mu_hat to (1+L)*80 + 1194 to force the engine to place an order. Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat should be 3*80 + 1194 = 1434. I'll use 1450 to provide a small buffer. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=15) to capture the volatility of the current lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total ghost inventory increased to 1194 units (P2: 227, P6: 139, P15: 175, P18: 153, P19: 176, P25: 324). These units are permanently lost but remain in the pipeline calculation. Demand remains stable at ~80 units/period since Period 13.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from severe disruptions. Currently, 1450 units are marked 'In-transit', but historical evidence suggests a major portion of this is 'ghost inventory' - orders that are permanently lost but remain in the OR engine's pipeline calculation. Confirmed ghost inventory includes Period 2 (227), Period 6 (139), Period 15 (175), Period 18 (153), Period 19 (176), and Period 25 (324), totaling 1194 units. These units are beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods (Period 25 was ordered 4 periods ago). Demand since Period 13 has averaged approximately 83 units/period. To ensure the OR engine actually places an order, mu_hat must be set to (1+L)*Demand + Ghost_Inventory. Using L=3, this calculation is (1+3)*83 + 1194 = 332 + 1194 = 1526. This uplift offsets the systemic error in the pipeline inventory calculation caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Total ghost inventory increased to 1194 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25). These units are permanently lost but still included in the OR engine's pipeline count. Demand remains stable at ~83 units/period since Period 13.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation for 'chips(Regular)' is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is plagued by a massive amount of 'ghost inventory' \u2013 orders that are listed as 'In-transit' but have likely been lost or will arrive far too late. Observed lead times have reached a maximum of 3 periods, and the following orders are now well beyond that: P2 (227), P6 (139), P15 (175), P18 (153), P19 (176), P25 (324). This totals 1194 units of confirmed ghost inventory. Additionally, orders from P28 (256 units) and P29 (76 units) are still within a plausible lead-time window, bringing total in-transit to 1526. The backend OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock. To force an order when the pipeline is artificially inflated, I must add the ghost inventory (1194) to the expected demand across the lead-time window. Demand has shifted upward again in the last 2 periods (~124 avg), while the regime since P13 has averaged ~84. I will use a conservative forecast of ~90 units per period. Assuming L=3, the target mu_hat should be (1+3)*90 + 1194 units = 1554. I set L=3 as the most reliable maximum observed lead time to ensure the inventory calculation covers enough periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 1194 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25). Recent demand (P28-29) shows a spike to ~124 units/period, up from the ~84 seen since P13. Monitoring if this high demand persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted recently. While the long-term regime since Period 13 was ~84 units/period, the last three periods (P28-P30) have seen a significant spike to an average of 128.3 units/period (107, 142, 136). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this surge. Regarding the pipeline, there is a massive ghost inventory issue. The total in-transit is 1298 units. Based on historical data, orders from P2 (227), P6 (139), P15 (175), P18 (153), P19 (176), and P25 (324) are considered lost (ghost inventory total = 1194 units), as they haven't arrived within the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. The OR engine subtracts all 1298 units from the base stock. To counteract the 1194 ghost units, I must inflate mu_hat. Mean demand (128.3) over (1+L=3) periods is ~385. Adding the 1194 ghost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1579. This ensures the engine places an order to cover real demand despite the stuck pipeline inventory. Lead time is set to 2 to reflect the most recent successful arrival (P28 arrived in P30).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased to ~128 units/period (P28-P30) from the previous ~84. Ghost inventory total confirmed at 1194 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25), requiring direct mu_hat inflation to offset the OR engine's pipeline calculation.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant inventory challenges due to 'ghost inventory' - orders that are permanently lost but remain in the 'In-transit' calculation for the OR engine. Total ghost inventory is 1194 units (P2: 227, P6: 139, P15: 175, P18: 153, P19: 176, P25: 324). These orders are all at least 6 periods old, far exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3. To prevent the backend from under-ordering, mu_hat must be inflated by this 1194 unit offset. Additionally, the demand regime has recently shifted upwards. Mean demand from P28-P31 is approximately 131 units (107, 142, 136, 139). To capture this shift while offsetting the pipeline error, mu_hat is set to (1+L) * 131 + 1194. With L=2 (the promised lead time and recent arrival speed), this equals 3 * 131 + 1194 = 1587. Since stockouts are occurring despite recent arrivals, sigma_hat is set to a higher value using recent_N (N=4) to ensure a more robust safety stock.

Carry-over insight: P28 order (256 units) arrived in 2 periods (P30), whereas many previous orders were lost or took 3 periods. Recent demand (P28-P31) is stable at ~131 units/period, representing a significant upward shift from the previous ~80.

Daily Reward (R_t): $161.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P28-P32) has stabilized at a higher level, averaging 142.6 units. The lead time remains highly volatile, but recent orders from P28 and P31 successfully arrived in 2 and 1 periods respectively, whereas earlier orders are written off as lost. The total 'ghost inventory' currently in-transit is 1,137 units (P2: 227, P6: 139, P15: 175, P18: 153, P19: 176, P25: 324, P29: 76, P30: 28 are omitted if delayed beyond 3 periods). Looking at 'In-transit' of 1,426: P29 (76), P30 (28), and P32 (128) are legitimate pipeline; the rest (1,194) are 'ghosts'. I must inflate mu_hat by 1,194 units to bypass the OR engine's pipeline deduction. Demand forecast (L+1=3) is 143 * 3 = 429. Total mu_hat = 429 + 1194 = 1623. Lead time is set to 2 to represent the average of recent successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed total ghost inventory of 1,194 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30). These units remain in the OR engine's pipeline calculation but will never arrive. Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 28: avg increased to ~143 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 28-33) has shifted upwards to an average of ~146 units/period (107, 142, 136, 139, 189, 163). The lead time has recently stabilized to a faster rate (P28 arrived in 2, P31 and P32 arrived in 1), but I will maintain an estimate of L=2 to be safe given historical volatility. The critical issue remains the high volume of 'ghost inventory' \u2013 orders that are permanently lost but still counted as 'In-transit' by the OR engine. The confirmed ghost inventory includes: P2 (227), P6 (139), P15 (175), P18 (153), P19 (176), P25 (324), P29 (76), and P30 (28). Total ghost inventory = 1298 units. To ensure the OR engine actually places an order, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Ghost Inventory). Desired Base Stock for a 3-period window (L+1) at 146 units/period is ~438. Total mu_hat = 438 + 1298 = 1736. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for recent demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Ghost inventory increased to 1298 units (added P29: 76 units and P30: 28 units, which are now overdue). Recent demand (P28-P33) confirmed at ~146 units/period. Lead time appears to have decreased to 1-2 periods recently, but reliability is low.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 28-34) has stabilized at approximately 142 units per period, a significant increase from the previous baseline. I am utilizing N=7 for mu_hat (P28-P34) to capture this shift. The most critical issue remains the high volume of 'ghost inventory' \u2013 orders that are listed as in-transit but have clearly been lost. These include P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, and P30, totaling 1,298 units. Because the OR backend subtracts total pipeline inventory from the base stock to determine the order quantity, I must offset these 1,298 'dead' units by adding them directly to the mu_hat value. Failure to do so will result in the OR engine placing zero orders despite zero on-hand inventory. Lead time has been volatile but recently shows 1-2 periods; I am using L=2 (explicit) to provide a safety buffer while reflecting recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Ghost inventory total updated to 1,298 units (P2: 227, P6: 139, P15: 175, P18: 153, P19: 176, P25: 324, P29: 76, P30: 28). This total must be added to mu_hat to offset the pipeline calculation. Demand regime (P28-P34) avg is 142.5.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P28-P35) averages approximately 139 units per period, which is a significant increase from the previous regime. I am using recent_N=8 to capture this shift. The lead time has become more volatile, with recent arrivals occurring in 1 or 2 periods, so I am using the calculate method for L. The most critical issue is the accumulation of 'ghost inventory' \u2013 orders that are listed as In-transit but are confirmed lost or overdue by many periods. From the Carry-over Insights, these include P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, and P30, totaling 1,298 units. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock to determine the order quantity, I must inflate mu_hat by these 1,298 units to prevent the engine from incorrectly under-ordering. Therefore, the explicit mu_hat is calculated as: (1 + L_avg) * 139 + 1298. With L_avg appearing to be around 2, this is roughly (3 * 139) + 1298 = 1715. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1715 to ensure the system places an order that covers current demand despite the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory remains at 1298 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30). Demand regime P28-P35 avg confirmed at ~139 units/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards starting at Period 28, with the most recent 9 periods (P28-P36) averaging ~135 units. The current period (37) shows an ending on-hand inventory of 152. There is a verified 'ghost' inventory of 1,298 units (representing orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 25, 29, and 30) that are significantly overdue and unlikely to arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (1,495 units) from the calculated base stock, we must inflate mu_hat by the ghost inventory amount to prevent the engine from ordering 0 units. Recent lead times have been 1-2 periods, but given the high frequency of lost shipments, I will use an explicit L=3 to maintain a safety buffer. Mu_hat is set to (1+L)*135 + 1298 = 1838. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=9 to capture the volatility of the new demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 28 has stabilized at an average of approximately 140 units per period (P28-P37 mean \u2248 138.9). Relative to the previous regime of ~80 units, this is a sustained increase. Regarding lead time, recent successful arrivals (P28, P31, P32, P34) show a lead time between 1 and 2 periods, though history shows extreme volatility and permanent shipment losses. The 'In-transit' inventory currently sits at 1686 units, but a significant portion matches identified 'ghost inventory' (lost orders that the OR engine still counts as pipeline). These lost orders are: P2(227), P6(139), P15(175), P18(153), P19(176), P25(324), P29(76), and P30(28), totaling 1298 units. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to this non-existent pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Expected_Demand + Ghost_Inventory. Using L=2 (recent average) and Expected_Demand=140, mu_hat = (1+2)*140 + 1298 = 1718. Sigma_hat is set to 45 (approx 1.5 * sqrt(3) * 17) to account for demand variance and lead-time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Ghost inventory remains at 1298 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30). Demand regime P28-P37 is stable at ~140 units/period. Recent actual lead times have shortened to 1-2 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary challenge remains the cumulative 'ghost inventory' of 1,298 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30) which the OR engine treats as valid pipeline inventory, preventing it from placing necessary orders. I must continue to inflate mu_hat by this total. Regarding demand, we observed a significant peak between P28-P33 (avg ~153), but recent periods P34-P38 show a cooling or stabilization (122, 112, 89, 110, 90; avg ~105). Given this deceleration, I will base the underlying demand on a more recent window (N=10) which captures the transition. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P34 arrived in 2, P31 & P32 in 1). I will set L to 2 to be safe. Base mu_hat is (1+L)*~115 plus the 1,298 offset, totaling ~1643. Sigma is set to reflect the higher volatility seen during the recent peak/drop cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime cooled from P28-P33 peak (~150) to P34-P38 level (~105). Ghost inventory remains constant at 1,298 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The secondary environment is plagued by significant 'ghost inventory' (lost orders still showing in pipeline). As of Period 40, the confirmed lost orders are P2 (227), P6 (139), P15 (175), P18 (153), P19 (176), P25 (324), P29 (76), and P30 (28), totaling 1,298 units. Additionally, P33 (197) and P37 (191) are still within plausible window but add to the high In-transit total (1,686). The OR engine subtracts this entire 1,686 from the base stock. Currently, demand has stabilized in a 'cooled' regime after a spike; the average demand from P34-P39 is 104 units/period. With a lead time of 2, the base stock for (L+1)=3 periods should be ~312 units. To force an order when the engine thinks we have 1,686 units in the pipeline, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Current Ghost Inventory + Required Base Stock). I will set explicit mu_hat to 1610 (1298 ghost + 312 required) to trigger replenishment, using explicit L=2 consistent with recent arrivals and explicit sigma_hat reflecting recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total ghost inventory remains 1,298 units. Period 33 order (197 units) is now 7 periods old and highly likely lost; if confirmed arrived=0 by P41, ghost total will rise to 1,495. Demand regime since P34 is ~104 units/period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P34-P40) is stable at approximately 104 units/period. The critical issue remains the massive 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline (units the OR engine thinks are coming but are actually lost), which prevents it from placing new orders. Confirmed ghost inventory includes P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, and P30, totaling 1,298 units. Additionally, the P33 order (197 units) is now 7 periods old and is confirmed as lost since arrivals for orders placed in P34 have already occurred. This brings the total ghost inventory to 1,495 units. To force the OR engine to order, I must inflate mu_hat to cover both the predicted demand for the lead time and review period (1+L) and the full ghost inventory offset. With L=2 (recent observed average) and demand at ~104, the base requirement is 312 units. Adding the 1,495 unit offset results in a mu_hat of ~1807. I will use 'explicit' to ensure this exact offset is applied to bypass the pipeline calculation logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Ghost inventory increased to 1,495 units (added P33: 197 units, which is now 7 periods old and confirmed lost). Demand regime since P34 remains stable at ~104 units/period. Period 40 conclude confirms no arrivals, solidifying the loss of P33.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary challenge remains the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation, which is polluted by 1,495 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, and recently confirmed P33). Because the OR engine subtracts this entire in-transit amount from the target base stock, we must inflate the mu_hat parameter by adding these 1,495 units to our base demand forecast. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 34, averaging approximately 104 units per period (P34-P41 avg: 101, excluding recent variance). Given the lead time is volatile (1-3 periods, recently 2), I will use L=2. The target base stock calculation: (1+L)*demand + ghost_offset = (1+2)*104 + 1495 = 312 + 1495 = 1807. This ensures the OR backend places an order that accounts for the current inventory gap while ignoring the units that will never arrive. Sigma_hat is set using recent volatility (N=8) to capture the demand spread in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 1,495 units. Current demand regime (P34-P41) is stable at ~104 units/period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (since Period 34) is stable at approximately 104 units per period (P34-P42 average: 100.3). Period 42 conclude shows no arrivals, which is expected as no orders were placed in P38-P40. The total ghost inventory is 1,495 units (P2: 227, P6: 139, P15: 175, P18: 153, P19: 176, P25: 324, P29: 76, P30: 28, P33: 197). These units are permanently stuck in the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation and must be offset. Lead time has recently fluctuated between 1-3 periods, so I will use an explicit L=2 as a balanced estimate. To ensure the OR engine actually places an order despite the 1,807 units in-transit (where 1,495 are ghost units), I set mu_hat to the expected demand over (L+1) periods plus the ghost total: (104 * 3) + 1495 = 1807. This effectively zeros out the pipeline penalty for lost units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P34-P43) has shifted to a lower regime averaging approximately 94 units/period. The current 'In-transit' balance is 1807 units. However, I have identified a cumulative 'Ghost Inventory' of 1495 units (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, and P33) that have significantly exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods and are confirmed lost. These units remain in the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation, preventing it from placing new orders. To bypass this, I must inflate mu_hat by the total ghost inventory. Setting L=2 (recent observed lead time), base demand forecast at 94 units/period for (1+L)=3 periods is 282. Adding the 1495 ghost units results in a mu_hat of 1777. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Ghost inventory remains confirmed at 1495 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33). Demand regime since P34 is stable at ~94 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 34-44 has stabilized at an average of approximately 94 units per period (P34-P44 mean = 93.63), a decrease from the P28-P33 peak. Total ghost inventory remains 1495 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33). These orders are lost but inflate the 'In-transit' figure (1686 units). To force the OR engine to order despite this ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat to cover the actual forecast plus the ghost inventory. Projected demand for (L+1)=3 periods is approximately 282 units. Adding the ghost inventory (1495) results in a mu_hat of 1777. Given we have 63 on-hand and 1686 in-transit (where 1495 is ghost), the functional pipeline is 1686 - 1495 = 191. On-hand + functional pipeline = 63 + 191 = 254. Setting mu_hat to 1777 will prompt an order that accounts for the missing stock. I'll use a slightly higher N for sigma to capture the volatility of demand over the last 10 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 34 has stabilized at a lower level, averaging approximately 92 units/period (using P34-P45). The current inventory situation is critical because 'In-transit' inventory (1714 units) is largely composed of 'ghost units' that the OR engine believes are coming but will never arrive. These lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37) total 1686 units. This is calculated as follows: Confirmed ghost inventory up to P41 was 1495. Period 37 order (191 units) is now 8 periods old with no arrival, confirming it as also lost (total 1495 + 191 = 1686). The OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation (Current In-transit: 1714) includes these 1686 units. To force the OR engine to place any order to meet the current demand (avg ~92), I must inflate mu_hat to offset these 1686 ghost units. I set L=3 as a conservative lead time based on the recent arrival in P44. I set mu_hat to [ (1+L) * Mean_Demand ] + Ghost_Inventory. With L=3 and mean demand ~92, the target base stock is ~368. Adding 1686 gives 2054.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Ghost inventory increased to 1686 units (added P37: 191 units, which is 8 periods old and confirmed lost). Total ghost list: P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37. Demand regime since P34 is stable at ~92 units/period.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 34 has stabilized around ~90 units/period (mean of last 13 samples is 89.2). Actual lead times have been volatile but recently clustered around 2-3 periods for successful arrivals. The primary challenge remains the OR engine's 'In-transit' count (2054 units), which includes a massive amount of 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). The total confirmed ghost inventory is 1686 units. These units are never arriving but effectively block the OR engine from ordering more because it sees them as incoming supply. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat to (1+L)*Forecast + Ghost Inventory. Using L=2 and Forecast=90, the adjusted mu_hat is (3 * 90) + 1686 = 1956. This 'tricks' the backend into thinking the required base stock is high enough to generate a non-zero order despite the inflated pipeline count. Sigma_hat is set to a recent small-sample standard deviation to reflect current stability.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Ghost inventory increased to 1686 units (Total list: P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). These are permanently lost orders erroneously counted as 'In-transit'. Demand regime since P34 is stable at ~90 units/period. mu_hat must be inflated by 1686 to counteract the pipeline calculation error.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P34-P47) has stabilized at an average of approximately 88 units per period, down from the previous peak. I will use N=14 to capture this trend. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' - orders that the OR engine counts as being in-transit but are actually lost. These lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37) total 1,686 units. Because the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock calculated, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by adding these 1,686 units to my demand forecast. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the massive, fake 'in-transit' volume. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to reflect the promised value and recent typical arrivals, despite the high loss rate.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Ghost inventory remains at 1686 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). Demand regime since P34 is stable at ~88 units/period. The total 2054 in-transit units include these 1686 lost units and the 340+28 units ordered in P45-46.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 34-48) has stabilized around an average of 88 units/period. The total in-transit quantity of 2054 units is heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory'\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived and are now technically lost. These lost orders are: P2 (227), P6 (139), P15 (175), P18 (153), P19 (176), P25 (324), P29 (76), P30 (28), P33 (197), and P37 (191), totaling 1686 units. Because the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from its target base stock, I must use 'mu_hat' with the 'explicit' method to override this. To ensure an order is placed, mu_hat must be set to: [(Desired Base Stock) + (Ghost Inventory)]. Based on a demand of 88 units/period and a lead time of 2-3 periods, a safe base stock level is approximately 350-400 units. Adding the 1686 ghost units results in a target mu_hat of ~2036-2086. With 2054 units currently in-transit and 0 on-hand, an explicit value of 2100 for mu_hat will signal the engine to maintain a small buffer while accounting for the calculation error.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory remains at 1686 units. Current demand regime (P34-P48) is stable at ~88 units/period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we face a significant discrepancy between the system's 'In-transit' count (2100 units) and real-world expected arrivals. Based on historical data, multiple orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37) are confirmed lost, totaling 1686 'ghost' units. Additionally, the orders from P45 (28 units), P46 (340 units), and P49 (46 units) are the only ones genuinely in-transit. The OR backend treats all 2100 units as future inventory, which would result in zero orders despite being out of stock. To force the engine to order, I must inflate mu_hat by the total ghost inventory (1686 units). The current demand regime (P34-P49) has stabilized at approximately 88 units per period. I am setting mu_hat to (1 + L) * 88 + 1686 to bypass the pipeline inventory error and ensure replenishment. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals have varied between 1 and 3 periods.
