The product, 'chips(Regular)', has a historical demand average of approximately 158 units per period (samples: 118, 153, 211, 153, 155). The promised lead time is 2 periods. To calculate the needed order quantity, I must cover the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods) to prevent stockouts, as arrivals from a Period 1 order will not be available for sale until Period 3. Average demand over 3 periods is roughly 474 units. I will order 480 units to establish an initial inventory buffer while accounting for the historical volatility observed (specifically the spike to 211).",

Expected demand for Periods 2, 3, and 4 (L+1=3) based on historical samples is ~474 units (average 158 * 3). Since 480 is approximately equal to 474, the pipeline is currently sufficient.

Order P1 (480) is expected in P3 arrival phase. Order P2 (150) is expected in P4 arrival phase. Current on-hand is 0, and sold=0 in P1 and P2 due to 0 inventory. Total in-transit is 630.

Based on historical samples (up to 211) and current data, I expect demand to fluctuate between 150-220 in the coming periods. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (480 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4, but the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0.

In-transit is 630 (480 from P1, 150 from P2). e) Order logic: I have a significant stockout gap (285 units lost demand already).

Over the last five periods (P35-P39), the average demand is ~100.4 units/period, with the most recent demand being 101. For Period 40, I estimate a base demand of 110 units to provide a slight buffer. Total 'Ghost' In-transit inventory remains at 1370 units (lost orders: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33). The total reported In-transit is 1460, meaning the reliable pipeline consists of only P37 (160 units) and P39 (110 units). Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. Current On-hand inventory is 220 units. To cover Period 40 demand (~110) plus provide safety stock against lead time volatility for Period 41, I will target an inventory position (On-hand + Reliable In-transit) of approximately 450 units. Current reliable position = 220 (On-hand) + 160 (P37) + 110 (P39) = 490 units. No new order is strictly required to meet the immediate target, but to maintain a steady flow given the high loss rate, I will place a small sustaining order.",
