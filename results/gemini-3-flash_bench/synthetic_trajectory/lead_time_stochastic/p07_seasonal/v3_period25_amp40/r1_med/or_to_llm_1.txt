Based on the rules, the Period 1 order (placed in Period 1 decision phase) should arrive during Period 1+2=3. I will see the confirmation in the Period 4 start message. Currently, on-hand is 0, meaning we have stocked out for Periods 1 and 2 because lead time is >= 1. 2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand provided (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggests an average of ~158. However, the game history for P1 and P2 shows lower actual demands of 64 and 87. There is a discrepancy between the 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the prompt and the 'Game History' demand. I will prioritize the Game History demands (avg ~75) as they represent the current session. 3. Inventory Position: On-hand = 0. Pipeline = 436 (P1: 213, P2: 223). Total Position = 436. 4. OR Recommendation: OR suggests 39 units. The OR base-stock calculation considers (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2, it looks at 3 periods. 3 periods * ~150 (from historical samples) = 450. Since my pipeline is 436, OR suggests ~39 to reach its target. 5. Strategy: I will follow the OR recommendation. Although actual demand in P1/P2 was lower than historical samples, the pipeline is already quite large (436 units) relative to recent demand. If P1 arrives in Period 3 as expected, I will have 213 units to satisfy demand. Ordering 39 units maintains a steady inflow without over-committing while waiting to confirm the actual lead time.",

This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is lost. I will monitor P4 conclude (visible in P5) to see if P1's order arrives then. 2. Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. Pipeline (In-transit) is 475 units (P1: 213, P2: 223, P3: 39). None have arrived yet, and I have sold 0 units due to stockouts. 3.

Strategy: OR recommends 0 because my pipeline (475) significantly exceeds the base stock calculation for a 2-period lead time. However, because my first three orders are late/missing and I am currently stocked out, I face a risk. If lead time is 3, P1 arrives in P4, P2 in P5, and P3 in P6.

Strategy: My total pipeline (378) already covers 2-3 periods of average demand (~158/period). However, the P2 order of 223 units is late.

Breaking down the pipeline: P6 (275 units) is currently at T+3 (overdue relative to promised L=2, but consistent with observed late arrivals), P8 (160 units) is at T+1. Note: Total in-transit technically includes the lost P2 order (223 units); subtracting this gives a real pipeline of 435 units (P6: 275, P8: 160). 3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand is stable, averaging ~134 units over the last 5 periods (134, 125, 148, 126). 4. Strategy: Current inventory (109) + real pipeline (435) = 544 units. This covers over 4 periods of demand at the current rate (544 / 135 \u2248 4.03). Since the lead time is at most 3 periods, we are currently overstocked due to the sudden arrival of 235 units in Period 8 and the large P6 shipment still pending. The OR recommendation is 0, which aligns with the high pipeline even when accounting for the lost order. I will follow the OR recommendation and order 0 to avoid further holding costs while waiting for the P6 shipment to arrive.",

Historical 'Period X conclude' messages indicate actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P14 arrived in 3, P11 arrived in 3, P12 arrived in 3). Several shipments (P2 and P6) have been confirmed lost in previous Carry-over Insights.\n\n2. **Inventory & Pipeline Evaluation**: Current On-hand is 75 units. In-transit is 748 units. However, we must identify reachable stock. Analyzing the history: \n- P15 order (50 units) is 3 periods old (expected arrival P17 or P18, now overdue).\n- P17 order (50 units) is 2 periods old (expected arrival P19).\n- P18 order (150 units) is 1 period old (expected arrival P20).\nRemaining 'In-transit' balance (748 - 50 - 50 - 150 = 498) consists of the confirmed lost orders (P2=223, P6=275). Effective healthy pipeline is approximately 250 units (P15, P17, P18).\n\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is (90+87+64+114+60)/5 = 83 units. This is a slight decrease from the long-term average (~110 units). For 3 periods (L+1), we need roughly 250-300 units.\n\n4. **Final Strategy**: Total visible healthy stock (On-hand 75 + Pipeline 250) = 325 units. This covers ~3-4 periods of demand at current rates. The OR recommendation is 0 because it counts the full 'In-transit' figure (748), including lost shipments. While I technically have enough coverage if P15/P17/P18 arrive, the high volatility and history of losses suggest placing a small 'bridge' order of 50 units to maintain a buffer, as current On-hand (75) is below a single period's average demand.",

The last five periods (P30-P34) have seen demands of 136, 139, 189, 163, 122 (average 149.8). I will plan for a mean demand of 150. \n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0. Realistic pipeline (P30, P31, P32, P33, P34 orders) is 750 units. My target inventory for (L+1)=3 periods should be ~450 units plus safety stock. Total exposure needed is approximately 600 units. \n4. **OR Baseline Reconciliation**: The OR recommends 0 units because it perceives a pipeline of 1448 units as sufficient to cover any demand. However, since 898 of those units are lost and current on-hand is 0, we are at extreme risk of stockouts. Order P30 (150 units) is due, but based on recent volatile lead times (1-3 periods), arrivals are inconsistent. \n5. **Decision**: I will order 150 units to maintain a continuous flow of 150 units per period, matching the new demand regime and compensating for the high volume of lost shipments.",

Since P31 arrived in P32 (LT=1) and P32 arrived in P33 (LT=1), but nothing arrived in P34 or P35, the supplier remains inconsistent, though recent arrivals were LT=1. 2. Demand Analysis: The current demand regime is approximately 140-150 units/period (last 5-period average is 145). 3. OR Recommendation & Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely based on the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 1598 (which it reads as covering many future periods). However, with 0 on-hand and 898 units of that in-transit lost, we must ensure continuity. With a 3-period coverage goal (L+1=3) at 150 units/period, we need ~450 units available.
