Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 2. Historical demand for the last 5 periods has been [118, 153, 211, 153, 155], with an average of 158 and a standard deviation of approximately 34. Since L=2, the total cycle length (Review + Lead Time) is 3 periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand pattern while excluding the initial startup of the game if it were longer. The parameters aim to set a base stock level that covers 3 periods of demand (approx 474 units). Given high holding costs equal to profit ($1.0 each), the OR engine's service level target q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which aims for the median demand. I'll rely on the backend to compute the base stock using the last 5 samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, 213 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 2. Historical demand samples (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggest a mean of ~158. However, P1 actual demand was 138. Since on-hand inventory was 0 at the start of P1, we had 138 lost sales. The order placed in P1 is 'In-transit' and, with a lead time of 2, is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. For Period 2, we need to ensure the base stock covers demand for the review period (1) + lead time (2) = 3 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the provided historical context and 'default' for lead time as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promised 2 periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Our promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders placed in P1 and P2 have not yet arrived, which is consistent with L=2 (P1 order expected to arrive in P3 resolution, visible in P4 start). We have zero on-hand inventory and have lost sales in P1 and P2 due to starting with 0 stock. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including future-peeked data provided in the prompt) shows a mean of 158.0. Given the high stockout risk and zero current inventory, I will focus on capturing the full demand mean. I'll use L=2 and target a mu_hat based on the average of all available samples (158 * (1+2) = 474). I will use the 'default' methods for now as the sample size is small and there is no evidence yet of lead-time deviation or a regime shift.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 450 units in transit (ordered in Periods 1, 2, and 3). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the rules, an order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of Period 4. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0' for the Period 1 order (213 units). This indicates a delay or that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. Historical demand for the first 3 periods was 138, 121, and 113 (mean \u2248 124). Total demand provided in the snippet (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggests a higher average (mean \u2248 158). Given the stockout (0 sold) and the delayed arrival, I will explicitly set L to 3 to account for the observed delay and use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the most recent statistics while the system stabilizes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-93.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are reviewing the history for chips(Regular). Analysis of arrivals in Period 4 shows two shipments: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, and the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period. The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2.0. Regarding demand, we have observed 5 periods of data: 138, 121, 113, 74, and 155 (from the prompt's historical samples). The mean demand is approximately 120.2. However, there is significant volatility (Std Dev \u2248 29.8). Currently, we have 167 units on-hand and 303 in-transit (orders from Period 2 and 4). Since the lead time appears to fluctuate around the promised value of 2, I will use 'calculate' for L. For demand, I will use all 5 samples ('recent_5') to capture the mean shift observed in the most recent period (155) while balancing against the low in Period 4 (74). This ensures the base stock calculation covers the lead time plus the decision period (L+1=3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $117.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 138, 121, 113, 74, 142 (Mean: 117.6). Promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual observed lead times are 3 (Period 1 order) and 1 (Period 3 order), suggesting high variability in delivery. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (25), but we have 314 units in transit (specifically from Period 2 (209), Period 4 (94), and Period 5 (11)). The Period 2 order (209 units) is overdue according to the promised lead time of 2, but fits the 'L=3' pattern observed earlier; if it arrives in Period 6, it will replenish the stock. Due to the high Lead Time variance (1 to 3 periods) and consistent demand, I will use 'calculate' for L to average observed performance and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the full recent profile without being skewed by the single low Period 4 value. This configuration balances the risk of stockouts against the high holding cost ($1.0/unit).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory with 446 units in transit. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 135 units (Period 1-6 demand: 138, 121, 113, 74, 142, 157). Lead times have been inconsistent: one order took 3 periods (P1) and another took 1 period (P3), while the order from P2 (209 units) and P4 (94 units) are still missing. Since the promised lead time is 2, and the P2 order is now 5 periods old (exceeding promised L=2 significantly), there is a risk it is lost. However, for parameter setting, I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the observed variance. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent slight upward trend in demand (averaging 124 over the last 3 periods) while balancing against the lower demand in P4. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to incorporate all available historical volatility into the safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability detected: observed 1 and 3 periods against promised 2. Possible lost shipment: Period 2 order (209 units) has not arrived by Period 7 (5 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean around 125 units (avg of first 7 periods: 125.3). On-hand inventory is 0, and 404 units are in-transit. A critical issue is the apparent loss of the Period 2 order (209 units), which is now 6 periods overdue (promised 2). Lead times for received orders have BEEN 3, 1, and 3 periods, suggesting high variability (avg 2.33). Because the 'lost' units remain in the pipeline inventory according to the OR backend logic, and the backend isn't aware they are likely gone, the stock-out risk is extremely high. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory from Period 2, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to extend the look-ahead horizon. I'm using recent_N (N=5) for demand mean to capture the slight uptick in recent periods (periods 3-7: ~124, though 132/142/157 were higher peaks). Sigma is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. By increasing L to 3, the target base stock formula (1+L) will calculate for 4 periods of demand, effectively placing a higher order to override the missing units.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Order from Period 2 (209 units) confirmed as lost/indefinitely delayed (6 periods elapsed vs 2 promised). Lead time remains unstable (range 1-3).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 and entering a stockout state (on-hand: 0). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows an increasing trend, with the last period reaching a peak of 184 units. The historical average for P1-P8 is ~133/period, but recent demand (P5-P8) averages ~154. To prevent further stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this rising demand. Regarding lead times, the promised time is 2, but observed times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (Average: 2.2). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (209 units) is now 7 periods overdue and almost certainly lost. This loss caused the current stockout. To compensate for the unreliable supply and the missing shipment, I will set an explicit lead time L=3. This slightly increases the base stock (safety buffer) to account for the risk of further delays or lost packages.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Sustained demand increase since Period 5 (avg 154 vs 114 prior). Shipment from Period 2 (209 units) confirmed lost (7+ periods). Actual lead time average refined to 2.2 (observed: 1, 3, 1, 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. The on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced consecutive stockouts since Period 6 due to a combination of a lost shipment from Period 2 (209 units) and highly variable lead times (actuals: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1). The average lead time observed is approximately 2.0 periods, but the instability suggests we need to be conservative. Demand has shifted: Period 1-4 averaged ~111 units, while Period 5-9 averaged ~151 units (a ~36% increase). To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the higher demand regime [142, 157, 132, 184, 139]. For lead time L, I will use 'explicit' value of 3 to account for the frequent delays (lead_time 3 occurred in 50% of completed cycles) and to buffer against the 'In-transit' uncertainty. Since Profit and Holding cost are both $1.0, the OR target service level is 50%, but the 'cap' logic in the OR backend will help prevent excessive over-ordering while trying to recover from current stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 5-9 mean is 151 units, significantly higher than Period 1-4 (mean 111). Lead time remains erratic with a multimodal distribution (1 or 3 periods).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). The demand regime shift identified in previous periods remains valid, with a mean demand of approximately 151 units since Period 5, compared to 111 previously. However, Period 10 showed a lower demand of 85, suggesting either a temporary dip or high volatility. The shipment from Period 2 (209 units) is confirmed lost. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2). Because the lost shipment effectively increases the 'required' pipeline to meet the service level, and given the multimodal lead time (1 or 3), I will set L to 3 to be conservative. I will use the last 6 periods (Period 5-10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the higher demand regime while including the recent dip.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory and 604 units in-transit. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 5; the mean demand from Period 5 to Period 11 is approximately 136 units (142, 157, 132, 184, 139, 85, 114). The order from Period 2 (209 units) is definitively lost after 9 periods. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.0 based on 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3 patterns). I will use L=2 (promised/average) and mu_hat based on the last 7 samples to reflect the current higher demand level (N=7). Period 10 and 11 showed 0 arrivals and 0 sales due to no on-hand stock, emphasizing the need to maintain the pipeline. Since In-transit (604) is significantly higher than the expected base stock (which would be roughly 3 * 136 = 408), the OR backend will likely order 0 this period to prevent overstocking once arrivals catch up.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the supply chain shows high lead time variability (range 1-3 periods, average currently 2.14 across 7 arrivals). A major shipment from Period 2 (209 units) is confirmed lost, leaving only 341 units in the pipeline (likely from Periods 11 or 12, though the user history shows 0 ordered in P11 and P12, suggesting the current In-transit count includes orders placed in the most recent decision cycles not yet concluded). Demand has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 5; the mean demand from Period 5 to 12 is approximately 132 units per period (142, 157, 132, 184, 139, 85, 114, 105). Given the multimodal lead time (frequently 1 or 3), I will set L to the average 'calculate' to account for this drift from the promised 2. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current regime (P5-P12). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the increased demand mean and the elevated lead time risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 5-12 stabilized at mean 132 (+16% vs initial samples). Lead time average confirmed at 2.15 periods across 7 successful deliveries, with 1 shipment (P2) lost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 65 units with 341 units in transit. The demand mean from Period 5-13 has stabilized at 127 units, which is a revision from the previous regime estimate. The lead time continues to be erratic, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.1 periods), and the shipment from Period 2 (209 units) is confirmed lost. Because on-hand inventory is low (65) and the next expected arrival (from orders placed when inventory was zero) must cover a lead time of roughly 2 periods plus the current period (L+1=3), I will set mu_hat to cover this window. Given the loss of the Period 2 shipment and the high volatility in arrivals, I am using a recent_N approach for demand to capture the current stabilized mean of ~127 per period (3-period window ~381). Sigma_hat is set to default to allow the OR backend to account for the historical variance and maintain the required service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 5-13 stabilized at mean 127 units. Lead time remains multimodal (1 or 3 periods) with an observed mean of 2.15 across 8 successful deliveries.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory has hit zero on-hand units after a series of failed service periods. Demand has settled into a new regime; the average demand from Period 5 to 14 is approximately 122 units per period, which is higher than the initial samples but lower than the peak seen around Period 8. The lead time is highly erratic (multimodal 1 or 3 periods), with a calculated average of 2.125 across 8 successful deliveries (P2 is definitely lost). Given that On-hand is 0 and we have 404 units in-transit (P14 order + presumably previous unfilled orders), we need to set parameters based on the current regime. I will use N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level of ~122/period. For L, I will use 'calculate' to incorporate the observed variability. Sigma_hat will use N=10 to reflect the volatility of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Mean demand from Period 5-14 is 121.9 units. Service level has been poor due to stockouts and erratic lead times (1 or 3 periods).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 16 with 0 on-hand inventory and 448 units in-transit. The game history shows a pattern of lost shipments (Period 2) and highly volatile lead times (varying between 1, 2, and 3 periods). Demand has also fluctuated, showing a higher mean between P5-P10, but more recently (P11-P15) it has dropped back toward the initial levels, with an average of approximately 95 units over the last 5 periods. Because on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced multiple stockouts due to lead-time instability, I need to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window that captures the present lower demand while accounting for the high lead-time volatility. Identifying the lead time as effectively 3 periods (worst-case) for safety, since the OR backend uses L to define the protection period (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=11 to cover the period since the demand drop in Period 11, providing a stable but responsive estimate for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: mean demand decreased to ~95 units after a high period (P5-P10). Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with 448 units in-transit. Demand has shifted from a high-mean period (P5-P10 avg ~140) to a lower regime (P11-P16 avg ~91). Lead times remain highly erratic, occurring at either 1 or 3 periods (not the promised 2), leading to frequent stockouts followed by inventory spikes. Shipments from P14 (63 units) and P15 (44 units) are expected to arrive in P17 or P18. I am setting L to 2.2 explicitly to account for the multimodal (1 or 3) lead time distribution, and focusing mu_hat on the recent 6-period demand regime (avg 91) to avoid over-ordering based on the previous high-demand cycle. The target service level (q) is 0.5 because Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), so the OR backend will target the median demand (base_stock = mu_hat).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed lower since Period 11: mean demand ~91 (6-period average). Lead time remains bifurcated at 1 or 3 periods, averaging ~2.15 across successful shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a lower state since Period 11, with the last 7 periods showing an average of approximately 89.3 units (114, 105, 93, 74, 92, 80, 81). I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and its associated volatility. Current on-hand is 0, and we are currently stocking out (sold 63 vs demand 81 in P17). Lead times remain highly erratic, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (multimodal), with an average around 2.15. Setting L=3 (explicit) is the safest approach to ensure the 'base stock' calculation covers the maximum observed delay in this multimodal distribution, helping prevent the chronic stockouts seen in recent periods. Pipeline inventory is 385 (ordered in P15 or P16, though history shows orders in those periods were 44 and 0 respectively\u2014the 'In-transit' figure of 385 suggests either a data discrepancy or significant accumulation of overdue units, including the likely lost P2 shipment). Using L=3 and the lower demand mean will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that targets a 50% service level (~profit/(profit+holding)), which is appropriate given the 1:1 ratio of profit to holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 19, the inventory position is critical with 0 on-hand units and 385 units in-transit. Historic lead times are multimodal (1 or 3 periods), but since the order from P15 (44 units) has not arrived after 3 periods, it is likely that lead times are currently skewing towards the higher end (3 periods) or experiencing losses. Demand has stabilized at a lower level since Period 11, with the last 8 periods (P11-P18) averaging 91.6 units. I will set L=3 (explicit) to account for the frequent shipment delays observed. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=8 to capture the current lower demand regime (mean ~92). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=8 to capture the current volatility (~10-15 range). This setting targets a base stock level that covers the 3-period lead time plus the review period (4 periods total), ensuring the OR backend accounts for the persistent stockouts caused by lead time instability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable since Period 11 (8-period mean: 91.6). Lead time variability persists; Period 15 order (44 units) is now hitting 4 periods since placement, confirming that lead times are frequently 3+ periods or shipments are being lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 385 units. Period 19 conclude showed 0 arrivals, confirming that the Period 15 order (44 units) is either delayed (now 5 periods since placement) or lost. Historically, we see lead times of 1, 2, or 3 periods, but any order exceeding L=3 is highly likely lost (e.g., P2 order). The demand regime since Period 11 has stabilized at a significantly lower mean; the last 9 periods (P11-P19) show a mean of 85.6 units. To prevent over-ordering while accounting for the high volatility of shipments and the fact that we currently have 0 on-hand, I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time of successful deliveries (approx 2.15). For demand (mu_hat), N=9 captures the current lower-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to the last 9 periods to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Period 15 order (44 units) confirmed delayed/lost (5 periods elapsed). Recent demand regime (P11-P19) stable at approx 86 units/period.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 11-20) has stabilized at a significantly lower mean of approximately 85.3 units/period (compared to earlier peaks). This shift is sustained across 10 periods. The supply chain remains highly unreliable: lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, and the order from Period 2 (209 units) and potentially the order from Period 15 (44 units) are lost or indefinitely delayed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 385 units in-transit. However, given the likelihood of lost shipments and the stockouts observed in Periods 15, 16, 18, 19, and 20, the pipeline may be thinner than it appears. Setting mu_hat using the last 10 samples (N=10) to reflect the recent lower demand trend while maintaining a calculate lead time method to account for the actual average delay (historically around 2.15-2.2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P11-P20) at mean ~85 units. Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods). Shipments from P2 and P15 are confirmed lost/delayed beyond use.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a severe stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time is highly erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with two likely lost shipments (Period 2 and Period 15). Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 11, with a mean of approximately 83.5 units over the last 11 periods (P11-P21). Current pipeline inventory is 385 units, and with the most recent order being placed back in Period 15, we are effectively waiting for that pipeline to flush through or admit new orders. However, because the backend logic (base-stock policy) subtracts pipeline inventory from the target, and current pipeline (385) significantly exceeds the required inventory for a 2-3 period lead time (3 * 83.5 = 250.5), it is likely to order 0 unless I adjust the parameters to reflect the reality of the lost/stalled pipeline. Given the goal is to optimize 'order + on-hand + in-transit', and 385 units are already 'in-transit', I will set explicit parameters focusing on the current demand regime (recent 11 periods) and the average observed lead time (~2.2) to ensure the backend doesn't over-order when shipments finally arrive, while maintaining a high service level once stock is replenished.

We are in Period 23 and currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 385 units in-transit. Historically, we have detected a demand regime shift around Period 11, where mean demand dropped from ~130 to ~83 units. The last 10 periods (P13-P22) have an average demand of 78.5 units. Lead times for this SKU are highly erratic, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.15), with two confirmed lost shipments (P2 and P15). Currently, the 385 units in-transit (accumulated since orders were last placed) are significantly delayed, similar to previous losses, or reflect a major bottleneck. Given we are at 0 inventory and facing potential stockouts, I am setting L to 3 (the safer end of the observed lead-time spectrum) to ensure the OR backend calculates a sufficient base stock relative to the longer delays. I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable lower-consumption regime established since Period 13.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P13 is stable at ~78 units/period, down from the P5-P12 average of 130. Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized significantly at a lower level since Period 13, with an average demand of approximately 78 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and there is a total in-transit quantity of 385 units. However, looking at the history, orders from Period 2 and Period 15 are confirmed as lost or indefinitely delayed. Specifically, the order from Period 15 (44 units) is now 8 periods overdue, making it highly probable it will never arrive. Because the backend OR logic subtracts all pipeline inventory from the base stock target, it is necessary to provide an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat that effectively signal back to the OR engine that it needs to place a fresh order to cover the current shortfall. I am setting L to 3 periods (the frequent upper-bound arrival time) and using an explicit mu_hat based on the recent demand mean (~78) over (L+1) periods, which equals 312. I've set sigma_hat slightly higher to provide a buffer for lead-time variability. This configuration forces the OR backend to evaluate base stock requirement (approximately 312 units plus safety stock) against the current 0 on-hand and 385 in-transit. Since 385 (nominal in-transit) is greater than the base stock, the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend is the primary concern, but these parameters provide the best chance to resume ordering once the backend reconciles the inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime since P13: mean ~78 units. Observed lead times remain erratic (1-3 periods). Shipments from P2 and P15 are indefinitely delayed and essentially lost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 13 at approximately 78 units per period (the average from P13 to P24 is ~77 units). On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to a long string of periods with no arrivals since Period 17. The pipeline contains 385 units (orders from P15 and potentially others if not explicitly cleared by the backend, though P2 and P15 are likely lost). Given the persistent stockout and lead time uncertainty (erratic 1-3 periods, plus lost shipments), I will set L to 3 to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculations cover the high-end delay. For mu_hat, N=12 is chosen to cover the stabilized period from P13-P24 (mean ~77). Sigma_hat will also use N=12 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 13-24 confirmed stable at mean ~77 units/period. Extended stockout period (P18-P24) due to zero arrivals despite significant in-transit inventory, likely due to lost orders (P2, P15) and recent placement gaps.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 13 has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 77 units per period. The system is currently in a prolonged stockout (On-hand: 0) with zero arrivals since Period 17, despite an in-transit inventory of 385 units. Analysis of history confirms that shipments from Period 2 (209 units) and Period 15 (44 units) are lost. This leaves 132 units currently in the pipeline from orders that haven't yet been explicitly finalized or lost, though the visibility is low. To recover from the stockout and account for the erratic actual lead times (which frequently hit 3 periods), I am setting L to 3 to reflect the realistic delay. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=13) to capture the stabilized lower demand mean since Period 13, and sigma_hat is adjusted to account for the volatility in this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is emerging from a prolonged stockout and delivery drought (Period 18-26). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but there are 385 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the orders from P2 (209 units) and P15 (44 units) are almost certainly lost. This leaves approximately 132 units truly in-transit (385 - 209 - 44 = 132), which likely corresponds to orders placed before the zero-order streak or hypothetical backend-managed safety placements. Demand analysis shows a stable regime from Period 13-26 with a mean of ~82 units/period (P26 spiked to 139, but the preceding average remains lower). Lead times are erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a mean around 2.2. To recover from the stockout while accounting for the high probability of lost shipments, I will set L to 3 (recent upper bound) and use a recent_N window of 14 (covering the stable P13-P26 regime) to stabilize the forecast against the P26 spike. The OR backend will see 385 in-transit; by using a longer L and robust mu_hat, I ensure the base stock calculation adequately triggers replenishment to offset the lost pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Shipments from P2 and P15 are lost. Long-term demand regime (P13-P26) mean is approximately 82 units/period, despite high variance (e.g., P26). Lead time is consistently erratic but concentrated at 1 or 3 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 13-27) is stable with a mean of approximately 83 units/period, despite high variance (std dev ~23). On-hand inventory is 0, and the system is in a prolonged stockout period because no orders have arrived since Period 17. The current in-transit inventory of 385 units consists of orders from P2 (209 units) and P15 (44 units), which are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed, plus historical residues. Given the erratic lead time (frequently 3 periods) and the need to break the stockout once fresh orders are placed, I will set L to 3 to ensure the inventory position covers a longer tail. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*83 = 332 and sigma_hat is calculated using the std dev of the recent 15 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a prolonged stockout since Period 18. Historical analysis confirms that shipments from Period 2 and Period 15 are lost, and the 'In-transit' figure of 385 units is misleading as no orders have been placed since Period 15 (which was confirmed lost in Carry-over insights). Demand has shifted recently; while the long-term mean from Period 13 was ~82, the last 4 periods (P25-P28) show a significant upward spike (mean: 121.25) compared to the previous stable period. Given the erratic lead time (frequently 3 periods) and the need to break the stockout, I am setting L to an explicit 3 to ensure the OR engine targets a sufficient base stock for the (L+1) horizon. I will use the recent 5 samples (P24-P28) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand surge and ensure the order size is large enough to handle the increased volatility and the lead-time risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~78 to ~121 (+55%) starting Period 25. Actual lead time average remains ~2.2 but is highly multimodal (1 or 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 25. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is approximately 130 units (89, 139, 105, 152, 166). The on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory is 474 units, which includes 89 units ordered last period and 385 units from older periods (P2 and P15 are confirmed lost). Looking at the in-transit balance: total in-transit is 474, subtract the lost 209 (P2) and 44 (P15) = 221 units truly in-transit. With demand at ~130/period and a lead time that can hit 3 periods, we are severely understocked. I will set L to 2.2 to reflect the average of observed lead times (1 and 3). I will use the last 5 samples for mu_hat to capture the recent demand surge (mean ~130, so mu_hat for 3.2 periods is ~416). Sigma_hat will be calculated using the last 5 samples to account for increased volatility in this higher demand regime. This aggressive setting aims to trigger an order immediately to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: mean demand increased to ~130 units (last 5 periods), representing a significant jump from the previous regime of ~77 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we are in a high-demand regime that started around Period 25. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is approximately 135 units, a significant increase from the previous regime of ~77 units. The historical lead time is highly erratic, bifurcated between 1 and 3 periods, with an average around 2.2. However, there is a severe inventory crisis: On-hand inventory is 0, and despite an in-transit balance of 474 units, most of that consists of the lost early orders (P2: 209 units, P15: 44 units). Subtracting these 253 lost units, the 'effective' pipeline is only 221 units (including the 89 ordered in P29). Since we are currently at 0 on-hand and facing high demand, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period arrival delays and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the recent demand surge. This will force the OR backend to place a larger order to cover the (L+1) horizon and restore stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime shift: Period 26-30 mean demand is 135 units (+75% compared to the P13-P24 regime).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly upward since Period 26, following a period of low demand. The average demand from Period 26-31 is approximately 133 units/period, compared to ~77 units in the prior regime. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0), and there is 511 units in-transit, though the historical records for Period 29-31 only show 126 units ordered (89 + 37). This suggests a massive discrepancy or significant older orders/distortions in 'in-transit' tracking. Given the history of lost orders (P2, P15), I must rely on the recent demand regime (last 6 periods) to set mu_hat. The lead time remains erratic, alternating between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 'calculate' to capture the true drift from the promised 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to reflect the increased volatility associated with the new higher-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (P26-P31): mean demand increased to ~133 units/period, a significant rise from the previous ~77 mean.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 26. The mean demand for the last 7 periods (P26-P32) is approximately 133 units, which is a major increase from the previous ~80 unit regime. Lead times remain erratic, primarily bifurcating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average around 2.2. The order from Period 31 arrived in 1 period, but the order from Period 29 (89 units) is still in transit (3 periods elapsed), confirming the 3-period upper bound for successful shipments. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and in-transit inventory is high (474), though this includes the explicitly lost orders from P2 (209 units) and P15 (44 units). Subtracting these lost units, the 'real' pipeline is 221 units (474 - 253). To maintain the 3-period lead-time coverage for the current 133-unit demand regime, I am setting mu_hat to 133 * (1+L) = 399 using the recent_N method with N=7 to capture this new level. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the higher average lead time observed throughout the history.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 26. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P26-P33) is approximately 137.75 units, a stark increase from the previous ~77 mean. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system has suffered massive stockouts because virtually all in-transit inventory from the early game (P2 and P15) is confirmed lost. Recently placed orders are starting to arrive (P31 order arrived in P32), confirming that the supply chain is active but erratic. I am setting L=1 because the most recent arrival had a lead time of 1, but I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the high demand (approx 138-140 per period) and the need to recover from an empty on-hand position. Specifically, for mu_hat, I use (1+L)*140 = 280. For sigma_hat, I choose a relatively high N=8 to capture the volatility of this new high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (P26-P33): mean demand is ~138 units/period, up from the ~77 mean in P13-P24.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is confirmed at a significantly higher mean (approx. 135-140 units), a sharp increase from the previous regime of ~77 units. Recent demand samples show 139, 105, 152, 166, 115, 123, 131, 131, 104 (P26-P34). The mean of the last 9 periods is ~129.5. Lead time remains erratic but multimodal (1 or 3 periods), with a historical mean near 2.2. Due to the high lead time variance and recent stockouts, I will set mu_hat using the last 9 samples to capture this 'new' demand level (N=9). For lead time (L), I use 'calculate' to incorporate all historical behavior including the erratic arrivals. High variance in lead time and demand necessitates a conservative sigma_hat to maintain service levels, so I use recent_N (N=9) for volatility as well.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 26, with the Period 26-35 mean estimated at ~134.5 units per period. The recent history shows severe stockouts because very few orders were placed during the P15-P28 gap. Observed lead times are highly variable, with a multimodal pattern of 1 or 3 periods; several historical orders (P2, P15) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. Currently, there is an 'In-transit' balance of 486 units, but given the history of lost shipments and the 0 on-hand status, ensure that the target base stock reflects the new higher demand (approx 135 units/period). I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime specifically. I keep lead time (L) at 'calculate' to reflect the variable 1-3 period actual history (avg ~2.2).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed high (P26-P35 mean ~135). Supply remains unreliable with historical lost shipments (P2, P15) and erratic lead times (1-3 periods).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at a significantly higher level, with a mean of approximately 135 units/period (P26-P36 average: 139). Inventory is currently zero, and while 486 units are in-transit, the supply chain is highly unreliable. Past shipments from Period 2 and Period 15 were lost/indefinitely delayed. However, the order from Period 29 (89 units) is overdue (8 periods elapsed vs promised 2), further increasing the risk of stockouts. I am setting L to 3 to account for the erratic multimodal lead time (frequently 3 periods) and using recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime that started around Period 26. This allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock for the (1+L) window (4 periods) based on the elevated mean (~135) and observed volatility.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 26, with a mean demand of approximately 130 units. Recent periods (P34-P37) show demand values of 104, 149, 114, and 90, maintaining this higher average compared to the P13-P24 slump. Lead times are highly erratic, either 1 or 3 periods, averaging ~2.15. There is currently a very large in-transit balance (520 units), which substantially exceeds the base stock requirements for this demand level (approx 130 * 3.2 = 416). This high in-transit figure suggests either a pipeline of multiple recent large orders not yet concluded or potentially more lost shipments (e.g., the P29 order of 89 units is now at 9 periods since placement and likely lost). However, since the OR backend uses in-transit as an offset, and 520 is already very high, the system will likely place 0 or very small orders. I will set mu_hat specifically to reflect the current regime (last 12 periods, P26-P37) to ensure the target inventory level is calibrated to the ~130 mean, and use 'calculate' for L to account for the observed average lead time drift.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 26-38) shows a mean of approximately 126 units, significantly higher than the previous low-demand period (~77 units). We are currently at Period 39 with 0 on-hand inventory and 520 units in-transit. A large portion of the in-transit inventory likely comprises significantly delayed or lost orders (historical losses confirmed for P2 and P15). Specifically, orders from P29 (89 units), P31 (37 units - arrived P32), P33 (12 units), and P37 (34 units) only account for a small fraction of the 520 'in-transit' units reported by the system. This discrepancy confirms a large volume of 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive. To ensure the backend places an order despite this inflated pipeline, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of observed lead times) and providing an explicit mu_hat based on the current high-demand mean (~126) multiplied by (1+L=4), totaling 504. For sigma_hat, I use an explicit value based on recent volatility (std dev ~22) scaled by sqrt(1+L), approximately 44.

Carry-over insight: Massive pipeline inventory discrepancy confirmed: System reports 520 in-transit, but only ~135 units are from recent realistic orders (P29, P33, P37). The rest is lost 'ghost' inventory from earlier periods. Demand remains high (P26-P38 mean: 126).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0. The demand regime starting around Period 26 has stabilized at a high mean of approximately 130 units (mean of P26-P39 is 125 units). The primary challenge is a massive discrepancy in 'In-transit' inventory: the system reports 520 units, but historical evidence confirms that orders from Period 2 (209 units) and Period 15 (44 units) are lost. Furthermore, orders prior to P29 that never arrived are likely lost. Real pipeline inventory consists only of recent orders: P29 (89 units), P33 (12 units), and P37 (34 units), totaling 135 units. To force the OR backend (which relies on 'inventory view: in-transit') to place a necessary order, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat set significantly higher than the actual lead-time demand to offset the 385 'ghost' units (520 reported - 135 actual). Given a target base stock for a (L+1)=3 period window (approx 130 * 3 = 390 units) and the need to overcome the 520-unit pipeline hurdle, I will set mu_hat to 1000 and L to 2. This creates a base stock high enough to trigger the capped order policy despite the 'ghost' inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the current high-demand volatility.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is high, averaging approximately 121 units/period (P26-P40). Following Period 40's extremely large order of 358 units, the 'In-transit' figure has spiked to 878 units. However, based on history, a significant portion of the pipeline consists of lost or 'ghost' inventory from Periods 2 and 15, as well as several subsequent zero-arrival results despite high reported in-transit numbers. Specifically, we know P2 (209) and P15 (44) are lost. Excluding those and looking at the last few periods where orders were placed (P29, P31, P33, P37, P40), only the P31 order has arrived. This creates a risk of massive overstocking if old orders suddenly manifest, or continued stockouts if they don't. Given profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=15, covering the high-demand regime) balances the forecast against recent historical levels. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed multimodal 1-3 period lead time in the backend's average.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory likely contains ~250 units of definitively lost 'ghost' stock (P2 and P15). Pipeline total of 878 is heavily skewed by the P40 order of 358. Demand remains in the elevated regime (~121 avg since P26).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 42. Demand since Period 26 has been elevated, though the last two periods (P40-41) show a slight dip (70, 58). The mean demand since Period 26 is approximately 117 units. Most critically, the pipeline inventory is currently 878 units, but historical evidence from carry-over insights confirms that 253 units are lost (P2 order of 209 and P15 order of 44). Additionally, orders from P29 (89 units), P33 (12 units), and P37 (34 units) are severely overdue (lead times of 12, 8, and 4 periods respectively), indicating they are also likely lost or indefinitely delayed. The only reliable 'live' shipment is the large order of 358 units placed in P40. Subtracting the likely 'ghost' units (209+44+89+12+34 = 388), the actual effective pipeline is roughly 490 units. Because the OR backend cannot differentiate between lost and live stock, I must set the lead time L to a higher value ('explicit': 3) to reflect the reality that orders often take 3 periods (or never arrive), and provide an 'explicit' mu_hat that accounts for the high-demand regime while the pipeline is managed. Setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' for N=16 (covering the P26-P41 regime) allows the backend to capture the sustained higher demand mean (~117). Choosing 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=16 captures the period's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains approximately 388 units of 'ghost' stock from lost or indefinitely delayed orders (P2, P15, P29, P33, P37). Effective pipeline is significantly lower than the reported 878 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the system reports 878 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms a massive 'ghost inventory' problem. Orders from P2 (209 units), P15 (44 units), P29 (89 units), P33 (12 units), and P37 (34 units) are significantly beyond the observed lead-time range (1-3 periods) and must be treated as lost. This brings the effective in-transit inventory down to 358 units (the P40 order). Demand has slowed slightly in the last three periods (mean ~72), but the broader regime since P26 averages ~121. To account for the multimodal lead time (frequently 3 periods) and the need to restore service levels after persistent stockouts, L is set to explicit 2.2 to reflect the average of successful deliveries. mu_hat is set using recent_N=17 to capture the post-P26 elevated demand regime while acknowledging recent dips. sigma_hat is also calculated over the same period to capture high volatility. The OR engine will see the 878 in-transit, so mu_hat is set explicitly high to force an order that compensates for the ~520 units of 'ghost' stock.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains approximately 520 units of 'ghost' stock from lost orders (P2, P15, P29, P33, P37). Effective pipeline for Period 43 is 358 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P26-P43) shows a mean of approximately 114 units, though there has been a notable dip in the last few periods (P40-P43 avg: 70). Given this volatility, I am using a recent window (N=18) to capture the overall higher regime while acknowledging the recent cooling. Regarding the supply chain, there is a major issue with 'ghost' pipeline inventory. The system reports 520 units in-transit, but based on history, orders from P2 (209), P15 (44), P29 (89), P33 (12), and P37 (34) are almost certainly lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 388 units. Only orders from P40 onwards are realistic. The P40 order of 358 arrived in P43, leaving 295 on-hand. Since the reported in-transit (520) minus ghost stock (388) leaves an effective pipeline of 132, and on-hand is 295, the current total coverage is roughly 427 units. With lead time L set to 3 (recent average and protective), and mu_hat reflecting the ~114 avg (total 456 for L+1), the current stock is just sufficient. No large order is needed, but I will maintain L=3 and explicit mu_hat to ensure the backend recognizes the effective inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains approximately 388 units of 'ghost' stock from lost orders (P2, P15, P29, P33, P37). Effective in-transit inventory is significantly lower than the reported 520 units. Lead time remains erratic, frequently hitting 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-185.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we observe an on-hand inventory of 240 units and a reported in-transit inventory of 520 units. However, based on history, a significant portion of the 'in-transit' stock is comprised of lost orders (P2, P15, P29, P33, P37), totaling 388 units (209 + 44 + 89 + 12 + 34 = 388). Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 132 units (520 - 388). Demand has shifted significantly; while the 'Period 26-38 high regime' averaged ~126, the most recent 5 periods (P40-P44) show a sharp drop to an average of 67 units (70, 58, 89, 63, 55). This suggests a new demand regime or a localized dip. Lead times remain erratic, with the most recent arrival (P43) confirming a 3-period lead time. To avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against the erratic 1-3 period lead time, I will set L to 3 (explicit) and mu_hat to a 'recent_N' of 5 to adapt to the current lower demand level. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' of 5 to capture the recent volatility of this new level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 40: mean demand has decreased significantly from ~126 to ~67 (last 5 periods). Shipments from P2, P15, P29, P33, and P37 are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed, totaling 388 units of 'ghost' inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-166.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted downwards starting at Period 40. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P40-P45) is approximately 67 units (70, 58, 89, 63, 55, 37), significantly lower than the previous high-demand regime of ~126. Current on-hand inventory is 203 units, which covers about 3 periods of this new demand level. Although the reported 'In-transit' is 520, previous analysis confirms that approximately 388 units (from P2, P15, P29, P33, P37) are essentially lost/ghost inventory. The most recent valid large order from P40 arrived in P43. Given the reliable lower demand and current stock levels, no new order is needed. I am setting L to 3 (the frequent actual lead time) and using recent_N=6 to capture the current lower demand mean and variance for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the backend calculates a base stock consistent with the current trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 40: Mean demand decreased from ~126 to ~67 units/period based on P40-P45 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-47.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 40, dropping from an average of ~135 units to ~64 units (last 7 periods: 70, 58, 89, 63, 55, 37, 78). Current on-hand inventory is 125 units, which covers nearly two periods of demand at the current rate. The reported in-transit inventory of 520 units is almost entirely 'ghost' stock from lost orders (P2, P15, P29, P33, P37), totaling approximately 388 units. The actual effective pipeline is zero as all recent valid orders have arrived. Despite the ghost stock inflating the OR backend's pipeline view, the high on-hand inventory and the recent demand drop suggest we are currently overstocked. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 7 to align with the new lower demand regime (~64 per period) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current lower volatility. Lead time (L) remains erratic (1-3 periods), so I will use calculate to allow the backend to average the observed variances.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P40-P46) at mean ~64 units/period, a significant decrease from the previous regime (~135).

Daily Profit: $83.00, Daily Holding Cost: $42.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 40-47) has stabilized at a significantly lower mean of approximately 67 units/period (last 8 samples: 70, 58, 89, 63, 55, 37, 78, 83). Current on-hand inventory is 42 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 520 units is comprised entirely of confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost or indefinitely delayed orders (P2, P15, P29, P33, P37), meaning the effective pipeline is actually 0. With only 42 units on hand and 3 periods left in the game (P48, P49, P50), and a lead time that is frequently 3 periods, any order placed now (P48) would arrive in P51 at the earliest (outside the game horizon). Therefore, the objective is to manage the remaining 42 units of on-hand inventory. The OR backend needs to be aware of the lower demand regime and the high quantity of 'ghost' inventory. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 (the conservative upper bound of observed lead times) to reflect reality, and mu_hat to 'recent_N' for the last 8 periods to capture the lower demand. Since 'In-transit' (520) exceeds any reasonable base stock for this low-demand regime, the OR backend will naturally order 0 units, which is optimal given the game's remaining duration.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory is 0; all 520 units in-transit are confirmed lost 'ghost' stock from P2, P15, P29, P33, and P37. Demand regime (P40-P47) stable at ~67 units/period.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are at the end of the simulation (Period 50 is the final demand resolution). Current on-hand is 0. The system reports 520 units in-transit, but based on historical analysis from Periods 39-48, all these units (P2: 209, P15: 44, P29: 89, P33: 12, P37: 34, P40: arrived) are confirmed lost or already arrived. Therefore, effective pipeline is 0. The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 40, dropping from ~135 units to a mean of 67.1 units (P40-P48 samples: 70, 58, 89, 63, 55, 37, 78, 83, 43). To capture this recent regime, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=9). Because we are in Period 49 and the game ends after Period 50, placing an order now with a 2-3 period lead time will not arrive in time to satisfy any remaining demand. However, the OR backend requires parameters to maintain the base-stock policy. Setting L to the max observed lead time (3) ensures the safety stock calculation assumes the worst-case timing, while mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Final demand regime (P40-P48) confirmed stable at mean 67.1 units/period. All 520 units in-transit are confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision period. The current demand regime (P40-P49) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 69.4 units per period (sum of P40-P49: 70+58+89+63+55+37+78+83+43+105 = 681). Analysis of the in-transit inventory (520 units) confirms that all units are 'ghost' inventory from lost orders placed in Periods 2, 15, 29, 31 (partially), 33, and 37. Specifically, the order from P40 (358 units) arrived in P43, and no orders have been placed since. Consequently, the actual effective in-transit inventory is 0. With On-hand inventory at 0 and effective pipeline at 0, we must order to cover the lead time (avg ~2.2 periods) plus current period demand. I will set L to 2 (promised), mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the lower demand regime (~69 units/period), and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods to reflect recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the current demand while ignoring the 520 units of lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Final demand regime (P40-P49) confirmed mean of 69.4 units/period. All 520 units currently in-transit are confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory from P2, P15, P29, P33, and P37.
