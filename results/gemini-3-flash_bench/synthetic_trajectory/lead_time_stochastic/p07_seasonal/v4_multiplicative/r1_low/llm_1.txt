The product 'chips(Regular)' shows a historical five-period demand average of 131 units (150, 163, 134, 139, 69). Note the drop to 69 in Period 5. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) is expected to arrive during P3 and be available for sale in P4. To cover demand from P1 through P3 (the current period plus the lead time), I need to account for approximately three periods of demand. Using the historical average (~130 units/period) as a baseline, the demand for P1, P2, and P3 totals 390 units. Since I start with 0 inventory and 0 in-transit, I will place an initial order to establish a baseline stock level. I will order 400 units to cover the lead time demand and provide a small safety buffer for initial variability.",

{
  "rationale": "We are at Period 50, the final decision period of the simulation. In Period 50, any order placed will have a minimum lead time of 1-3 periods, meaning it will arrive after the game has concluded and thus cannot be sold. Therefore, the optimal strategy for the final period is to place an order of 0 to avoid unnecessary holding costs on inventory that cannot contribute to revenue. Current on-hand inventory is 114 units, which is sufficient to cover the expected demand for the final period (recent mean ~80-100 units). Any ending inventory at the conclusion of Period 50 will incur a holding cost, so maximizing sales from existing stock without adding more cost is the priority.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Period 50: Final period reached. Strategy shifted to clearing on-hand inventory; no further orders placed as they would arrive after simulation end.",
