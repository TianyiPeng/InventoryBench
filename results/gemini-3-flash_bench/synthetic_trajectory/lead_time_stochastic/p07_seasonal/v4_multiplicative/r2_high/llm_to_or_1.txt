Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Currently, there are 0 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Looking at the historical demand samples (P1: 150, P2: 163, P3: 134, P4: 139, P5: 69), the average demand is approximately 131 units, but there is a significant drop in P5 (69). Given the lack of specific calendar dates or product descriptions beyond 'Regular chips', I will initialize the forecast using all available samples to establish a baseline. The target service level q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95. I will set the lead time to the promised 2 periods (L+1 = 3 periods of coverage). I'll use 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to process the provided historical samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we started with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand was 137, but since the 191 units ordered at the start of Period 1 had not arrived yet (promised lead time is 2), we sold 0 units and ended with 0 inventory. The 191 units remain in-transit. For Period 2, we expect the demand to follow the historical pattern provided (150, 163, 134, 139, 69). The mean of these 5 samples is 131. Since the sample sizes are small and we are at the beginning of the game, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand mean and variance to capture the initial distribution. I will stick with the promised lead time (L=2) for now as we have no evidence of drift yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (191 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 3 conclude message (which I will read at the start of Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order hasn't arrived yet, leading to lost sales since Period 1. The in-transit inventory of 378 units consists of orders from P1 (191) and P2 (187). Looking at historical demand (P1: 150, P2: 163, P3: 134, P4: 139, P5: 69 - though the game history just reported P1: 137 and P2: 157), the demand appears relatively stable around 140-160 units until the drop in P5. I will use the 'default' method for L (2 periods) as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available historical samples (default) to establish a baseline, as the 'recent' demand drop in the prompt's data (Period 5) has not been reached in the current game state (Period 3).

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period_4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (191 units), Period 2 (187 units), and Period 3 (118 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have had 0 sales due to no arrivals. I will adjust the lead time 'L' to 3 periods to account for the delay. Demand history shows Period_1: 150 (initial sample list, though history says 137), Period_2: 163 (history: 157), Period_3: 134 (history: 136), Period_4: 139, Period_5: 69. Using the combined data from the provided history and sample list, the average demand is approximately 130-140 units. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level while accounting for the expected L=3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1691.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first set of arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1 and 3. Interestingly, both arrived in Period 4, indicating variable lead times (Period 1 took 3 periods, Period 3 took 1 period). The promised lead time is 2. The mean demand across the first 5 periods (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) is approximately 131 units, but Period 5 shows a significant drop to 69. However, looking at the 'Period 4 conclude' message, the demand recorded there was 100, and history shows higher values earlier. On-hand inventory is 209 and in-transit is 317 (from Period 2 and Period 4 orders). Given the lead time variability (average of 3 and 1 is 2), I will stick with the 'calculate' method for L to incorporate observed performance. For demand (mu_hat), the recent period drop needs to be balanced against earlier higher demand; I'll use recent_N with N=5 to capture the full history available while acknowledging the recent slowdown. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the observed volatility.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 59 units following a demand of 150 in Period 5. Examining the lead time history: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), and the Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. The averaged observed lead time is 2.0 periods ((3+1)/2). I will set L to 'calculate' to use this observed average. Regarding demand, the samples are: 150, 163, 134, 139 (pre-game) and 137, 157, 136, 100, 150 (game history). The most recent sample (Period 5) was 150. There was a slight dip in Period 4 (100), but the mean remains relatively stable around 140. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime while smoothing out the Period 4 outlier. This results in a base stock calculated over (1+2)=3 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $401.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 36 units. Analyzing the history: Promised lead time is 2. Observed lead times have been 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), indicating high variability (average 2). Total in-transit is 558 units (orders from P2, P4, P5, P6). The P2 order (187 units) is now overdue (placed P2, expected P4/P5, currently P7 start), suggesting a potential delay or loss, though it's too early to confirm a total loss. Demand samples are: 137, 157, 136, 100, 150, 23. Period 6 saw a significant drop to 23, but given the product is 'chips(Regular)', this is likely a random fluctuation rather than a regime shift. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the observed variability. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N of 5 to balance the recent low demand with the previous higher levels. This will set the base stock to cover expected demand over the next 3 periods (L+1).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, we have 69 units on-hand and 468 units in-transit. Data analysis shows significant lead time variability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period, and Period 4 arrived in 3 periods. The average observed lead time is currently 2.33 periods. Demand has shown high volatility (ranging from 23 to 157). Period 5 and 6 orders (69 and 172 units respectively) are still in-transit. Given the lead time fluctuations, I will use 'calculate' for L to allow the system to average observed arrivals. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5-period average is approx 81, whereas the historical average is around 114. Given the massive drop in Period 6 (23) followed by a partial recovery in Period 7 (97), I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent volatility while maintaining sufficient base stock to cover the 468 units already in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is unstable, varying between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.33). Demand showed a significant temporary dip in Period 6 (23 units) but returned closer to mean in Period 7 (97 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1302.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe chips(Regular) with an on-hand inventory of 104 and a large pipeline of 390 units. Historical lead times show significant volatility, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1), averaging 2.2 periods against a promised 2. Demand has been fluctuating recently: after a significant dip in Period 6 (23 units), it has stabilized somewhat in Periods 7 and 8 (97 and 74 units respectively). Given the high pipeline (390 units) relative to recent demand, the OR engine's capped policy will likely restrict new ordering to prevent excess holding costs. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the higher average actual lead time (approx 2.2). For demand forecasting, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the volatility post-Period 3, encompassing the low outliers and recent recovery. This balances the risk of stockouts from lead-time delays against the cost of overstocking during demand fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased after Period 5: Mean demand across P4-P8 is approx 89, compared to P1-P3 avg of 143 (-38%). Lead time remains highly erratic, strictly alternating between 1 and 3 periods over the last 5 arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1245.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the chips(Regular) SKU shows a clear downward shift in demand and highly volatile delivery lead times. Over the first five periods, the average demand was approximately 136 units/period; however, from Periods 6 to 9, the average demand dropped to approximately 66 units/period. The lead time is currently erratic, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with an analytical average slightly above the promised 2. To account for this demand regime shift and ensure responsiveness to the reduction, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 (covering the lower demand period). For lead time, I'm using the 'calculate' method to utilize the historical average of observed lead times (approx 2.4), which is safer than the default 2 given the recent 3-period arrivals. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the increased variance relative to the lower mean demand, ensuring a suitable service level while managing on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 6: mean demand halved from ~135 to ~66. Lead time is non-stationary, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1254.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11, the product is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). Period 10 experienced a demand spike of 133 units, which is a significant deviation from the recent lower-demand regime (mean ~66) observed since Period 6. This spike exhausted all inventory and caused 67 units of lost sales. Regarding lead times, the history shows an oscillating pattern of 1 and 3 periods (Average = 2). The order from Period 6 (172 units) is now 4 periods old and has not arrived; however, no other orders are missing, so I will suspect a delay or loss but focus on the pipeline. Total in-transit is 372 (P6: 172, P9: 13, P10: 187). Given the recent demand spike and the need to restore inventory, I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the last 5 periods (P6-P10, mean ~79) to better capture the volatility while maintaining L=2 to reflect the average lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the increased volatility (std \u2248 42) observed in the recent period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased: after a Period 6-9 low (~66), Period 10 saw a spike to 133. Order from Period 6 (172 units) is currently 4 periods overdue (Promised L=2, observed max L=3), suggesting potential shipment loss or severe delay.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand 0). Demand has recovered from the Period 6-9 low (avg ~66) to a higher level (Period 10: 133, Period 11: 113), averaging 123 over the last 2 periods and ~100 over the last 8. The shipment from Period 6 (172 units) is now 5 periods overdue (Promised L=2, observed max L=3), which strongly suggests it is lost. In-transit inventory (426) consists of orders from P9 (13), P11 (54), and the likely lost P6 (172), plus others not yet concluded. Because the backend includes the potentially lost 172 units in the pipeline inventory, it will under-order. To compensate and rebuild stock, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for the erratic shipping delays (1-3 periods) and 'explicit' mu_hat to set a baseline demand of 110 per period across 4 periods (L+1), totaling 440. Sigma_hat is set to a high 'explicit' value of 60 to protect against recent high volatility (133 vs 23) and prevent further stockouts during this recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Period 6 shipment (172 units) is 5 periods overdue and highly likely lost; pipeline inventory is inflated. Demand has shifted back up from the Period 6-9 dip, now averaging ~100+ over the last 5 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out (on-hand: 0). The shipment from Period 6 (172 units) is now 6 periods overdue relative to its placement, while the maximum observed lead time has been 3 periods. I am officially treating this shipment as lost to prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to an inflated pipeline (In-transit: 526, but 172 of that is likely phantom). Demand has rebounded from a mid-game dip (P6-P9 avg ~66) to a high-demand regime (P10-P12 avg ~134). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 'long' lead time observations (3 periods) and to build a buffer against the erratic delivery pattern. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand surge (P10-P13), which averages 129 units per period. Over a (L+1)=4 period horizon, this justifies a base stock targeting ~516 units. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility seen in the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Shipment from Period 6 (172 units) is 6 periods overdue and confirmed as lost; pipeline data is unreliable. Demand regime has returned to high levels (avg ~130) since Period 10.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Demand has returned to a high-regime (avg ~143 over the last 4 periods: 133, 113, 157, 171). The order from Period 6 (172 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is definitively lost. Consequently, the 'In-transit' figure of 595 is inflated by 172 units; the true pipeline is 423 units (from P11, P12, P13). Lead times are unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, so I am using L=3 to be conservative. To recover from the stockout and account for the lost shipment's impact on pipeline-based calculations, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (+/-(1+L)*mean), and increasing sigma_hat to account for high volatility (std dev is ~25, sqrt(1+3)*25 = 50). This will signal the OR backend to place a larger order to reach a safer base stock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 6 shipment (172 units) is lost. Demand has stabilized in a high-regime (~143/period) since Period 10.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1026.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 10, with an average of approximately 142.4 units per period (P10-P14: 133, 113, 157, 171, 138). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline inventory is heavily distorted by a confirmed lost shipment from Period 6 (172 units). The OR backend's capped policy relies on pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit). Including the lost 172 units in the pipeline calculation will cause the backend to under-order, leading to stockouts. To correct for this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the current demand regime and artificially offsets the lost 172 units. Calculated base stock needed for a lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage) at demand ~143 is 429 + safety stock. To signal the backend to order sufficiently despite the 172-unit phantom inventory, I will inflate mu_hat to ensure the 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation yields a robust order. Lead time (L) is set to 3 based on recent arrivals (P11, P9, P8 all took 3 periods).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to a higher regime since Period 10, with the recent 6 periods (P10-P15) averaging approximately 134.3 units per period. Prior insights suggest significant volatility and a lost shipment from Period 6 (172 units), which has artificially inflated the pipeline inventory (In-transit=707). To account for this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current high-demand regime properly. The lead time (L) has historically fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with most recent arrivals (P14, P15) exhibiting a lead time of 3 periods. Given the promised lead time of 2 and the observed inconsistency, I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to average known lead times while I provide robust demand forecasts to buffer against the risk of the lost shipment's impact on ordering logic.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand is in a high regime, averaging ~122 units over the last 7 periods (P10-P16). The lead time remains unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with most recent arrivals (P14, P15, P16) confirming a lead time of 3 periods. The shipment from Period 6 (172 units) is now 10 periods overdue and confirmed lost, which inflates the 'In-transit' figure of 638. To correct for this, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom pipeline inventory. I will use a recent_N of 7 for demand (mean ~122) and set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the current delay pattern. This helps the OR backend target a base stock level that accounts for the 3-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=4 periods of demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility. After a high-demand period (P10-P14 avg ~142), the last three periods (P15-P17) have seen a cool-down (avg ~71). This suggests a possible shift back to a lower-demand regime or high variance. The shipment from Period 6 (172 units) is confirmed lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 576 is significantly inflated (actual active pipeline is 404 units). Lead times have settled at 3 periods for the last four arrivals (P14-P17). To account for the recent demand volatility and the lost shipment, I am setting L to 3. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat to capture the high-demand peak and the recent dip, providing a balanced forecast across the lead time. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=8 to capture the high variability observed in this window.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (last 4 arrivals: P11, P12, P13, P14 all arrived with L=3). Demand is currently in a high-variance phase following a high-demand regime ending P14.

Daily Reward (R_t): $759.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the inventory situation is critical with only 1 unit on-hand. Historical analysis reveals two key factors: first, the shipment from Period 6 (172 units) is definitely lost, which inflates the system's pipeline inventory; second, the lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed consistently from P11 through P14). Demand has entered a lower phase recently (P17: 21, P18: 40), but this follows a high-demand regime, suggesting high variance. To correct for the lost shipment and the known lead time of 3, I am explicitly setting L=3. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 9 periods (P10-P18) to capture the average demand of approximately 108 per period, covering both the spikes and the recent dips. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N=9' to account for the high volatility observed in this timeframe. These parameters will force the OR backend to target a base stock sufficient for (L+1)=4 periods of demand while recognizing the actual lead time is longer than promised.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time stabilization at 3 periods across last 5 arrived shipments (P11-P14 orders). Recent demand (P17-P18) shows a significant dip compared to the P10-P16 average of ~130.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a lower-demand phase compared to the high-demand regime observed between Periods 10-16 (avg ~130). Over the last three periods (P17-P19), demand has averaged 42 units (21, 40, 66). I will use a N=5 window for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent downturn while maintaining a safety buffer. Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last six arrivals (P11-P14 orders), so I will set L to 3. In-transit inventory of 594 units includes the confirmed lost order of 172 units from Period 6; the OR backend's capped policy will account for pipeline inventory, but the explicit mu_hat and higher L should help trigger necessary orders despite the inflated 'in-transit' figure on the dashboard.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand (P17-P19) has consistently dropped to a lower regime averaging ~42 units, compared to the previous regime of ~130.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the product is in a low-demand regime. Average demand from Period 17 to Period 20 is approximately 55.75 units, a significant drop from the high-demand phase (P10-P16) that averaged ~130. The Period 6 shipment (172 units) is confirmed lost and must be discounted from the pipeline. Recent arrivals (orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14) have consistently shown an actual lead time of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. The pipeline currently contains 594 units (including the lost 172), which is very high relative to the current demand regime. To prevent excessive holding costs while acknowledging the higher demand in P20 (96), I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current demand shift and set L=3 to match the stabilized lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 17: average demand dropped to ~56, down from ~130. Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last 5 successful arrivals (P11-P14 orders).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently, with a sharp drop in Periods 17-19 followed by a sudden spike to 96 and 115 in Periods 20 and 21. This suggests the low-demand regime was temporary or the variance has increased significantly. Calculating mu_hat over the last 5 periods (P17-P21: 21, 40, 66, 96, 115) gives an average of 67.6, which is more representative of current conditions than the long-term history. The lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (last 5 arrivals all had L=3). I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this recent volatility while adjusting for the stabilize lead time. The in-transit inventory is high (594), but much of this is likely due to the lost Period 6 shipment (172 units), which is still erroneously included in the system's pipeline inventory calculation. Setting L to an explicit value of 3 ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the actual observed lead time rather than the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has surged again: after a brief low (P17-18), demand escalated for 3 consecutive periods (P19-P21) reaching 115. Average demand for the last 5 periods is ~68.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and demand has surged in the last 4 periods (96, 115, 113), recovering from a brief dip. The demand regime from Period 19-22 averages ~98 units, while the previous 10-period average was higher. Lead time analysis indicates a stable pattern of 3 periods (observed consistently for orders from periods 11-14). The order from Period 6 (172 units) is confirmed lost, which means the 'In-transit' figure of 594 is inflated by 172 units. The actual reliable pipeline is 422 units (594 - 172). To address the current stockout and the recent upward demand trend, I am setting L to 3 (explicit based on recent history) and mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the recent recovery and volatility). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the high local variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P19-P22 average demand is ~98, ending the P17-P18 dip. Reliable pipeline inventory is 422 units (In-transit 594 - 172 lost from P6).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly returned to a high regime, with the last four periods showing demand of 96, 115, 113, and 145 (avg ~117.25). This confirms the end of the P17-P18 dip. Lead time has consistently stabilized at 3 periods for all successful deliveries since P11. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory is 594 units. However, we acknowledge that 172 units from Period 6 are lost/stalled, leaving an effective pipeline of 422 units. Note that Period 4 and Period 8 showed erratic lead-times of 1, but the last 5 arrivals (P11-P14 orders) have all been exactly 3 periods. To ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand at the current high-demand level, I will set L to 3 and use recent_N=5 for demand (covering the recovery phase P19-P23) to capture the higher mean and variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully recovered and stabilized in a high-regime range (avg ~117) since Period 19. Lead time remains stable at 3 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is currently in a state of chronic stockout with zero on-hand inventory. Demand has stabilized in a high-regime (P19-P24 avg: ~107 units) following a brief dip in P17-P18. Lead time has been consistently observed at 3 periods for all successful recent arrivals, which is longer than the promised 2 periods. Critically, the order from Period 6 (172 units) is permanently lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 594 is inflated; the actual reliable pipeline is 422 units (594 - 172). However, even this 422 units is insufficient to cover the demand over the lead time (L+1 = 4 periods) given current high demand. I am setting L to 3 (recent stabilization) and mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current high-demand regime (~107/period). This will signal the OR backend to place an immediate, large order to recover inventory and meet the sustained high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand has settled into a high-demand regime (avg ~107/period) over the last 6 periods (P19-P24). Predicted pipeline inventory must exclude the 172 units from Period 6 which are confirmed lost.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the primary challenge is managing a stockout and reconciling pipeline inventory. On-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' quantity is 594 units, but carry-over insights definitively confirm that 172 units from Period 6 are lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is 422 units (594 - 172). Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods based on historical arrivals (orders from P11-P14). Demand has shifted between regimes several times; the most recent 7 periods (P19-P25) show a mean demand of approximately 99 units (96, 115, 113, 145, 104, 57, and the current P26 context). Setting L=3 reflects the actual observed lead time of 3 periods. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime while accounting for the recent dip in P25. The OR engine will subtract the 'effective' pipeline from the calculated base stock to determine the order; setting L=3 and using recent demand data ensures we aim for a target inventory that covers the 4-period window (L+1).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Demand shifted to a high regime from Period 19-24 (avg ~117) but has cooled in the last two periods (P25: 57, P26: 78). The average demand over the last 8 periods (P19-P26) is approximately 97 units. Lead time has been stable at 3 periods for all recent arrivals (P11-P14 orders). The significant in-transit figure of 594 units includes the 172 units from Period 6 which are confirmed lost. Adjusting for the loss, the reliable pipeline is 422 units (orders from P15 onwards). To recover from the stockout while accounting for the stabilized 3-period lead time and current demand volatility, I will set L to 3 and use recent_N (N=8) for demand forecasting to capture the post-dip recovery and recent cooling. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient for L+1 periods (4 periods) of demand (~388 units), which is currently covered by the adjusted pipeline, though new orders may be suppressed by the backend until the actual arrivals from Period 15+ materialize.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: after a high-demand regime (avg ~117, P19-P24), the last two periods (P25-P26) show a cooling trend (avg ~68). Lead time is consistently 3 periods based on all arrivals since Period 14.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state is currently critical with 0 units on-hand and 594 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 172 units ordered in Period 6 are confirmed lost, meaning the effective pipeline inventory is 422 units. Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last several successful arrivals. Demand has shown high volatility: after a high-demand regime (avg ~117, P19-P24), the last three periods (P25-P27) have cooled significantly to an average of 70 units (57, 78, 75). I am using recent_N (N=9, covering P19-P27) to capture both the high-demand peaks and the recent cooling trend, resulting in a balanced mean estimate for the next 4 periods (L+1). L is set to explicit=3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time instead of the promised 2. mu_hat is set via recent_N (N=9) to reconcile the most recent full regime of activity, and sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=9) to account for the high variance observed across these shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed over P25-P27, averaging 70 units/period, following the P19-P24 high-demand regime.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand = 0). Demand has cooled from a peak of ~145 (P23) to a current low-demand regime averaging 69.25 units over the last 4 periods (P25-P28: 57, 78, 75, 67). Lead time is stabilized at 3 periods for the last several successful arrivals, though no shipments have arrived since P17. The pipeline inventory is reported as 594 units, but must be adjusted by -172 units due to the confirmed loss of the Period 6 shipment. Adjusted pipeline = 422 units. Note: No orders have been placed since Period 19, which explains the ongoing stockout; arrivals from P14-P15 orders likely already passed through. I will set L to 3 (stable observed lead time) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the current fulfillment delay and use recent_N=4 for demand to reflect the current cooling trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: P25-P28 average demand is 69.25 units, significantly lower than the P19-P24 average of 113 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P25-P29) has stabilized into a lower regime, with the last 5 samples being 57, 78, 75, 67, and 77 (mean ~71). This is significantly lower than the P19-P24 average of ~113. Lead time has been consistently 3 periods for all successful deliveries since P14. The shipment of 172 units from Period 6 is confirmed lost (now 23 periods overdue), making the effective pipeline inventory 422 units (594 total In-transit - 172 lost). Despite the high pipeline, on-hand inventory is 0 and no new orders have been placed since Period 19. Setting L=3 and using a recent 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat correctly captures the current lower demand trend while the backend base-stock calculation accounts for the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a lower-demand regime (avg ~71) for the last 5 periods (P25-P29). Pipeline reliability is impacted by the confirmed loss of 172 units from P6.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 594 units in-transit. However, 172 units from Period 6 are confirmed lost, and the large order of 217 units from Period 15 is now 15 periods overdue (Promised L=2, Observed L=3), suggesting it is also lost. Adjusting for these losses, the functional pipeline is significantly lower. Demand has been in a cooling phase (avg ~77 over P25-P30), but Period 30 showed a slight uptick to 108. I will set L to 3 (stabilized lead time for successful arrivals) and use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (avg ~77) while accounting for the recent volatility. Sigma_hat will use the same window to reflect current variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Shipments from Period 6 (172 units) and Period 15 (217 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 389 units of unreliable pipeline inventory. Demand regime remains in a lower state (avg ~77) compared to the mid-game peak.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P27-P31) has shifted back upward, averaging approximately 90 units per period, compared to the previous low-regime average of 70. Lead time remains consistently observed at 3 periods for all successful deliveries. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 594 units includes two confirmed lost shipments from Period 6 (172 units) and Period 15 (217 units), totaling 389 units. The actual effective pipeline is only 205 units (594 - 389), while the current on-hand inventory is 0. To reconcile this, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (avg ~90) and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods to capture current volatility. I set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the stabilized actual lead time, ensuring the OR engine calculates the base stock correctly for a 4-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed total lost pipeline inventory of 389 units (P6: 172 units, P15: 217 units). Demand regime has shifted upward again in the last 5 periods (P27-P31), averaging 89.6 units compared to the P25-P28 average of ~70.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is facing a critical inventory shortage with 0 on-hand units and no successful arrivals since Period 17. Lead time has historically stabilized at 3 periods, but multiple shipments are now confirmed lost: Period 6 (172 units), Period 15 (217 units), and Period 19 (18 units) is now 11 periods overdue. This results in 407 units of ghost inventory in the pipeline (In-transit: 594 - 407 = 187 actual units). I am setting L to 3 to reflect the consistent delivery speed of successful orders. Demand has shifted back to a higher regime, averaging 107.2 units over the last 5 periods (P28-P32: 67, 77, 108, 121, 115). I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this upward shift and ensure the OR backend attempts to rebuild inventory to meet the current demand level, while naturally accounting for the inflated pipeline inventory by increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat expectations.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 19 shipment (18 units) is also likely lost (11 periods overdue). Total lost pipeline inventory is now 407 units. Recent demand (P28-P32) shows a return to high-regime demand averaging ~107 units.

The system currently faces a significant stockout with 0 on-hand inventory.

The effective pipeline is actually only 187 units (594 - 407), none of which have arrived since Period 17's arrival of the P14 order. Demand has shifted back to a high-regime state, with the last five periods (P29-P33) averaging 105 units. Lead time has been consistently 3 periods for all successful terminal arrivals. I am setting L=3 explicitly and mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this recovered demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods to account for recent high volatility. This configuration ensures the base stock calculation targets enough inventory to cover the lead time and the next period's demand, while the OR engine's cap logic will prevent excessive ordering once the actual pipeline status is accounted for via the internal logic.

Carry-over insight: Current reliable pipeline inventory is only 187 units; 407 units (orders from P6, P15, and P19) are confirmed lost and must be manually discounted from 'In-transit' for decision making. Demand has returned to a high-demand regime averaging ~105 units since Period 29.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P29-P34) has stabilized in a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 108.6 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), and the pipeline inventory reported as 594 units includes 407 units from orders in Period 6 (172), Period 15 (217), and Period 19 (18) that are significantly overdue and confirmed lost. Therefore, the reliable pipeline is only 187 units. Lead time has been consistent at 3 periods for all successful arrivals since Period 14. To ensure stock availability given the 3-period lead time and the current stockout, I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods of recovered demand (N=6) to capture the current high-regime. Setting L to 3 reflects the actual observed lead time rather than the promised 2. Using recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat will account for the current volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline integrity verification: Total lost inventory stands at 407 units (P6, P15, P19). Last arrival occurred in P17; no shipments have arrived for 17 consecutive periods, confirming a catastrophic breakdown in the supply chain arrivals or massive shipment losses.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has effectively collapsed, with no arrivals since Period 17 (18 periods ago). Specifically, shipments from Period 6 (172 units), Period 15 (217 units), and Period 19 (18 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 407 units of unreliable 'In-transit' inventory. Although the system reports 594 units in-transit, only 187 units (from orders placed in early periods that never arrived or are stuck) remain statistically 'pipeline', though their arrival is highly doubtful. Demand has stabilized into a high-volatility regime, averaging 110 units over the last 5 periods (P31-P35). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and no replenishment is arriving, the priority is to signal a large required stock level to the OR backend. I am setting L=3 based on the last known stable period before the total stoppage, and using an explicit mu_hat reflecting (1+L)*110 (recent mean) to force an order that compensates for the massive lost pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to a high explicit value to account for the increased demand variance observed in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain catastrophic failure: No arrivals observed for 18 consecutive periods (since P17 conclude). Total confirmed lost inventory now totals 407 units (P6: 172, P15: 217, P19: 18). Pipeline data is non-functional.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has experienced a catastrophic failure, with no arrivals since Period 17 (19 periods ago). Based on the history, 407 units are confirmed lost (P6: 172, P15: 217, P19: 18). The current 'In-transit' of 594 reflects these ghost units plus 187 units that haven't arrived despite being extremely overdue. Effectively, the pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has recently cooled (P35: 77, P36: 36), but the average over the last 15 periods is ~95. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) covers the volatile period (P29-P36 avg ~91). Given the total lack of arrivals, L is set to an 'explicit' 10 to reflect the severe delivery delays and force the OR engine to trigger replenishment, though the pipeline inventory logic may block orders unless the lost units are accounted for by the backend. Explicit sigma is used to handle the high variance seen in recent transitions.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: No arrivals for 19 consecutive periods. Total confirmed lost inventory (407 units) must be manually discounted from the 594 units in-transit to understand true pipeline state (187 units remaining, all severely overdue).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has experienced a catastrophic failure with no arrivals for 20 consecutive periods (since P17 conclude). Total confirmed lost inventory is 407 units (P6: 172, P15: 217, P19: 18). While 'In-transit' shows 712 units, the true reliable pipeline (excluding lost units and including the P37 order of 118) is only 305 units (712 - 407). Demand has cooled significantly over the last three periods (P35-P37) with an average of ~52 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime. Given the extreme lead-time uncertainty (L=3 is the last known stable state but currently it is essentially infinite) and 0 on-hand inventory, I must continue placing orders to eventually satisfy demand when arrivals resume. I will set L to 3 (most recent stable) and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (N=3 to capture the abrupt cooling trend) and sigma_hat to reflect current local demand conditions.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse continues: 20 consecutive periods with no arrivals (last arrival P17). Total reliable pipeline inventory is only 305 units after discounting 407 confirmed lost units from the in-transit total.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe disruption with no arrivals observed since Period 17 (21 consecutive periods of stockouts). On-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 712 units, but historically confirmed losses include Period 6 (172 units), Period 15 (217 units), and Period 19 (18 units), totaling 407 units of unreliable 'ghost' inventory. This leaves a reliable pipeline of 305 units (712 - 407 = 305). Despite these pending orders (including the 118 units ordered in Period 37), nothing has arrived, suggesting either a permanent shift in lead time or total logistics failure. Demand appears to remain in a volatile state, with recent values ranging from 44 to 127. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=10) to capture the current demand fluctuations properly. L is set to explicit=8 to reflect the severe delivery delays seen, which forces the OR backend to increase the target base stock and potentially trigger new orders to overcome the pipeline gap, even though previous orders have not arrived.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure persists: 21 consecutive periods with no arrivals. Total confirmed lost inventory remains 407 units (P6: 172, P15: 217, P19: 18). Reliable pipeline is 305 units, all significantly overdue.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a total collapse, with no arrivals since Period 17 (22 consecutive periods). Historical lead times showed a stabilization at 3 periods prior to this failure, but recent behavior suggests an 'explicit' lead time adjustment is necessary to account for extreme delays. The total 'In-transit' of 857 units is significantly unreliable as it includes confirmed or highly probable lost shipments from P6 (172), P15 (217), and P19 (18), totaling 407 lost units. This leaves a 'real' pipeline of 450 units (including the orders placed in P37 and P39). Demand has been volatile but recently shows a lower regime; the average demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is approximately 70 units. I am setting L to 5 to account for these extreme delays while using a recent window for demand (N=5) to reflect the current cooling trend. The high profit margin vs. holding cost ($19 vs $1) dictates a high service level, which is why I am maintaining orders despite the inflated pipeline, as actual inventory on-hand remains zero.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse continues: 22 consecutive periods with no arrivals. Total confirmed lost inventory stands at 407 units (P6: 172, P15: 217, P19: 18). Any order placed since P20 is significantly overdue.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2115.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has finally resumed operations after a 22-period outage. In Period 40, we observed the arrival of the Period 39 order (145 units) with a lead time of 1 period. This suggests that the catastrophic failure has cleared and we are back to a functional, albeit potentially short, lead time regime. Demand has been volatile but averages approximately 100 units over the last 15 periods. Given that the Period 39 order arrived so quickly, I will set L=1 to reflect this recent arrival. I will use the recent_N method (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime, which is higher than the P35-P37 dip but lower than the historical maximums. Regarding the pipeline: we must ignore the 407 units confirmed lost (P6, P15, P19) and the 118 units from P37 which are now 4 periods overdue and likely lost as well. The OR backend needs to replenish stock to meet the current demand trend while accounting for the fact that most 'In-transit' units are phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Period 39 order arrived in Period 40 (L=1), ending a 22-period arrival drought. Lead time appears to have shifted to 1 period. Total confirmed lost inventory now includes 525 units (P6: 172, P15: 217, P19: 18, P37: 118).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has shown signs of recovery with a shipment from Period 39 arriving in Period 40 (lead time = 1). However, the overall pipeline remains severely compromised by past failures: shipments from P6 (172), P15 (217), P19 (18), and now P37 (118) are confirmed lost or effectively non-existent, totaling 525 units of ghost inventory. Subtracting this from the reported 712 'in-transit' units leaves a true pipeline of 187 units (orders from P20-P36 where order volume was 0, meaning zero reliable units are truly on the way except what we order now). Demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime averaging 91.8 units over the last 10 periods (P32-P41). I will set L to 1 to reflect the most recent arrival speed, mu_hat to a recent 10-period average, and sigma_hat based on recent high volatility to ensure the OR backend orders enough to combat the zero on-hand and phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed total lost/phantom pipeline inventory is 525 units (P6: 172, P15: 217, P19: 18, P37: 118). Most recent arrival (P39 order) confirms a lead time of 1 period, signaling a shift from the previous 3-period stabilization. Demand has stabilized into a high-volatility regime averaging ~92 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with the arrival of the Period 39 order in Period 40 (Lead Time = 1). However, 525 units of pipeline inventory (from P6, P15, P19, and P37) are confirmed as lost or phantom inventory, as they are severely overdue and arrivals have resumed for more recent orders. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Demand has transitioned into a high-volatility regime, averaging 92.4 units over the last 5 periods (P38-P42). Given the shift in lead time from the previous 3-period stabilization to a more recent 1-period arrival, I am setting L to 1 period. To manage the high demand volatility and account for the recent recovery, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current demand level (~92 units) and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to address the significant variance observed in the latest data.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered from its catastrophic failure with a single arrival in Period 40 (ordered P39, L=1). However, the system is still extremely fragile. Total confirmed lost inventory now includes orders from Periods 6 (172 units), 15 (217 units), 19 (18 units), and 37 (118 units), totaling 525 phantom units. Current 'In-transit' is 712, meaning the reliable pipeline is 187 units (from P38 or P40-P43 orders, though orders in P38, P40-P43 were 0, so the 187 must be previously existing non-lost units). Demand has stabilized in a high-volatility regime averaging ~105 units over the last 5 periods. Given the recent L=1 observation but previous L=3 stabilization, I will use an explicit L=2 to balance the risk of stockouts with lead-time uncertainty. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (N chosen based on the post-dip recovery since P39) and sigma_hat to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery attempted: P39 order arrived in P40 with L=1. Total confirmed lost/phantom pipeline inventory is 525 units (P6: 172, P15: 217, P19: 18, P37: 118).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has experienced a catastrophic breakdown with no arrivals for 22 periods (P17-P40), followed by a single arrival in P40 (order from P39, L=1). Demand has stabilized into a high-volatility regime averaging approximately 107 units over the last 5 periods (P40-P44: 113, 109, 119, 107, 126). Total confirmed lost/phantom inventory is 525 units (P6: 172, P15: 217, P19: 18, P37: 118). Subtracting these from the 712 units 'In-transit' leaves 187 units of theoretically active pipeline inventory; however, since no arrivals have occurred in P41-P44 despite the P39 order arriving with L=1, the lead time is highly unreliable. I am setting L to 1 based on the most recent successful arrival (P39), and setting mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for the current high-demand regime (avg ~115) while considering the extreme historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability remains critical: following a 22-period drought, a single order (P39) arrived with L=1, but no subsequent arrivals have occurred in P41-P44. Total phantom pipeline inventory is confirmed at 525 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Following a 22-period arrival drought, a single order from P39 arrived in P40 (L=1), but no shipments have arrived in the five periods since (P41-P45), despite an 'In-transit' balance of 712 units. Confirmed lost/phantom inventory includes P6 (172), P15 (217), P19 (18), and now P37 (118), totaling 525 units. Subtracting these from the 712 units 'In-transit' leaves a 'true' pipeline of 187 units (from P38-P45 orders, though most were 0-quantity orders in that range). Effectively, we are out of stock with no arrivals imminent. Demand is currently in a high-regime phase, averaging 113.2 units over the last 5 periods (P41-P45). Given the extreme unreliability of arrivals, I will use an explicit L=2 to match the promised lead time (since L=1 was a single outlier and L=3 is no longer recently observed) and an explicit mu_hat to cover the high demand. I will target a safety stock to handle the high variance observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain remains unstable: single arrival in P40 (L=1) followed by 5 periods of no arrivals. Total phantom inventory remains 525 units (P6, P15, P19, P37). Recent demand regime (P41-P45) average is 113.2 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains extremely unreliable with only one successful arrival (Period 39 order) in the last 29 periods. Total 'phantom' inventory that must be excluded from pipeline calculations is 525 units (P6: 172, P15: 217, P19: 18, and now P37: 118, which is 10 periods overdue against a promised L=2). After discounting these 525 units from the current in-transit total of 712, the 'real' pipeline is 187 units. Demand has stabilized at a high level, averaging 113.2 units over the last 5 periods (P41-P45). Given the proximity to the end of the simulation (Period 47 of 50) and the demonstrated risk of total shipment loss, I will maintain mu_hat based on the most recent demand regime (N=5) to ensure the base stock calculation targets current consumption. I am using 'explicit' for L=2 to match promised lead time as the single L=1 observation is insufficient to declare a new permanent lead time, and a value of 2 provides a more conservative safety buffer for the remaining periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Total phantom/lost pipeline inventory confirmed at 525 units (P6, P15, P19, P37). All orders placed before P39 (except P17) are officially lost. Lead time is highly volatile/unreliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains deeply unreliable, with only one successful arrival (P39 at P40, L=1) in the last 30 periods. A total of 525 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are confirmed lost (P6: 172, P15: 217, P19: 18, P37: 118), meaning the effective reliable pipeline is only 187 units (from the 712 units reported). Demand has been volatile, with a recent high average of ~113 units followed by a sharp drop to 31 in P47. I am setting L to 1 based on the most recent (and only) successful lead time observation, though systemic risk remains high. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 7 to capture the high-demand period while weighing in the recent volatility. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N to account for the instability in these final periods.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain remains dysfunctional with a 525-unit 'phantom' pipeline (Orders P6, P15, P19, P37 confirmed lost). Order P39 confirming L=1 is the only arrival since P17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. Since Period 17, only one shipment (ordered in Period 39) has arrived. A total of 525 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are confirmed lost (P6, P15, P19, P37). The current 'In-transit' of 712 units minus these 525 'phantom' units leaves a 'true' pipeline of 187 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P44-P48) has shown a decelerating trend (105, 102, 31, 62), though the broader P40-P48 average is approximately 89 units. Due to the extreme unreliability of arrivals and the game ending in Period 50, placing new orders is unlikely to result in sales before the simulation concludes. However, to maintain the operational logic: L is set to 'explicit' at 3 periods (the last stable lead time before the collapse), and mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture the volatile but generally high demand (~90 units) while accounting for the recent dip. The OR backend will see a high pipeline (712 units) versus a base stock requirement, likely resulting in 0 units ordered, which is appropriate given the 525 lost units and the imminent 50-period cutoff.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain dysfunction confirmed: only 1 arrival in last 31 periods. Total phantom pipeline (confirmed lost) is 525 units (P6, P15, P19, P37). Demand regime P40-P48 averages ~89 units with high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the environment is characterized by persistent supply chain instability and a confirmed set of 'phantom' inventory units that distort the OR engine's view of 'In-transit' stock. Total in-transit is 712 units, but 525 units are officially confirmed lost (P6: 172, P15: 217, P19: 18, P37: 118), leaving an actual reliable pipeline of 187 units. Since the last arrival was from P39 (arriving in P40 with L=1) and nothing has arrived for 9 periods since, lead time is extremely unreliable. I will use 'explicit' for L=1 to reflect the last successful transit time, although the risk of loss remains high. For demand, the recent 10-period average (P40-P49) is approximately 84.3 units, but the most recent 3 periods show a cooling trend (~54 units). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to provide a stable but responsive forecast (approx 84 units/period), as we are at the end of the simulation. This balances the risk of stockouts against the holding cost of units that may arrive late or never.
