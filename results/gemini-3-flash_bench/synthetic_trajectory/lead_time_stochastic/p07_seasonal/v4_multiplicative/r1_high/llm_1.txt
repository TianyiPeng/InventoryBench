  "rationale": "This is Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)', a staple snack item with moderate profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), suggesting a strategy that favors high service levels over minimal inventory. Historical data shows an average demand of approximately 131 units (150, 163, 134, 139, 69), though the last sample was a significant dip. Given the promised lead time (L) of 2 periods, an order placed now (T) will arrive at the start of Period 4 (T+L+1 = 1+2+1 = 4). Therefore, the initial order must cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. My target inventory level (order-up-to) is calculated based on expected demand during the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods). Using the historical average of ~131 units/period, I need roughly 393 units to avoid stockouts through Period 3. Since on-hand and in-transit are both 0, I will place an initial order of 400 units to establish a buffer and account for the high demand seen in early samples.",

After auditing history, orders from P2 (150) and P6 (100) are confirmed lost (too many periods elapsed). Thus, 'live' In-transit = 350 (P12) + 250 (P13) + 250 (P14 order) = 850? No, wait: The status says 'In-transit: 850'. These are P2(150), P6(100), P12(350), P13(250). Since P2 and P6 are lost, effective pipeline is 350 + 250 = 600. (e) Order Logic: To cover demand for (L+1) = 4 periods (P14-P17) at ~130 units/period, I need ~520 units. Effective pipeline (600) already covers this, but since I am at 0 on-hand and P13 demand was 173 (potential stockout risk if LT=3), I will place a moderate order of 150 to maintain a buffer for the next cycle and compensate for the lost P6/P2 units.",

My current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 1710 units, but based on historical tracking and carry-over insights, 1420 of these are 'phantom' or lost units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P27/29, and now P37).

The discrepancy in 'In-transit' remains high due to accumulated ghosts. My reliable 'On-hand + In-transit' is 293 (on-hand) + 400 (P44 & P45) = 693 units.
