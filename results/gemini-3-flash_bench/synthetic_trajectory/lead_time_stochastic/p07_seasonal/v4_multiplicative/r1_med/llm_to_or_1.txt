Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The inventory is zero, and the target is to establish a base stock for 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the initial demand data provided (Period 1-5), the average demand is approximately 131 units. However, there is a clear drop in Period 5 (69 units), which might be a change in regime or a late-entering outlier. For the initial order, I will use all available historical data (N=5) to estimate demand. The promised lead time is 2, so the parameters must cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, suggesting a relatively high service level. Using recent_N for mu and sigma allows the OR backend to quickly adapt to the available historical samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, 191 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 2. As expected, these did not arrive in Period 1 (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), and they will not arrive until Period 3 or 4. Our current on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales of 105 units in Period 1. Historical demand for Period 1 was 105, but looking at the provided baseline (150, 163, 134, 139, 69), the average is approx 131. Period 5 specifically shows a drop to 69, but it's too early to call a regime shift. I will use the default methods for mu and sigma to capture the baseline statistics while waiting for the initial shipment to arrive. Lead time L is set to default (2).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because the orders from Period 1 and Period 2 are still in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Therefore, we expect the shipment from Period 1 (191 units) to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Demand for the first two periods was 105 and 118, while the historical samples provided (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) suggest a higher average (~131). However, the actual observed demand in Period 1 and 2 is slightly lower than the seed data average. Given the promised lead time L=2, the base stock should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to allow the system to adapt as arrivals conclude, and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (using the 5 provided historical samples as the primary baseline) to ensure we are ordering enough to build safety stock once arrivals commence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently over 90 units (P1: 105, P2: 118, P3: 93, Avg: 105). No inventory has arrived yet, despite a promised lead time of 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (191 units) was expected in Period 3's arrival phase (visible in Period 4's start status), but 'arrived=0' is still reported for chips(Regular) according to Period 3's conclude message. However, the 'In-transit' count is 380, which equals P1 (191) + P2 (184) + P3 (5). This confirms the orders are in the pipeline. Based on the rules, P1's order should have arrived during P3 and be visible now; its absence suggests the actual lead time is likely 3 periods rather than 2. I am adjusting L to 3 (explicit) to account for this delay. I am setting mu_hat using the mean of the available history (N=3) to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand (approx 105 * 4 = 420). sigma_hat is set to default to handle variability around that mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $334.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the actual lead times have been inconsistent. The Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=3), while the Period 3 order also arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=1), which is shorter than the promised 2. Demand across the first 4 periods has been relatively stable, averaging 105.5 units (105, 118, 93, 106). However, the historical demand data provided in the prompt shows a significant drop in Period 5 to 69 units. This suggests a potential downward shift in demand. Given the current on-hand inventory of 90 and in-transit of 278, we are well-covered for the immediate future. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) with N=5 to incorporate the recent drop, 'calculate' for lead time to average the observed variances (3 and 1), and 'recent_N' for sigma to reflect the increased volatility caused by the recent low demand point.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we face an stockout (on-hand 0) following a demand of 94 in Period 5. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) and game history demands (105, 118, 93, 106, 94) average approximately 113 units per period. Lead times have been inconsistent: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period (averaging 2, the promised lead time). Currently, 335 units are in transit (from Periods 2, 4, and 5). Since the recent demand average is around 113, and the promised lead time is 2, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current demand mean and volatility, while setting L to the promised 2 periods (default). This targets a base stock covering 3 periods of demand to recover from the stockout.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 with 335 units in-transit. Historic demand mean is roughly 107 units per period. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times are inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, and Period 3 arrived in 1 period. Period 2's order (184 units) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting a lost shipment or severe delay. Period 4 (94 units) and Period 5 (57 units) orders are also in-transit. Total 'safe' in-transit excluding the likely lost Period 2 shipment is 94 + 57 = 151 units. Given the stockout in Periods 5 and 6, we need to restock. I will use 'explicit' for L to set it to 3 (adjusting for the observed longer lead time of P1) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (the full history) to capture the demand average of ~107 units/period across the lead time plus review period (1+3=4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Significant supply instability: Period 2 order (184 units) appears lost (5 periods elapsed, promised 2); Period 1 had actual lead time of 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $191.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. The demand history shows a relatively stable mean around 100 units, with a noticeable drop to 57 in Period 7 (though historical data provided in the prompt listed 69 for Period 5, I will prioritize the 'conclude' messages which show Period 1-7 demand: 105, 118, 93, 106, 94, 128, 57). The supply chain is highly unstable: the Period 2 order (184 units) is effectively lost (shipped 6 periods ago, promised 2), while Period 1 and Period 4 orders both arrived with an actual lead time of 3 periods. Period 3 arrived in 1 period. Given the loss of the Period 2 shipment and the inconsistent lead times, I am setting L=3 to reflect the most common delayed arrival observed. For mu_hat, the mean demand of the last 7 periods is approx 100; with L=3, the (1+L) factor is 4, resulting in a forecasted demand of 400. I will use 'explicit' for L and 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=7) to stabilize the forecast against the recent low demand of 57. sigma_hat will use the default calculation to maintain a buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply instability persists: Period 2 order (184 units) confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed). Actual lead time for successful bulk orders (P1, P4) is 3 periods, not the promised 2.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe significant volatility in lead times and supply reliability. Carry-over insights confirm the Period 2 order (184 units) is lost. While the promised lead time (L) is 2, actual lead times for successful orders have been 3 periods (P1, P4, P5) or 1 period (P3, P7). This inconsistency suggests setting L explicitly to 3 to ensure we cover demand during the most common delay. Demand analysis: Prior samples 1-5 showed a mean of ~111, but the last 3 observed conclude messages (P6-P8) show a sharp drop (128, 57, 48), with the most recent two suggesting a low-demand regime (avg ~53). Given the provided samples (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) and the actual concluded history, N=5 for mu_hat will balance the recent low demand against the historical higher levels. sigma_hat is set to 3 to capture the volatility during this shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Average demand dropped from ~110 to ~53 over the last 2 observed periods. Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-33.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has settled into a lower regime starting around Period 7. The average demand of the last three periods (P7-P9) is 47.6 units, compared to the initial average of ~107 units. Therefore, I am setting N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat). Lead times remain highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.2 periods). I will explicitly set L to 3 to ensure the inventory covers the worst-case scenario observed and to compensate for the previously lost shipment from Period 2. The pipeline currently contains 198 units (ordered in P9 and others) and on-hand is 185; with current low demand, this creates a high inventory position, so the parameters will likely result in a zero or small order to avoid excessive holding costs while the backend recalculates based on the lower mu_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~107 to ~48 (approx. 55% drop) sustained over 3 periods. Lead time remains erratic, frequently hitting 3 periods despite a promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $255.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the inventory stands at 97 on-hand with 21 in-transit (Period 9 order of 14 units and Period 10 order of 0 units; however, the UI 'In-transit' shows 198, which likely includes the historically missing Period 2 order of 184 units that we have deemed lost). Demand analysis shows a significant regime shift starting at Period 7. Pre-Period 7 average demand was ~107 units; whereas Periods 7-10 show demand of 57, 48, 38, and 88 respectively. The spike to 88 in Period 10 suggests the 55% drop observed previously might be stabilizing or reverting slightly, but the mean of the last 4 periods is ~58 units. Lead times have been erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Promised: 2). I will assume a lead time of 3 periods (L=3) for safety, given the history of delays (Periods 1, 4, 5 all took 3 periods). Using recent_N=4 for mean demand (mu_hat) to capture the lower-demand regime while acknowledging the recent uptick. Pipeline inventory must be treated carefully; since the Period 2 order (184 units) is 9 periods old and has not arrived, it is likely lost and should not be counted toward meeting future demand, despite appearing in the 'In-transit' total.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing in lower-regime: Period 10 saw an 88-unit demand, breaking the string of <60 unit periods observed since Period 7.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. While a lower-demand regime was identified starting at Period 7 (averaging ~48-57 units), Periods 10 and 11 saw a significant resurgence with demands of 88 and 146 respectively. The Period 11 demand of 146 suggests we may be entering a higher-demand phase or a volatile cycle that averages out to a level higher than the previous low-regime dip. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead times have been erratic: although the promised lead time is 2, we have observed actual lead times of 1 and 3 periods, and Period 2's order is confirmed lost. Given the recent demand spike and the fact that we have 0 on-hand, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent upward trend (P7-P11 average: 75.4) and setting sigma_hat explicitly to 50 to handle the high variance (from 38 to 146). I'll use an explicit lead time L=3 to ensure the inventory target covers the risk of the longer observed lead times.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has shifted significantly: after a lull (P7-P9), demand surged in P10 (88) and P11 (146), indicating a potential end to the low-demand regime.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, on-hand inventory was exhausted (ending on-hand: 0). Demand continues to fluctuate significantly; after a lull (Periods 7-9), demand spiked in Periods 10-11 (88, 146) and remains relatively high at 89 in Period 12. This suggests a return to the original high-demand regime or a transition to higher volatility. The supply chain remains erratic: while promised lead time is 2, observed lead times reflect a mix of 1 and 3 periods, with the most recent arrival (ordered P9) arriving in P12 (LT=3). I am setting L to 3 to account for this prevailing delay. For demand (mu_hat), the last 3 periods (P10-P12) average 107.7 units per period. I will use recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent resurgence in both mean demand and volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the anticipated (3+1) periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: demand has rebounded from the P7-P9 low (avg ~48) to a higher average of ~108 (P10-P12), matching the initial regime levels. Lead time remains unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has recovered and intensified, with Period 13 demand hitting 173 units. The last four periods (P10-P13) average 124 units (88, 146, 89, 173), which is higher than the initial regime. However, lead times are highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, and the Period 2 order (184 units) is long lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, while 464 units are in-transit (P12 order of 117, P13 order of 163, and the legacy P2 loss). To ensure service level given the demand surge and supply uncertainty, I am setting L to 3 (the longest recurring observed lead time) to build a larger safety buffer. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the recent recovery in demand (approx 124/period), and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to account for the heightened volatility (std dev approx 40).

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: average demand for P10-P13 increased to ~124 units, exceeding the original regime (~105). Lead time remains highly erratic, frequently requiring a 3-period planning horizon to maintain stock.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand has significantly recovered and surged, with Period 10-14 averaging approximately 119.8 units (88, 146, 89, 173, 103). The original regime was ~105, followed by a low dip (~48). I am treating the last 5 periods (P10-P14) as the most relevant demand regime. Regarding lead time, the promised value is 2, but actual observations (P1: 3, P4: 3, P5: 3, P9: 3) versus occasional short cycles (P7: 1, P8: 1) indicate high instability. To prevent further stock-outs and account for the pipeline risk, I am explicitly setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend aims for a 4-period coverage (L+1). My mu_hat and sigma_hat settings will focus on the recent high-demand regime (N=5) to reflect the recent surge and increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: P10-P14 average is ~120 units, recovering from the P7-P9 lull. Lead time continues to be erratic, frequently requiring a 3-period horizon for safety.

Daily Reward (R_t): $383.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, an arrival of 117 units (ordered P12) occurred with a lead time of 3 periods, confirming that lead times continue to frequently hit 3 periods despite the promised 2. Demand for Period 15 was 100 units, which closely aligns with the stabilized recovery regime observed since Period 10. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P10-P15) is approximately 116.5 units, indicating a return to higher demand levels after the P7-P9 slump. On-hand inventory is very low (17 units), and there are large outstanding orders (P13: 163 units, P14: 104 units). Given the consistent evidence of 3-period lead times (orders from P1, P4, P5, P9, and P12 all took 3 periods), I will explicitly set L to 3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the full pipeline delay. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this stabilized 'recovery' regime while filtering out the low-demand artifact of P7-P9. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 6 periods to reflect the current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with a recovery from the P7-P9 low to a higher level (averaging approx. 120 units from P10-P15), followed by a sudden dip to 40 units in P16. Given this volatility and the historical avg of ~100+, I will use a recent_N window for demand forecasting to capture the recovery trend while acknowledging the recent outlier. For lead time, while the promise is 2 periods, history shows arrivals frequently take 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P12, P13 all arrived with L=3). I will explicitly set L=3 to ensure the OR backend plans over a sufficient horizon (L+1=4 periods) to prevent the frequent stockouts observed earlier. On-hand is currently 140, but 345 units are in-transit (orders from P14 and P16), so the base stock calculation will decide the incremental order size.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: demand surged to ~120 (P10-P15) before a sharp single-period drop to 40 in P16. Lead time continues to be more reliably modeled as 3 periods rather than the promised 2.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the on-hand inventory reached 192 units following the arrival of orders from P14 (LT 3) and P16 (LT 1). Demand in P17 was 109 units, which aligns with the 'recovered' demand regime (~100-120 units). Current demand signals suggest that the dip in P16 (40 units) was an outlier rather than a new regime shift. Lead times remain highly erratic, with observations of both 1 and 3 periods; however, planning for a lead time of 3 periods (L=3) remains the safest strategy to prevent stockouts during delayed arrivals. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (since Period 10) to capture the demand behavior post-recovery, while explicitly setting L=3 to account for the frequent shipment delays observed throughout the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe on-hand inventory of 131 and 300 units in-transit. Demand has shown significant volatility recently, with a sharp drop in P16 (40) followed by a moderate recovery (P17: 109, P18: 61). Over the last 9 periods (P10-P18), the mean demand is approximately 102 units. Lead times remain erratic; while the promised lead time is 2, actual successful arrivals (excluding the lost P2 order) appear to cluster around 3 periods (P12, P13, P14, P16 all arrived in 3 periods) or occasionally 1 period. To manage this instability and avoid stockouts during demand spikes, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to establish a safer planning horizon. I am using the last 9 periods (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime which recovered from the P7-P9 lull but remains volatile. This N covers the shift that started in P10.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units following several regime shifts (from ~110 initially, down to ~50 in P7-P9, then surging up to ~120, and recently settling). Over the last 5 periods (P15-P19), demand points are 100, 40, 109, 61, and 80, averaging 78 with high variance. However, given the longer-term context, a slightly higher base is safer. Regarding lead time, the promised L=2 is unreliable; observed actual lead times are frequently 3 periods (P12, P13, P14 orders all took 3 periods), though we saw a single-period arrival in P17. To prevent stockouts caused by supply delays, I am setting L to 3. The OR backend will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the current volatility and mean levels, while the explicit L=3 provides a necessary buffer for the pipeline inventory calculation.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 341 units in-transit (from orders in Periods 17, 18, and 19). Demand has shown high volatility recently, with the last 5 periods (P16-P20) averaging 76.8 units, though this includes a sharp drop to 40 and a subsequent recovery towards 94. Because on-hand inventory is depleted and pipeline inventory is high, I need to set parameters that stabilize the base stock around the higher demand regime to avoid further stockouts while accounting for lead time erraticism. Lead times frequently hit 3 periods (observed in P12, P13, P14, P15, P16) even though the promise is 2. I will set L to 3 to ensure the OR engine calculates the order quantity based on a 4-period window (L+1). For demand, I'll use the last 11 samples (P10-P20) which captures the recovery from the P7-P9 lull and reflects the current volatile but higher-mean regime (~98 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains volatile but has settled into a medium-high range (avg ~98 units since P10) after the P7-P9 lull. Lead time remains erratic but consistently requires planning for 3 periods to maintain service levels.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is facing a severe stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical data indicates a significant supply reliability issue; specifically, the large order from Period 2 (184 units) is confirmed lost, and recent lead times have frequently hit 3 periods, despite a promised lead time of 2. For Period 22, the 'In-transit' pipeline of 456 units consists of orders from P17 (10), P18 (106), P19 (41), P21 (115), and a previously recorded pipeline. To ensure the OR backend properly accounts for the systemic delays and minimizes further stockouts, I am explicitly setting L to 3. Demand since Period 10 has averaged ~98 units, but with recent variability and a period of high demand (P10-P15), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 (covering P10-P21) to capture the current regime's average (~98*4 = 392 for L=3). This ensures the base stock calculation covers the lead time plus one period of demand while accounting for the observed supply instability.

Although promised 2, the actual lead time is 3. Demand has stabilized into a medium-high regime after the P7-P9 lull. The average demand from P10 to P22 is approximately 101.3 units, but recent periods (P21 and P22) show higher levels of 96 and 131. To maintain a sufficient service level against the 3-period lead time risk and recent demand surges, I am using L=3 and a recent_N of 13 for mu_hat (covering the post-lull regime from P10-P22). Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the overall volatility of the system. We have 456 units in-transit (from P17, P18, P19, P21), which should cover upcoming periods once they arrive.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P10-P23) shows a stabilized regime around 100 units per period (average ~103), recovering from the P7-P9 lull. The most recent demand (P23) was 116 units, and on-hand inventory is currently 0 with a significant \u2018in-transit\u2019 pipeline of 349 units. Lead times remain erratic, oscillating primarily between 1 and 3 periods, though recent P21 order arrived in 2 periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am setting L to 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of the delivery window. I will use the last 14 periods (P10-P23) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current stable demand regime including its inherent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at ~103 units/period since P10, with volatility returning to normal levels (~30-40 units std dev). Lead time remains erratic but safest when modeled at 3 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 464 units in-transit. Historic demand since Period 10 has stabilized around an average of 103 units per period. The recent demand (P23-P24) was 116 and 106, respectively. Lead times remain highly erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with many significant orders taking 3 periods to conclude. Given the stockout in P24 and 0 on-hand inventory at the start of P25, it is critical to use a planning horizon that accounts for this volatility. I will use L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the likely 3-period lead time. For demand, I'll use the last 15 periods (since the recovery in P10) to establish a stable mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat), providing enough buffer to handle the observed volatility without incurring excessive holding costs once the in-transit units arrive.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience inventory stockouts due to erratic lead times and demand volatility. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Historical analysis shows a stable demand regime since Period 10, averaging approximately 103 units per period. Although the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times frequently hit 3 periods (as seen in P4, P7, P8, P12, P15, P16, and P17), with occasional 1-2 period arrivals. To ensure continuity of supply given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent delays. mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=15) to capture the demand stabilization since the P7-P9 lull. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=15) to reflect the current regime's volatility, which includes spikes like P11 and P13.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand is in a stable but volatile regime, following the P7-P9 dip, with an average of approximately 101 units over the last 15 periods (P11-P26). Period 26 demand was 91. Lead times continue to be erratic, frequently oscillating between 1, 2, and 3 periods; historical 'concludes' show several 3-period arrivals (P12, P15, P16, P17) and recent 2-period arrivals (P23, P25). To ensure high service levels despite this instability, I am modeling lead time as 3 periods (explicit L=3). I'll use the last 17 samples (back to P10) for mu_hat to capture the post-dip recovery and stabilization, totaling (L+1=4) periods of demand. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to capture recent volatility.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 463 units in-transit. Historically, since Period 10, the demand has settled into a regime averaging ~103 units with moderate volatility. However, recent fulfillment has been poor, leading to stockouts. Specifically, orders from Period 24 (115), Period 26 (7), and Period 18-19 (147 total) haven't arrived yet. The lead time is highly erratic, frequently reaching 3 periods (observed in P12, P13, P14, P16, P17) or resulting in lost shipments (P2). Given the current stockout and large pipeline, I will set L to 3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the extended delivery window and high pipeline inventory. I'll use recent_N for mu_hat (N=18, covering the post-lull regime since P10) to capture the current demand average of ~103, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the observed volatility in this regime.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently facing a stockout situation with 0 units on-hand, despite a large in-transit pipeline of 456 units. Demand since Period 10 has stabilized around a mean of ~103 units/period, but recent arrivals have been sparse and small (e.g., 7 units arriving in Period 28). Lead times remain highly erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a 3-period planning horizon being the safest to avoid prolonged outages. Given the stockout and the massive in-transit balance (which exceeds four periods of expected demand), the OR backend is unlikely to place a new order if I use 'recent_N' for demand, as the pipeline covers the calculated base stock. However, since the current inventory is zero and recent shipments have been very small, I will maintain the 3-period lead time estimate (explicit L=3) and set mu_hat using recent_N (N=19, covering the Period 10 regime shift) to accurately reflect the ~103 avg demand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to capture the observed volatility in this regime.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is currently severely stock-out, with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows a persistent demand regime starting around Period 10, averaging approximately 100 units per period, despite some short-term volatility. The last four periods (P26-P29) show demand of 91, 67, 81, and 69, which is slightly lower than the P10-P25 average but consistent with the product's profile. Lead times are highly erratic, frequently fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode of 3 for larger orders. To prevent further stock-outs and manage the large in-transit pipeline (456 units), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient horizon (L+1=4 periods). I will use a recent demand window (recent_N=20) to capture the stable post-lull regime since Period 10, which provides a balanced view of demand mean and variance. The OR backend will use these to determine if additional orders are needed beyond the existing pipeline.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory has reached zero on-hand with a significant backlog of demand unsatisfied in the last period (111 demand). The 'In-transit' quantity of 456 units covers several large orders placed recently (specifically P24 and other preceding periods) that have not yet concluded. History shows lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with many units being caught in transit. Demand since Period 10 has averaged ~103 units, but recent periods (P26-P30) show a slight dip (avg ~84). Given the massive in-transit inventory relative to current demand, the OR backend's inventory-position-based logic will likely refrain from ordering more. I will maintain L=3 as the planning horizon to account for the frequent 3-period arrival delays observed throughout the history. For demand forecasting, I will use the recent 20 samples (P11-P30) to capture the post-lull behavior (avg ~100) while incorporating recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant stockouts occurring since P24 due to timing of arrivals versus demand; pipeline inventory is high (456) but on-hand is zero. Demand regime remains stable around 100 units/period (P11-P30 avg: 99.7).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0, despite a high pipeline inventory of 456 units. Demand has remained relatively stable around 100 units/period (P11-P30 average is ~99.7). However, supply lead times are extremely erratic, oscillating between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with some orders potentially lost (P2 confirmed lost). The recent stockout (P24-P31) is due to a failure to receive the large 'In-transit' quantities. Specifically, an order for 115 units from P24 and subsequent potential orders (though history shows 0 orders emitted for P27-P31) are currently missing. To recover, I need to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high lead-time volatility. Identifying L=3 as the planning horizon is necessary for safety, even though the promised lead time is 2. I will use recent_N (N=20) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the post-P10 demand regime (mean ~100) while filtering out the very early data. This will set a robust target inventory while the pipeline eventually flushes into on-hand stock.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0 and in-transit inventory at 456 units. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a stable demand regime of approximately 100 units/period (average since P11 is ~99.7). However, supply has been extremely erratic, with physical arrivals completely stalled between P29 and P32 despite high pipeline stock. Looking at the history, actual lead times frequently hit 3 periods, though sometimes as low as 1 or 2. More critically, large orders (like the one in P2-P3) have been lost entirely in the past. The current 456 units in-transit represent orders that should have arrived if the lead time were the promised 2 periods. To avoid over-ordering while accounting for the high possibility of delayed shipments, I will keep L at 3 periods (safest planning horizon confirmed in history) and use a recent_N window for demand that captures the current stabilized regime of ~100 units. Since on-hand + in-transit (456) already significantly exceeds the expected demand for a 3-period horizon (approx 4 * 100 = 400), the OR backend's inventory-position logic (base_stock - pipeline) will correctly suppress new orders until the current bottleneck clears, preventing massive overstocking once shipments eventually arrive.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged arrival bottleneck: P29-P32 saw zero arrivals despite a pipeline of 456 units. Demand remains stable at ~100 units/period. Modeling lead time as 3 periods remains the most robust strategy.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a severe supply chain bottleneck. There are 460 units in-transit (pipeline), dominated by large orders placed between Period 18 and Period 24 (totaling 456 units) that have not arrived for 10-15 periods, far exceeding the promised lead time of 2 or the frequently observed actual lead time of 3. On-hand inventory is 0, and sales have been lost for several periods. Despite this, demand remains stable in the current regime (avg ~100 units since P10). Because the OR engine uses a base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), the massive pipeline (460) effectively blocks new orders unless I artificially adjust L or mu_hat to raise the base-stock target. I will set L=3 based on historical stability and use an explicit mu_hat that represents the expected demand over (L+1)=4 periods. Given the high probability of lost or severely delayed orders in the pipeline, I must ensure the base-stock target stays high enough to trigger replenishment if the pipeline isn't clearing.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply chain failure: 456 units from Periods 18-24 are now 10+ periods overdue and likely lost or indefinitely stalled, causing prolonged stockouts despite high pipeline inventory.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a total collapse. Currently, we have 0 on-hand units and 460 units in-transit. Crucially, 456 of those in-transit units were ordered between Periods 18 and 24 and are now significantly overdue (11+ periods for the oldest), suggesting they are lost or permanently stalled. Only 4 units ordered in Period 33 are 'fresh'. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 100 units/period (P11-P34 avg: ~99). To resume operations, the OR backend must place new orders, but its logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see the 'In-transit: 460' and refuse to order if we use default settings. To bypass this, I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent reliable lead time observed historically) and using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am calculating mu_hat as (1+L) * 100 = 400. Since the OR backend subtracts the pipeline (460) from its base_stock target, setting mu_hat explicitly to a high value like 950 will force the system to acknowledge the need for new inventory despite the 'phantom' pipeline. I have set sigma_hat based on recent historical volatility (~35 std dev * sqrt(1+3)).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: 456 units ordered P18-P24 are 11+ periods overdue and considered lost. Emergency parameter override required to trigger new orders despite stalled pipeline.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a catastrophic failure, with 456 units ordered between Periods 18 and 24 being 11+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. This created a massive bottleneck where the OR backend, seeing a large 'In-transit' balance, refused to place new orders while the warehouse remained empty. In Period 35, I initiated a recovery by setting mu_hat and L to very high explicit values to force an emergency order (296 units). Total In-transit is now 756 units, but 456 of those are 'phantom' stock. To prevent the OR backend from stopping orders again, I am setting L=3 (the reliable historical lead time) and using an explicit mu_hat of 1200. This extremely high mu_hat (representing roughly 10 periods of demand) is a necessary 'override' to ensure the base_stock calculation exceeds the high (but fake) pipeline inventory, triggering replenishment until the new orders actually arrive. Demand is stable around 100 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Emergency replenishment strategy active: Using extremely high explicit mu_hat to override 456 units of stalled/lost pipeline inventory from P18-P24 and restore on-hand stock.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has experienced a catastrophic failure, with a total of 1100 units now in-transit (pipeline), 456 of which are from periods 18-24 and are definitively lost or indefinitely stalled. On-hand inventory remains at 0, resulting in continuous stockouts. The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock, preventing new orders. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to a value that accounts for 4 periods of demand (L=3 + 1) at approximately 100 units/period (400), plus the 'ghost' pipeline of 456 units that the engine is incorrectly subtracting, totaling approximately 856. I will round this to 1100 to ensure the engine triggers a substantial order regardless of the stalled pipeline, as we need to restore physical stock. Lead time L is set to 3 to reflect the most conservative successful historical arrival pattern. Sigma_hat is set to a recent period standard deviation (approx 40 over 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Emergency replenishment protocol maintained: mu_hat is being explicitly inflated to 1100+ to negate the 456 units of stalled/lost pipeline inventory (P18-P24) and force the OR engine to order new stock despite the high 'In-transit' figure.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The emergency replenishment strategy implemented in Periods 36 and 37 was successful. New orders from Period 35 (296 units) and Period 36 (344 units) arrived in Period 37, bringing the on-hand inventory to 581 units and ending the prolonged stockout. This has effectively overridden the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 456 units that remains stalled/lost from P18-P24. With on-hand inventory now sufficient to cover approximately 5-6 periods of demand (avg ~100), the goal is to return to a sustainable replenishment policy. Demand in Period 37 was 59 units, following 52 in Period 36, which is lower than the long-term average but within historical volatility range. I am now transitioning back to standard parameters while accounting for the unreliable lead time (set to 3). mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N=20 to capture the stable demand regime (~100 units) while smoothing out the recent lower observations. This will allow the OR engine to gradually resume normal ordering now that the inventory safety cushion is restored.

Carry-over insight: Emergency replenishment successful: On-hand inventory restored in Period 37 (581 units), effectively negating the impact of the lost 456 units in pipeline from P18-P24.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The emergency replenishment protocol initiated in P35-P37 to counteract the 456 units of stalled/lost pipeline inventory (P18-P24) has been successful. As of P38 conclude, on-hand inventory is 496 units. Current pipeline inventory is 562 units (largely comprised of the 456 stalled units + small P33/P37 orders). Since the 456 units remain 'In-transit' in the system's eyes but are physically lost, they continue to block the standard OR logic from ordering. However, with 496 units on hand and demand stabilizing around 85-100 units/period (latest P38 demand was 85), we are currently overstocked relative to the 3-period lead time. I am returning parameters to a normalized state. For L, I will use 'explicit' value 3, as historical data confirms this is the most reliable planning horizon. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime (avg ~90-100) while allowing the on-hand surplus to gradually deplete. The inflated mu_hat is no longer necessary.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has successfully recovered from the massive inventory hole caused by the 456 units of lost/stalled pipeline inventory (Periods 18-24). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 364 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 562 units includes both the 102 units ordered in Period 37 and the 460 units of effectively lost stock (4 units from P33 and 456 units from P18-24). Demand has returned to its stable regime around 100 units/period (P37-P39 average is 92). I am shifting from the 'emergency inflation' protocol back to a standard maintenance policy. To account for the 456 units of stalled/lost stock still reflecting in the backend's 'Pipeline Inventory', I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to 456 (the lost amount) + (1+L)*100. With L=2, this equals ~756. This ensures the OR engine doesn't stop ordering when on-hand inventory drops, as it will realize the 456 'stalled' units aren't coming.

Carry-over insight: Emergency replenishment successful; on-hand inventory restored. Resuming maintenance policy while explicitly accounting for 456 units of permanently stalled pipeline inventory (P18-24).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory has been successfully restored (277 units) following the emergency replenishment. We have confirmed that 456 units ordered between Periods 18-24 are lost or indefinitely stalled, as they are now 15+ periods overdue. However, the backend OR engine still counts these in 'pipeline_inventory'. To prevent the engine from stopping orders due to this 'ghost' inventory, I must continue to explicitly set mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=3 and an average demand of ~100, we need a base stock of ~400 units. To achieve this while the engine subtracts 456 from the calculation, I set mu_hat to a value that offsets the lost units and target stock (approx 456 + 400). I am slightly reducing mu_hat from the previous emergency levels to avoid excessive holding costs now that on-hand levels are healthy. Lead time is set to 3 to reflect the consistent historical delay.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 100 units per period (P10-P41 average is ~97). Inventory levels are currently adequate (on-hand 131), but we must continue to account for the 'phantom' pipeline of 456 units (from P18-24) that are considered permanently lost. To ensure the OR engine actually places orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock for L=3 and a 100 unit demand with high service level (0.8 quantile) is roughly 450-500 units. To offset 456 'invisible' units in-transit, I set mu_hat explicitly to 500. This ensures that the system maintains a safety stock while acknowledging the current on-hand inventory. Lead time is set to 3 periods based on historical evidence of delivery delays.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the current on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 42. Demand has been high in recent periods (P41: 146, P42: 143), suggesting a sustained high-demand phase. The 'In-transit' count of 628 includes 456 units from P18-P24 that are confirmed lost/stalled and 172 units from P37 (106) and P41 (66). To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite the 456 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I must either use an explicit lead time or inflate the demand expectation. Modeling L as 3 reflects the safest historical lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (P38-P42 avg ~119) to capture the recent high demand. To negate the 456 lost units, I must add roughly 456 to the target base stock. Since base_stock \u2248 (L+1)*\u03bc_hat, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (4 * 119) + 456 = 932. This forces the system to recognize that the existing pipeline is insufficient and current on-hand is zero.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and a pipeline of 911 units. However, 456 units from this pipeline (ordered P18-P24) are confirmed lost/stalled, as noted in carry-over insights. Subtracting these lost units, the 'effective' pipeline is 455 units (911 - 456). Demand has surged recently, with the last 4 periods (P40-P43) averaging ~129 units, up from the long-term average of ~100. To prevent further stockouts and account for the high lead-time volatility (frequently 3 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime. Because the backend OR engine is unaware that 456 units in the 'In-transit' figure are effectively gone, I am using an explicit mu_hat value to force a replenishment order. The target base stock should cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand at ~129/period (~516 units) plus a safety buffer. Given the 456-unit 'ghost' pipeline, I set mu_hat to 1000 to ensure the engine triggers an order despite the inflated in-transit count.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 994 units in-transit. However, 456 of these units (from Periods 18-24) are confirmed lost/stalled and will not arrive. The active pipeline consists of orders from P37 (102 units), P43 (283 units), and P44 (149 units), totaling 534 'real' units. Lead times remain erratic, with the most recent arrival (P41) taking 3 periods. Demand has increased significantly in the last few periods (P41-P43: 146, 143, 139), with a slight dip in P44 to 80. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the current stockout and future demand while ignoring the 456 phantom units, I am using an explicit mu_hat. I estimate (1+L) demand where L=3. Expected demand is ~120/period, so (1+3)*120 = 480. To 'neutralize' the 456 phantom units in the backend's calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must add 456 to my target. 480 + 456 = 936. I will set mu_hat to 950 to trigger a robust replenishment order today.

Carry-over insight: Phanton pipeline inventory (456 units from P18-24) persists; parameters must be adjusted explicitly to negate these units until they are removed from the transit figure. Recent demand (P41-P44) has trended higher, averaging ~127 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' figure of 728 units. However, based on history, 456 units from P18-P24 are over 20 periods overdue and effectively lost/stalled indefinitely. The true actionable pipeline consists of orders from P44 (149 units) and P45 (17 units), plus the fresh order from P46. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this 'phantom inventory', I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target stock level. Average demand for the recent regime (P41-P45) is ~123 units. With a lead time of 3 periods, a normal target (1+L) would be ~492. To negate the 456 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat to 950 (492 + 456 \u2248 948). Lead time (L) is set to 3 to stay conservative given the erratic history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 456 units in pipeline inventory from Periods 18-24 that are 20+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. With On-hand inventory at 121 and In-transit at 834 (456 stalled + 378 recent), the real functional pipeline is only 378. Demand has stabilized but remains volatile; the last 5 periods (P42-P46) averaged ~105 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the phantom pipeline, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Expected Demand over (L+1) periods (where L=3) is 4 * 105 = 420. To offset the 456 dead units, I set mu_hat to 420 + 456 = 876. This ensures the base stock calculation (mu_hat + safety) effectively treats the 456 units as non-existent. L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent 3-period actual lead time observed for successful arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-121.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 121, and the current 'In-transit' figure is 834. This pipeline is heavily distorted by 456 units from P18-24 that are confirmed lost/stalled (as per P35-45 insights). The effective pipeline is 834 - 456 = 378 units. These units represent orders from P44 (149), P45 (17), P46 (106), and the current P47 order (0 units). Recent demand (P41-P46) has been volatile but averages approximately 112 units per period (if we exclude the P47 demand of 0 which seems to be an anomaly or partial reporting). A 3-period lead time remains the safest planning horizon. To ensure the backend orders despite the phantom 456 units in transit, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand at ~115 units/period (~460 units) plus a safety buffer, I would normally target around 600 units. However, to 'trick' the backend into seeing a need for stock while it thinks I have 834 in transit, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset the 456 lost units. mu_hat = (460 + 456) / 2 (approximate) is insufficient; I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a total target of ~1000 units to ensure replenishment continues as we approach the end of the simulation (P50). sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Maintaining phantom pipeline correction (456 units stalled P18-24). Demand remains volatile, averaging ~112 units (P41-P46), requiring explicit parameter inflation to sustain on-hand levels.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49. The 'In-transit' figure of 897 units is heavily distorted by 456 units from the P18-P24 period that are confirmed lost/stalled (over 25 periods overdue). Additionally, there is recent inventory in the pipeline (ordered P44, P45, P46, P48) totaling 335 units. Current on-hand is low (10 units). Lead time remains erratic, but a 3-period horizon (L=3) is the most robust planning target based on historical patterns. Since L=3, the OR backend targets (L+1)=4 periods of demand. To force an order despite the 456 phantom units and ensure we cover the next 4 periods (avg demand ~110-120), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory Position = (4 periods * 120 demand) + 456 (phantom) = 936. Pipeline is 897. This will trigger a small order to bridge the gap and maintain service levels as we approach the end of the simulation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 50. The current status shows on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is 1004 units. However, we must continue to account for the 'phantom' pipeline of 456 units (stalled since Period 18-24). Effectively, the 'live' pipeline is 548 units. Recent demand (P41-P49) has been volatile, with a 0-demand outlier in P47, but generally stays around 110-120 units. To compute the order, I use L=3 to account for historical erratic lead times. For mu_hat, I use the 'explicit' method to override the phantom inventory. I need to target a base stock that covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand at ~115 units/period (460 units), plus a safety buffer, AND negates the 456 units that the OR backend incorrectly counts as arriving. Total targeted base stock \u2248 460 + 100 (safety) + 456 (phantom negation) = 1016. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 1016 ensures the capped policy still allows for replenishment despite the frozen pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Re-confirmed phantom pipeline inventory (456 units) requires sustained explicit mu_hat inflation to prevent stockouts while the OR backend perceives high (but non-existent) incoming stock.
