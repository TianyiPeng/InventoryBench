Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of 102 units and a standard deviation of 35 over the 5 provided samples (137, 92, 110, 43, 128). The OR recommendation is 164 units, which is capped. Given the relatively high holding cost ($1.0) compared to profit ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, suggesting the OR agent target the median demand. Applying a base-stock logic: \u03bc(L+1) = 102 * (2+1) = 306. Safety stock for a 0.5 fractile (z=0) would be 0, resulting in a base stock of 306.

Demand for P1 (126) and P2 (119) resulted in 0 sales because arrivals haven't happened yet. Total pipeline is 318 units. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) yield a mean of ~102. Recent actual demand (P1: 126, P2: 119) is slightly higher but consistent with the range. 4. OR Analysis: The OR agent recommends 6 units. This low number is likely because the pipeline (318) almost perfectly matches the base-stock target for (L+1)=3 periods (3 * 102 = 306). However, because we have missed sales in P1 and P2 due to starting with 0 inventory, we need to ensure we don't stock out once the flow stabilizes. 5.

Historical demand samples are 137, 92, 110, 43, 128 (Mean: 102). In Period 4 conclude, we saw a demand of 18, which is uniquely low. In-transit inventory is 204 units (likely the Period 2 order of 154 and the Period 4 order of 50). 3. Strategy: Total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 356 units. With an average demand of ~102/period, 356 units covers roughly 3.5 periods of demand. Given the lead time variability (L=1 to 3), we need to cover L+1 periods (up to 4 periods). 4.

Currently, Period 9's order (70 units) and Period 6's order (80 units - likely lost or severely delayed) are in the pipeline.

Total reliable units (On-hand + P9 order) = 178. 4. OR Comparison: OR recommends 0.

Total inventory current available (On-hand 65 + Real In-transit 220) = 285 units. This barely covers the (L+1) window.\n5.

However, my tracking confirms that 634 of those units are 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). The real pipeline consists only of: P24 (100), P25 (150), and P26 (150), totaling 400 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Demand for chips(Regular) averages approximately 85-90 units per period. Using a lead time of 3 periods (the most frequent actual lead time) and a 1-period review cycle, I need to cover demand for 4 periods. 90 units * 4 = 360 units. With a real pipeline of 400 units (expected to arrive between P27 and P29), my current coverage is adequate if they arrive as scheduled. However, to maintain safety stock and account for high demand volatility (peaks of 180+), I will place a small order of 100 units.

The OR recommendation of 0 is likely based on the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 1434, which suggests we are overstocked. By correcting the pipeline to 350 units against a lead time of 2 periods (requiring coverage for ~3 periods of demand, roughly 360 units), the current actual pipeline is just barely sufficient.

The actual active pipeline consists only of: P42 (150), P43 (150), and P44 (120), totaling 420 units. Current on-hand is 43. Expected total availability is 463 units. Average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 95 units per period. With a lead time of roughly 3 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 45, 46, 47, and 48 (L+1 + safety). Target inventory level for 4 periods at 95 units/period is ~380-400 units. Since 463 units are already in the valid pipeline/on-hand, and the game is approaching its end (Period 45/50), I will order a small amount (30 units) to maintain a buffer, as actual arrivals have been inconsistent and the pipeline is sufficient but not excessive once phantom units are removed.",

Removing these phantoms, the actual pipeline consists of orders from P44 (120), P45 (30), and P46 (120), totaling 270 units. Current on-hand inventory is 81. Mean demand since Period 30 has been approximately 105 units/period. Following a base-stock logic for a 2-period lead time (covering 3 periods of demand: 3 * 105 = 315), the required inventory (on-hand + actual pipeline) should be around 315. Currently, we have 81 (on-hand) + 270 (actual pipeline) = 351 units. While we have enough to cover the immediate 3-period window, the end of the game is approaching (Period 47 of 50).

Subtracting the confirmed 1354 phantom units from the 1684 reported in-transit leaves only 330 units of 'real' pipeline (P44, P45, P46, P47). With On-Hand at 0 and current demand averaging ~100-110 units, we need enough inventory to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods). Assuming a demand of ~120 units per period, we need ~360 units in the real pipeline. Currently, we have 330 units (120+30+120+60).
