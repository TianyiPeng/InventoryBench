The historical demand data (P1-P5) shows an average of approximately 102 units with a standard deviation of 37. The OR baseline recommends 164 units based on the critical fractile (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1) = 0.8) and the promised lead time of 2 periods. Given that we have no current inventory and need to cover the current period (P1) plus the two-period lead time wait before the first order arrives, we must establish a pipeline. Since the first period demand will be resolved after our decision, we rely on the OR's base-stock calculation which targets a level to cover (L+1) periods of demand. The recommendation of 164 units is a reasonable starting point to build inventory without overcommitting, as it covers roughly 1.6x the mean demand, providing a safety buffer for volatility seen in the historical data (range 43-137).

Based on the rules, a lead time of 2 means the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the Period 3 conclusion. Since 'arrived=0' was reported for Period 3, the Period 1 order is either delayed or lost. 2. Inventory & Demand: Current on-hand is 0. Demand for the first three periods was 125, 135, and 78 (Average ~113). Because arrivals are late, the machine has sold 0 units and is incurring significant lost sales. Total in-transit is 379 units. 3. OR Analysis: The OR algorithm recommends 0 units. This is because it sees a large pipeline (379) relative to its calculated base-stock level, assuming those 379 units will arrive eventually. 4. Decision: Since the Period 1 order is officially late (should have arrived in Period 3 conclude), I must treat the pipeline as unreliable. However, I have already ordered 379 units. Ordering more when the supply chain is blocked might just lead to a massive inventory glut if they all arrive at once.

Demand Analysis: Historical mean is ~100 units/period. Recent demand (P11) was 142. Stockouts have occurred in P6, P7, and now P11. 4. OR Strategy Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 10 is dangerously low because it calculates based on a pipeline that includes lost shipments (In-transit: 350) and may underestimate demand variance. My requirement for (L+1) coverage (3 periods * 105 avg) is ~315 units. Reliable pipeline is at most 135 (P9 + P11). 5.

We are waiting for P11 (ordered P11, now P14, 3 periods), P12 (ordered P12, now P14, 2 periods), and P13 (ordered P13, now P14, 1 period).

The current pipeline shows 635 units, consisting of orders from P12 (160), P13 (150), and P14 (110).

Demand averages around 100 units/period (Historical mean=101.4, Sample mean=102). With a lead time of 2-3 periods, we need enough inventory + pipeline to cover ~4 periods of demand (~400 units). Our current pipeline of 420 units (excluding lost ones) plus 10 on-hand units totals 430 units.\n\n3. **Demand & OR Comparison**: The OR recommendation is 0 because its internal capped base-stock calculation views the 635 units in-transit as excessive. While I have identified that ~215 of those units are potentially lost (P2, P6, P10), the remaining ~420 active units in the pipeline are sufficient to meet upcoming demand.

Based on an L+1=4 period risk window, I need roughly 388-400 units to cover demand until the next available shipment arrives. \n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees a massive pipeline of 515 units vs its internal base stock.

The historical average is approximately 100-110 units. 4. Pipeline Evaluation: With a 3-period lead time, we need to cover demand for Period 22, 23, 24, and 25 (L+1 = 4 periods). At an average demand of 110, we need ~440 units in the pipeline. Currently, P17 (150 units) should arrive this period, P18 (150) in P21 (wait, P18 should have arrived in P21 if LT=3. Since P21 conclude shows 'arrived=0', P18 is either delayed or the lead time is sliding to 4 periods). 5. Action: The OR recommendation of 0 is likely due to the high in-transit total (750), but as identified in previous insights, the supplier is unreliable. However, with 535 units ordered between P17-P20, we have significant coverage coming.

Specifically, orders from P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 420 units) are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights. The orders from P20 (115), P22 (120), and P23 (125) have already arrived. This leaves only P24 (120), P25 (110), and P26 (115) as reliable incoming inventory, totaling 345 units. The OR recommends 0 units because it views the raw 980 units in-transit as sufficient. However, removing the 420 lost units and the 360 units that already arrived (but are still in the raw 'in-transit' counter) reveals a real pipeline of only 200 units (P25 and P26).

Based on recent history (P23 arriving in 2 periods and the stabilized 3-period lead-time expectation), the P24 order is expected to arrive in Period 29. The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically derived from the total in-transit quantity (1100), but this treats ancient lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, etc.) as pending inventory. Excluding these lost orders, the realistic pipeline is approximately 465 units.

The 'In-transit' figure of 1660 is deceptive; approximately 1320 units are confirmed lost shipments from periods prior to P41. The active, reliable pipeline consists only of orders from Period 42 (115 units), Period 43 (115 units), and Period 44 (115 units). On-hand inventory is currently 44 units. Recent demand has been fluctuating but averages roughly 95-100 units per period over the last five periods (P40-P44: 118, 147, 87, 87, 94). The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically driven by the inflated 'In-transit' total and should be ignored. To maintain a safe inventory level covering a 3-period lead time plus the review period (4 periods total demand ~400 units), I must continue ordering to offset the ongoing 'ghost inventory' in the system.

Based on 'Carry-over Insights', orders from Periods 17-33 are confirmed lost. The reliable pipeline includes orders from Period 44 (115 units) and Period 45 (115 units), totaling 230 reliable units. Lead-Time Inference: Actual lead time has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, recently consistently hitting 3 periods (P40, P41, P42). Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been lower (avg ~75 over last 5 periods), but the mid-term average (P35-P45) is closer to 100. OR Comparison: OR recommends 0 units because it likely perceives the 'In-transit' figure as valid stock or sees current on-hand as sufficient for its target service level given recent lower demand. Strategy: With 223 on-hand and 230 reliable units arriving soon (Total 453), and an average demand level of ~100, we have coverage for approximately 4.5 periods.

The reliable active pipeline consists only of orders from P44 (115 units) and P45 (115 units), totaling 230 units. Current on-hand is 119, giving a total functional inventory of 349. Average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 93 units. With an actual lead time currently seen around 3 periods, we need enough stock to cover demand for the current period plus the 3-period lead time (4 periods total). Expected demand over 4 periods is ~372 units (93 * 4). Since 349 is slightly below the target, and given the high volatility and supplier unreliability, a small buffer order is necessary to prevent stockouts in the final periods of the game (ending P50).

Currently, on-hand inventory is 24 units. The reliable pipeline consists of the orders from Period 44 (115), Period 45 (115), and Period 47 (60). Given that we are at Period 48 of 50, we must ensure we have enough stock for the final three periods (48, 49, 50). Average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 93 units. Total expected demand for the remainder of the game is around 280 units (93 * 3). Our current reliable inventory (24 on-hand + 115 from P44 + 115 from P45 + 60 from P47) equals 314 units. While this mathematically covers the expected demand, the observed lead time has recently been 3 periods (P41, P42, P43 took 3, 3, and 2 periods respectively). The order from Period 44 is expected to arrive during Period 48 conclude. To hedge against a potential stockout in the final two periods if Period 44 is delayed or if demand spikes, I will place a small safety order.
