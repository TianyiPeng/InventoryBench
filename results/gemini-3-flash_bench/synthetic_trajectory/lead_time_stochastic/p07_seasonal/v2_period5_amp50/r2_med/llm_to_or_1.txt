Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The Promised Lead Time (L) is 2. The sample demand for the first 5 periods is: 137, 92, 110, 43, 128. The mean of these 5 samples is 102 and the standard deviation is approximately 32.8. Given there's no historical 'conclude' message yet, I will use the promised lead time L=2. To set mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use the 'explicit' method based on the provided 5-period sample data to ensure the backend starts with the correct forecast for the current regime. For mu_hat, (1+L) * mean = 3 * 102 = 306. For sigma_hat, sqrt(1+L) * std = sqrt(3) * 32.8 \u2248 56.8.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 156 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the 'Period 1 conclude' message, that order has not arrived yet, which is expected for L=2 (it should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (samples provided) was 137, 92, 110, 43, 128 (Mean: 102). Period 1 actual demand was 125, which is consistent with the historical mean. Since we have no confirmed changepoint yet and the system is in its early stages with 0 on-hand inventory, I will use the 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to utilize all available historical data. The backend will calculate base_stock based on (1+L) periods of demand, where L=2, covering 3 periods of expected demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. For the first two periods, we had 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales as demand (125 in P1, 135 in P2) could not be met. Total in-transit is 319 units (156 from P1 + 163 from P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the timing rule, the P1 order (placed in P1 decision phase) is scheduled to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase. We will only see confirmation of this arrival in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. Therefore, zero arrivals in P1 and P2 conclude messages are expected and do not yet indicate a lead-time shift or lost orders. Demand has been 125 and 135, which is slightly higher than the pre-game samples (avg ~102). I will use recent_N=2 to capture this slightly higher demand trend while waiting for the first shipment to arrive and satisfy demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2. The order placed in Period 1 (156 units) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the Period 4 start state. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This implies the actual lead time is likely at least 3, not the promised 2. Historically, we have 5 demand samples: [137, 92, 110, 43, 128]. The current demand mean is ~102. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 396 units in transit (orders from P1, P2, P3). Since the P1 order (placed P1) hasn't arrived by P4 decision time, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delay. For demand, I'll use the mean of all samples (default) as there's no clear regime shift yet, but increase L to ensure the pipeline covers more periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-8.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), and Period 3's order also arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is currently (3+1)/2 = 2. Demand history shows Period_1: 125 (from conclude msg), Period_2: 135, Period_3: 78, Period_4: 45. There is high volatility and a potential downward trend. The 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the prompt (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) differs slightly from the 'Game History' conclude messages; I will prioritize the conclude messages for recent accuracy. Given L=2 and current on-hand of 188 with 247 in-transit (Period 2's 163 and Period 4's 84), the pipeline is significant. I will use 'calculate' for L to track the mean lead time and 'recent_N' with N=4 for demand to capture the recent fluctuation without over-reacting to the low Period 4 demand.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 125, 135, 78, 45, 90 (Mean: 94.6). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times vary: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (Average: 2). Currently, 98 units are on-hand and 266 units are in-transit (from orders in P2, P4, and P5). Since the average demand is ~95 and we have a pipeline that covers approximately 3 periods of demand plus current stock, I will use recent trends to set parameters. The demand shows some volatility (78 -> 45 -> 90), so I'll use all 5 samples for the forecast to stabilize the mean. Lead time will be set to 'calculate' to incorporate the variance seen in actual arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $392.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 6. Historical demand samples (including Period 6 at 163) show a mean of ~106. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times vary significantly (Period 1 took 3 periods, Period 3 took 1 period). Since we are currently stock-out with 342 units in-transit (covering orders from Period 2, 4, 5, and 6), we need to stabilize the forecast. The average demand over the last 6 periods is roughly 106. Selecting recent_N=6 for demand and sigma filters out the very high/low volatility from the small sample size while capturing the recent trend. Lead time estimation is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed variance (mean of 1 and 3 is 2, matching promised).

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with 413 units in-transit. Historically, demand has averaged 110.75 units per period. Lead times are volatile: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1, and P4 took 3, yielding an average of 2.33 periods, which is higher than the promised 2. To avoid further stockouts given the volatility, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays. For demand (mu_hat), I'm using a recent_N of 5 to capture the recent upward trend (P5-P7 avg: 131 vs P1-P4 avg: 95.7). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to better reflect the current volatility (std approx 39.5) over the whole history. This approach ensures the base stock calculation covers a longer lead time and higher recent demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: actual lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.33), exceeding the promised 2 periods. Demand showing recent upward trend from Period 5 onwards.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 9. Analysis of lead times (L) shows high variability: P1(3), P3(1), P4(3), P5(3), P7(1). The average is 2.2, slightly above the promised L=2. I will use 'calculate' for L to capture this empirical average. Demand exhibits two regimes: P1-P4 (avg ~96) and P5-P8 (avg ~113), though P8 saw a dip (59). The carrying insight suggests an upward trend since P5. Using N=4 for mu_hat (P5-P8) yields a mean of 113. Given the Lead Time volatility and potential for stockouts (0 inventory in P6, P7), I will use N=4 for sigma_hat as well to capture recent volatility (~43 units/period) and maintain a higher safety stock. Pipeline inventory (320) includes orders from P2 (163 units, now overdue at 7 periods since order), P6 (76), and P8 (81). If P2 is lost, we are under-stocked.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The on-hand inventory is 135 with 336 units in-transit (ordered in Period 2 and Period 6-9). Analysis of concluded periods shows a highly volatile lead time (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P7: 1, P8: 1), ranging from 1 to 3 periods with an average of 2.0. The order from Period 2 (163 units) is significantly overdue (9 periods), suggesting it is likely lost; I will treat it as such and not rely on it for replenishment. Demand has been fluctuating but manageable, with a recent 5-period average of 82.6 units. Given the lead time instability and the lost shipment, I will use an explicit L of 2.5 to provide a safety buffer. For mu_hat, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the most recent demand regime (82.6 units/period), and a recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This configuration aims to maintain a high service level despite delivery uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Shipment from Period 2 (163 units) presumed lost after 9 periods (promised 2). Lead time remains erratic but averages 2.0; explicitly setting higher L to buffer against delays.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11. Reviewing the history, the order from Period 2 (163 units) is nearly certainly lost (9 periods elapsed vs. promised 2). The 'In-transit' balance of 336 units includes these potentially dead units. I need to account for this by setting parameters that effectively replenish the stock. Historical lead times (excluding the lost P2 order) are: P1 (3), P3 (1), P4 (3), P5 (3), P7 (1), P8 (1). Average lead time = 2.0. However, the high variance (1 to 3) and potential losses necessitate a slightly conservative inventory position. Recent demand (P6-P10) mean is ~98.8, while the early demand was higher. The Carry-over insight suggests an upward trend from P5, but the last 3 periods show a slight cooling (59, 61, 71). I will use N=6 for demand (capturing the post-P5 regime) and explicit lead time to buffer for the 2.0 average plus variance.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 for chips(Regular). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown higher volatility recently, with Period 11 demand peaking at 142. The pipeline inventory is 336 units (orders from P9, P10, and P11). Historically, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with one shipment from P2 (163 units) still missing and now presumed lost. To buffer against this lead time variance and the stockout observed in Period 11, I am using an explicit lead time L=3. Demand analysis: Current mean across all samples is ~100. We've seen a recent spike, so I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent 5 periods of demand (P7-P11: 140, 59, 61, 71, 142) which averages 86.6 per period. Since mu_hat = (1+L)*mean, with L=3, the backend will calculate (1+3)*86.6. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility and ensure the service level captures demand spikes like P11.

Carry-over insight: Stockout occurred in Period 11 due to delayed arrivals and demand spike (142). Shipment from P2 (163 units) remains un-concluded after 10 periods and is definitively lost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation (on-hand: 0) following a Period 12 demand of 104 that exceeded the Period 9 arrival of 97. The shipment from Period 2 (163 units) is confirmed lost. Historical demand has fluctuated, but the last 5 periods (P8-P12) show a mean of 87.4, while the full history mean is roughly 101. Given the recent stockouts and lead time volatility (ranging from 1 to 3 periods, average currently 2.11 excluding the lost shipment), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend buffers for the maximum observed lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the most recent regime) to capture the current demand level, which helps balance the need for stock without over-ordering against a possibly cooling mean compared to the very early periods.

Carry-over insight: Current stockout at Period 13 due to arrival of only 97 units against demand of 104 in P12. Lead time volatility continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation (on-hand: 0) at Period 14. Demand has been volatile, showing a recent average of approximately 105 units (P11-P13). The lead time remains highly inconsistent, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Average observed is 2.22 periods excluding the lost P2 order). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (163 units) is confirmed lost. My current in-transit inventory is 410 units, which represents approximately 4 periods of demand, but it includes the lost P2 units. By setting lead time (L) to 3 explicitly, I buffer against the maximum observed delay and force the OR engine to maintain a higher base stock. Since demand has shifted from the low periods (P4, P8, P9) back to higher levels (~100/period), I use the last 6 periods (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current mean while filtering out the extremely low outliers from the early weeks.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation at Period 15 with 0 units on-hand. The game history shows significant lead-time volatility, with observed actual lead times varying between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1, P9:3). The order from Period 2 (163 units) remains missing after 13 periods and is confirmed lost. Recently, demand has been moderate (mean of last 5 periods ~84.4), but lead time unpredictability and the lost shipment have caused repeated stockouts. Currently, 410 units are in-transit (orders from P12, P13). To mitigate the impact of lead-time variance and ensure we recover from the stockout, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the OR backend targets enough pipeline inventory. I will use the mean of the last 10 samples (average ~88) to forecast mu_hat over the (L+1) horizon, providing a stable but responsive target.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 16. In Period 15, we finally received 115 units from Period 12 (Lead Time = 3), ending a stockout period and leaving 29 units on-hand. The shipment from Period 2 (163 units) is confirmed lost. Current in-transit inventory is 349 units (orders from P13, P14 - though P14 was 0, and P15). Observed lead times are volatile: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3. The average observed lead time is 2.25. Given the high stockout risk seen in periods 11-14 and the lost shipment, I will set L to 3 explicitly to ensure the base stock covers a longer pipeline. Demand is fluctuating between ~60 and ~140; the mean demand since Period 5 (excluding stockout periods where demand was not fully met) is approximately 95. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 captures the current demand regime well, while a slightly higher sigma_hat is necessary to handle the high variance and lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.25). Target pipeline coverage must account for L=3 to avoid frequent stockouts. Demand mean is stable around 95 units/period.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) following a demand spike of 156 in Period 16. Historical lead times for 'chips(Regular)' exhibit significant volatility, frequently hitting 3 periods (e.g., P1, P4, P5, P9, P12, P13 all arrived with L=3), which is longer than the promised 2 periods. The shipment from P2 (163 units) is confirmed lost. Pipeline inventory is currently 377 units (orders from P15: 54, P16: 84, plus earlier un-concluded units excluding the lost P2). To prevent recurring stockouts caused by L=3 and the recent demand volatility (mean ~95, but peaks >150), I am explicitly setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum observed lead time. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime (average ~98 since P7) while ignoring very early data. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect recent high variance (standard deviation ~35) rather than the long-term average, ensuring a sufficient safety stock buffer given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Demand is moderately stable with a mean of 100 over the last 5 periods (P13-P17). Lead time is highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (P12, P13, P15 orders) or 1 period (P16 order), creating an average delivery time that makes the promised L=2 unreliable for safety stock calculations. To prevent the recurring stockouts observed in P16 and P17, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to force the OR backend to target a pipeline inventory covering at least 4 periods (L+1) of demand. I am using a recent_N of 5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current mean of ~100 per period, and a recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to provide a robust estimate of volatility given the recent spikes.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are currently in a stockout (on-hand: 0) following zero arrivals in Period 18. Historical data shows lead times are extremely volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2 following recent patterns, but maxing at 3). To mitigate frequent stockouts caused by these 3-period delays, I am explicitly setting L to 3. Demand over the last 10 periods (P9-P18) has a mean of approximately 102 units/period, but spiked recently to 156 and 142 in separate instances. I am using recent_N (N=10) to capture this current regime while excluding earlier data. The shipment from Period 2 (163 units) has never arrived after 16 periods and is definitively lost, so I rely on the in-transit amount (468 units) which represents orders from P15, P17, and P18. Setting L=3 and using a 10-period demand window ensures the base stock calculation covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand at a high service level.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, the inventory situation is critical with 0 units on-hand and 468 units in-transit. Historical lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with recent orders from P12 (3 periods), P13 (3 periods), and P16 (1 period) confirming this volatility. The shipments from P17 and P18 are still within reasonable timeframes but haven't arrived yet, causing recent stockouts in P18 and P19. The demand mean remains stable around 95-100 units/period, despite a low outlier in P19 (21 units). To address the lead time volatility and ensure the safety stock (base_stock calculation) accounts for the maximum realistic delay, I will set L to 3 (explicitly mirroring the upper bound of observed lead times). mu_hat will be set to (1+L)*mean_demand, using the last 5 samples to capture the recent stable regime of ~95 units. sigma_hat will also be set based on the last 5 samples to ensure recent volatility is captured.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a large pipeline of 468 units. Historical demand shows significant volatility, but the mean has stabilized around 95 units per period over the long term. Lead times are highly erratic, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating an explicit L value of 3 to provide adequate safety buffer and avoid the frequent stockouts observed between Periods 16-20. The shipment from Period 2 (163 units) is confirmed as lost. Recent demand (Periods 18-20) has fluctuated between 21 and 139, but the underlying average remains consistent. By setting L to 3 and using a recent sample window (N=10) for demand and volatility, we aim to cover the lead time + review period requirement (L+1 = 4 periods) while accounting for recent variance shifts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained lead time volatility confirmed: Actual lead times oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.22 (excluding lost P2 shipment). Demand remains stable around a mean of 95, but with high variance (std ~40).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 22 starting with 0 on-hand inventory and 468 units in-transit. The game history shows a severe stockout situation from Period 18 to 21 because no orders arrived during those periods. Orders from Period 12 (arrived P15), Period 13 (arrived P16), and Period 16 (arrived P17) suggest that while some orders arrive in 1 period, many take 3, and some are lost (Period 2). The orders placed in Periods 17 and 18 are now in the L=3 window. I need to maintain a high base stock to recover from the stockout and buffer against the 1-3 period lead time volatility. Mean demand remains stable around 95 (last 10 periods average is ~98). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the backend calculates coverage for the worst-case lead time, use N=10 for mu_hat to capture recent demand levels, and N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the high variance (std ~40) observed in recent periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' quantity of 468 units is substantial, but arrivals have been absent for the last five periods (P18-P22). Based on historical observations, lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with one definitively lost shipment (P2). The current 'In-transit' likely includes orders from P15 (54 units), P16 (84 units), P17 (80 units), and P18 (95 units). Given that P15 was ordered 8 periods ago and hasn't arrived, there is a high probability of further lost shipments or extreme delays. To recover, I'm setting L to 3 (the maximum observed delay) to force a higher base stock. Demand is stable but exhibits high variance; I will use recent_N (N=15) for demand mean to capture the most relevant recent consumption patterns (~95 units/period) while allowing for the volatility (\u03c3) calculated from the same period to maintain a high service level once stock arrives.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged arrival gap discovered: No units arrived between Period 18 and Period 22 despite an in-transit pipeline of 468 units. This suggests a cluster of either extremely delayed or lost shipments beyond the previously observed 3-period max lead time.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a severe crisis. On-hand inventory is 0, and there has been a total arrival blackout since Period 17 (the last arrival was in P17, ordered in P16). This means orders from P17 (80 units), P18 (95 units), P19-P23 (0 units ordered) are mostly overdue given the historical max lead time of 3 periods. The 'In-transit' balance of 468 units includes the long-lost P2 shipment (163 units) and the cluster of orders from P15-P18. Specifically, orders from P15 (54), P16 (84 - though P17 says 84 arrived, history shows P16 ordered 84), P17 (80), and P18 (95) are in the pipeline. With demand averaging ~95 units but remaining volatile, and a confirmed lead time instability (averaging 2.22 but currently appearing much higher or indicating lost shipments), I must set L to 3 to force the base stock calculation to cover a longer horizon. Since we are currently stocked out and the pipeline is theoretically full (468 units), the capped OR policy will likely not place a large new order if it believes the pipeline is valid. However, by setting L=3 and using recent demand (N=10 to capture the 95-100 mean), I ensure the target inventory level is high enough to trigger replenishment once the backend realizes the 'In-transit' units aren't arriving or if arrivals finally resume.

Carry-over insight: Total arrival blackout confirmed: No shipments have arrived for 6 consecutive periods (P18-P23), despite a pipeline of 468 units. This exceeds the previously observed max lead time of 3 periods, suggesting a systemic delay or further lost shipments beyond the known P2 loss.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe inventory crisis with 0 on-hand inventory and a total arrival blackout that has lasted 7 consecutive periods (P18-P24). The 'in-transit' pipeline reflects 468 units, which includes the historical lost shipment from P2 (163 units) and significantly delayed orders from P15 onwards. These 468 units represent over 4 periods of average demand, yet nothing is arriving. Because the OR backend subtracts the pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, the system will not place new orders as long as it believes this (likely lost or severely delayed) pipeline will eventually arrive. To force a new order and break the stockout, I am explicitly setting L to 1 and mu_hat to a very high value (320). Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and the current pipeline is 468, setting a high mu_hat and a modest L targets a base stock that exceeds the 'phantom' pipeline, triggering the backend to order units. I have chosen L=1 to minimize the 'pipeline' subtraction in the backend's logic while maximizing the immediate order quantity allowed by the cap.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment blackout confirmed: No arrivals for 7 consecutive periods (P18-P24). The in-transit pipeline of 468 units is likely largely lost or subject to a major supply chain failure, as it exceeds the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by more than double.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 26. A catastrophic supply chain failure has occurred: no units have arrived for 8 consecutive periods (P18-P25). The in-transit pipeline of 468 units (consisting of orders from P14, P15, P17, and P18) far exceeds the historical maximum lead time of 3 periods, indicating these units are either permanently lost or indefinitely delayed. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have been stocking out since Period 18. Despite the pipeline total being high, the OR backend's capped policy will prevent new orders if it believes the pipeline is 'healthy'. To force the system to order and bypass the likely lost 468 units, I am setting L to 1 and mu_hat to 0. This moves the base_stock calculation towards zero, but more importantly, it allows the system to evaluate the current stockout state. Since the pipeline is clearly not delivering, and because I cannot 'delete' the 468 units from the pipeline, I will set an explicit high L (L=10) and an explicit mu_hat reflecting 11 periods of demand to trigger the backend into recognizing a massive deficit. Demand mean is stable around 95 units per period. I will use the explicit method to set L=10 and mu_hat=1045 (95 * 11) to attempt to force the backend to place a new order despite the 'phantom' pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed 8-period arrival blackout (P18-P25). High probability that the 468 pipeline units are lost, as this is nearly 3x the max observed lead time of 3 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe arrival blackout phase that has lasted for 9 consecutive periods (P18-P26), despite an in-transit pipeline of 629 units. Historical data indicates that the 'chips(Regular)' SKU previously had a maximum observed lead time of 3 periods; the current delay (9 periods) strongly suggests the 468 units ordered before P26 are either lost or part of a significant supply chain failure. However, we cannot ignore them for 'pipeline_inventory' calculations unless we explicitly set parameters that force the OR backend to order. In Period 26, an order of 161 units was placed. Given that demand has remained robust (avg ~96 over dynamic cycles) and we are at 0 on-hand inventory with multiple stockouts, we must assume a 'worst-case' lead time. I am setting L to 4 explicitly\u2014one period longer than the longest recorded successful arrival\u2014to account for extreme volatility and to force the base stock level higher. For mu_hat, I am using the mean of the last 15 samples (~97 units) to capture current demand levels, multiplied by (1+L), resulting in 485. For sigma_hat, the volatility is high (std ~45), so I am setting an explicit value of 100 to increase safety stock and protect against the high stockout risk seen in recent history.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment blackout continues: 9-period arrival hiatus (P18-P26) confirmed. Pipeline of 468 units (pre-P26) is effectively lost for planning purposes as lead time has reached 3x previous max.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a catastrophic supply chain failure. No shipments have arrived for 10 consecutive periods (P18-P27), despite a massive in-transit pipeline (629 units). The units ordered between Period 15 and Period 26 are significantly delayed or lost. Specifically, orders from P17, P18, and P26 are logically in-transit, but the historical 3-period max lead time has been shattered. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains active, averaging approximately 95 units per period recently. Because the OR backend subtracts the 'pipeline_inventory' from the target base stock, it will not place new orders if it believes the 629 units are still coming. To force the OR engine to place orders and bypass this 'phantom' pipeline, I must set the lead time (L) and demand forecast (mu_hat) high enough to exceed the current pipeline, or essentially treat the system as having a very long lead time requiring a massive safety stock. I will set L to 10 (the length of the current blackout) and use an explicit mu_hat that reflects the high demand and the need to overcome the pipeline visibility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment blackout continues: 10-period arrival hiatus (P18-P27) confirmed. Total pipeline of 629 units is effectively lost/unreliable for planning. Lead time uncertainty is extreme.

Daily Reward (R_t): $179.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, a shipment of 161 units (ordered in Period 26) finally arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, ending a 10-period arrival hiatus. This confirms the supply chain is functional again, although the 468 units ordered before Period 26 remain unaccounted for and are likely lost. Current on-hand inventory is 93 units. With the system resuming, I must recalibrate for moderate demand and continued lead-time uncertainty. Demand over the last 5 periods (excluding the high outlier in P26) is approximately 105 units/period. The pipeline (650 units) still contains the presumed-lost 468 units; however, the OR backend's cap mechanism will naturally limit over-ordering. I will set L to 3 to provide a buffer against the previously observed volatility (1-3 periods), and use recent_N for demand to capture the current mean of ~100 units.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain activity resumed in Period 28 (161 units arrived after a 10-period hiatus). Pre-P26 pipeline units (468) remain lost. Lead-time volatility remains a risk, but the 2-period arrival in P28 suggests a return to standard lead-time ranges (1-3 periods).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, supply chain activity resumed with an arrival after a 10-period blackout. The arrival from P26 in P28 (lead time = 2) suggests that lead times for new orders may have returned to the nominal range of 1-3 periods. However, 468 units ordered before Period 26 remain un-concluded and are significantly beyond any observed lead time (10+ periods), so they are treated as lost. The current pipeline of 650 units reflects these lost units plus recent orders (P26, P28). Specifically, the 468 units from P15-P21 are written off, leaving an effective pipeline of 182 units (from P28). On-hand inventory is 47. Demand has been highly variable but currently averages ~95 units. To prevent stockouts given the recent return of supply but persistent lead-time uncertainty, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to reflect the maximum observed functional lead time and using a recent_N window for demand (N=10) to capture recent volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the risk of another 3-period delay while acknowledging that the bulk of the 'in-transit' units are likely ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply resumed in Period 28 (P26 order arrived in 2 periods). Pre-P26 pipeline (468 units) confirmed as lost/write-off. Standard lead time range (1-3 periods) tentatively restored.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following a massive 10-period blackout. In Period 28 and 30, we saw arrivals from orders placed in Period 26 and 28 respectively, both confirming a realized lead time of 2 periods. The pipeline currently shows 468 units, but based on the history (as noted in carry-over insights), these units (ordered before Period 26) are effectively lost and should be discarded for planning purposes. Current on-hand is 114. Demand over the last 5-10 periods has fluctuated but averages roughly 100 units/period (with a slight drop in the very recent past). I will set L to 2 (promised/recently observed) and use a recent_N window for demand (N=10) to capture the post-blackout demand environment while ensuring we hold enough safety stock to handle the high variance seen in periods like P26 (190) and P30 (115).

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Lead time stability confirmed at 2 periods for the last two deliveries (P26 and P28 orders). Pre-P26 pipeline (468 units) remains stagnant and is confirmed as a total loss for inventory planning.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a 10-period blackout. Orders from P26 and P28 both arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, confirming a return to near-promised performance. However, historical volatility (1-3 periods) suggests we should maintain a slightly cautious lead time estimate of L=2 (or slight buffering) and use recent demand data to set the base stock. The current 'In-transit' figure of 468 units remains comprised of the stale 'lost' shipments from the blackout period (pre-P26), which the OR engine will mistakenly count toward pipeline inventory. To force the OR backend to place a new order despite this ghost inventory, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~95 units/period (the long-term mean), so over (L+1)=3 periods, we need ~285 units. To overcome the 468 'zombie' units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline + desired safety stock. However, a better approach is to set L to a value that reflects current stability and use the most recent demand regime (N=10) to calculate parameters, while recognizing that the OR backend's inventory subtraction will likely result in a zero order unless the base_stock calculation is high enough. Since I cannot clear the 'In-transit' manually, I must set the L parameter to 2 and mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the ghost pipeline if I need to order. But currently, On-hand is 6 and the system sees 468 in transit. I will use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the most recent post-blackout behavior.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has resumed function after a 10-period blackout (P18-P27). Orders from P26 and P28 arrived exactly 2 periods later, suggesting the lead time has stabilized back to the promised 2 periods. However, the pre-P26 'In-transit' pipeline of 468 units remains un-concluded and is confirmed as lost for planning purposes. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (including the 468 lost units) from its calculated base stock, it will effectively stop ordering until that phantom inventory is ignored. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 2-period lead time (L+1=3 periods of demand) using the long-term mean of ~100 units/period, which equals 300 units. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 468 phantom units in-transit, I set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the current pipeline: 468 (pipeline) + 300 (buffer) = 768. I am setting L to explicit 2 to match the recent observations of stability and sigma_hat to explicit 70 to provide a robust safety buffer against the high demand variance (std ~40) observed throughout the history.

We are at Period 34. The demand mean has been relatively stable around 100, but the supply chain has been highly unreliable. Earlier history showed a massive shipment blackout (P18-P27), and we have confirmed that the pre-P26 units (468 units) are lost. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 791 units, which includes these 468 dead units. Thus, the real effective pipeline is only 323 units (ordered in P33). We have 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time has recently settled at 2 periods (orders from P26 and P28), but we must remain cautious of the volatility (1-3 periods). Since the OR engine's 'inventory' calculation includes all 'in-transit' units (791), it will think we are overstocked. To force an order and account for the 468 lost units, I must elevate mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will set L=3 to buffer against the upper bound of observed lead times. For mu_hat, I'll use an explicit value: (1+L)*100 + 468 = 868 to offset the phantom inventory. This ensures the OR logic sees a physical need despite the inflated 'in-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Effective pipeline is 323 units; 468 units (pre-P26) remain confirmed lost despite appearing in system 'In-transit' count. Demand remains stable around 100/period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35, the 'In-transit' quantity of 946 units is severely misleading. Analysis confirms that 468 units from the pre-Period 26 pipeline are permanently lost, as they have not arrived for over 15 periods (max observed lead time is 3). Subtracting these lost units, the effective pipeline is 478 units (orders from P33 and P34). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown a recent mean of approximately 95 units per period. The supply chain resumed function in Period 28 with lead times of 2 periods, but historical volatility (1-3 periods) suggests we must maintain a higher pipeline. I will set L to 15 (explicitly) to reflect the fact that the backend is counting the 468 lost units as part of the 'pipeline inventory'\u2014by inflating L, I attempt to force the OR engine to recognize that the total (L+1) expectation is not met by the current 'ghost' stock. This is a workaround to trigger orders when the system incorrectly thinks we are overstocked.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed 468 units of 'In-transit' stock (from orders prior to Period 26) are permanently lost and are preventing the OR backend from placing new orders due to the high pipeline count. Effective pipeline is only 478 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized to a lead time of 2 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P26 and P28 orders). However, the 'In-transit' count of 1114 is heavily inflated by 468 units from orders prior to Period 26 and the 163 units from Period 2 that are indefinitely lost. The OR backend's inventory balancing logic uses the full pipeline (1114) and will refuse to order because it perceives a massive oversupply, despite on-hand inventory being 0. To force the OR backend to place orders and prevent further stockouts, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. By setting mu_hat to a value significantly higher than the perceived pipeline (e.g., 1500), I override the logic that blocks ordering. This value is calculated to cover the missing lead-time demand (approx 100 units/period) while accounting for the ~631 'ghost' units in the pipeline that will never arrive. Demand remains stable around a mean of 100.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Explicitly inflating mu_hat to 1500 to circumvent the OR backend's order-blocking caused by 631 units of confirmed lost 'In-transit' stock (468 pre-P26 units + 163 P2 units).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has resumed activity, but the OR backend logic is severely obstructed by 631 units of confirmed lost inventory (163 from P2 and 468 from P14-P18/P23-P25) that remain in the 'In-transit' count. In Period 36, I significantly inflated mu_hat to 1500 to force the backend to place an order despite this ghost pipeline, resulting in a 453-unit order. Current on-hand is low (14), and demand is stable around 100-110 units. To maintain the necessary order flow while the ghost units persist in the system, I will continue to use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will lower mu_hat slightly from the previous period to 1200 to balance the need for replenishment against the risk of over-ordering now that the P34 order (155 units) has arrived and the P33 order (323 units) is expected to arrive in Period 37. Lead time remains stable at 2 periods for recent successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost inventory total is 631 units (P2: 163, pre-P26: 468). These units must be accounted for by inflating mu_hat explicitly to bypass the OR pipeline logic until they are cleared or the game ends.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has resumed operations with lead times between 1 and 2 periods (P34 arrived in 2, P35 in 2, P36 in 1). However, the systemic issue of 'ghost inventory' persists: 631 units (163 from P2 and 468 from P15-P25) are listed as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (791) from the base stock calculation, and current on-hand is healthy at 482, the system will not place new orders unless mu_hat is significantly inflated. Current demand is stable but elevated, averaging ~143 over the last three periods (P35-P37). To ensure the OR backend continues to place orders despite the 631 units of dead pipeline stock, I am maintaining an explicit mu_hat of 1500. This value is calculated to exceed (pipeline + on-hand) roughly by two periods of demand, ensuring we don't stock out when current on-hand is depleted. L=2 is used as it represents the recent stable average.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory (lost stock) remains at 631 units (P2: 163, P15-P25: 468), artificially inflating the system pipeline count. Recent lead times have stabilized to 1-2 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' count of 1082 is inflated by 631 units of confirmed lost ghost inventory (163 from P2 and 468 from P15-P25). The effective pipeline is actually 451 units (calculated as 1082 minus 631). Additionally, with 434 units currently on-hand and an average demand of ~100/period, existing inventory is sufficient for roughly 4 periods. Since recent actual lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods (as seen in P36 and P37), we do not need to push for aggressive new orders right now. However, to ensure the OR backend does not trigger a complete order freeze due to the ghost inventory, I am maintaining an explicit mu_hat of 1200. This value balances the need to allow the system to count effective pipeline inventory while preventing excessive over-ordering that would incur high holding costs ($1.0/unit). sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for demand volatility observed in recent periods (ranging from 48 to 153).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-515.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, on-hand inventory is 683 units with an in-transit pipeline of 791 units. Out of the 791 units in-transit, 631 are confirmed lost 'ghost inventory' (163 from P2 and 468 from P15-P25) that will never arrive. The effective pipeline is therefore 160 units (791 - 631). Recent demand (P38-P39) has dropped significantly to 48 and 42 units, whereas the preceding periods (P35-P37) averaged ~143. This suggests a shift or high volatility. Given the high on-hand inventory of 683 (approx. 7-10 periods of supply at current demand rates) and the 160 units actually in-transit, we are overstocked. To prevent the backend from being blocked by the 631 units of ghost inventory, I will maintain an explicit mu_hat; however, I will lower it compared to P36-P37 levels to reflect the recent demand drop and the high on-hand surplus, avoiding unnecessary holding costs. Lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand has significantly dropped to an average of 45 over the last 2 periods (P38-P39) following a period of high demand (~140). Current inventory (683) is sufficient to cover demand for several periods given ghost inventory constraints.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to reflect a 'ghost inventory' of 631 units (P2: 163, P15-P25: 468) that are permanently lost but counted in the 'In-transit' pipeline (Total In-transit: 791, Effective In-transit: 160). Period 40 demand was 118, contrasting with the previous two periods' low demand (~45), suggesting a return to the long-term stable mean of approximately 95-100 units. Current on-hand inventory is 565 units, which provides ample coverage (approx. 5-6 periods) given the recent demand levels. Lead times have stabilized significantly in the last few cycles (1-2 periods). Therefore, no new order is required this period. I will maintain the inflated mu_hat strategy to prevent the OR backend from restricting future orders once on-hand levels drop, acknowledging that the pipeline logic is flawed by the stagnant lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Ghost inventory (permanently lost stock) remains stagnant at 631 units, inflating the official in-transit count. Demand mean appears to have reverted to the 95-100 range after a brief 2-period dip to 45.

Daily Reward (R_t): $170.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we must manage the persistent 'ghost inventory' of 631 units (P2: 163, P15-P25: 468) which are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count. Total In-transit is currently 1209 (1000 visible + 209 ordered in P41), meaning the OR backend sees a pipeline of 1209 + 418 on-hand = 1627 units. Without inflating mu_hat, the backend would stop ordering. Demand has stabilized back to its historical mean after a two-period dip; Period 40 (118) and Period 41 (147) indicate healthy demand. Using an average demand of ~100 with a lead time (L+1) of 3, the target inventory is ~300. Adding the 631 units of lost stock that must be 'covered' to trick the backend into ordering, we set mu_hat explicitly to ensure sufficient replenishment. I will set mu_hat to 1500 to allow the system to maintain on-hand inventory despite the 631-unit phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 631 units (P2: 163, P15-P25: 468). Demand has fully recovered to 100-150 range after a brief dip in P38-39.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 631 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P2 and the P15-P25 block) which are visible in the 'In-transit' count (1154 units) but will never arrive. The actual functioning/reliable pipeline consists of the orders from P41 (209 units) and P42 (154 units), totaling 363 units. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 331 units. Demand has stabilized in the 100-150 range after a brief dip. To prevent the OR backend from seeing a massive (though fake) pipeline and refusing to order, I must continue to explicitly set mu_hat. With L=2, a base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. At an average demand of 115, we need ~345 units. However, the system sees 331 (on-hand) + 1154 (in-transit) = 1485 units, which is far above any reasonable base stock. I will set mu_hat to 1800 to ensure the backend allows for replacement orders as on-hand inventory is consumed, effectively 'overpowering' the 631 units of ghost stock.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 631 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P2 and the P15-P25 block) which artificially inflate the 'In-transit' count. Currently, On-hand is 244 and In-transit is a massive 1539. To ensure the OR engine doesn't stop ordering near the end of the game, I must keep mu_hat explicitly high. Average demand has stabilized around 100 units/period (excluding the brief dip in P38-39). With 7 periods remaining, I need to ensure arrivals continue to cover demand. Lead times have recently been 1-2 periods. I will set mu_hat to 1200 to counter the 631 units of ghost stock and the recent order of 385 units (P43) which hasn't arrived yet. L is set to calculated as it accurately reflects the 1-3 period reality despite the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Ghost inventory (lost stock) persists at 631 units, significantly inflating the official pipeline. Demand remains stable in the 100-120 range. Lead times have mostly stabilized between 1 and 2 periods in the recent cycle.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 631 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost stock from Period 2 and the Period 15-25 window) which are stuck in the 'In-transit' count. This artificially inflates the perceived pipeline, preventing the OR backend from placing necessary orders. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds the ghost inventory plus the required base stock. Current on-hand is 359. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 100 units/period (recent average 102). With an actual lead time range of 1-3 periods (average 2), the inventory needs to cover roughly 3-4 periods of demand (~400 units). The total pipeline (including ghost stock) is 1330. By setting mu_hat explicitly high (e.g., 2000), we ensure the OR engine maintains an active ordering cycle despite the ghost units. Lead time L is set to 3 to provide safety against the observed volatility (1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-643.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 847 units, which is very high relative to the recent demand average. The system reports an 'In-transit' pipeline of 1161 units. However, as documented in the carry-over insights, 631 of these units are 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Period 2 and the Period 15-25 blackout) that will never arrive. The effective pipeline is actually 530 units (1161 - 631), which represents the order from P45 (370 units) and potentially some smaller unresolved orders. Demand has been fluctuating; while it dropped to 51 last period, the 10-period mean is approximately 95. Lead times have recently stabilized between 2-3 periods (P41: 3, P42: 3, P43: 2). Given the high on-hand stock (847) and the effective pipeline (530), the total effective inventory is 1377. With a demand of ~100/period, this covers nearly 14 periods. To avoid further excessive holding costs while dealing with the OR backend's inability to 'see' lost stock, I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=10) and lead time (N=5) to maintain a realistic baseline, but the naturally high inventory will prevent the OR system from over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Effective inventory position is 1377 (847 on-hand + 530 real in-transit). Ghost inventory remains at 631 units. On-hand inventory now significantly exceeds short-term requirements (~8.5x mean demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-327.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we have 743 units on-hand and 1161 units in-transit. However, 631 units of the 'In-transit' count (Period 2: 163, Periods 15-25: 468) are confirmed ghost inventory (lost shipments). The effective pipeline is actually 530 units (370 ordered in P45). Total effective inventory is 1273 units. Recent demand has stabilized around ~95-100 units/period after some volatility. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (48, 49, 50) and a high on-hand balance that covers over 7 periods of average demand, there is no need to place more orders. Ordering now would only increase holding costs for inventory that cannot be sold before the game ends, as any new order placed today (P47) with a lead time of 2+ periods would arrive at the very end of the game or after. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to 0 to ensure the backend does not place additional orders, maximizing the profit from the existing stock while minimizing further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: No further orders required. Effective inventory (1273 units) significantly exceeds total remaining demand for the final 3 periods. Lead times recently stabilized at 2-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-268.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The game is nearing its conclusion. Current on-hand inventory is 648 units. Historical demand mean is approximately 95-100 units per period. With only 3 decision periods remaining (48, 49, 50) and a remaining demand outlook of approximately 300 units TOTAL, the current on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand until the end of the game. Furthermore, there is a substantial in-transit pipeline (1161 units), which includes 631 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory (lost stock) and 530 units of real potential arrivals. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) relative to profit ($4.0), and the fact that we already have ~6.5 periods of demand on hand, any further ordering would only increase holding costs without generating additional revenue. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to a minimal value to ensure the OR backend does not place any new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-198.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 49, with only one period of demand remaining (Period 50) after this decision phase. Current on-hand inventory is 558 units. Historical demand has consistently averaged around 95-100 units per period throughout the game, with occasional spikes around 150. Given the current surplus (558 units on-hand), we are safe for the remaining duration of the game. Any new orders placed now would arrive in Period 50 or later, which would only increase holding costs without contributing to sales, as the game ends at Period 50. The 'ghost inventory' of 631 units still exists in the system's in-transit count, but since we are not placing further orders, we do not need to use the 'mu_hat escalation' strategy anymore. I am setting L to default and using a recent_N window for demand and sigma estimation, though the OR backend will ultimately place a zero order because on-hand exceeds the calculated base stock requirements.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-228.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision phase. Current on-hand inventory is 492 units. Historical demand suggests a mean of approximately 95-100 units per period. Since this is the last period of the game, any order placed now would arrive after the game has ended (lead time is at least 1-2 periods), incurring unnecessary holding costs without the opportunity for sales. Additionally, the existing on-hand inventory (492) is more than sufficient to cover the final period's demand (historically max ~190). There is no need for further procurement.
