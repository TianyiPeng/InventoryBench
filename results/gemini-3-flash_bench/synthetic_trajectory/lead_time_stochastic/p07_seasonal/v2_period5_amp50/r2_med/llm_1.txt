The mean demand is approximately 102 units/period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. This means an order placed in Period 1 will arrive during Period 3 and be visible/usable at the start of Period 4. I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 to ensure availability when the first order arrives. Total demand for 3 periods at the current mean is ~306 units. Since current on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0, I will place a substantial initial order to establish inventory. Given the variance (SD ~34), I'll target a slightly higher stock level to avoid stockouts in the first three periods.",

Historic demand for the first 5 periods (simulated/provided) was [137, 92, 110, 43, 128], averaging ~102 units/period. The actual Period 1 demand was 125, which is consistent with the history. I need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 periods) because the next arrival isn't until the end of Period 3. Total demand expected for periods 2, 3, and 4 is approximately 300-330 units.

To prepare for Period 4 and 5, I should place an additional order. Given the average demand of ~110 and a desire to maintain a safety buffer against the high holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4) ratio (4:1), I will order another 110 units to ensure the pipeline stays full for the period following the current in-transit arrival.",

Estimating demand at ~130 units/period, I need roughly 390 units to cover these periods plus a small safety buffer. Since I already have 430 units in the pipeline (320 arriving P3, 110 arriving P4), I am theoretically covered for immediate needs.

Targeting a total pipeline (On-hand + In-transit + New Order) to cover periods 3, 4, and 5 (approx 130 * 3 = 390 units), I see my current In-transit (430) already exceeds this.

Recent periods showed a brief trough (P38-P39) followed by a return to mean (P40: 118 units). My goal is to maintain a service level covering (Lead Time + 1) periods, which is roughly 300 units (3 periods * 100 demand). Inventory assessment: Current on-hand is 149 units. The Period 40 order (120 units) is the only reliable in-transit shipment, as previous orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33) totaling 1,520 units are confirmed or highly likely to be lost (ghost inventory). The Period 37 order (130 units) is now 4 periods old; given the recent 1-2 period lead time trend, it is likely lost as well. Therefore, reliable pipeline = On-hand (149) + P40 In-transit (120) = 269 units. To reach a target pipeline of 330 units (3 periods * 110 to be safe), I will place an order of 60 units. This manages the risk of stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs, especially since total reported in-transit remains misleadingly high.",
