Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0. There is no historical lead time data yet, so I will rely on the promised lead time of 2 periods. The demand history provided (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) shows a mean of 102 and a standard deviation of approximately 34.6. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), the OR backend will calculate a high service level. Since this is the first period and we need to build inventory to cover the (L+1) window, I'll use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to establish a stable baseline. No changepoints or lead time deviations are yet detectable.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 164 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the 'CRITICAL TIMING EXAMPLE', an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 2 is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and will be first visible in the Period 4 start message. Thus, the 'arrived=0' in the Period 1 conclude message is expected and does not indicate a delay yet. Demand in Period 1 was 126, which is consistent with the provided historical sample (137, 92, 110, 43, 128). With 0 on-hand, we had 126 lost sales. For Period 2, I will use the 'default' lead time (2) and 'default' demand statistics based on all available samples (including the just-observed P1 demand) to establish a baseline. The OR engine will calculate a base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, with 328 units in-transit (164 ordered in P1, 164 ordered in P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on Scenario A in the timing guidelines, the P1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's resolution phase and will be visible in the P3 conclude message at the start of P4. Therefore, it is normal to have 0 arrivals and 0 sales in P1 and P2. Historical demand from the provided sample list is: P1=137, P2=92, P3=110, P4=43, P5=128; however, the game history reports actual realized demand for P1=126 and P2=119. The mean of P1 and P2 demand is 122.5. Since we are just starting and there's no evidence yet of lead-time drift or lost shipments, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the actual demand experienced so far, ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (164 units), Period 2 (164 units), and Period 3 (54 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates the actual lead time is likely longer than 2 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and have missed all demand so far (significant lost profit), we must maintain a high pipeline. Historically, demand for the first 5 samples is [137, 92, 110, 43, 128], averaging ~102 per period. With L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+2)=3 periods of demand (~306 units). Our current in-transit is 382. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay and use all 5 samples for demand to stabilize the forecast, as the recent Period 4 demand (43) might be an outlier or part of high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the 'Period 4 conclude' message, we see two arrivals: Period 1's order arrived (lead_time=3) and Period 3's order arrived (lead_time=1). The promised lead time is 2. This suggests variability in delivery (1 to 3 periods). The demand history (P1-P5: 137, 92, 110, 43, 128) shows significant variance but no clear structural shift yet. Mean demand is ~102. Current On-hand is 200, and In-transit is 296 (from orders in P2 and P4). Since the lead time is fluctuating around the mean of 2, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (3 and 1). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' (all samples) as 5 data points are insufficient to confirm a new regime, especially with the high volatility observed in P4 (demand=43 vis-a-vis others).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1480.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 137, 92, 110, 43, 128 (Mean: 102). From the conclude messages: The order from P1 arrived at P4 (Lead Time = 3), and the order from P3 arrived at P4 (Lead Time = 1). The promised lead time is 2, so actual lead time is volatile (average = 2). Current on-hand is 116 and in-transit is 310 (from orders in P2, P4, and P5). Since the average demand is 102 and lead time is approx 2, the pipeline (1+L=3) requires roughly 306 units. We have 116 + 310 = 426 units already accounted for, which is significantly above the base stock requirement. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to average the observed shifts and 'default' for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture the full demand history, allowing the OR backend to naturally throttle orders via the pipeline inventory logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2204.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are starting with 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 6 (demand 158 vs 116 available). The promised lead time is 2, but observed actual lead times have been 3 (P1 order) and 1 (P3 order), averaging 2. The P2 order (164 units) is now 4 periods overdue (ordered P2, currently P7 start), suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. To recover from the stockout and account for the missing P2 shipment, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for the demand forecast. This captures the recent volatility (ranging from 18 to 158). For lead time, I'll use 'calculate' to weight the historical arrivals equally. The parameters aim to rebuild the pipeline to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) while the backend's base-stock logic attempts to bridge the gap left by the missing P2 inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2508.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has exhausted available stock in the last two periods. Historical demand data from first 7 periods (126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158, 134) plus the seed data shows significant variance, though recent periods suggest an upward trend. Lead Time Analysis: Promised L=2. Observations: P1 arrived P4 (L=3), P3 arrived P4 (L=1), P4 arrived P7 (L=3). P2 order (164 units) is significantly overdue (7 periods since order), suggesting a lost shipment or severe disruption. Strategy: Since P2 is likely lost, the 'In-transit' figure of 394 units consists of P5(14), P6(73), P7(143), and the likely lost P2(164). Subtracting 164 from in-transit leaves only 230 reliable units. I will use 'explicit' L=3 to reflect the observed shipment delays and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the recent higher demand (avg ~100+ units) while avoiding the outlier low of 18 in Period 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is unstable, averaging 2.33 with occurrences of L=3. Period 2 shipment (164 units) is likely lost (7 periods elapsed). Demand shows high volatility with a recent 3-period average of 125 units.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 102 units and 389 units in transit. Historical lead times for chips(Regular) have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P4: L=3 & L=1; P7: L=3; P8: L=3 & L=1), confirming instability. The order from Period 2 (164 units) has not arrived after 7 periods and is now confirmed as lost. Recent demand (last 5 periods) shows significant volatility (84, 158, 134, 55, and the provided historical samples 137, 92, 110, 43, 128). To mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by lead-time variance and lost shipments, I will use an explicit L of 2.33 (average of observed successful arrivals) and use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capitalize on the most recent consumption patterns.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 2 shipment (164 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Lead time is bi-modal, either 1 or 3 periods, averaging 2.33.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1186.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the Period 2 shipment (164 units) is essentially lost as it has significantly exceeded the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. Historical lead times show a bi-modal distribution (1 period or 3 periods), with an average lead time calculated from arrivals being approximately 2.0 (values: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1). I will set L to 'calculate' to capture this variability. Recent demand has cooled down significantly compared to the early spikes, with the last 5 periods (Periods 5-9) averaging 80.6 units, whereas the full history (137, 92, 110, 43, 128, 126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158, 134, 55, 72) suggests a higher mean. To avoid over-stocking given the current on-hand inventory of 182 and an in-transit pipeline of 237 (which includes the likely-lost P2 order), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to reflect the current demand regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture recent volatility without the noise of the early periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Period 2 shipment (164 units) is confirmed lost (8 periods elapsed). Lead time averages 2.0 but fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods. Demand stabilized at a lower mean of ~81 units over the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1418.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of the 'conclude' messages reveals significant lead time variability: orders arrive in either 1 or 3 periods (average ~2.0). The Period 2 order (164 units) is now 9 periods old and must be treated as lost to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Demand has shifted from an early high mean to a more stable recent regime. Over the last 5 periods (P6-P10), demand was 158, 134, 55, 72, 80 (avg 99.8); however, excluding the P6/P7 spike, the last 3 periods average 69. To balance service levels against the $1.0 holding cost, I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the stabilization while respecting the recent variance. I will explicitly set L=2.3 to account for the frequent L=3 occurrences observed in history, ensuring the base stock calculation covers the risk of longer transit times.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Period 2 shipment (164 units) is definitively lost (9 periods elapsed). Lead time is bi-modal (1 or 3 periods). Demand stabilized at a lower mean of ~80-100 units following a mid-game spike.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, on-hand inventory is 0 following a demand spike of 149 in Period 11. The Period 2 order (164 units) is confirmed lost (10 periods elapsed). Observed lead times are bi-modal: 1 period (P3, P7, P8 orders) or 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 orders). Average lead time is (3+1+3+3+1+1)/6 = 2.0, but the 'calculate' method is chosen to handle this variance. Demand has shifted from early volatility to a more stable regime; the last 5 periods (P7-P11) have an average demand of (134+55+72+80+149)/5 = 98 units. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this current trend while providing enough protection against the high variance seen in Period 11.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 17 units with 386 units in transit (excluding the definitively lost Period 2 order). Analysis of the last 4 concluded lead times (P7:L=1, P8:L=1, P10:L=2, P12:L=2) shows a shift away from the earlier L=3 delays towards the promised L=2, though it remains slightly volatile. Demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) has averaged 89.2 units, showing a stabilization compared to earlier spikes. I will set L to 2 (promised/recent trend) and use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture this stable but lower demand regime. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent demand variability (std ~29) ensuring a sufficient buffer for the 3rd period of risk (L+1) without over-ordering given the high in-transit pipeline.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 386 units in transit. Historical lead times have been highly variable, alternating between 1 period (P3, P7, P8) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), with P10 achieving the promised 2 periods. The average observed lead time is 2.14 periods. The order from Period 2 (164 units) is now 12 periods old and is definitively lost; this unit count must be excluded from the OR backend's perceived pipeline to trigger necessary replenishment. Demand has stabilized somewhat after early volatility, with a 5-period average of 95.8 units (P9-P13). I will set L to 'calculate' to incorporate all lead time evidence and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (P9-P13) to capture the current demand regime. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for recent variability (e.g., the spike to 149 in P11).

Daily Reward (R_t): $285.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 10-14) has averaged approximately 84 units per period (80, 149, 90, 78, 25). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline (in-transit) of 422 units includes several orders: P12 (134 units, now at L=3), P14 (51 units), and the P2 legacy order which is confirmed lost. Observed lead times over the last five arrivals have been 1, 1, 2, 3 periods, averaging 1.75. Given the stockout in Period 14 (only 15/25 demand met) and the arrival of only 15 units, there's a risk of continued stockouts if P12 (134 units) doesn't arrive in Period 15 arrival phase. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the variable lead time and use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current mean of ~84, helping the OR engine estimate a safer base stock level to recover from the current stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1726.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system has 41 units on-hand and 306 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the order from Period 2 (164 units) is confirmed lost as 14 periods have elapsed since it was placed, far exceeding the observed lead times of 1-3 periods. This lost shipment must be excluded from the pipeline inventory to avoid under-ordering. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 73 units. Observed lead times have been 1, 2, or 3 periods, suggesting a move back toward the middle of that range; thus, an explicit lead time of 2 is appropriate. To ensure high service levels (q=0.95), parameters are set to cover lead time + review period demand (3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Period 2 shipment (164 units) is definitively lost and must be excluded from pipeline calculations. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 87 units, but P13-P15 shows a lower sustained average of 65.3 units.

Daily Profit: $779.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $779.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory is currently at 0 on-hand following a demand spike of 182 units in Period 16, which significantly exceeded the recent average demand of ~65-80 units. In-transit inventory stands at 346 units; however, 164 units from the Period 2 order are confirmed lost (14 periods overdue), making the effective pipeline 182 units (Orders from P14, P15, and P16). Lead times have been bi-modal (1 or 3 periods), averaging approximately 2 periods excluding the lost shipment. Due to the recent volatility (the P16 spike vs. the P13-15 low), I will use a conservative N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the recent regime shift without overreacting solely to the P16 spike. Setting L=2 (default) is appropriate as the mean lead time remains cerca 2.0, but the pipeline adjustment for the lost P2 order is critical to ensuring the OR backend places a sufficient order to recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly: Period 16 demand (182) was nearly 3x the P13-P15 average (65.3). Lead time remains unreliable but averages 2 periods (bi-modal 1 or 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1369.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the Period 2 shipment of 164 units is definitively lost (16 periods elapsed). The pipeline inventory (351) includes this lost shipment, so the functional pipeline is actually 187 (351 - 164). Period 16 demand was an outlier (182), while Period 17 returned to a more moderate level (73). Given the high volatility and the loss of the early shipment, I am using a recent_N (N=5) window for demand to capture the recent spike alongside the subsequent stabilization. Lead time remains bi-modal (1 or 3 periods), averaging 2.0 based on recent history (P14-P16 arrivals), so I will use the 'calculate' method to utilize the full historical performance. This strategy aims to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to buffer against the demonstrated volatility and lead time instability while accounting for the lost units in the backend's calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: P16 demand (182) was a significant spike compared to the 65.3 average of P13-P15; P17 (73) suggests a return to moderate levels but high variance persists. Functional pipeline is 187 units (Accounted P2 lost shipment of 164 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $342.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Period 18 ended with 0 inventory after fulfilling 18 units of 71 units demand. The Period 2 shipment (164 units) is confirmed lost, leaving a functional pipeline of 320 units (Total in-transit 484 - 164 lost). Historical lead times are bi-modal (1 or 3 periods, averaging 2). Recent demand exhibits high volatility: after a spike in P16 (182), the last two periods (P17: 73, P18: 71) suggest a return to a mean near 100 with significant variance. I will use recent_N=5 for demand mean (P14-P18 average is ~84) and sigma to capture this volatility. L is set to 2 (promised/average) to maintain the base stock calculation, but the explicit mu_hat will be set higher to account for the L+1 period coverage and recent demand swings.

Carry-over insight: Current functional pipeline is 320 units (484 in-transit - 164 lost from P2). Demand mean over P14-P18 is 88.8 units; however, the P16 spike (182) significantly inflated variance, requiring a conservative sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 20. On-hand is 0, demand is currently volatile. The P2 order (164 units) is definitively lost after 18 periods, meaning the functional pipeline is 320 units (484 - 164). L calculation: Observed lead times are 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, which averages 2.18. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this instability. Demand: Recent demand (P15-P19: 93, 182, 73, 71, 47) averages 93.2 units, but with extremely high variance (sigma ~ 51). Because the functional pipeline (320) already covers approximately 3 periods of average demand (approx 280 units) and on-hand is 0 due to an arrival gap, I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 (93.2 * 3.18) to ensure the OR backend bridges the current inventory stockout while accounting for the bi-modal lead time and recent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: P19 demand (47) is a significant drop from the P16 spike (182), confirming a high-variance regime. Functional pipeline remains 320 units (adjusted for 164 lost units from P2).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the firm is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The total in-transit quantity is 498 units, but 164 units from Period 2 are definitively lost (19 periods elapsed). The functional pipeline is therefore 334 units (498 - 164). Demand has shifted since the Period 16 spike (182); the last 4 periods (P17-P20) show a mean demand of 69.25 units. However, to account for the overall current regime and high variance observed lately, I will use a window of the last 10 periods (P11-P20) which captures the spike and subsequent stabilization, averaging 91.6 units. Lead time remains bi-modal (1 or 3 periods), averaging 2.0. By setting L to 2 and using a recent_N window of 10 for demand parameters, I am instructing the OR backend to target a base stock covering 3 periods of demand (~275 units). Since the functional pipeline (334) currently exceeds this calculated base stock, the OR backend will likely place a minimal or zero order this period to avoid excessive holding costs while waiting for the arrivals scheduled from P18 and P20.

Carry-over insight: Current functional pipeline is confirmed at 334 units after adjusting for the 164-unit loss from Period 2. Demand mean over the last 10 periods is 91.6 units, reflecting a high-variance environment following the P16 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are at 0 on-hand inventory and have faced stockouts for the last 3 periods due to lead-time instability and delayed arrivals. The 'In-transit' count is 498, but as documented in the Carry-Over Insights, 164 units from Period 2 are definitively lost. The functional pipeline is therefore 334 units (498 - 164). Recent demand (P21 = 123) is higher than the previous stagnation around 60-80, suggesting the demand mean has shifted back toward the long-term average. To recover from recent stockouts while accounting for the bi-modal lead time (alternating between 1 and 3 periods, averaging ~2.3), I am using L=3 to ensure the backend base stock covers the upper bound of the delivery window. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 (covering P14-P21) to capture the recent volatility and the return to higher demand levels (avg ~84), which for L=3 translates to a mu_hat of ~336. I am using recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to accurately reflect the high variance observed over the last several cycles (stdev ~46), which for L=3 scales to a sigma_hat of ~92.

Carry-over insight: Recurring bi-modal lead time (1 or 3 periods) continues to cause stockout cycles; functional pipeline is 334 units (adjusted for 164-unit loss from Period 2). Demand is exhibiting recurring high-variance cycles.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 23 and currently have 0 on-hand inventory with 510 units in-transit. However, the Period 2 order (164 units) is confirmed lost, making our functional pipeline 346 units (510 - 164). This pipeline consists of orders from P17 (96), P18 (133), P20 (14), and P22 (12). The lead time remains bi-modal (1 or 3 periods). The last several periods (P21 at 123, P22 at 125) indicate a significant demand regime shift back to high levels after a lull in P19-P20. Over the last 10 periods (P13-P22), demand mean is approx 88.3 units, but the most recent 5 periods (P18-P22) reflect high volatility (std ~34) and a move toward a higher mean. To prevent further stockouts and account for the bi-modal lead time and lost shipment, I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to capture the current upward trend while maintaining a calculated lead time to bridge the 1-3 period variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 21-22 demand (~124 units) indicates a return to high-demand levels compared to the P19-P20 average (66.5), representing an 86% increase. Functional pipeline remains adjusted by -164 units due to the P2 loss.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment has entered a high-demand, high-variance regime. Over the last 10 periods (P14-P23), mean demand is approximately 90.7 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P21-P23) averaged 90 units, while P21-P22 spiked to 124. This suggests significant volatility. On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (4 units). Current in-transit inventory is 484 units, but subtracting the confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (164 units) leaves a functional pipeline of 320 units. Lead times are bi-modal (1 or 3 periods). Using a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current high-demand, high-variance regime while smoothing the effect of the P16 spike. Setting L to the average calculated lead time (calculate) accounts for the consistent bi-modal behavior (averaging ~2 periods) observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in a high-variance state; P21-P22 showed a 86% increase (~124 units) over P19-P20 (~66.5 units), though P23 dropped to 22. Functional pipeline is 320 units (484 total - 164 lost from P2).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 units on-hand and an in-transit balance of 484. However, the Period 2 order of 164 units is definitively lost (23 periods overdue), making the functional pipeline 320 units. Lead time remains bi-modal (1 or 3 periods), so I am setting L to 2 (the promised average) but maintaining high variance expectations. Recent demand has been extremely volatile: after a spike to ~124 (P21-P22), demand dropped to 22 (P23) and rose to 71 (P24). The 10-period average (P15-P24) is 84.3 units, but the high variance necessitates a conservative sigma_hat. With 320 functional units in the pipeline and a desired base stock around 250-300 units ((L+1)*mean + safety), no new order is expected to be triggered by the OR backend, which is appropriate given the current stockout and pending arrivals from Period 17/18.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with a significant portion of the 'In-transit' units representing a lost shipment from Period 2 (164 units). The functional pipeline is 320 units (484 total in-transit - 164 lost). Recent demand continues to show high volatility: after a spike in P21-P22 (~124 units), demand dropped to 22 in P23 and returned to 110 in P25. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), mean demand is approximately 86 units, but the high variance necessitates a larger sigma_hat to prevent frequent stockouts caused by the bi-modal lead time (observed as either 1 or 3 periods). I will set L to 2 (promised) but use explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-variance demand regime and the need for a higher base stock to buffer against lead time instability.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The Period 2 shipment of 164 units is definitively lost after 25 periods, so the functional pipeline is 332 units (496 total in-transit - 164 lost). Recent demand (P25: 110, P26: 120) confirms a return to a high-demand regime, averaging 95.8 units over the last 5 periods. Lead time remains bi-modal (1 or 3 periods), averaging 2.0. To recover from the stockout and mitigate lead-time variability, I am setting L explicitly to 2 to match the average, and using recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the sustained high variance observe in recent periods, ensuring the OR backend targets a high enough service level to prevent further stockouts despite unreliable arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: P25-P26 average (115) is 73% higher than the P19-P20 average (66.5). Functional pipeline is currently 332 units after adjusting for the 164-unit loss from Period 2.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system is in a stockout state despite high demand (Period 25-27 average of 114 units). The 'In-transit' quantity of 496 units is misleading: it includes the 164 units from Period 2, which are definitively lost (ordered 26 periods ago). Excluding these, the functional pipeline is 332 units. Lead time is bi-modal (1 or 3 periods, averaging 2). Current pipeline inventory is meant to cover demand during the lead time (L+1 periods). Given the recent high-demand regime (approx. 115 units/period over P25-P26), I will use recent_N to capture this elevated demand state. I am setting L to 2 (promised) to allow the OR engine to use its internal logic, but choosing mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 7 periods (P21-P27) to reflect the sustained higher mean (~81-125 range) and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation targets a higher level to recover from the stockout.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 484 units in-transit. Based on consistent carry-over insights, the Period 2 order of 164 units is definitively lost, making the 'functional' in-transit inventory 320 units (484 - 164). Lead time remains bi-modal (1, 2, or 3 periods) with a consistent average near the promised L=2. Demand has stabilized into a high-demand, high-variance regime. Over the last 8 periods (P21-P28), demand has averaged 101.6 units, compared to much lower levels earlier. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat to capture this sustained high-demand level and explicit sigma_hat set to 35 to account for the frequent fluctuations (ranging from 22 to 125). Setting L to its promised value of 2 via 'default' is sufficient as the 'calculate' method would be skewed by the lost P2 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: P21-P28 average demand is 101.6 units, a significant increase from the P19-P20 average of 66.5. Functional pipeline inventory check: total in-transit 484 minus 164 confirmed lost from Period 2 equals 320 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 analysis: On-hand inventory is 0 following a string of stockouts. The total In-transit is 484 units, but historically, the Period 2 order (164 units) is confirmed lost (28 periods have elapsed). Thus, the functional pipeline is actually 320 units (484 - 164). Lead time remains bi-modal, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting an average near the promised 2. Demand has stabilized into a high-demand regime; the average demand from Period 21 to Period 29 is 98.9 units, significantly higher than the earlier mid-game average. To ensure recovery and satisfy current demand levels, I will use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat to capture this higher mean (~99 units per period) and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time. High sigma_hat via 'default' is maintained to buffer against the observed high variance and bi-modal lead time arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: P21-P29 average demand is 98.9 units, consistently higher than the P19-P20 average of 66.5. In-transit inventory remains adjusted: 484 total - 164 (P2 lost) = 320 functional units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 31. On-hand inventory is 0, and the total in-transit units are 484. However, consistent history confirms that the Period 2 order (164 units) is lost. Therefore, the functional pipeline is 320 units (484 - 164). Recent demand (P21-P30) shows a sustained high-demand regime averaging approximately 96 units per period, which is significantly higher than the mid-game average (~66). Lead times are bi-modal (1 or 3 periods), averaging 2. My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand. Since the functional pipeline (320) is already significantly higher than the expected demand over (2+1) periods (approx 96 * 3 = 288), the backend Capped Policy will likely result in zero orders until the pipeline clears. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~96) and account for the high volatility observed in this stage to set a safe service level.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. The current in-transit inventory is listed as 484 units, but after adjusting for the 164 units ordered in Period 2 (which is confirmed lost after 30 periods), the actual functional pipeline is 320 units. These 320 units comprise orders from Period 15 (18 units), Period 17 (96 units), Period 18 (133 units), Period 20 (14 units), Period 22 (12 units), Period 26 (12 units), and early periods that have not arrived, though the reliability of these arrivals is low given the bi-modal lead time (1 or 3 periods) and the long-lost Period 2 shipment. Demand has sustained a high-regime shift since Period 21, with the last 10 periods (P22-P31) averaging 106.3 units, significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime (~66 units). Period 31 demand was 146 units, indicating continued growth or volatility. I am setting L to 'explicit' at 2.5 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals despite the promised 2. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect the high volatility observed in this period, ensuring the OR backend calculates a sufficient base stock to break the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: P22-P31 average demand is 106.3 units (+60% vs earlier baseline). Functional pipeline remains 320 units (484 total - 164 lost from P2).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 484 units 'in-transit'. However, historical evidence from Period 10 onwards confirms that 164 units ordered in Period 2 are definitively lost, meaning the functional pipeline is only 320 units. Lead time remains bi-modal (1 or 3 periods, averaging ~2). Demand has shifted significantly: the average demand from Period 22 to 32 is 106.3 units, representing a 60% increase over earlier baseline periods, with the most recent Period 32 demand spiking to 183. To recover from current stockouts and cover the (L+1) period risk window given the high current in-transit volume, I will use a recent_N window (N=11) to capture this higher demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean and the substantial volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: P22-P32 average demand is 106.3 units. Period 32 reached a peak of 183 units. Functional pipeline remains 320 units after adjusting for 164-unit loss from Period 2.

The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high-regime average of approximately 106.3 units over the last 12 periods (P22-P33), which is a significant increase from earlier periods. Period 32 demand reached a peak of 183 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture this higher mean of ~106.3 units across the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=12 to account for the high volatility observed during this regime (SD approx 40). Regarding inventory, the total In-transit is 527 units, but the Period 2 order (164 units) is definitively lost after 32 periods. The functional pipeline is 363 units (527 - 164). Since current on-hand is 0 and the functional pipeline of 363 units is slightly above the expected demand for the (L+1) period (approx 319 units), the OR backend will moderate new orders to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 35. The inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit units are 527; however, we have long established that the 164 units ordered in Period 2 are lost. This results in a functional pipeline of 363 units (527 - 164). Our goal is to stabilize the service level after a long series of stockouts and high demand regimes. Recent demand has been volatile, peaking at 183 in P32 but dropping to 31 in P34. Over the last 14 periods (P21-P34), which represents the current high-variance regime, the average demand is 96 units/period. The lead time remains bi-modal (1 or 3 periods). I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat based on the regime average of 96 units/period across (L+1)=3 periods, totaling 288. To buffer against the high volatility observed (e.g., P32 peak), I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 120, which is approximately 1.25x the current mean, to ensure the OR backend targets a higher base stock to recover from the zero-inventory state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P21-P34 shows an average of 96 units with high variance (range 22-183). Functional pipeline remains (Total In-transit - 164) due to the lost P2 shipment.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a high-variance state with a mean demand of approximately 96 units over the P21-P35 window, though the most recent samples (P33-P35) suggest a slight cooling (82, 31, 66). On-hand inventory is 0, and 'In-transit' shows 527 units. However, we must exclude the 164 units from Period 2 that are definitively lost, resulting in a functional pipeline of 363 units. Given the bi-modal lead time (often 1 or 3 periods, averaging ~2) and high demand volatility, I am using recent_N (N=15) to capture the current regime's mean (estimated ~96) and variance. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual historical average of seen lead times. This configuration ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the increased demand level and the significant risk of stockouts due to lead-time instability.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P36) spiked to 166 units, corroborating the high-variance, high-demand regime identified in carry-over insights. Over the last 15 periods (P22-P36), the mean demand is approximately 105 units. The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 527 units in-transit. However, adjusting for the 164 units lost from Period 2, the functional pipeline is 363 units. Historically, lead times have been bi-modal (1 or 3 periods). Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=15 captures the current high-demand regime, while using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=15 accounts for the significant volatility (range 22-183). Lead time is estimated as 'calculate' to best approximate the observed mean of 2.15 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed continued high-variance regime; P36 demand (166) is among the highest recent values. Functional pipeline adjusted to 363 units after subtracting the 164-unit loss from Period 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-variance, high-mean regime. Since Period 21, the average demand is approximately 101 units, significantly higher than the earlier baseline (66.5). Period 36 and 37 demand (166 and 114) reinforces this pattern. The lead time remains bi-modal (1 or 3 periods), although no arrivals have been recorded in the conclude messages since Period 28, suggesting multiple orders are currently in-transit. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total in-transit is 527 units, but the Period 2 order (164 units) is definitively lost, making the functional pipeline 363 units. I will use recent_N (N=17, covering the regime since P21) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and volatility. To manage the bimodal lead time risk, I'll set L to an explicit value of 2 to balance the average, knowing the OR engine will use this to determine the base stock level required to cover demand through the lead and review periods.

Carry-over insight: No new significant pattern detected beyond the sustained high-demand regime and the 164-unit loss from Period 2.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0 and a significant amount of demand being lost. There are 527 units in-transit, but 164 units from Period 2 are definitively lost, making the functional pipeline 363 units. Lead times have been highly unstable and bi-modal (1 or 3 periods), but there is a concerning absence of arrivals since Period 28, despite several orders placed earlier. I am maintaining the lead time at 'calculate' to capture the historical volatility. For demand (mu_hat), the last 15 periods (P24-P38) show a mean of ~102 units, reflecting a sustained high-demand regime with significant variance. I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. The goal is to reach a base stock level that accounts for the high demand (mean ~102) over the replenishment cycle (L+1) while the OR backend caps the order to avoid over-ordering into a large existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged arrival gap: No units have arrived since Period 28 (10 periods), despite a functional pipeline of 363 units. This suggests either extreme lead-time lengthening or further lost shipments beyond the confirmed Period 2 loss.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, the supply chain situation is critical. No inventory has arrived since Period 28, a gap of 11 periods, despite a significant 'In-transit' quantity of 527 units. Subtracting the confirmed 164-unit loss from Period 2, the functional pipeline is 363 units. These 363 units consists of orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 33. Given that the oldest of these (P15, P17, P18) are now over 20 periods past due, they must be considered lost at this stage, similar to the P2 shipment. This leaves only the P33 order (43 units) as potentially viable, though it is also now 5 periods past the promised lead time of 2. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains in a high-variance regime, with a recent average (P35-P39) of 100.6 units but individual periods peaking much higher. To recover service levels, I must assume a significantly lengthened lead time (L) for the OR backend to trigger an order that accounts for the perceived 'void' in the pipeline. I will set L to 4 to reflect the extreme delays and provide an explicit demand forecast (mu_hat) based on the recent high-variance average of ~100 units per period. I am also increasing sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (range 59-166 recently).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Collapse: Orders from Periods 15, 17, and 18 (totaling 320 units) are now confirmed lost based on a 20+ period absence. Only 43 units (from P33) remain as viable functional pipeline. Lead time is effectively non-deterministic or shifted to >11 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe breakdown. As of Period 41, no units have arrived since Period 28 (13 periods ago). A critical analysis of the 'In-transit' inventory (738 units) reveals that at least 484 units are definitively lost: Period 2 (164 units, 39 periods ago), Period 15 (18 units, 26 periods ago), Period 17 (96 units, 24 periods ago), and Period 18 (133 units, 23 periods ago), plus older un-concluded quantities. The only potentially viable orders are from Period 33 (43 units) and the new order from Period 40 (211 units). Since the OR backend does not perceive these losses and calculates the 'final order' based on the full 738-unit pipeline, it will likely under-order or order nothing. To force the system to bypass the phantom inventory and fulfill demand, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I will set L to the promised 2 to avoid capping, mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand at the recent high-variance mean (~100/period), and sigma_hat to a high value to ensure the base stock is large enough to trigger an order despite the 738 in-transit units. My goal is to reach a base stock > 738 units to force a delivery.

Carry-over insight: Supply Chain Collapse: No arrivals for 13 periods (since P28). Pipeline inventory of 738 is largely composed of lost shipments (at least 484 units confirmed lost from P2, P15, P17, P18). Lead time for any surviving shipments has exceeded 13 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a critical failure state with zero arrivals for the last 13 periods (since Period 28). The 'In-transit' figure of 1179 is extremely misleading due to a high volume of lost shipments. Specifically, shipments from Period 2 (164), Period 15 (18), Period 17 (96), Period 18 (133), and Period 33 (43) are all well past any reasonable lead time and must be considered lost. The only potentially viable pipeline includes orders from Period 40 (211 units) and Period 41 (441 units), totaling 652 units. Demand remains in a high-variance regime, with Period 41 reaching 184 units. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the actual lead time is effectively infinite or extremely prolonged, I will maintain an 'explicit' L to reflect the current supply delay and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the sustained high-variance/high-mean environment. I am ordering to try and force a replenishment while acknowledging the game is nearing its end (Period 42/50).

Carry-over insight: Supply Chain Failure: Zero arrivals for 13 consecutive periods (P29-P41). Pipeline of 1179 reflects at least 527 units from abandoned/lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P33). Effective lead time is currently non-deterministic/infinite.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has effectively collapsed, with zero arrivals for 14 consecutive periods (P29-P42). The reported 'In-transit' of 1374 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments: specific losses include P2 (164), P15 (18), P17 (96), and P18 (133), and likely all orders prior to P33. However, since the OR engine uses pipeline inventory (In-transit + On-hand) to determine the order size, and the backend thinks there are 1374 units coming, it will stop ordering unless mu_hat is set extremely high. To force the OR engine to place any order at all given the massive (likely ghost) pipeline, I must set mu_hat to exceed the current pipeline + lead time demand. Demand remains in a high-variance regime, with P41 hitting 184 units. Since literal lead times are now undefined/infinite, I am setting L explicitly to a high value and mu_hat to a value that reflects both the demand spike and the need to overcome the 'In-transit' buffer created by the backend's ignorance of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Supply Chain Failure: Zero arrivals for 14 consecutive periods (P29-P42). Total pipeline of 1374 includes at least 620 units from confirmed/highly probable lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P33). Effective lead time is infinite, making regular stock policies ineffective without extreme parameter adjustment.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
After a massive supply chain failure (zero arrivals from Period 29-42), the shipment from Period 40 (211 units) finally arrived in Period 43 with a lead time of 3 periods. This resolves the 'infinite' lead time concern for new orders, though it confirms that a large portion of the 1618 units in transit (specifically orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P33 totaling 620 units) are definitively lost. The functional pipeline is calculated as 1618 (total) - 620 (lost) = 998 units. Demand remains volatile; the most recent demand was 44, but the average since Period 30 is approximately 98 units with several spikes above 160. To manage this, I am setting L to 3 (matching the most recent arrival) and mu_hat using a recent_N of 14 (covering the high-variance regime since P30). Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 60 to buffer against the frequent demand spikes (e.g., P31, P32, P36, P41) while on-hand inventory is finally being replenished.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain partially recovered: P40 order arrived in P43 (L=3), ending a 14-period drought. Confirmed lost pipeline updated to 620 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P33). Demand regime P30-P43 average is ~98 units with high variance.

=== Period 44 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $652.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with arrivals from Period 40 (arrived P43, L=3) and Period 41 (arrived P44, L=3). We now have 545 units on-hand. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1177 is heavily skewed by 620 units confirmed as lost (P2, P15, P17, P18, P33). The true functional pipeline is 557 units (1177 - 620). Combining on-hand (545) and functional pipeline (557), we have 1102 units against a demand mean of ~98 units/period. The current inventory covers approximately 11 periods of demand, which is well above the (L+1) requirement for L=3. Given we are at Period 45 of 50, and holding costs are $1/unit while profit is $19/unit, we should avoid further ordering to prevent excessive ending inventory at the game's conclusion. I will set the parameters to reflect the observed L=3 and the high-variance demand regime (mean ~98), but since on-hand + functional pipeline already exceeds the base stock target, the backend capped policy will result in zero orders, which is the desired outcome for the final phase.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Lead time settled at 3 periods for recent arrivals (P40, P41). Confirmed lost shipments total 620 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P33), which should be permanently subtracted from in-transit visibility.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has successfully recovered with the arrival of orders from Periods 41, 42, and 43. Current on-hand inventory is 1,081 units, which is significantly high relative to the average demand. Recent lead times for the recovery phase have stabilized at 2-3 periods (P40: L=3, P41: L=3, P42: L=3, P43: L=2). The current in-transit inventory is 527 units, but based on carry-over insights, at least 620 units from earlier periods (P2, P15, P17, P18, P33) were previously confirmed as lost. Since the system reports 527 units in-transit, it appears the backend may have cleared some of the legacy 'ghost' inventory or the 'in-transit' figure is finally reflecting viable orders. Given the high on-hand stock (1,081 units) and the average demand (approx. 98 units/period), we have roughly 11 periods of stock on hand. Consequently, the OR backend will naturally suppress further orders. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the recent actual lead time and using a recent_N of 15 for demand to capture the current high-variance regime (~98 mean).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: P40-P43 orders arrived with lead times of 2-3 periods. On-hand inventory now exceeds 1,000 units, providing a significant buffer for the remaining 5 periods of the game.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has successfully recovered with recent arrivals from Periods 40-43 showing lead times of 2-3 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 933 units. Given that there are only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P47-P50) and the average demand is approximately 100 units per period (P22-P46 average is ~102), the existing on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand without further ordering. The focus now shifts to inventory depletion to minimize holding costs while maintaining a 100% service level for the final periods. The pipeline of 527 units (which includes some likely lost historical shipments) is irrelevant because the on-hand stock already exceeds total projected demand for the rest of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1807.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of a 50-period game. On-hand inventory is 796 units, which is extremely high relative to the average demand of approximately 100 units/period. Over the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50), even at peak historical demand levels (~180 units/period), the current on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to cover all possible demand. The supply chain has recovered with recent lead times of 2-3 periods, but any further ordering would only increase holding costs without contributing to additional sales, as new orders would likely arrive too late or simply add to the ending surplus. Therefore, the strategy is to stop ordering and allow the on-hand inventory to satisfy remaining demand, maximizing profit by minimizing holding costs and avoiding unnecessary capital tied up in stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilized at L=2-3 in final periods; extreme inventory surplus (796 units) against 3 periods of remaining demand ensures 100% service level without further ordering.

Daily Profit: $1273.00, Daily Holding Cost: $729.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $544.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49, the penultimate period (49/50). On-hand inventory is 729 units, while the maximum demand observed in history was 184 (Period 41). The average demand in the most recent regime is approximately 100 units. With only 2 periods remaining (Period 49 and Period 50), the current on-hand stock is more than three times the estimated total remaining demand. Placing any further orders would only increase holding costs without contributing to additional sales or profit, especially given the promised lead time of 2 periods, which means an order placed now would not arrive until after the game concludes. Therefore, L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat are set to 'default' or 'recent_N' simply as placeholders, as the existing stock already guarantees a 100% service level for the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $991.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, which is the final decision period of the simulation. The current on-hand inventory is 643 units. Given that the average demand over the last 10 periods (P40-P49) is approximately 109 units, the existing inventory is more than sufficient to cover the final period's demand. Any additional orders placed now would arrive after the game ends (lead time L=2) and would only incur holding costs or contribute to ending inventory without generating additional sales or profit. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure no new order is triggered. The functional pipeline and historical lead time issues are moot at this stage as we seek to maximize the final reward by minimizing further holding costs while satisfying the likely demand.
