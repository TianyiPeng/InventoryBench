The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive at the start of Period 4. Therefore, I need to cover demand for Period 1 (current), Period 2, and Period 3 to ensure availability when future orders arrive. The sum of the first three historical periods is 365 (76+130+159). Given a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, a balanced stock level is preferred.
