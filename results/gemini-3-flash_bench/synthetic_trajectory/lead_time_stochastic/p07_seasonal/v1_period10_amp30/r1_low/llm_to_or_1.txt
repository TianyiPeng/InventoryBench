Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time (L) of 2 periods. Historical demand data for the first 5 periods (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) shows a mean of 108.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 33.6. Since we have no carry-over insights or observed lead-time deviations yet, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to set the base stock level. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * mean and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L) * std. With L=2, the system will aim to cover 3 periods of demand (current + lead time). Although the game just started for the LLM controller, the provided history allows us to establish a baseline immediately.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The game started with 0 on-hand inventory. In Period 1, an order of 168 units was placed, which is currently 'In-transit'. Based on the lead time definition (promised L=2), this order should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). Current demand history shows 5 initial samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) plus the observed Period 1 demand of 114. The average demand across these 6 samples is roughly 109.6. Since we have no confirmed shifts in lead time or demand regime yet, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize the available historical data and promised lead time (L=2). This will set the base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, with 329 units in-transit (orders from Period 1 and Period 2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, the Period 1 order (168 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase. This arrival will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message, which I will read at the start of Period 4. Therefore, it is too early to conclude the lead time has drifted or that shipments are lost. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (samples provided: 76, 130, 159, 101, 78) shows an average of approximately 109 units per period. The recent 'conclude' messages for P1 and P2 reported a demand of 114, which is consistent with the sample mean. I will use 'default' for L (2) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the provided sample distribution. The backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (168 units), Period 2 (161 units), and Period 3 (11 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This indicates a delay or that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have had 100% stockouts for 3 periods. Total demand across P1-P5 (samples provided) is fluctuates around a mean of ~109. Since we are in a stockout situation with delayed arrivals, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the observed delay. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the demand pattern from the provided historical samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78).

Carry-over insight: Possible lead time extension: Order from Period 1 (promised L=2) did not arrive by Period 3 conclude, suggesting actual L >= 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two orders arrived: the Period 1 order (arrived in 3 periods) and the Period 3 order (arrived in 1 period). This indicates high lead time variability (range 1-3) compared to the promised L=2. The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. Demand remains relatively stable with samples: 76, 130, 159, 101, 78 (avg ~109). However, because holding cost ($1) equals profit ($1), the OR engine's critical ratio q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which targets the median demand. Given the lead time volatility, I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the average behavior and 'recent_N' for demand to stay responsive to the latest levels. On-hand is 61, with 216 in transit (orders from P2 and P4).

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed lead times of 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order). Mean lead time remains ~2, but variability is high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 5 (demand 121, sold 61). We have 347 units in-transit. Looking at the history, the lead time is highly variable: the Period 1 order took 3 periods, while the Period 3 order took only 1 period. The Period 2 order (161 units), placed 4 periods ago, has not arrived, suggesting it might be lost or significantly delayed. Demand is showing an upward trend: the latest samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78 from pre-game; 114, 114, 86, 118, 121 from history) suggest a mean around 110-120. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we target the median. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture the recent higher demand stabilization around 110. I will keep an eye on the missing Period 2 order.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Possible lost shipment: Order from Period 2 (161 units) has not arrived after 4 periods (promised L=2), exceeding the 3-period max observation.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand history shows a mean of approximately 105 units/period (recent samples: 114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75). On-hand inventory is currently 0. Pipeline inventory is 347 units. Crucially, the order from Period 2 (161 units) is now 4 periods overdue (promised L=2), suggesting it is likely lost. Excluding that lost shipment, the effective pipeline is 186 units (55 from P4, 131 from P5). Our lead time has been volatile, with observations of 1 and 3 periods. To account for the likely lost shipment and the need to restore stock after multiple stockouts (ending on-hand 0 for two consecutive periods), I will set L to 2 (promised) but use a robust mu_hat. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the average demand of ~103 (x3 for review+L = 309). Since the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (347), it would normally order nothing; however, because we suspect 161 units are lost, we need to ensure the system targets a higher base stock or adjust L to 'explicit' if the OR engine's subtraction of 347 makes it stop ordering. However, parameters must be set for the policy. Re-calculating: Average demand ~103. L+1 = 3. mu_hat = 309. Pipeline = 347. This will result in 0 order. To force an order to replace the lost 161 units, I will explicitly increase mu_hat to include the lost volume to offset the pipeline inventory in the OR's calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Shipment Loss Confirmed: Period 2 order (161 units) hasn't arrived by Period 6 conclude (4 periods elapsed), confirmed lost. Adjusting mu_hat to compensate for pipeline inventory inflation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 100 units (samples: 76, 130, 159, 101, 78, 114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75, 74). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 415 units is misleading because it includes the Period 2 order (161 units) which is confirmed lost (not arrived by Period 7, L=5+). After subtracting the lost 161 units, the functional pipeline is 254 units (Periods 5 and 7 orders: 131 + 123). Historically, lead times have been 3, 1, and 3 periods, averaging ~2.33. To compensate for the pipeline inventory inflation caused by the lost Period 2 order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1)=4 period window: 4 * 105 (estimated mean) + safety stock (~120) = ~540. However, because the OR backend subtracts the (inflated) pipeline of 415 from the base_stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order that fills the actual gap. Expected actual inventory need is roughly 540; backend will subtract 415, so I need base_stock to be higher to ensure we cover the stockout. I'll set L to 3 to reflect recent delays and sigma_hat to recent patterns.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 135 units on-hand. Looking at history, the order from Period 2 (161 units) is definitely lost. The current 'In-transit' of 362 units reflects orders from Period 6 (0), Period 7 (123), and Period 8 (201). Since Period 7's 123 units already arrived in Period 8, the backend's 'In-transit' logic likely includes the lost Period 2 order (161) and recent orders. Analysis of lead times (3, 1, 3, 3, 1) shows an average of 2.2 periods. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~106 units across the first 8 periods, but the most recent 3 periods (Period 6-8) show a mean of ~89. However, earlier samples were higher (up to 121, 130). I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the broader variance while accounting for the lost order by setting an explicit mu_hat that ensures the base stock calculation targets enough inventory to cover the lead time + review period, effectively ignoring the 'phantom' pipeline inventory from the lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Pipeline inventory remains inflated by the lost Period 2 order (161 units). The OR backend's capped policy will under-order unless mu_hat is adjusted to account for this gap until the lost order is naturally aged out of the window or inventory levels stabilize.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-132.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 234 units. However, there is a significant issue with the pipeline inventory tracking: the system still counts 161 units 'In-transit' from Period 2. Based on the history, this shipment is confirmed lost (7 periods have elapsed since the order was placed). Because the OR backend uses the formula 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', it will under-order by exactly 161 units as long as it believes those units are coming. To counteract this, I must explicitly set 'mu_hat' to a value that incorporates the expected demand for the lead time plus the review period, PLUS the 161 units the backend thinks we have. The average demand across the last 9 periods is approximately 102.5 units per period. With a lead time of 2, the window is 3 periods. Expected demand window = 3 * 102.5 = 307.5. To force the backend to place a correct order despite the 'phantom' 161 units, I set mu_hat = 307.5 + 161 = 468.5. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the high variability (actual L has fluctuated between 1 and 3).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 11 starts with 94 units on hand and 235 units in transit. Historical demand averages 104.3 units per period. The shipment from Period 2 (161 units) is definitively lost, which artificially inflates the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend. This inflation causes the backend to under-order. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Following the logic: Target Inventory = (1+L) * Mean Demand + Safety Stock. With L=2, mean demand=104, that's 312 + Safety Stock (approx 100 units) = ~412. However, because the backend subtracts the inflated pipeline (235 units, of which 161 is 'ghost' inventory), I must inflate mu_hat by approximately the size of the lost shipment (161 units) to force the backend to place an order that restores the physical stock levels. Average demand remains stable around 100-110 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Continued inflation of mu_hat required due to the lost Period 2 shipment (161 units) still appearing in pipeline inventory. This correction will be necessary until the inventory levels reflect the physical reality or the lost order is aged out.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we face a stockout risk with only 16 units on-hand and recent demand averaging ~100. The primary planning challenge remains the lost Period 2 order of 161 units. This order still occupies 'In-transit' capacity in the backend's view, even though it will never arrive. The current Pipeline Inventory is 419, which includes this 161-unit ghost. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, I must explicitly inflate 'mu_hat'. The base demand forecast (1+L) * mean is (1+2) * 105 = 315. To counteract the 161-unit ghost, I set mu_hat to 315 + 161 = 476. Lead time L is set to calculated (mean ~2) but recent observations (P1, P4, P5 arrived in 3 periods; P3, P7, P8 arrived in 1 period) show high variance. Using mu_hat = 476 and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=7 to capture the volatility post-Period 4) allows the system to place an order that covers true demand and safety stock despite the phantom inventory.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. The current on-hand inventory is 0. In Period 12, we stocked out, selling only 90 units against a demand of 158. The 'In-transit' quantity is 386, which consists of the lost Period 2 order (161 units), the Period 11 order (184 units), and the Period 12 order (41 units). The observed lead times are [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2], averaging 2.0 periods. Demand has been fluctuating but remains centered around 100-110 units. The lost shipment from Period 2 (161 units) continues to inflate the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I must continue to inflate mu_hat. Specifically, base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. The backend's order logic is: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). Since in_transit includes 161 phantom units, I add 161 to the forecasted\u9700\u6c42 across the (L+1) horizon. With L=2, (1+L)=3. Average demand is ~107. Standard mu_hat (L=2) = 321. Adjusted mu_hat = 321 + 161 = 482.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the system is facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory and 482 units in-transit. Based on the history, the order from Period 2 (161 units) is definitively lost, having not arrived after 11 periods. This lost order continues to inflate the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation (Base stock - Pipeline), leading to systemic under-ordering. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The calculation is: (1 + Promised_L) * Mean_Demand + Lost_Shipment_Volume. Promised L is 2, and the mean of the last 10 periods of demand is ~114. Calculation: (3 * 114) + 161 = 503. This shift ensures the base stock target is high enough to trigger an actual order despite the 'ghost' inventory. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Systemic under-ordering continues due to the lost Period 2 shipment (161 units) inflating pipeline inventory. Adjusting mu_hat explicitly to offset this phantom inventory until the lost order is naturally cleared or stock levels recover.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows relative stability with a slight upward trend, averaging approximately 115 units per period. The primary operational challenge remains the lost shipment of 161 units from Period 2. This 'phantom' inventory is still included in the 319 units currently 'In-transit', which artificially inflates the pipeline and causes the OR backend to under-order. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Typically, mu_hat = (1+L) * mean_demand; with L=2 and mean_demand ~115, the base mu_hat should be 345. However, since the pipeline is inflated by 161 units that will never arrive, I must increase mu_hat by 161 to 'neutralize' the lost shipment in the backend logic (345 + 161 = 506). I will maintain the default lead time (L=2) and use recent_N for volatility Calculation to reflect recent fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Phantom pipeline inventory persists. Explicit mu_hat adjustment of +161 units remains necessary to prevent systemic under-ordering caused by the confirmed lost Period 2 shipment.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Period 2 order of 161 units is confirmed lost, as it has not arrived after 14 periods. This 'phantom' stock is still counted in the OR backend's pipeline inventory (In-transit: 405), which includes the lost 161 units plus orders from P13 (96), P14 (21), and P15 (127). The physical in-transit inventory is actually 244 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 161-unit inflation, I must adjust the mu_hat parameter. The current mean demand over the review + lead time (1+2=3 periods) is approximately 342 (avg demand ~114 * 3). Adding the 161 units to offset the lost shipment results in an explicit mu_hat of 503. Lead time (L) is set to calculate to reflect the observed variability (1, 2, and 3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to default to handle standard volatility.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Period 2 order (161 units) is officially lost, but remains in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). To counteract this 'phantom' inventory and prevent chronic under-ordering, I must continue to inflate the mu_hat parameter by 161 units. The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 106 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage including the review period), the expected requirement is ~318 units. Adding the 161-unit correction yields a mu_hat of ~479. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (average of 1, 2, and 3-period arrivals), and sigma_hat uses the last 10 periods to capture current volatility.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with an average of approximately 107 units over the last 17 periods. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable. We have a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (161 units) that still exists in the 'In-transit' count (322 units), effectively inflating the pipeline inventory and causing the OR backend to under-order. This 'phantom' inventory must be offset. Additionally, the observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting that an L of 2 is an appropriate mean, though the backend's calculation is safer. To address the phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The formula for base stock is (1+L)*mean_demand. With L=2 and average demand ~107, the base mu_hat should be 321. To compensate for the 161 lost units, I add 161 to this target, resulting in 482 units. This will force the OR engine to order enough to cover current demand despite the false belief that 161 units are arriving soon. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is critically low (8 units) after Period 18. Historical demand samples (P1-P5 provided in prompt + P1-P18 in history) show a mean demand of approximately 105 units. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The pipeline inventory (428 units) is still inflated by the confirmed lost order from Period 2 (161 units). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline inventory, I must explicitly increase mu_hat. Base stock formula is mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Mean demand (105) * (1+L) = 315. Adding the 161 unit offset yields 476. Given high demand volatility (std ~30), sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a high service level while the stock recovers from the recent arrival gap.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory has hit zero following a demand of 101 units in Period 19, leaving a potential backorder or lost sale situation. The primary issue remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory caused by the Period 2 order (161 units) which was confirmed lost but still resides in the total in-transit count. Since the OR backend calculates 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)', this 161-unit inflation causes systemic under-ordering. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The forecast for (1+L) periods (where L=2) is based on the average demand from Period 5 onwards (roughly 106 units/period). Therefore, expected demand for 3 periods is ~318 units. To neutralize the 161-unit phantom inventory, I set mu_hat = 318 + 161 = 479. This forces the base stock calculation high enough to trigger an order despite the fake pipeline units. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (actual L ranges from 1 to 3). Sigma_hat uses the last 15 periods to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic under-ordering continues due to the lost Period 2 shipment (161 units) inflating pipeline inventory. Explicit mu_hat adjustment (Forecast + 161) is required until stock levels stabilize or the lost order is cleared.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a recent mean of approximately 82 units over the last 10 periods (P11-P20). However, a shipment of 161 units from Period 2 is confirmed lost, yet it remains in the OR engine's 'in-transit' (pipeline) calculation. This 'phantom' inventory causes the backend to under-order significantly. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To compensate, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + Promised L) * Mean Demand + Lost Units = (1 + 2) * 82 + 161 = 407. This allows the OR backend to place an order that treats the 161 missing units as if they never existed, restoring physical stock levels. L is kept at 'default' (2) as recent arrivals show a mean lead time close to 2.3, and sigma_hat is left at 'default' to capture historical volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces zero on-hand inventory and has suffered significant lost sales in the last three periods (P19, P20, P21) because no shipments arrived. The 'In-transit' quantity of 479 includes several orders placed since Period 15. Crucially, the 'In-transit' total still includes the 161 units from Period 2, which was confirmed lost but never cleared from the pipeline inventory. This phantom inventory causes the OR backend to under-order. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The average demand across all periods is approximately 107 units. With a lead time L=2, the base stock should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand, which is roughly 321 units. To offset the 161 units of phantom inventory, I set mu_hat to 482 (321 + 161). For sigma_hat, I use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture recent demand volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand inventory: 0) and has faced significant service level issues due to a combination of demand volatility and a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (161 units). This lost shipment continues to inflate the OR backend's perceived 'pipeline inventory', which causes it to under-order. To correct this, I am using an explicit mu_hat setting. Demand analysis: The last 10 periods (P13-P22) have an average demand of approximately 100 units/period (mean = 100.2). With a promised lead time of 2 (review+lead = 3 periods), the baseline mu_hat would be ~300. Adding the 161-unit correction for the phantom inventory, I set mu_hat to 461. I am keeping L at the default promised lead time to maximize responsiveness, and setting sigma_hat to explicitly high (100) to ensure a higher service level/base stock, prioritizing recovery from the current stockout over holding costs for this period.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state is critical: On-hand is 0, and the previous 4 periods (P20-P23) have seen a total demand of 444 units with only 14 units sold, resulting in significant lost sales. Demand remains relatively stable between 100-140 units. The 'In-transit' count of 468 includes the confirmed lost P2 shipment (161 units), meaning actual reliable pipeline inventory is only 307 units. The OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will be suppressed by this 161-unit phantom inventory. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat by exactly 161 + current average demand. Current mean demand (approx last 10 periods) is ~100. With L=2, the base (1+L)mu is 300. Adding the 161-unit correction gives a mu_hat of ~461. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat ensures the backend orders enough to overcome the phantom pipeline inventory and address the current stockout.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 468 units in-transit. A significantly large portion of this 'in-transit' inventory consists of confirmed or likely lost shipments (Period 2: 161 units, and likely Period 15: 127 units, Period 17: 34 units, Period 18: 106 units, Period 19: 40 units). The OR backend calculates orders as 'base_stock - in_transit', meaning these 'phantom' units prevent the system from placing new orders, resulting in zero orders placed in Periods 21, 23, and 24 despite high demand. To force the backend to place an order, mu_hat must be set to an explicit value that covers the expected demand for the lookback window (L+1 periods) PLUS the total volume of phantom pipeline inventory (~468 units). Current demand is stable around 130-140 units. With L=2, the lookback window is 3 periods (~420 units). Total mu_hat = 420 (Demand) + 468 (Phantom offset) = 888. This will force the backend to reconcile the inventory gap caused by persistent shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Systemic stockouts caused by cumulative shipment losses (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) totaling ~468 units. These units inflate 'in-transit' inventory, suppressing new orders. Explicit mu_hat of 888 is set to bypass the pipeline inventory deduction and trigger restocking.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical data indicates a significant volume of lost shipments (Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19), which creates 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Currently, In-transit is 766 units, but a large portion consists of these lost orders. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this inflated pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Mean demand is approximately 110-120 units per period. With a lead time L=2, the base stock should cover 3 periods (~360 units). However, because the backend subtracts the pipeline (766 units) from the calculated base stock, it will result in zero orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to overcome the subtraction. My target is to order around 300-400 units to rebuild stock. Last period's order of 298 has not arrived yet. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1000 to trigger a substantial replenishment order and bypass the pipeline inflation. L is set to calculate to maintain the average realized lead time (approx 2.3).

Carry-over insight: Systemic stockouts continue; phantom pipeline inventory (approx 460-500 units) from lost shipments prevents normal reordering. Explicit mu_hat inflation (set to 1000) is required to force restocking until physical inventory levels recover or the lost orders age out.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from severe stockouts (On-hand: 0) and inflated In-transit inventory (1000 units) caused by significant cumulative shipment losses (Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19). These lost units act as 'phantom inventory' in the OR backend's logic, preventing it from placing orders because the pipeline appears full. To force the system to order despite this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1150. This value is calculated to cover approximately 3 periods of average demand (~110-120 units/period) plus a correction to offset the approximately 500-600 units of lost shipments currently clogging the lead-time window. This will effectively 'bypass' the pipeline deduction and trigger the necessary restocking orders until the physical stock levels recover or the lost orders age out of the review window.

Carry-over insight: Systemic stockouts and phantom pipeline inventory (~600 units) persist. Strategic mu_hat inflation (Target: >1100) is required to override the OR backend's logic and trigger orders until inventory arrives.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory and a heavily inflated 'in-transit' figure (1150 units). This inflation is caused by a series of confirmed or highly probable lost shipments from Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, 25, 26, and 27, totaling approximately 800-900 phantom units. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline inventory (1150) from the base stock calculation, it will stop ordering unless the mu_hat parameter is set high enough to override this deduction. Average historical demand is roughly 104 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2 (review+lead = 3 periods), we expect to need ~312 units to cover the cycle. To force an order of approximately 200-300 units while 1150 units are 'in-transit', we must set an explicit mu_hat near 1400-1500. I will set mu_hat to 1450 and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure a robust order is generated despite the phantom pipeline inventory. This strategy will continue until physical inventory arrives or the lost orders are aged out by the backend.

Carry-over insight: Systemic stockouts and phantom pipeline inventory persist. Total lost/overdue shipments now estimated at ~900 units, requiring mu_hat inflation >1400 to trigger orders.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent arrival of 234 units (ordered P26) has improved the on-hand inventory to 154 units. However, the system is still suffering from significant phantom pipeline inventory. The 'In-transit' balance of 1216 units is heavily inflated by several missing shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, and P25). Specifically, the P25 order (298 units) should have arrived by now (promised L=2) but hasn't, suggesting it is either lost or severely delayed. Because the OR backend subtracts this inflated 'In-transit' value from the target base stock, it will stop ordering unless the mu_hat (target) is exceptionally high. Current demand is averaging ~102 units/period (last 5 periods). To ensure the backend places recurring orders despite the ~900-1000 phantom units in transit, I am setting mu_hat to 1350 using the explicit method. This allows for a target base stock that outweighs the phantom pipeline, triggering the replenishment necessary to maintain on-hand inventory for the upcoming periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Phantom pipeline inventory now includes P25 (298 units), which is overdue (L=4 vs promised 2). Total phantom in-transit estimated at ~1000 units. Strategic mu_hat inflation >1300 required to maintain ordering flow.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-98.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory Situation: On-hand inventory has recovered to 201 units following the arrival of orders from P26 and P27. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1066 units remains significantly inflated by 'phantom' inventory\u2014specifically confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) and likely delayed ones (P25). 

Lead Time Analysis: Recent arrivals (P26, P27) show a return to the promised lead time of 2 periods. However, P25 (ordered Period 25) is now at its L=4 mark and has not arrived, confirming the presence of either delays or further losses in the pipeline. 

Demand Analysis: Current demand remains stable, averaging approximately 105 units. Total reviewed-period demand (1+L=3 periods) is ~315 units. 

Strategic Parameter Adjustment: The OR backend calculates 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)'. With in_transit at 1066 and on_hand at 201, the deduction (1267) vastly exceeds a normal base_stock (~450-500). To ensure the system continues to place orders for incoming demand while this 1066 units of phantom inventory exists, I must explicitly set mu_hat to be higher than (on_hand + in_transit). I will set mu_hat to 1400 (roughly 1267 + 130 margin) to trigger a modest order around 100-150 units, maintaining safety stock while accounting for the phantom data.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Phantom in-transit inventory persists at 1066 units (confirmed losses + overdue P25). Strategic mu_hat inflation (>1350) required until 'in-transit' clears or physical stock risks over-supply.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent arrival of three consecutive orders (P26, P27, P28) with a consistent lead time of 2 periods indicates that the logistics channel has stabilized, at least temporarily. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 899 remains heavily inflated by phantom inventory: P2 (161 units), P15 (127), P17 (34), P18 (106), P19 (40), and P25 (298 units, now 5 periods overdue) which are all likely lost. Summing these confirmed/likely losses yields 766 units. Current physical 'In-transit' is likely only the P30 order (133 units). With 436 units on-hand and 133 units truly in-bound, the system would stop ordering if it saw 899 units in-transit. Mean demand (all historical) is approx 105. Period 31 demand is currently 65, showing some volatility. To ensure the backend doesn't freeze orders due to the 766 phantom units, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus an offset for the lost units. Base demand for 3 periods (L=2) is ~315. Adding the 766 offset = 1081. I will set mu_hat at 1100 to maintain a healthy safety stock while physical inventory recovers.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has stabilized at 2 periods for the last 3 arrivals (P28-P30 concludes). Total phantom inventory from lost/overdue shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25) is estimated at 766 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-220.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 31 periods, several shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25) have either been confirmed lost or are severely overdue, creating a 'phantom' pipeline inventory of approximately 766 units (P2:161, P15:127, P17:34, P18:106, P19:40, P25:298). Although the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time for recent successful deliveries (P26, P27, P28) has stabilized at 2 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 328 units. The 'In-transit' figure is 899, but 766 of those are likely lost, meaning only ~133 units (from P30) are actually expected to arrive soon. The OR backend subtracts the full 899 from the base stock. To maintain a healthy stock level and compensate for the 766-unit phantom inventory bias, I must inflate mu_hat significantly. Average demand is ~104/period. For L=2, a normal base stock (3 periods of demand) would be ~312 plus safety stock. To ensure an order is actually placed when 'In-transit' is 899, the calculated base stock needs to exceed 1227 (328 + 899). Setting mu_hat to 1350 via 'explicit' method guarantees the backend targets a level that overrides the phantom pipeline and accounts for current demand volatility.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 101 units per period over the last 10 periods. The primary operational challenge remains the high 'In-transit' figure (1022 units), which is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) and the delayed/lost P25 shipment (298 units). Combined, these 'phantom' units total approximately 1,066 units. Because the OR backend's base-stock logic subtracts all pipeline inventory from the target stock, it would under-order (or not order at all) if we used standard parameters. Lead times for the most recent successful arrivals (P28, P29, P30) have been consistent at 2 periods. To ensure a steady flow of replenishment while we have 235 units on hand (covering roughly 2.3 periods of demand), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1350. This value accounts for (1+L) periods of demand plus the ~1066 phantom units. This 'trick' forces the backend to continue ordering to match current demand, preventing another stockout cycle caused by logic that sees lost shipments as incoming stock.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit inventory remains approximately 1066 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25). Continued explicit mu_hat inflation (>1300) is necessary to override the OR backend's pipeline deduction until these old 'in-transit' records no longer influence the calculation.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) averages approximately 100-110 units per period. Lead times have recently stabilized at 1-2 periods (as seen in Period 30, 32, and 33 concludes). However, the central issue remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The current 'In-transit' value of 992 units includes several old, confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) and likely P25 (ordered Period 25, 9 periods ago). These total approximately 1066 units of 'ghost' inventory. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its calculated base stock, it will not place new orders if the phantom inventory exceeds the target level. To counteract this, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly higher than the actual expected demand. The inventory on-hand is currently 234 units, providing some buffer. I will set mu_hat to 1350 to provide a target base stock that overcomes the ~1000 units of phantom inventory, ensuring the OR logic triggers an order to maintain stock as on-hand inventory is consumed by demand (avg 100/period).

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit inventory remains approximately 1066 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25). Lead time is currently averaging 1.5 periods based on most recent arrivals (P32 @ 1 period, P30 @ 2 periods).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory from lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25), totaling 1,066 units. This phantom inventory directly reduces the orders generated by the OR backend. With on-hand inventory at 104 and demand averaging ~110-120, we must continue to override the pipeline deduction. Lead time has been 1-2 periods recently. To ensure a replenishment order is placed, I am setting mu_hat to 1350. This value accounts for (1+L) periods of demand plus the 1,066 units of phantom inventory that the backend subtracts, forcing the logic to see a 'need' for new stock despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to a recent 7-period window to capture current demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a recent mean of approximately 110 units per period. Lead times have also stabilized at approximately 2 periods (recent arrivals in P28, P29, P30, and P33 show delays of 2, 2, 2, and 1 periods respectively). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1246 units is severely inflated by multiple confirmed lost or significantly overdue shipments (specifically P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P25), totaling roughly 1066 'phantom' units. Because the OR backend subtracts this inflated pipeline inventory from the target base stock, it would normally calculate a zero or near-zero order. To bypass this and ensure the store maintains a physical inventory of approximately 3 periods of demand (Review + Lead Time), mu_hat must be set to a value that covers expected demand + the phantom inventory. I am setting mu_hat to 1350 (approx 3 * 110 + 1020) to ensure the system places orders that match the current physical demand rate (~110-130) despite the stagnant 'in-transit' records.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is critically low (10 units). Lead time has stabilized at 2 periods for recent arrivals (P28, P29, P30, P34). However, there is a massive 'In-transit' figure (1225 units) that is heavily inflated by lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25) totaling 766 units. Also, orders from P33 (93 units), P35 (130 units), and P36 (103 units) are currently active in the pipeline. The OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the target base stock. If I use a realistic mu_hat, it will order 0, causing a stockout because it thinks 1225 units are coming. To force the OR backend to place an order of approximately 100-115 units (current demand mean) to cover future periods, I must set mu_hat to a value that overrides the 1225 phantom units plus the desired base stock. Target Base Stock = (1+L)*demand + safety. With L=2 and demand ~110, target is ~330. Therefore, mu_hat must be ~1225 + 330 = 1555. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1550 to ensure the engine places an order despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Stabilized lead time at 2 periods confirmed. Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 766 units from lost/overdue shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25). Explicit mu_hat inflation (>1500) required to maintain ordering until phantom units age out of the system's calculation.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of 105. Recent arrivals (P34 at L=2, P35 at L=2, P36 at L=1) confirm an actual lead time (L) of approximately 1.5 to 2 periods; I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this observed trend. The core issue remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory, which the backend subtracts from its order calculation. The confirmed losses and long-overdue shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25) total approximately 1066 units. To counteract this 'phantom' stock and ensure the OR backend continues to place orders for actual demand, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate necessary 'base stock' at (1+L)*mean + safety, roughly 350-400. To force an order when in-transit is 1307, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the sum of phantom inventory and desired stock. Setting mu_hat to 1600 provides enough buffer to overcome the 1307 in-transit inflation while accounting for current on-hand inventory (189), ensuring we maintain adequate stock levels for upcoming periods.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit inventory remains approximately 1066 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25). Maintaining explicit mu_hat > 1500 is critical to bypass the backend's deduction of these non-existent units and sustain ordering.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) fluctuates around a mean of approximately 105 units. Recent lead times have stabilized around 1.5 to 2 periods (P35/P36 arrived in 2 periods; P34 in 2 periods; P32 in 1 period). However, the system's 'In-transit' figure (1411 units) is heavily inflated by phantom inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) and long-overdue shipments (P25). These phantom units total approximately 1,066 units. This phantom inventory causes the OR backend to underestimate the necessary replacement order because it subtracts 1,411 instead of the true physical pipeline (approx 345 units). To override this and ensure a base stock that covers the next review + lead time periods (approx 3 * 105 = 315) plus a safety buffer, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1500. This compensates for the 1,066 units of phantom in-transit stock, allowing the logic to calculate a 'true' required order of roughly 1500 - 1066 - on_hand. This strategy prevents the stockouts observed in earlier periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-73.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to show a high 'In-transit' inventory (1307 units), which includes significant phantom inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) and long-overdue shipments (P25). These total approximately 766-1066 units. At Period 40, on-hand inventory is 163. The backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) will continue to under-order or not order at all if mu_hat is not inflated to offset this 'phantom' pipeline. Recent demand has averaged ~95 units over the last 10 periods, but the immediate goal is to prevent stockouts while these phantom units remain in the calculation window. I will set L to 'calculate' as lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods recently. I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat of 1600. This value is calculated as ((1+L) * Forecast) + Phantom Inventory. With L=2 and Forecast ~100, (3 * 100) + 1066 \u2248 1366. I am using 1600 to provide a more robust buffer given the profit/holding cost ratio (1:1) and the need to ensure the system actually places orders despite the inflated pipeline. This strategy overrides the backend's deduction of non-existent units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to hover around an average of 105 units per period. In-transit inventory is currently 1437 units, but a large portion of this is 'phantom' inventory from confirmed or highly probable lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, and P31). Based on the carry-over insights and historical arrival analysis, the total phantom in-transit units amount to approximately 1066. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this inflated pipeline, mu_hat must be set to a level that overrides this deduction. Setting mu_hat to 1500 effectively targets a base stock that accounts for expected demand over the (L+1) horizon plus the ~1066 phantom units. Lead time has been fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods; using the calculate method for L allows the backend to adjust based on recent arrivals. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Total phantom in-transit inventory remains at approximately 1066 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P31). Demand remains stable (~105/period). Lead time is averaging ~1.8 periods. Extended mu_hat inflation (>1500) is required until phantom units are purged from the backend tracking.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as on-hand stock is nearly exhausted (2 units) and in-transit inventory is extremely high (1437 units). However, a significant portion of this in-transit inventory is 'phantom' inventory from lost or severely overdue shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, and potentially P31). These phantom units (totaling ~1066 units) mislead the OR backend's pipeline deduction logic, causing it to under-order or stop ordering entirely. Demand is stable, averaging ~102 units over the last 10 periods (P32-P41). Lead time remains variable but averages ~1.88 periods over the last 8 arrivals. To bypass the backend's logic and force a replenishment order that overcomes the 1066-unit phantom inventory bias, I am setting mu_hat to 1600 (approx. 1066 phantom units + 500 units for 5 periods of safety coverage) and L to 2. This high mu_hat ensures the base_stock calculation minus the inflated in-transit value still results in a positive order volume to prevent a stockout in Period 42/43.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant challenges due to 'phantom' pipeline inventory. As of Period 43, there are 1598 units listed as 'In-transit'. However, a significant portion of this (approximately 1066 units) corresponds to confirmed lost or severely overdue shipments from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, 25, and 31. Because the OR backend deducts the 'In-transit' total from the target base stock to calculate the order quantity, these 1066 non-existent units are causing systemic under-ordering, leading to the current stockout (On-hand: 0). Demand is stable but reasonably high, averaging ~100 units/period (last 5-10 periods). Lead time has been volatile but recently shows a mix of 1 and 2 periods. To override the backend's faulty pipeline deduction and trigger necessary restocking, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to a value that covers the desired base stock PLUS the phantom inventory. Target base stock for (L+1=3) periods is ~300-350 units; adding the 1066 phantom units necessitates a mu_hat of approximately 1400. I am choosing 1450 to ensure an order is generated despite high 'In-transit' labels.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: In-transit inventory includes 1066 'phantom' units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P31) which are lost or permanently delayed. Regular explicit mu_hat inflation (+1000 units above forecast) is required to sustain ordering.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current environment is characterized by significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory, totaling 1066 units from identified lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P31). These units inflate the pipeline stock known to the OR backend, causing it to suppress orders unless the target base stock is artificially raised. Demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging ~105 units per period over the last 10 periods. The lead time has shown some variability but is averaging approximately 2 periods. To ensure a continuous supply and bypass the backend's deduction of the 1066 non-existent units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. A target base stock to cover demand for current period + lead time (L=2) is approximately 315 units (3 * 105). Adding the 1066 phantom units leads to a required mu_hat of ~1381. I will set mu_hat to 1500 to provide a safety buffer and prevent stockouts seen in P41-P42. L is set to calculated and sigma is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am currently at Period 45 with 0 on-hand inventory and an 'in-transit' figure of 1488 units. This 'in-transit' total is significantly inflated by 1066 phantom units from lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (specifically periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, 25, and 31). The OR backend's logic subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base stock, leading to systemic under-ordering. To override this, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that covers the anticipated demand (approx. 100 per period) over lead time (avg 2 periods) plus review period (1), AND compensates for the 1066 phantom units. Forecast (1+2)*100 = 300. Adding 1066 units gives a target mu_hat of ~1366. I will set it to 1400 to ensure orders are triggered for the final periods of the game. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has recently bounced between 1 and 3 periods, averaging near the promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-35.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains stable with a recent mean of approximately 95 units per period. The primary challenge continues to be the 'phantom' pipeline inventory, currently estimated at 1166 units (confirmed lost orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P31 and the severely overdue P25). This phantom inventory inflates the backend's subtraction from the order quantity, leading to systemic under-ordering if not bypassed. The current in-transit is 1327, while actual expected arrivals are only 161 (P44 order of 20 and P42 order arrived but P44/P45 logic suggests P44's 20 is the only real unit left besides P43+P45 activity). To ensure the OR backend generates an order that maintains a safety stock of ~300 units (approx 3 periods of demand) while the backend subtracts ~1166 phantom units, I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 1500. This calculation aims to provide (Demand * (L+1)) + safety margin + phantom offset. L is set to calculate to reflect the actual lead time variability (avg ~2).

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Phantom in-transit inventory remains the dominant factor, estimated at 1166 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P31). Explicit mu_hat inflation (>1500) remains necessary to counteract the backend's deduction of these non-existent units and prevent stockouts in the final periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 of 50. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable with a mean of approximately 105 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory. As of Period 47, 'In-transit' is 1402 units, but physical stock is only 10 units. Historical records (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P31, P37, P44) total approximately 1166 units that are lost or significantly overdue, yet still counted by the OR backend as pipeline inventory. These phantom units are deducted from the base stock calculation, leading to systemic under-ordering. To ensure we have enough stock for the final 3 periods, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1500. This value overrides the pipeline deduction (1500 - 1402 = 98 units potentially ordered), targeting a recovery of on-hand inventory. Given the 2-period lead time, orders placed now are the last ones likely to arrive before the game ends.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' is relatively stable, with a recent mean of approximately 95 units (last 5 periods). On-hand inventory is 0 and the backend reports 1490 units in-transit. However, consistent history shows that approximately 1166 units of this in-transit total are 'phantom' units from lost or permanently delayed shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P31). Without adjustment, the OR backend's capped policy will subtract the full 1490 units from the base stock calculation and fail to place any new orders, leading to stockouts in the final two periods. Lead time varies between 1 and 3 periods, averaging ~1.8. To force a reorder that covers the remaining 2 periods of play and compensates for the current stockout, I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 1600. This value overrides the phantom pipeline deduction (1600 - 1490 = 110 real target) while providing enough units to cover expected demand (~200 units over L+1). Sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a high service level.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. The game ends after Period 50. Any order placed now (Period 49) with an actual lead time (L) of 1 or more will arrive in Period 50 or later. Based on the history, actual lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods, with a recent average around 2. Therefore, an order placed now is highly unlikely to arrive in time to be sold before the game concludes. Furthermore, the 'In-transit' inventory is significantly inflated to 1600 units, of which 1166 are identified as 'phantom' units (confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed). Even excluding these phantom units, there are approximately 434 units currently in transit that are expected to arrive in Period 49 or 50. With 0 on-hand inventory and only 1 period left of the game after this decision, these expected arrivals should be sufficient to meet the final demands (averaging ~105 units). Placing a new order would only incur holding costs or pay for units that cannot be sold. Thus, I am setting parameters to ensure no new order is placed.

Carry-over insight: Final game period reaches: phantom in-transit inventory remains at 1166 units. Demand has remained stable throughout the session (~105/period). Lead time averaged 2 periods across the simulation.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision phase of the simulation. The primary challenge throughout this session has been significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory\u2014estimated at 1166 units\u2014resulting from multiple lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P31). These phantom units falsely inflate the pipeline inventory, causing the OR backend to suppress orders. Recent arrivals (P40, P42) show that the actual lead time is averaging 3 periods. Current demand is stable at approximately 105 units. With 0 on-hand inventory and 1600 total units reported in-transit (of which 1166 are phantom), the backend's default base stock calculation would result in zero orders. To ensure an order is placed to meet the final periods' demand and mitigate the impact of the lost stock, I am setting mu_hat to 1600 (explicitly matching the in-transit amount) to neutralize the pipeline deduction and allow for a replenishment signal. L is set to 2 to align with the core mechanics, even though recent variability suggests 3.
