Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for Period 1-5 is already provided (76, 130, 159, 101, 78). Since we are currently at Period 1, we must forecast based on all available historical samples to set our base stock. The mean demand across the 5 provided samples is approximately 108.8, and the standard deviation is approximately 33.7. Given the lead time L=2, the total horizon to cover is (1+L) = 3 periods. I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical data points provided in the prompt to calculate the initial parameters. Despite being at 'Period 1' of the game play, the prompt provides five periods of specific historical data that the OR backend will use to seed its calculations.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 168 units was placed with a promised lead time (L) of 2. This order is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3. Because the starting on-hand inventory was 0 and no order could arrive in Period 1 (L=2), sales were 0 despite a demand of 115 units. For Period 2, I will use recent demand data to forecast. Historical samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) plus the observed Period 1 demand (115) suggest a mean demand of approximately 110 units per period. Since L=2, mu_hat should cover 3 periods of demand (1+L), totaling roughly 330 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the most relevant demand variance while waiting for the pipeline inventory to arrive.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (168 units) and Period 2 (167 units) are in transit. Based on the lead time definition (L=2), the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts in Periods 1 and 2 where demand was 115 and 109 respectively. The historical demand data provided (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) shows a mean of approximately 109. Since we have only 5 demand samples and no clear calendar/seasonal drivers yet, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current demand level. I will maintain L=2 (default) as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised lead time.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. Previous history shows demand ranging from 115 to 116 units, though historical data provided (Periods 1-5) suggests a mean around 108.8 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (168 units) and P2 (167 units) are currently in-transit and totaling 335 units (plus P3's 46 units = 381). Based on the 2-period lead time, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the P3 conclude message, but P3 conclude reports 'arrived=0'. This confirms the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. I will explicitly set L=3 to account for this delay. For mu_hat, the historical samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) average 108.8. I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the backend use all available samples, but by setting L=3, the mu_hat calculation (1+L)*mean will automatically scale to cover 4 periods of demand, helping to recover from the current stockout caused by the delivery delay.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as at least 3 periods (P1 order did not arrive by end of P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $321.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival of the Period 1 order (L=3) and the Period 3 order (L=1). The Period 2 order (167 units) is still in transit, suggesting a non-deterministic lead time. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations are 3 and 1. Averaging these gives 2. Demand over the first 5 periods has a mean of 108.8 (76, 130, 159, 101, 78 - from historical data provided in the prompt) or 111.75 based on the 'conclude' logs (115, 109, 116, 107). Using a recent_N of 4 periods for demand (mu_hat) captures the current average of ~112 units/period. For sigma_hat, the variance appears stable, so recent_N=4 is also appropriate. Setting L=2 (default) is reasonable as the average observed lead time (3+1)/2 is exactly 2, though we must monitor for the missing Period 2 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period (Avg=2). P2 order remains in-transit as of P5 start.

Daily Reward (R_t): $428.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are faced with 0 on-hand inventory and a large backlog of missed sales (due to stockouts in P1-P3). Historical demand samples are [76, 130, 159, 101, 78], with an average of 108.8 units/period. The lead time has shown significant variability: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P2 (ordered 167 units) is still missing after 4 periods (ordered P2, currently P6 start), suggesting it may be lost. To handle this, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but monitoring the missing P2 order. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the full range of observed demand. Given the stockouts and the missing shipment, I will use an explicit sigma_hat set to approximately 1.5x the historical standard deviation (std=33.5, sqrt(1+2)*33.5 \u2248 58, so I'll set it to 85) to ensure the OR backend aims for a higher base stock to recover from the supply instability.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Potential lost shipment detected (P2 order of 167 units has not arrived after 4 periods). Supply chain remains highly unstable (LT range 1 to 3+ periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is highly unstable. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The Period 2 order (167 units) is now 5 periods old (exceeding the longest observed lead time of 3) and is likely lost. The Period 4 order (107 units) should have arrived in Period 6 (if LT=2), but it did not, leaving the system with 0 stock and lost sales in Period 6. Based on history, observed lead times are 3, 1, and >2. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent arrival delays and ensure the base stock covers a longer window. Demand appears relatively stable around a mean of ~109. Using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat captures this average while excluding the initial high-variance seeding samples. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect the recent demand volatility accurately.

Carry-over insight: Period 6/7: Period 2 order (167 units) confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed). Period 4 order (107 units) delayed beyond promised lead time (LT > 2).

Daily Profit: $232.00, Daily Holding Cost: $49.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $183.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that demand has significantly decreased to 58 in Period 7, compared to an average of ~110 in the first six periods. This suggests a potential demand regime shift or seasonality change. Lead times are highly volatile: P1 and P4 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P2 (ordered P2) is confirmed lost as it still hasn't arrived after 5 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 49. In-transit inventory (339) includes P5 (0), P6 (130), P7 (42), and the lost P2 (167). Since P2 is lost, the OR engine's pipeline calculation (which includes P2 units) will cause it to under-order. To compensate, I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent lower demand trend (avg ~88). Setting L=3 increases the base stock target, helping to offset the 'ghost' inventory from the lost P2 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Demand dropped to 58 (previous avg ~110). Average lead time for successful deliveries (P1, P3, P4) is 2.33 periods, but P1 and P4 specifically took 3 periods, indicating the promised L=2 is unreliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $204.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. The lead time (L) history shows high volatility: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P7=1. The average of these successful deliveries is 2.0, but the risk of 3-period lead times is high, and P2 (167 units) is confirmed lost. Demand has shifted downward starting at Period 7 (averaging ~59 units over the last 2 periods compared to ~110 units previously). On-hand inventory is 32, and in-transit is 306 units (P6 order of 130 units is now at L=2 and expected next period; P8 order of 9 units is at L=1). I will set L to 2 (the observed average) but use an explicit mu_hat to reflect the recent demand drop (approx 60/period) over the next 3 review+lead periods (1+L=3). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the variability around this new demand level without being overly influenced by the higher initial periods. This conservative approach accounts for the significant pipeline inventory while protecting against missed shipments or lead-time spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 7: Average demand dropped from ~110 to ~59 units (-46%). Lead time remains inconsistent with a bipartite distribution of 1 or 3 periods (Average ~2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $164.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high lead-time volatility with an emerging demand regime. Current observations: 1) On-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 9 (sold 41, demand 77). 2) In-transit inventory of 297 includes Period 2 (167 units, likely lost), Period 6 (130 units, delayed/LT=4+). 3) Lead times have been inconsistent: 1, 3, 3, 1, 1 (Avg ~1.8). However, the systemic delay of the Period 6 order (130 units) suggests replenishment is unreliable. 4) Demand shifted downwards around Period 7. Mean demand for P7-P9 is 64.6, compared to the initial mean of ~110. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays and the 'missing' Period 6 order, requiring higher base stock to cover the supply gaps. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the lower demand regime (avg 64.6) while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility in both arrival patterns and demand shifts.

Carry-over insight: Period 9/10: In-transit inventory includes a likely lost shipment (P2, 167 units) and an overdue shipment (P6, 130 units, currently at LT=4). Stockout occurred in Period 9 despite pipeline inventory due to supply instability. Demand regime since Period 7 remains lower (avg ~65) vs early periods (avg ~110).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11, facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The demand regime shifted at Period 7 from ~110 units to ~85 units (avg of P7-P10 is 85), though Period 10 saw a spike to 146. Supply instability is critical: P2 (167 units) is confirmed lost, and P6 (130 units) is significantly overdue (ordered P6, now P11, LT=5). Reliable lead times have been either 1 or 3 periods. In-transit inventory of 297 consists of the lost P2 (167) and the overdue P6 (130). Because the backend calculates base stock minus pipeline (in-transit), the lost/overdue units are preventing new orders from being placed. I will set L=3 based on the observed maximum successful lead time to increase the safety buffer. I will use a mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent demand volatility (avg ~85) and use explicit sigma_hat to account for the high variance observed in Period 10.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: High demand volatility detected within the new regime (Demand spiked to 146 from previous avg of ~65). Supply remains broken; P6 (130 units) now 3 periods past promised delivery.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is highly unreliable with significant delays and lost shipments. Period 2 order (167) is lost (10 periods late). Period 6 order (130) is significantly overdue (5 periods since order, promised 2). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have faced recent stockouts. Demand shows two distinct regimes: P1-P6 averaged ~110, while P7-P11 averaged ~88, though volatility is high (ranging from 58 to 146). To calculate parameters: 1) L=3 is used explicitly because successful deliveries (P1, P4) took 3 periods, and reliance on L=2 leads to stockouts given the observed instability. 2) mu_hat is set using N=5 to capture the more recent demand regime (avg 87.8 units/period). With L=3, mu_hat = (1+3)*87.8 = 351.2. 3) sigma_hat is set using N=5 to reflect recent high volatility (std dev ~35.6). With L=3, sigma_hat = sqrt(4)*35.6 = 71.2. This higher base stock helps buffer against the extreme lead time instability and recent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P7-P11 average is ~88 units with high volatility (std dev ~36). Persistent supply failure: P2 order (167) confirmed lost; P6 order (130) severely overdue (LT=5). Actual reliable lead time is 3 periods despite promise of 2.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely broken. As of Period 13 start, we have 413 units in-transit, but 297 of those are likely non-deliverable: the Period 2 order (167 units, 11 periods elapsed) and the Period 6 order (130 units, 7 periods elapsed). Based on history, successful arrivals occur at lead times of 1 or 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P7: 1, P8: 1). If an order exceeds 3 periods, it is effectively lost. This creates a massive hole in 'pipeline inventory'. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (Total In-Transit) to calculate orders. Since 297 units in that total are lost, the backend will under-order unless we compensate. Demand has also shifted; from Period 7-12, the average is 90.3 units (std dev ~32). To fix the under-ordering, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum reliable delivery time) and using an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand for (L+1) = 4 periods * 90.3 = 361. To neutralize the 297 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory, I add them to mu_hat: 361 + 297 = 658. This ensures the base stock is high enough that 'base_stock - pipeline' triggers a real order. Sigma_hat is set to 70 (approx sqrt(4)*35) to handle the high observed volatility in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply failure confirmed: Orders exceeding 3 periods are lost (P2, P6). Total lost in-transit inventory = 297 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is severely disrupted. Historical data confirms two shipments are lost: P2 (167 units) and P6 (130 units), totaling 297 units that will never arrive. Although the in-transit shows 636 units, the 'effective' pipeline is only 339 units (636 - 297). The last successful arrival occurred in P9. The actual lead time is highly inconsistent (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent delays observed (P1 and P4 took 3 periods). Regarding demand, a regime shift occurred at P7. While initially lower, demand from P10-P13 has surged (averaging ~126 units), indicating a return to high-volume or seasonal growth. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this recent spike (P10-P13: 146, 99, 103, 157) and specific explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility and stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P10-P13 average demand increased to 126 units (+43% vs previous P7-P9 average). Continuous stockouts since P9 due to zero arrivals and historical losses of 297 units (P2, P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $289.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the order from Period 11 (111 units) arrived after a lead time of 3 periods, confirming the pattern that successful deliveries take either 1 or 3 periods. The orders from Period 2 (167) and Period 6 (130) are now 13 and 9 periods overdue respectively, and are considered lost. The total in-transit quantity of 525 units includes these 297 lost units, meaning the 'active' pipeline is only 228 units (from P12, P13). Demand has stabilized at a higher level recently; the average demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 117 units. To account for the unreliable supply and the loss of almost 300 units from the pipeline, I am setting the lead time L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I am using the last 5 periods to capture the recent higher demand regime accurately.

Carry-over insight: Successful arrivals consistently show a bipartite lead time distribution of 1 or 3 periods (Average ~2). Orders exceeding 3 periods (P2, P6) are confirmed losses, totaling 297 units. Demand regime (P10-P14) has increased to an average of 117 units.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, the supply chain remains unreliable with a bipartite lead time distribution (1 or 3 periods). Orders from Period 2 (167 units) and Period 6 (130 units) are confirmed lost as they have exceeded the observable 3-period arrival window by a significant margin. The in-transit inventory of 520 units is primarily comprised of the Period 13 order (223 units, currently at T+3) and potentially newer orders. Current on-hand is 0 following a stockout in Period 15. The demand regime from P10-P15 is approximately 117 units (std dev ~28). To mitigate the risk of stockouts during the frequent 3-period lead time occurrences, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=6) to capture the higher recent demand average and using explicit sigma_hat to account for the supply-driven volatility and recent demand fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Period 15/16: Lead time distribution is confirmed bipartite (Value=1 or 3). Orders exceeding 3 periods (P2, P6) are lost. Demand regime (P10-P15) average is 117 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $207.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe an on-hand inventory of 137 units following an arrival of 223 units (ordered P13, Lead Time=3). The in-transit inventory is listed as 297 units, but based on historical analysis and the confirmed '3-period cutoff' rule, these units (P2: 167 units, P6: 130 units) are lost shipments. This leaves 0 functional pipeline inventory. Lead times are consistently bipartite (1 or 3 periods), making the promised L=2 unreliable; I will set L=3 (explicit) to reflect the maximum observed functional lead time for safety. Demand from P10-P16 shows a mean of approximately 113 units with high volatility. To ensure the OR engine targets enough stock to cover the review period plus the 3-period lead time while ignoring 'ghost' in-transit inventory, I am setting L=3, mu_hat=452 (113 * (1+3)), and sigma_hat=72 (36 * sqrt(1+3)). Using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat is necessary because the default backend calculation would include the lost orders (P2, P6) in the pipeline, leading it to under-order significantly.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Confirmed zero functional pipeline inventory; the 297 units 'in-transit' (from P2 and P6) are lost. Demand since P10 has stabilized at a higher mean of ~113 units.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P10-P17) shows a shift back to an average of roughly 111 units, which is a significant increase from the temporary dip seen around P7-P9. Lead times remain bipartite (1 or 3 periods), with a consistent pattern where orders are either received quickly or at the edge of the 3-period threshold. Crucially, the 'In-transit' quantity of 376 units includes 297 units from P2 and P6 that are confirmed lost (now overdue by 16 and 12 periods, respectively). The OR backend includes these lost units in its 'pipeline inventory' calculation, causing it to under-order. To correct for this, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 452 units. This value is derived from (1+L=3) periods * current mean of 113. However, to bypass the OR engine's use of the phantom 297 units in the pipeline, I must provide a target 'base_stock' that results in the desired order. Desired base_stock = (1+L) * mean + safety_stock. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat targets (1+2)*113=339. By setting mu_hat explicitly higher to account for the 297 units the engine 'thinks' we have, we force an actual order. Calculations: Adjusted mu_hat = (Target Base Stock + 297). Target base stock for 3 periods of coverage is approx 350. 350 + 297 = 647.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 10 has a mean of approximately 105 units (calculated from P10-P18: 146, 99, 103, 157, 80, 119, 86, 96, 38). Although the most recent demand (P18) was low (38), the long-term window suggests maintaining a forecast around 100-110 units to avoid stockouts during supply instability. Supply remains highly erratic with a bipartite lead time of 1 or 3 periods. I am using L=3 explicitly to calculate the base stock because orders arriving in 1 period are 'bonuses,' while the 3-period arrival is the critical constraint for inventory availability. In-transit inventory (619) includes 297 units from P2 and P6 which are definitively lost (LT > 10). The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' in its logic (Total In-transit - On-hand). Since the backend is unaware of the 297 lost units, it will see an inflated 'pipeline' and under-order. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the 105 mean demand plus a buffer to offset the 297 units that will never arrive, ensuring the order trigger is high enough to generate new orders despite the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 18/19: Historical mean demand (P10-P18) is 102.7 units. Total lost 'ghost' inventory in pipeline remains 297 units (P2: 167, P6: 130). Actual lead time behaves as a bipartite distribution of 1 or 3 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face demand and supply instability. In Period 20, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 19. The total in-transit quantity of 619 units is highly misleading because it includes confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 297 units (Orders from P2 and P6) that have never arrived and are over 13 periods late. Excluding these lost units, the functional pipeline is 322 units (Orders from P17 and P18). Demand is currently in a lower regime compared to the P10-P16 peak; the average demand from P17-P19 is 67.3 units, though the broader history from P10-P19 suggests a mean around 98 units. Given the lead time is bipartite (1 or 3 periods, averaging 2), I will setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the frequent delays observed (orders from P1, P4, P11, P12, P13 all took 3 periods). For demand forecasting, I am using recent_N=10 to capture the shift from the high-demand peak back to more moderate levels, while keeping sigma_hat high (recent_N=10) to protect against stockouts during the frequent 3-period arrival windows.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Demand slowed from P10-P16 avg (~113) to P17-P19 avg (~67 units). Functional pipeline is 322 units; remaining 297 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P17-P20) shows an average of ~81 units (96, 38, 68, 122). While P20 saw a spike to 122, the 4-period average is significantly lower than the P10-P16 surge. Supply chain remains bipartite (LT 1 or 3) and prone to total loss. Currently, 'In-transit' is 619 units, but 297 units (P2: 167, P6: 130) are confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory, leaving a functional pipeline of 322 units (P17: 79, P18: 243). These functional orders are expected to arrive in P21 (LT=3 for P17) or P19-P21 (LT=1-3 for P18). Since functional pipeline (322) already covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the recent average of 81 units, and we are currently at zero on-hand inventory, I will set L=3 to reflect the realistic lead-time upper bound. I'll use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current demand volatility while recognizing the lower mean compared to the mid-game peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P17-P20 average is 81 units, suggesting a slowdown from the P10-P16 period average of 113. Functional pipeline remains 322 units; 297 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments.

This leaves a functional pipeline of 322 units (ordered in P17 and P18). Demand has shown significant volatility: P17-P19 averaged ~67, but P20-P21 demand spiked to 122 and 150 respectively, indicating a potential return to the higher demand regime observed between P10-P16 (avg ~113). Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we have been stocking out, we must account for the recent demand surge. I am selecting L=3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of the bipartite lead time distribution (1 or 3). For mu_hat, I'm setting an explicit value based on the most recent 12-period average (P10-P21) which is approximately 110 units per period, scaled by (1+L). With L=3, the target base stock will be roughly 440 units. Since our functional pipeline is 322 units, the OR backend will calculate a necessary order to reach this level while accounting for the lost ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Demand returned to high levels (avg 136 for P20-P21) after a brief lull (P17-P19). Ghost inventory remains at 297 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a prolonged stockout state (on-hand = 0) despite a high total in-transit quantity of 619 units. Analysis of historical records confirms that 297 of these units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are lost 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P17 (79 units) and P18 (243 units), totaling 322 units. Lead times are bipartite, following a pattern of 1 or 3 periods. The P17 order is now at T=6 and the P18 order is at T=5; given that the maximum successful lead time observed is 3, these functional orders are now also significantly overdue, suggesting a total supply chain collapse or an extended lead time shift. The demand regime starting at P20 has returned to high levels, averaging 132 units (P20: 122, P21: 150, P22: 124). To force the OR backend to place new orders despite the large (but non-functional) pipeline, I will set L to 4 (the current delay level) and use mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods of high demand to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the perceived pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed as of Period 22: All functional pipeline orders (P17, P18 - 322 units) are now overdue (LT > 4). Total non-functional 'ghost' inventory in-transit is likely 619 units. Demand has returned to a high regime (avg 132 units) since P20.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of near-collapse. In-transit inventory of 690 units consists of: P2 (167 units, LT=22), P6 (130 units, LT=18), P17 (79 units, LT=7), and P18 (243 units, LT=6). Since the historical bipartite lead time distribution shows successful arrivals only at LT=1 or LT=3, any shipment exceeding LT=3 is likely lost. This identifies 619 units (P2, P6, P17, P18) as 'ghost' inventory. Only the P23 order (71 units) is currently within a viable window. Demand has returned to a high regime, averaging 135.5 units over the last 4 periods (P20-P23). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and functional pipeline is only 71 units, I must order aggressively to overcome the persistent supply failures and stockouts. I am setting L=3 to account for the upper bound of the observed bipartite distribution and using recent_N (N=4) for demand to reflect the current high-demand regime (+130 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed as of Period 24: Orders from P17 (79 units) and P18 (243 units) are now 4+ periods old and classified as lost. Total non-functional 'ghost' inventory in pipeline is 619 units. Demand regime (P20-P23) average remains high at 135.5 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of near-collapse. In-transit inventory currently shows 690 units, but historical evidence from 'Period X conclude' messages confirms that 619 of these units (orders from P2, P6, P17, and P18) are likely lost, as they are well beyond the observed maximum functional lead time of 3 periods. Only the P23 order (71 units) is potentially functional, placed 2 periods ago. Demand has stabilized at a high regime since Period 20, with an average of approximately 135 units (P20: 122, P21: 150, P22: 124, P23: 146, P24: 122). Despite the high failure rate of orders, I must continue to place orders to capture any available supply and minimize lost sales, given the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio. Setting L to 3 periods to account for the upper bound of the bipartite lead time distribution (1 or 3). I calculate mu_hat using the last 5 demand samples (avg ~133), and sigma_hat based on recent volatility in this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Continued supply chain collapse. Total 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments is 619 units (P2: 167, P6: 130, P17: 79, P18: 243). Functional pipeline currently consists only of the P23 order (71 units). Demand regime (P20-P24) average is 132.8 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. Historical data shows that any order exceeding 3 periods in lead time is effectively lost. Currently, out of the 619 units reported as 'in-transit', 548 units (P2, P6, P17, P18) are confirmed lost and represent 'ghost' inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculation. The P23 order of 71 units arrived in Period 25 (LT=2), confirming that while unreliable, the channel is not completely dead. Demand has stabilized into a high regime starting at Period 20, with a 6-period mean of 126.2 units and std dev of ~19.5. To force the OR backend into ordering despite the ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly high enough to overcome the 548 lost units while accounting for the target base stock. A base stock target for 4 periods (L=3+1) should be around 505 units. Adding the 548 units of ghost inventory necessitates a mu_hat around 1053. I will set L to 3 to reflect the high-end of the bipartite LT distribution (1 or 3).

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed total lost 'ghost' inventory is 548 units (P2: 167, P6: 130, P17: 79, P18: 243). The P23 order arrived successfully in 2 periods, suggesting the supply chain remains marginally active but highly unreliable. Demand regime P20-P25 average is 126.2 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a confirmed bipartite lead time (1 or 3 periods) and a significant history of lost shipments. Ghost inventory (units in-transit that will never arrive) currently totals 619 units from Periods 2, 6, 17, and 18. The current in-transit total is 916; subtracting the 619 ghost units leaves a functional pipeline of 297 units (the order placed in Period 26). Demand from Period 20 to 26 has stabilized at a higher mean of approximately 122 units (122, 150, 124, 146, 122, 93, 99). To ensure the OR backend accounts for the high risk of stockouts caused by supply instability, I am setting an explicit lead time L=3. I will utilize recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while filtering out the early period fluctuations. This approach forces the base stock calculation to cover the increased demand mean and volatility while recognizing that the actual effective pipeline is much lower than the raw 'In-transit' figure suggests.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments: P2 (167), P6 (130), P17 (79), P18 (243) - Total 619 units. Functional pipeline at P27 start is only 297 units. Demand regime (P20-P26) mean is ~122 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Context: Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent high-mean regime since Period 20 (avg ~115 units). Supply remains highly unreliable with critical 'ghost' inventory issues. 2. Pipeline Analysis: Total In-transit is 916. Confirmed lost shipments ('ghost inventory'): P2 (167), P6 (130), P17 (79), P18 (243) = 619 units. Functional pipeline = 916 - 619 = 297 units (all from P26 order). 3. Lead Time: Actual delivery LT fluctuates \u05d1\u05d9\u05df 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2). Using L=2 is appropriate as a base, but 'ghost' inventory must be offset. 4. Parameter Choice: mu_hat uses recent_N=8 to capture the current demand regime (P20-P27 avg ~119). L remains default (2). To compensate for the 619 units of 'ghost' inventory that the OR-backend incorrectly counts as pipeline, I am setting mu_hat via an explicit value. Calculation: Required Base Stock + Ghost Inventory Offset. Recent mean demand = 119. Required Base Stock (L+1=3) \u2248 119 * 3 = 357. Adjusted mu_hat = 357 + 619 = 976. This ensures the backend places a real order despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 28, total 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost orders) is 619 units: P2 (167), P6 (130), P17 (79), P18 (243). Functional pipeline is only 297 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with significant 'ghost' inventory. Total confirmed lost shipments sum to 619 units (P2: 167, P6: 130, P17: 79, P18: 243). While In-transit shows 712 units, only 93 units (ordered P28) are functional; the other 619 are losses. I must set L to 3 to account for the upper bound of the bipartite distribution (1 or 3 periods) observed in functional deliveries. Demand has softened recently (Period 28 demand = 67), but the average since the Period 20 high-demand regime shift is approximately 114 units. Given high volatility and stockout history, I will use a recent_N of 9 (Period 20-28) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime while ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level to buffer against supply instability.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Functional pipeline confirmed at 93 units (P28 order). Remaining 619 units in-transit (P2, P6, P17, P18) are permanently lost. Demand regime (P20-P28) average stabilized at ~114 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30, the demand environment remains in a high regime that started around Period 20, with an average demand of approximately 114 units (last 9 periods average). The supply chain is highly unreliable with a confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 619 units (P2: 167, P6: 130, P17: 79, P18: 243) that are permanently lost. Subtracting this from the recorded in-transit of 712 leaves a functional pipeline of 93 units (from the order in Period 28). Since on-hand inventory is 116 units and the functional pipeline is 93 (total 209), and the lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, we need to order to maintain a base stock that covers the (L+1) horizon. I will set the lead time to an explicit value of 3 to account for the risk of longer arrivals and use a recent_N for mu_hat (N=9) to capture the current stable demand mean of ~114. This aggressive parameterization compensates for the high risk of lost shipments, while the OR backend's inventory balancing will account for the 'ghost' inventory by my setting of parameters.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the inventory situation is as follows: We have 162 units on-hand. The indicated in-transit inventory of 619 units consists entirely of 'ghost' inventory (P2, P6, P17, P18) which are confirmed lost. Thus, the functional pipeline is currently 0. Demand context: Since Period 20, the demand has been in a high-volatility regime with a mean of approximately 110 units (P20-P30 average is 107.2). Specifically, recent demand (P28-P30) has cooled (67, 114, 47). Lead time: While the promised lead time is 2, historical data shows a bipartite distribution of 1 or 3, but the last three successful arrivals (P23, P26, P28) all arrived exactly in 2 periods, suggesting a stabilization of the supply chain. I will set L to 2 (promised/recent). For mu_hat, the P20-P30 period average (last 11 samples) is 107.2 units; I will use N=11 to capture this regime while tempering the recent lower spikes. Target base stock = (1+L)*Mean = 3 * 107.2 = 321.6. Since functional pipeline is 0 and on-hand is 162, the system will order ~160 units to bridge the gap and prepare for the 3-period coverage cycle.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain appears to have stabilized at the promised lead time of 2 periods (Observed: P23, P26, and P28 orders all arrived with LT=2). Demand regime P20-P30 average is 107 units.

LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we have 68 units on-hand. The total 'In-transit' quantity remains 619 units, but historical evidence (Carry-over insights) confirms that these are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18) that will never arrive. The functional pipeline is currently zero. The supply chain has stabilized over the last few successful deliveries (P23, P26, P28) at the promised lead time of 2 periods, so I will use L=default. Demand has been fluctuate but has averaged 107 units since Period 20. However, the most recent sequence (P28-P31) shows lower demand (67, 114, 47, 94; Avg ~80), while the broader P20-P31 period average is 101.4. To avoid stockouts considering the current zero functional pipeline, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=12 (covering the high-regime start at P20) to capture a robust demand mean while the OR engine manages the pipeline gap. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=12 to reflect the high volatility (range 47-150) observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Supply chain stability at L=2 confirmed by 3 consecutive successful shipments (P23, P26, P28). Functional pipeline is zero as of Period 32 start (619 in-transit units are confirmed lost/ghost inventory).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33, the on-hand inventory is 0. The system shows an 'in-transit' total of 619 units, but historical data confirms these are lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18). There is currently zero functional pipeline inventory. Recent shipment history (P23, P26, P28) indicates lead time has stabilized at the promised L=2. The demand regime since Period 20 has averaged approximately 107 units per period, though it shows considerable volatility (range 47-150). To recover from the current stockout and account for the zero functional pipeline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (P20-P32) to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime while maintaining the default L=2 setting as the supply chain appears to have normalized.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34, several critical factors must be reconciled. First, the supply chain has stabilized over the last few cycles (P23, P26, and P28 orders all followed the promised L=2). However, there is a significant discrepancy in visible 'in-transit' inventory: 619 units listed are confirmed lost from historical supply failures (P2, P6, P17, P18) and do not represent functional pipeline stock. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no functional units in-transit. Regarding demand, since Period 30, the mean demand has stabilized around 80 units (94, 87, 93 in the last 3 periods), which is a slight softening from the longer-term P20-P29 average. Given the 100% stockout status and zero functional pipeline, the OR backend needs to place a substantial order to refill the cycle. I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the current regime of ~90 units, while setting L=2 (default) as recent arrivals have validated this lead time.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stability at L=2 confirmed for functional orders (P23, P26, P28). 619 units of 'in-transit' inventory are confirmed lost 'ghost' stock. Effective functional pipeline inventory is currently zero.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods (verified by orders from Periods 23, 26, and 28). However, as noted in previous periods, a total of 619 units in the 'In-transit' total are 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18) and will never arrive. The functional pipeline is currently zero, and on-hand inventory is zero, meaning we are in a stockout. Demand since Period 20 has averaged approximately 104 units per period (P20-P34). I will use L=2 and target a base stock that covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Since the OR backend subtracts the full 619 units of 'in-transit' inventory from the order calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this ghost inventory. Calculation: Target Base Stock = 104 units/period * 3 periods = 312 units. Offset required for ghost inventory = 619. Total mu_hat adjusted for the backend = 312 + 619 = 931. This ensures the backend generates an order of approximately 312 units to recover from the stockout and cover the lead time.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from extreme unreliability. As of Period 36, the 'In-transit' inventory of 972 units includes 619 units of confirmed lost 'ghost' stock (P2: 167, P6: 130, P17: 79, P18: 243). The remaining 353 units are from the order placed in Period 35. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand (P30-P35) has averaged ~83 units, the backend needs to target a base stock that accounts for the current demand regime and the 2-period promised lead time. I am using 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the demand regime since Period 20 (average ~104 units) while allowing for the high volatility observed. L is set to 'default' (2) because recent successful deliveries confirmed L=2, even though the system remains prone to complete order loss. The OR backend must ignore the 619 units of ghost inventory to trigger an appropriate order, but since I cannot manually zero out the 'In-transit' field, the high mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations will naturally push the base stock up to compensate for the perceived pipeline shortfall.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments remains 619 units (P2, P6, P17, P18). Demand regime since Period 20 averages 104 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods, as confirmed by orders in Periods 23, 26, and 28. However, there is a cumulative 'ghost' inventory of 619 units (from P2, P6, P17, P18) that are permanently lost but still reflect in the 'In-transit' total. Specifically, at Period 37 start: Total In-transit (972) - Ghost (619) = 353 units. These 353 units were ordered in Period 35 and are expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 37 (to be visible in Period 38). The current demand regime since Period 20 has stabilized with an average of approximately 104 units. To ensure the backend places an appropriate order, I am setting L to 2 (promised). Demand mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=17, covering P20-P36) to capture the current stable mean of ~104. Given the stockout in P36 and zero on-hand inventory, the OR backend needs to maintain the pipeline to cover the 2-period lead time plus the review period (L+1).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of L=2 (confirmed by P23, P26, P28, and most recently P35 orders all arriving in 2 periods). The '619 units' in-transit are confirmed lost shipments (ghost inventory) and must be discounted when the OR engine calculates the pipeline. Current on-hand is 271. Demand regime since Period 20 has stabilized at an average of approximately 104 units (ranging from 47 to 150). The OR engine needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand to maintain service levels. Setting L=2 explicitly reflects the reliable recent performance. mu_hat is set to cover 3 periods using the recent demand regime (last 18 periods since the major shift), and sigma_hat is calculated similarly to account for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stability confirmed at L=2 for 4 consecutive successful arrivals (P23, P26, P28, P35). Total 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments remains 619 units (P2, P6, P17, P18). Demand regime since Period 20 is stable with a mean of ~104 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized at the promised lead time of 2 periods, with four consecutive successful arrivals (P23, P26, P28, P35) confirming L=2. The 'ghost' inventory of 619 units (P2, P6, P17, P18) is permanently lost and should be ignored, meaning the functional pipeline inventory is currently zero. Demand since Period 20 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 104 units and a standard deviation of about 25. Current on-hand inventory is 182 units. With L=2, we need to cover demand for Period 39, 40, and 41 (L+1 periods). Expected demand for 3 periods is ~312 units. Since on-hand is 182 and functional pipeline is 0, the OR backend needs to order approximately 130 units. I will use recent_N (N=19) to capture the stable demand regime since Period 20 and 'default' for L to utilize the now-reliable promised lead time of 2, ensuring the backend targets a base stock that accounts for Period 39-41 demand.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods, as confirmed by four consecutive successful arrivals (P23, P26, P28, P35). Total 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments remains 619 units (P2, P6, P17, P18), which must be discounted as they will never arrive. Demand has softened slightly in the very recent periods (P39 demand was 35), but the overall regime since Period 20 remains stable with a mean of approximately 104 units and a standard deviation of 30. Current on-hand inventory is 147 units. Given the lead time L=2, the pipeline inventory should ideally cover demand for L+1 periods (3 periods). Since current on-hand (147) and functional pipeline (0) is less than 3 * 104 = 312, an order is likely necessary. I will set L to 2, mu_hat to cover 3 periods using the recent stable regime (N=20), and sigma_hat accordingly to maintain a safe service level while accounting for the documented ghost inventory.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 20) is stable with a mean of approximately 101 units per period. The supply chain has demonstrated stability with a lead time of 2 periods (L=2) across the last four successful arrivals (P23, P26, P28, P35). Although 'In-transit' shows 619 units, these are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18) and must be mentally excluded from the pipeline. Currently, on-hand inventory is 32 units and functional pipeline inventory is 0. To meet the target base stock of (L+1) periods of demand (~300 units), an order is required. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand parameters using a window of 21 periods (P20-P40) to capture the current stable regime.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 619 units reported as 'in-transit'. However, based on extensive historical tracking, these 619 units (from Periods 2, 6, 17, and 18) are confirmed lost shipments and will never arrive. This 'ghost' inventory prevents the OR backend from ordering unless I adjust parameters carefully. Since Period 20, the demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 104 units and a standard deviation around 26. The supply chain has settled into a reliable actual lead time of L=2 (confirmed by four consecutive successful deliveries in Periods 25, 28, 30, and 37). To clear the ghost inventory effect and trigger a necessary order to cover the current stockout, I will use 'explicit' methods. For mu_hat, I'll forecast (1+L)*mean = (1+2)*104 = 312. To ensure the order is large enough to bypass the 619 ghost units and satisfy demand, I will set mu_hat to 1000 and sigma_hat to 100. This high mu_hat will force the base_stock (mu_hat + z*sigma) to exceed 619, resulting in a positive order to replenish the currently depleted stock.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods (L=2) for recent functional orders (P23, P26, P28, P35). However, there is a cumulative 'ghost' inventory of 619 units (from P2, P6, P17, P18) that are permanently lost but still reflect in the 'In-transit' total. Current In-transit is 1048 units; subtracting the 619 ghost units leaves a functional pipeline of 429 units (the P42 order). On-hand inventory is currently 0. Demand since Period 20 has averaged approximately 101 units, though it remains volatile (recent spikes to 133). Using L=2 and a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=23, covering the current regime) allows the backend to estimate the required base stock. Because the OR backend generates orders by subtracting 'total' in-transit from the base stock, and it does not know about the 619 lost units, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to artificially inflate the target stock level, thereby 'canceling out' the ghost inventory and ensuring a real-world order is placed.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 619 units (P2, P6, P17, P18) remains in the system calculation. Functional pipeline as of P43 start is 429 units (P42 order). Demand regime since P20 remains stable with mean ~101.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we are managing a situation where the documented 'In-transit' inventory of 1048 units is heavily skewed by 619 units of confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory (from Periods 2, 6, 17, and 18). The functional pipeline consists only of the order placed in Period 42 (429 units). The promised lead time is 2 periods, and recent successful arrivals (P23, P26, P28, P35) have adhered to this, meaning the P42 order is expected to arrive during Period 44 (visible in Period 45). On-hand inventory is currently 0. Demand since Period 20 has stabilized with a mean around 101 units and moderate volatility. To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I must counteract the 619 'ghost' units. I will set L to the default (2), and use an explicit mu_hat. The calculation for base stock is (1+L)*demand. With L=2 and mean demand ~101, needed base stock is ~303. However, the backend sees 1048 in-transit. To trigger an order that covers upcoming demand while ignoring the ghost stock, I will set mu_hat explicitly high. Specifically, mu_hat = (Ideal Base Stock) + (Ghost Inventory). Target Base Stock (for q=0.8) is approx 430 units. Adding 619 ghost units = 1049. This ensures the backend doesn't see a surplus. I will also use explicit sigma_hat to maintain a high service level given the history of stockouts.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 45. The system shows an 'In-transit' balance of 1201 units, but 619 of these are confirmed 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18) that will never arrive. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P42 (429 units) and P44 (153 units). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has been stable since Period 20 with a mean of approximately 101 units. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time is bipartite (1 or 3) but has recently stabilized closer to 2 for successful arrivals (P23, P26, P28, P35). However, P42 is now at LT=3 (ordered P42, not arrived by P44 conclude) which suggests it should arrive during P45. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for this observed delay and ensure the base stock calculation covers the necessary periods. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=25 to capture the stable demand regime since Period 20.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: P42 order (429 units) is delayed (LT=3), confirming the lead time still fluctuates between 2 and 3 despite recent stability. Total 'ghost' inventory remains 619 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-9.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we observe that the major order from Period 42 (429 units) finally arrived after a lead time of 3 periods, confirming that lead times are still fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods despite a recent period of stability. The 'In-transit' figure is 772, but 619 of these units are 'ghost inventory' from historical lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18). The functional pipeline consists only of the P44 order (153 units). On-hand inventory is 345 units. The demand regime hasbeen stable since Period 20, with a mean of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation around 25. To ensure we cover demand over a possible 3-period lead time (L=3) plus the current period (total 4 periods), and acknowledging that the OR backend uses a pipeline calculation that erroneously includes the 619 units of ghost stock, I will set L to 3 and use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bypass the backend's miscalculation of pipeline inventory. My explicit mu_hat will target an inventory level that covers 4 periods of demand (~400 units) plus a safety buffer, while effectively 'nullifying' the 619 ghost units by setting a targets that forces the logic to order if functional inventory is low. Since the game is nearing its end (Period 46/50), I aim to maintain enough stock to satisfy remaining demand without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 45/46: Lead time variability confirmed as bipartite (2 or 3 periods) with the P42 order arriving in 3 periods. Ghost inventory remains constant at 619 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 20 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 101 units. Lead time is confirmed as bipartite, consistently appearing as either 2 or 3 periods (the most recent arrival from P42 arrived in 3 periods). The 'In-transit' balance of 790 units includes 619 units of 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments from P2, P6, P17, and P18), meaning the functional pipeline is actually 171 units (P44 order: 153, P46 order: 18). With on-hand inventory at 272 and functional pipeline at 171, the total functional stock is 443 units. Given the bipartite lead time, I will set L to 3 periods to ensure coverage for the maximum likely delivery delay. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=20) to capture the stable demand mean of ~101 and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This configuration helps the backend account for the 619-unit discrepancy in the pipeline and ensures the order brings the functional inventory to a safe level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status at Period 48 shows 209 units on-hand and 790 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 619 units in the in-transit balance (from Periods 2, 6, 17, and 18) are confirmed lost 'ghost' shipments. Therefore, the functional pipeline is 171 units (153 from P44 and 18 from P46). Lead time is bipartite (2 or 3 periods), with the most recent arrival (P42) taking 3 periods. Demand has slightly softened since P45 (avg ~73 vs previous ~101), but remains volatile. To account for the 619 units of 'ghost' inventory that the OR engine incorrectly thinks is available, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods. Using L=2 (promised) and an average demand of 100, mu_hat should ideally be (1+2)*100 = 300. However, to offset the 619 units the OR engine will subtract from 300, I must set mu_hat to approximately 300 + 619 = 919. I will use L=recent_N (N=5) to reflect the actual bipartite lead time (avg ~2.4) and sigma_hat default to maintain a standard service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Functional pipeline confirmed as 171 units; remaining 619 units in-transit are confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory. Lead time is confirmed bipartite (2 or 3 periods).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized into a bipartite lead time distribution of 2 or 3 periods (average ~2.5), although there is a legacy 'ghost' inventory of 619 units (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18) that are permanently lost but still appear in 'in-transit' totals. Functional inventory currently consists of the P44 order (153 units) and P46 order (18 units), totaling 171 functional units in-transit. The demand regime has slowed recently (P46-P48 average ~62 units), but the broader regime since Period 20 averages ~101 units. I will set L to 3 to account for the slower end of the bipartite distribution and the current lack of a P44 arrival (which would be LT=2). Demand mu_hat is set using recent_N=29 to capture the stable regime since Period 20 (~101 units/period), adjusted for (1+L). Sigma_hat uses the same window to capture the volatility of this segment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $267.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 50, the demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 101 units since Period 20, though recent periods show a slight deceleration (Periods 46-49 mean ~68). Lead time remains bipartite, fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods (e.g., P35 order arrived in 2, P42 order arrived in 3). High 'ghost' inventory persists in the pipeline: 619 units (P2, P6, P17, P18) are permanently lost but remain in the system's in-transit calculation. Specifically, functional in-transit inventory consists of P44 (153 units, 6 periods ago - likely lost), P46 (18 units, 4 periods ago - likely lost). With 73 units on-hand and the likely failure of all currently listed pipeline inventory, there is a risk of stockout if no new order is placed. I will use a lead time of 3 to provide a buffer against the bipartite reality and set mu_hat explicitly to provide a safe base stock covering the 100-unit average over the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Functional pipeline exhaustion confirmed. Recent orders from P44 (153) and P46 (18) are likely lost as they exceed the observed 3-period lead time window, adding to the previous 619 units of 'ghost' inventory (Total ghost ~ 790). Supply chain remains unstable with 3 periods being the maximum reliable arrival time.
