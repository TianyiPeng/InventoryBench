Total demand to cover (P3-P5) is approximately 114 * 3 = 342 units. My current pipeline of 430 units already exceeds the expected demand for the next three periods. However, to maintain a safety buffer and account for the high demand variance seen in historical samples (up to 159), I must ensure I don't stock out if P1 or P2 are delayed.

The order from Period 1 (330 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in Period 4's start (Period 3 Conclude). However, Period 3 Conclude shows 'arrived=0'.

On-hand inventory is currently low at 26 units. The lead time analysis indicates a volatile oscillation between 1 and 3 periods, with a significant frequency of lost orders (~20%). Based on the Carry-over Insights, the recorded In-transit figure of 960 units is heavily inflated by confirmed/suspected lost shipments from P2 (100), P6 (170), P15 (100), P17 (100), and likely others that have dropped out of the 'conclude' window. Tracking recent active orders: P24 (120), P25 (110), P26 (130), and P27 (130) are the primary pipeline units unlikely to be lost yet. P24 (120 units) is now at lead_time 4 and is at high risk of being lost given the max lead time of 3. To maintain a sufficient safety stock covering up to 4 periods (L+1 + safety) of demand (~450-480 units) and accounting for the high loss rate, I need to ensure the pipeline of viable orders remains robust.
