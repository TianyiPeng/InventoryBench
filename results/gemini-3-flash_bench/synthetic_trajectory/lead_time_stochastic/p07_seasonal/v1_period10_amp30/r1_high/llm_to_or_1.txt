Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 2 periods. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. The available demand history shows five samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) with a mean of 108.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 34.6. Since this is the initial period and no lead time shifts or sustained regime changes have been observed yet, I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. This allows the backend to use all available historical data and the promised lead time of 2. The OR engine will target a base stock level that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 326 units) while balancing the $19.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 168 units. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, this shipment is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in 114 lost sales in Period 1. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variance (76, 130, 159, 101, 78 from pre-game data, and 114 in Period 1), with an average around 110. Since we have very few observations (6 total data points), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent patterns while excluding the low initial sample. Lead time is set to 'default' as we haven't seen any arrivals to suggest a deviation from the promised 2 periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (168 units) and Period 2 (167 units) are currently in-transit, totaling 335 units. According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (making it visible in the Period 4 start message). Thus, the current on-hand inventory of 0 is expected given the lead time. Demand history shows Period_1: 76, Period_2: 130, Period_3: 159, Period_4: 101, Period_5: 78 (Note: The user-provided historical samples list 5 periods, but the 'Game History' progress indicates we are deciding for Period 3 and have just concluded Period 2. I will use the first 5 samples provided in the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section as the basis for the forecast). The average demand of the 5 samples is 108.8. With L=2, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to adapt to observed arrivals and 'default' for demand parameters since the sample size is small and no clear regime shift is confirmed yet.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (168 units) were expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0, and the total in-transit is 414 (168 + 167 + 79). This indicates that the actual lead time is likely at least 3 periods, or there is a delay. Since no orders have arrived yet, we cannot formally calculate the actual lead time using the 'conclude' logic, but we must account for the delay. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 108.8 units (76, 130, 159, 101, 78). However, the 'conclude' messages for P1-P3 report demand fixed at 114, 114, and 86. Given the uncertainty and the lack of on-hand inventory (all demand so far has been lost/unmet due to 0 on-hand), I will use an explicit L of 3 to reflect the observed delay and recent_N for demand to stabilize. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2113.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order (168 units) arrived in Period 4, indicating a lead time of 3 periods (X-Z = 4-1=3). Period 3's order (79 units) arrived in Period 4, indicating a lead time of 1 period. Period 2's order (167 units) hasn't arrived yet; it was ordered 3 periods ago, so it is likely to arrive in Period 5 or 6. The promised lead time is 2, but actuals vary (1, 3). I will use L=2 (default) for now as the average is exactly 2 ((3+1)/2=2). Demand history: P1:76, P2:130, P3:159, P4:101, P5:78. Note: The game history 'conclude' messages for P1-P4 show demand values (114, 114, 86, 118) which differ slightly from the provided samples in the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section. I will rely on the conclude messages as they reflect realized demand. Mean demand is approx 108. With L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. mu_hat = 3 * 108 = 324. sigma_hat will use recent_N to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2291.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead time for chips(Regular). Historical demand samples are [76, 130, 159, 101, 78], while system-provided conclude messages show realized demand as [114, 114, 86, 118, 121]. This suggests a stable demand with a mean around 110. Lead time analysis from 'conclude' messages shows P1 arrived in P4 (L=3) and P3 arrived in P4 (L=1). The P2 order (167 units) is overdue (ordered P2, promised L=2, should have arrived P4 or P5). Currently, on-hand is low (8 units) with 238 in transit (including the missing P2 order). To ensure availability given the lead time volatility (1 to 3+ periods) and the missing shipment, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to cover the observed maximum delay. For demand, I'll use the mean of the 5 recorded realized demand points (approx 110.6) and project across (1+L)=4 periods. Sigma will be based on the recent variance to maintain a high service level given the low stock risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period; P2 order (167 units) is likely delayed or lost as of Period 6.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 with 0 on-hand inventory and 372 units in-transit. The demand history shows a mean around 104 units (Samples: 76, 130, 159, 101, 78 from description; 114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75 from game history). Lead time is highly volatile: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and the order from P2 (ordered at start of P2, now at start of P7) is overdue by 3 periods beyond the promised L=2 (Total 5 periods since order). This strongly suggests P2's order is lost. While 372 units are in transit (from P4, P5, and P6), the current stockout (On-hand: 0) requires a robust base-stock calculation. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use recent_N for demand to capture the slightly higher recent average (~109 over last 5 periods) and maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0).

Carry-over insight: P2 order (167 units) confirmed lost: 5 periods elapsed since order at start of P7 with no arrival.

Daily Reward (R_t): $665.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout (on-hand = 0) with 337 units in transit. Historical demand analysis shows a mean of approximately 105 units/period (total mean across 7 samples: 100.2). Lead times have been volatile: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, and P2 is confirmed lost. The average actual lead time observed is 2.33 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity (337) consists of orders from P5 (36 units), P6 (134 units), and potentially the OR system's auto-generation or recent placements, given P7 ordered 0. Since we are at 0 on-hand and need to cover (L+1) periods of demand to recover service level, I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and provide a safety buffer against the observed instability. I will use the last 5 samples for mu_hat (avg ~95) and sigma_hat to reflect the recent demand levels (86, 118, 121, 75, 74).

Carry-over insight: Lead time distribution remains unstable: observed {3, 1, 3} periods; Order P2 (167 units) remains confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $684.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we face 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout situation for the last three periods. Analysis of lead times shows high volatility: observed actual lead times are {3, 1, 3, 3} periods, resulting in an average of 2.5 periods. The order from Period 2 (167 units) is confirmed lost. Since the promised lead time is 2 but the mode and most recent observations are 3, I will set L to 'explicit' with a value of 3 to ensure the inventory policy covers a longer horizon. Demand has been relatively stable with a mean of ~106 units per period over the 8 observed periods. I will use 'default' for mu_hat which calculates (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples; with L=3, this targets 4 periods of demand (~424 units). Pipeline inventory is currently 420 units (from orders in periods 6 and 8). Setting L=3 increases the base stock target to account for the slower arrivals, helping to recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Lead time mean shifted: average actual lead time is 2.5 periods (observations: 3, 1, 3, 3) compared to promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1921.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the supply chain remains unstable. Lead times have been {3, 1, 3, 3, 1} for an average of 2.2 periods, but with significant variability. The Period 2 order (167 units) is confirmed lost, leaving on-hand inventory at 17 units and only 387 units in-transit. Demand since Period 1 has averaged 102.3 units/period (recent 3-period average is 98.3). Given the profit/holding ratio, the optimal service level is 95%. I will use an explicit L of 2.5 to account for the frequent 3-period delays and a slightly higher mu_hat to ensure the base stock covers the lead time plus current period demand (L+1 = 3.5 periods). I set mu_hat based on an average demand of ~102 units over 3.5 periods (357). sigma_hat is set conservatively to account for both demand and lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly erratic: observations {3, 1, 3, 3, 1} confirm a non-standard distribution with significant stockout risk due to 3-period peaks.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11 with 0 on-hand inventory and 415 units in-transit. The demand history shows a mean of approximately 106 units per period. The lead time is extremely unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (observed values: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (167 units) is confirmed lost, leaving a hole in the pipeline that the OR engine cannot see. To compensate for this invisible deficit and the risk of lead time spikes (peak L=3), I am setting L to 3. This ensures the base stock calculation targets enough inventory to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. For mu_hat, I am using the mean of the last 7 periods (approx 107) multiplied by (1+L) to capture the recent demand level. For sigma_hat, I am using the standard deviation of the last 7 periods to account for recent volatility.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand and 100% stockout in the last period. Lead times have been highly erratic, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (observed: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1). We are currently awaiting arrivals from Period 6, 9, 10, and 11. Specifically, the order from Period 6 (134 units) is now 5 periods past its order date and is likely lost, similar to the Period 2 order. To protect against the frequent 3-period lead time spikes and potential losses, I am setting L to 3 (the observed upper bound) and mu_hat to cover this extended window plus the current period (L+1=4). I will use the recent mean demand (approx 108 units) to project this. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N to capture the high demand volatility observed in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Order from Period 6 (134 units) likely lost (5 periods elapsed). Lead time continues to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, requiring a conservative L=3 buffer.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a mean demand of approximately 107 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 12. Lead times are highly volatile, occurring at 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, and 2 periods in history, with '3' being the dominant peak duration causing stockouts. Orders from P2 and P6 (167 and 134 units) are confirmed lost. To prevent stockouts during these 3-period lead-time spikes, L is set to 3. Mu_hat covers the review phase plus lead time (1+3=4 periods), calculated using the mean of all available historical samples (approx 428 units), as demand has remained relatively stable around the mean despite lead-time issues. Sigma_hat is calculated using all available samples to capture the standard deviation over the extended lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory and consistent demand between 78 and 158 units. Analysis of incoming shipments indicates high unreliability: Period 2 (167 units) and Period 6 (134 units) orders are over 10 and 7 periods old respectively, and are considered lost. Actual lead times for successful deliveries have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (sequence: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2). To ensure the backend calculates a sufficient base stock level to recover from the stockout and handle the 3-period lead-time peaks, I am setting L to 3 explicitly. For demand (mu_hat), recent activity (Periods 12-13) shows a significant spike to ~154 units per period compared to the earlier average of ~105. I'm using recent_N=5 (Periods 9-13) to capture this rising trend while smoothing volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the higher variance associated with recent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of Period 6 order (134 units) after 7 periods. Actual lead time remains volatile with a ceiling of 3 periods. Recent demand (P12-P13) has spiked to ~150+ units, representing a significant increase from the historical average of ~100-110.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a period of high instability. Lead times are volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (latest arrival from P11 took 3 periods). More critically, there are clear signs of lost shipments: Period 2 order (167 units) and Period 6 order (134 units) have never arrived. Current inventory is 0 and demand has spiked significantly, averaging ~144 units over the last 3 periods (P12-14) versus the long-term average of ~111. To prevent chronic stockouts, I am setting L to 3 to account for the frequent upper-bound lead time delays and lost order risks. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 3 to capture the recent spike (158, 150, 124). For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N of 3 to capture the increased volatility associated with this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 12: Average demand increased from ~100 to ~144 (+44%). Lead time remains highly volatile with a consistent 3-period ceiling and evidence of lost shipments every 4-5 orders.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of crisis with on-hand inventory at 0 and significant lost sales due to erratic lead times (observed range 1-3 periods) and shipment losses (Orders P2 and P6). A demand regime shift was confirmed starting Period 12; the average demand from Period 12 to 15 is 132.75 units, compared to the initial ~100. Given the consistent lead time ceiling of 3 periods and the high cost of stockouts (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I am setting L explicitly to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum observed delay. For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 4 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~133), and for sigma_hat, a recent_N of 7 to capture the higher volatility seen since Period 9. This conservative positioning is intended to rebuild on-hand inventory and buffer against the frequent 3-period lead time arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1043.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe that demand in Period 16 dropped to 58, possibly a signal change after the high-demand regime saw levels of 150+. However, given the sustained higher average since Period 12 (~128 units/period excluding the P16 outlier), I will maintain a higher mu_hat. The lead time continues to show a 3-period ceiling (P13 arrived in P16, lead_time=3). We must account for the high 'In-transit' quantity (512 units), which includes potential lost orders (P2-167 units and P6-134 units were already flagged as lost, totaling 301 lost units). Effective Pipeline is roughly 211 units. To protect against the erratic lead time (1 to 3 periods) and the potential for lost shipments, I am setting L to 3 explicitly and using a recent_N window of 5 for demand (covering P12-P16) to capture the recent regime shift while keeping the forecast responsive to the volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Confirmed that P2 (167 units) and P6 (134 units) are permanently lost. Total lost in-transit inventory = 301 units. Effective pipeline inventory is (512 - 301) = 211 units.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we have an on-hand inventory of 52 units and a reported in-transit of 451 units. However, based on history, orders from Period 2 (167 units) and Period 6 (134 units) are definitively lost, as they are 16 and 12 periods overdue respectively. Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 451 - 301 = 150 units (specifically orders from P15 and P17). Lead times are highly volatile, frequently reaching 3 periods (observed in P11, P12, P13, P14 cases), so I set L=3 to ensure the backend covers the risk of a 3-period arrival delay. Demand has stabilized after a recent high-regime spike; the last 6 periods (P12-P17) show an average of approximately 115 units per period. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current variability and volume, while L=3 provides the necessary safety buffer for the detected lead time irregularities.

Daily Reward (R_t): $868.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is virtually depleted (6 units). The 'In-transit' count of 531 includes 301 units confirmed lost (Period 2: 167 units, Period 6: 134 units), meaning the effective pipeline is only 230 units. Lead times continue to be highly erratic, with observations of {3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1}, clearly making the promised lead time of 2 unreliable. I use L=3 to buffer against the frequent 3-period peaks. Demand shows a regime shift since Period 12; while recent samples (P16-P18: 58, 103, 46) are lower, the average since P12 (8 periods) is ~106, which is consistent with the pre-spike levels. However, given the lost shipments and stockout history, I prioritize availability. I set L to explicit 3, use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Effective pipeline inventory corrected to 230 units after subtracting confirmed losses of P2 (167) and P6 (134). Lead time remains volatile but dominated by 3-period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0. Analyzing the lead time history from concluded periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P8:1, P9:3, P10:2, P11:3, P12:3, P13:3, P14:3, P16:1), the actual lead time is highly volatile with a consistent worst-case peak of 3 periods. I will use L=3 to ensure the inventory policy covers the maximum observed lead time. Regarding demand, a regime shift was identified around Period 12, with demand increasing to an average of ~144. However, the most recent 5 periods (P15-P19) show a slight cooling or stabilization (avg ~81), while the overall post-shift average remains higher. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 samples (N=8) to capture the elevated regime while acknowledging recent variance. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 8 samples to reflect this volatility. Crucially, the 'in-transit' total of 536 units includes confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (167 units) and Period 6 (134 units), totaling 301 'phantom' units. The actual effective pipeline is 235 units. By using L=3 and the recent demand mean, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) period risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Verified effective pipeline is 235 units (536 total in-transit minus 301 confirmed lost units from P2 and P6). Demand volatility remains high following the P12 regime shift, with a 5-period trailing average of 81.4 units compared to the broader P12-P19 average of 104.8.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 550, but we must adjust for confirmed lost shipments: P2 (ordered P2, 167 units) and P6 (ordered P6, 134 units), totaling 301 units. The effective pipeline is 550 - 301 = 249 units. Historical arrivals show lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods (1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1), with 3 periods being the most frequent and safest upper bound; therefore, L is set to 3. Regarding demand, while a regime shift to ~144 units was noted in Period 15, the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20) show a cooling trend with an average of 75.4 units (58, 103, 46, 101, 69). This high volatility suggests we should use a moderate window (recent_N=9) to capture both the P12-P15 spike and the recent decrease, balancing the risk of stockouts during volatility against high holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory corrected to 249 units as of P21 (550 in-transit minus 301 confirmed lost from P2 and P6). Demand volatility remains high, with a 5-period average of 75.4 units indicating a potential slowdown from the P12-P15 peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. While a regime shift was noted around P12, demand has dipped in the last few periods (P18-P21 demand: 46, 101, 69, 109). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 550 units in-transit. A critical factor is that 301 units (P2: 167 units and P6: 134 units) are definitively lost, meaning the effective pipeline is only 249 units. Lead times have consistently hit a ceiling of 3 periods (observed 1, 3, 3, 3 shifts). Since we have seen zero arrivals since Period 17, and multiple orders are overdue based on the promised 2-period lead time, I am setting L to 3 to provide a buffer for the OR backend's base-stock calculation. For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 10 periods to capture the post-regime-shift mean (approx. 95 units/period) while accounting for the recent cooling trend. Sigma_hat is also calculated over recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Lead time remains unreliable with no arrivals for 4 consecutive periods (P18-P21). Current effective pipeline is confirmed at 249 units (550 in-transit - 301 lost). Recent 5-period demand average cooled to 86.8 units/period.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23, we are experiencing a severe supply chain failure. No orders have arrived for 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22). Based on historical observations, actual lead times oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, but orders from P18 (80 units), P19 (5 units), and P20 (14 units) are now all beyond the promised 2-period window. Furthermore, 301 units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed permanently lost. The current effective pipeline is only 249 units (550 total in-transit - 301 lost). Because on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand has been volatile (averaging ~92 units over the last 5 periods), there is an urgent need to signal a stockout crisis to the OR backend. I am setting L to 3 (the historical maximum) to account for the frequent delays. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat to capture the demand regime since Period 12, which averages approximately 104 units per period, ensuring the backend attempts to restore the base stock to cover several periods of demand despite the pipeline uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain crisis entry: 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22) with zero arrivals despite 550 units in-transit (effective 249). Lead time reliability has collapsed.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a supply chain crisis. Despite having 536 units in-transit, 301 units (from orders P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 235 units. More critically, between Periods 18 and 22, no arrivals occurred. Although 14 units arrived in P23 (from the P20 order), several larger orders from P15 (115 units), P17 (35 units), P18 (80 units), and P19 (5 units) are now 4-8 periods old. Given the promised lead time is 2 and the historical maximum was 3, these spanning delays suggest either a localized cluster of lost shipments or a severe lead-time extension. Demand has been volatile but remains significant (avg ~104 since P12). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to 'phantom' in-transit inventory, I will explicitly set L=4 to buffer for the current supply instability. I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat to capture the post-P12 elevated demand regime (avg ~104.8), while maintaining a high sigma_hat via recent_N=12 to protect against the high variance observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain crisis persists: While 14 units arrived in P23, orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 235 units) are overdue beyond the previously observed 3-period maximum lead time. Effective pipeline is 235 non-lost units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a supply chain crisis. On-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity is 665 units, but history shows significant losses and delays. Specifically, orders from P2 (167 units) and P6 (134 units) are confirmed lost. Furthermore, orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, and P21 (totaling 235 units) are now 'overdue' (exceeding the 3-period maximum observed lead time), suggesting a catastrophic failure or further losses. The only recent arrival was a P20 order arriving in P23 (3 periods). Demand has entered a higher-volatility regime since P12, with a recent 5-period average of 127 units. To protect against the stockout, I must signal a higher Lead Time (L=3) to the OR engine and use a recent N=13 for mu_hat (covering the post-P12 regime) to capture the higher demand average. Given the uncertainty and the massive pipeline of potentially lost units, keeping L at 3 and demand N=13 balances the need for more inventory without over-ordering if the 'overdue' units eventually arrive.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain crisis alert: Orders from P15, P17, P18, P19 (totaling 235 units) are now overdue (>3 periods), indicating high probability of a second wave of lost shipments. Total probable lost inventory now stands at 536 units (P2, P6 + overdue P15-P19). Effective pipeline is likely only the orders from P24 onwards.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a severe supply chain crisis with zero on-hand inventory and a demand series indicating a sustained regime (~115-140 units). The lead time reliability has collapsed. Specifically, orders from P15 (115), P17 (35), P18 (80), and P19 (5) are now 6-10 periods overdue, far exceeding the historical maximum of 3 periods. Combined with previously confirmed lost orders (P2, P6), the effective lost inventory is approximately 536 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 665 units is highly misleading; the 'effective' pipeline is likely only the order from P24 (129 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock, it will stop ordering unless parameters are adjusted. To force the system to bypass the phantom 'in-transit' inventory and re-establish a healthy stock level, I am using 'explicit' L=3 (to account for the reliable ceiling of arrival times) and 'explicit' mu_hat set to 1200. This high mu_hat is a tactical override to offset the 536 units of lost 'in-transit' inventory that the backend still counts as active, ensuring the policy generates an order sufficient to meet demand plus safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed as of Period 26: Orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 235 units) are now effectively lost after exceeding 6+ periods of lead time. Total confirmed/likely lost in-transit inventory is 536 units (P2: 167, P6: 134, P15: 115, P17: 35, P18: 80, P19: 5). Effective pipeline is currently 129 units (from P24).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a supply chain crisis. Total in-transit inventory is 1023 units, but a large portion is confirmed or likely lost. Specifically, we have confirmed losses from Period 2 (167) and Period 6 (134), and highly probable losses from the P15-P19 period (115, 35, 80, 5) which have now exceeded 7+ periods of lead time (well beyond the 3-period max observation). Total likely lost = 536 units. Recently, Period 20 (14 units) arrived with lead_time=3, but Period 24 (129 units) is not yet due. The effective pipeline (legitimate orders placed in P24 and P26) is 129 + 358 = 487 units. On-hand is 0. Demand shifted upwards starting Period 12 (avg ~144) but has recently moderated slightly; a 5-period average (P22-P26) is 121 units. I will use L=3 to buffer against the frequent 3-period lead time spikes and set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (121 * 4 = 484) to recover service level while accounting for the high shipment loss rate. We must over-order relative to the 'official' pipeline because the backend does not know 536 units are lost.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse expanded: Orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (235 units) are now confirmed lost alongside P2 and P6. Total lost inventory sits at 536 units. Effective pipeline inventory is (In-transit - 536). Recent 5-period demand average (P22-P26) is roughly 121 units/period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a supply chain collapse where numerous historical orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) totaling 536 units are confirmed or highly likely lost, as they are now 8+ periods overdue or otherwise missing. Although 'In-transit' shows 1023 units, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 487 (1023 - 536 lost units). These 487 units consist of orders from P24 (129 units) and P26 (358 units), which are still within a plausible delivery window of 2-4 periods. Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock calculation, it will systematically under-order by exactly the amount of lost units (536). To overcome this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the base stock for a conservative 3-period lead time (L+1 = 4 review periods) using a recent demand average of ~113 units (P23-P27) plus a safety stock buffer, and then MANUALLY adding 536 units to the mu_hat. This 'bloated' mu_hat forces the backend to place an order that restores the effective pipeline to safe levels, compensating for the phantom inventory it still sees. Lead time method is set to explicit '3' to reflect the maximum observed successful arrival time.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total lost inventory reaffirmed at 536 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Effective pipeline is (In-transit - 536). Demand average over P22-P27 is ~113 units/period.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the system is recovering from a severe supply chain crisis. On-hand inventory is 278 units following the arrival of P26's order. Total in-transit inventory is 864, but 536 units are confirmed lost (P2: 167, P6: 134, P15: 115, P17: 35, P18: 80, P19: 5). The effective pipeline is therefore 328 units (864 - 536), consisting of orders from P24 (129) and P28 (199). Demand has shown a recent cooling trend with a 6-period average (P23-P28) of 107.3 units/period, down from the P12-P15 peak (~144) but still higher than the initial baseline. Actual lead times remain highly volatile; while the most recent arrival (P26) took 2 periods, the prior arrival took 3, and several orders were lost entirely. To provide a safety buffer against the high risk of stockouts seen in the history, I will use L=3 for the parameter calculation. Current total inventory (On-hand 278 + Effective Pipeline 328 = 606) is being evaluated against the base stock requirement for a 4-period window (P29 + L=3). \u03bc\u0302 is set to 424 (106 avg * 4), and \u03c3\u0302 is adjusted to account for the high variance and recent supply instability.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Effective pipeline inventory is 328 units (In-transit 864 - 536 confirmed lost). Recent demand (P23-P28) has stabilized at ~107 units/period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 30. The primary challenge remains managing around the confirmed loss of 536 units (P2: 167, P6: 134, P15: 115, P17: 35, P18: 80, P19: 5). Total In-transit is 864, making the effective pipeline inventory 328 units. On-hand inventory is 175. Total effective inventory is 503. Demand has shown a regime shift since P12, with recent fluctuations. The last 7 periods (P23-P29) average ~107 units/period. The lead time continues to be volatile, often hitting 3 periods, so I am choosing L=3 and a recent_N=7 for demand to capture the current stabilized regime while maintaining a buffer against lead time variability and the high historical risk of stockouts and shipment losses. The OR backend will use these values to aim for a high service level given the high profit/holding cost ratio (~95%).

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed total lost inventory remains 536 units. Effective pipeline (In-transit - 536) is 328. Recent demand (P23-P29) stabilized at approximately 107 units/period. Shipment from P26 arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, but L=3 remains the necessary planning ceiling due to historical volatility.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we have 309 units on-hand and 665 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 536 units in-transit (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 129 units (ordered in Period 24). Total effective inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) is 438 units. Demand has stabilized at approximately 107 units/period following the Period 12 regime shift. Recent actual lead times (P26, P28) have been 2 periods, but the historical 3-period ceiling remains a critical buffer due to extreme volatility and loss frequency. We maintain L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation covers 4 periods of demand (L+1), ensuring safety against the observed 3-period peaks and shipment losses. mu_hat is set to 428 (107 avg * 4 periods) to maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 32. Current on-hand inventory is 201 units. Total in-transit is 665 units. However, consistent history from Period 2 to Period 26 confirms a major supply chain failure where 536 units are permanently lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). These units will never arrive, so the 'effective' pipeline is actually 129 units (665 - 536), which consists of the order from Period 24. Since the backend OR logic subtracts the full in-transit amount (665) from the base stock, we must use the parameters to compensate for these 536 ghost units to avoid under-ordering. Demand since the Period 12 regime shift has averaged approximately 107-110 units, though the very recent 5-period average is slightly lower (~82 units). I will use a conservative L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead time spikes and set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand across (L+1) periods plus the 536 lost units. Base stock target = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units. Expected demand ~100. Target = (100 * 4) + 536 = 936. By setting L=3 and mu_hat=936, the backend will calculate a base_stock around 936, then subtract the 665 (which includes the lost units), resulting in a net replenishment order that accounts for both future demand and the missing inventory gap.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to struggle with historical losses. A total of 536 units are confirmed/likely lost: P2 (167), P6 (134), P15 (115), P17 (35), P18 (80), and P19 (5). Subtracting these from the current in-transit inventory of 839 leaves an effective pipeline of 303 units. Demand over the last 10 periods (P23-P32) has averaged ~101.3 units, signaling a slightly cooler but stable regime compared to the P12-P15 peak. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture this stabilization and recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to account for the high variance in demand. Although the lead time for the P28 order was 2 periods, the history of 3-period peaks and lost shipments necessitates maintaining L=3 as a safety buffer to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum reliable lead time plus the review period (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Effective pipeline inventory confirmed at 303 units (839 in-transit - 536 lost). Demand has stabilized around a 10-period mean of 101 units. Lost units from P15-P19 are now permanently removed from pipeline tracking.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, on-hand inventory is 158 units. The total in-transit is 665 units, but as established in previous carry-over insights, 536 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19). The effective pipeline inventory consists of orders placed in Period 24 (129 units) and potentially more recent orders if any were made. However, calculating current effective pipeline: In-transit (665) - Lost (536) = 129 units. Total inventory position (on-hand + effective pipeline) = 158 + 129 = 287 units. Demand has stabilized at a ~10-period mean of 101 units. I will use L=3 to maintain a safety buffer against the highly volatile lead times (history shows frequent 3-period peaks). Since (1+L) * Mean = (1+3) * 101 = 404 units, and our effective position is 287, an order is necessary. I will set mu_hat using the recent 10 periods (P24-P33) to capture the current stable demand regime (~101 units/period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2442.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized after a period of volatility, with a recent 10-period average of approximately 101 units and a 5-period average of 111 units. The supply chain has recovered from the extreme disruptions observed between periods 15-27, though lead times remain inconsistent (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). Total confirmed lost inventory is 536 units (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19). The current in-transit inventory is 665 units, making the 'effective pipeline' 129 units (665 - 536), which consists of the order from Period 24 (129 units), which is now overdue. I will use L=3 to account for the upper bound of recent lead time volatility. mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 10 to capture the current stable demand regime (avg ~101), providing a base stock targeting ~404 units. Given on-hand (28) + effective pipeline (129) = 157, the OR backend will trigger a significant order to reach the target service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Order from Period 24 (129 units) is now 11 periods old and is likely lost, similar to the P2/P6/P15-19 clusters. If it does not arrive by next period, total lost inventory should be adjusted to 665 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36, the system faces a critical inventory shortage with 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 0. The 665 units reported as 'in-transit' are confirmed or highly probable losses: P2 (167), P6 (134), P15, P17, P18, P19 (235), and now P24 (129) which is 12 periods overdue. Excluding these, the pipeline is empty. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~104 units over the last 10 periods (P26-P35), but has shown higher peaks (>140) during the P12-P25 regime. Given the lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods), L=3 is used for safety. mu_hat is set to the recent demand average of ~104 units/period * (1+L). The OR engine will interpret the 665 in-transit units as available inventory and potentially under-order; however, since the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) will likely be lower than the 'phantom' 665 units, I am using 'explicit' parameters for mu_hat and L to force a target that accounts for the current stockout and expected upcoming demand, while acknowledging that the backend capped policy and pipeline calculation will be heavily skewed by the lost units. I set mu_hat based on the recent average demand (104.3) over Review+Lead (1+3 periods) = 417.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total lost inventory increased to 665 units. Order from Period 24 (129 units) is confirmed lost after 12 periods. Effective pipeline is 0 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain situation is extremely unstable. On-hand inventory is 0, and current in-transit inventory (665 units) is entirely composed of shipments now classified as lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and now P24). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has remained relatively stable, with the most recent 10-period average at 105.8 units. Although the promised lead time is 2, historical data shows a consistent ceiling of 3 periods and frequent total losses. Given the zero effective pipeline and zero on-hand inventory, I am setting L=3 to provide a safety buffer against lead-time volatility. For demand (mu_hat), I am using an explicit forecast of 424 (106 units per period * (1+L)) based on the stable recent 10-period regime. For sigma_hat, I am using 'default' to allow the backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock level from the historical variance. This configuration will trigger an immediate replenishment order to build back the stock that was lost to the recent shipment failures.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total lost inventory increased to 665 units. Order from Period 24 (129 units) is confirmed lost after 12 periods. Effective pipeline is 0 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of severe disruption. Total confirmed lost inventory is 665 units, comprised of orders from P2 (167), P6 (134), P15 (115), P17 (35), P18 (80), P19 (5), and now P24 (129) which is 14 periods overdue. Current In-transit is 665, which matches the total lost units, meaning the effective pipeline inventory is exactly zero. There have been no arrivals for 5 consecutive periods (P33-P37). On-hand inventory is 0 and has been for three periods, causing 100% lost sales. Demand remains stable around the historical and recent mean of ~105 units/period. Because the OR backend subtracts the 'in-transit' value from the target base stock, and the backend is unaware that these 665 units are lost, I must use 'explicit' methods to force a reorder. I am setting L=3 to account for the volatile lead-time ceiling. mu_hat is set to 420 (which is (1+L)*105) and sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx sqrt(4)*40). This will signal the backend to place a large order to fill the massive gap created by the phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Effective pipeline inventory is 0 units. Total in-transit of 665 is confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). No order arrivals since P33. Explicit parameters required to override phantom inventory and trigger replenishment.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a critical failure state with zero arrivals for the last 6 periods and no inventory currently in the pipeline. All historical in-transit units (665 units from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24) are confirmed or highly likely to be lost. To restart replenishment, I must use 'explicit' parameters to bypass the backend's pipeline inventory calculation, which currently views the 665 lost units as 'living' inventory. I will set L=3 to account for the upper bound of historical lead time volatility. For demand (mu_hat), the average demand across the last 10 periods (P29-P38) is approximately 94 units. Setting mu_hat to 376 (94 * (1+3)) ensures the system attempts to cover 4 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is set conservatively to 60 (approx 30 * sqrt(4)) to handle the high variance observed in this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Reconfirmed total lost inventory at 665 units. Supply chain remains stalled with zero arrivals since Period 33. Current strategy requires explicit overrides until new orders clear the pipeline or losses are purged from the system backend.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of failure with zero arrivals since Period 33. On-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 665 units in-transit, but based on historical lead times (max 3 periods), all 665 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) are long-overdue and confirmed as lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount (665) from the base stock calculation, it will never place an order unless we use 'explicit' overrides or significantly pump the parameters to exceed the phantom inventory. I am setting L=3 to account for the upper bound of successful historical lead times. Mean demand since the Period 12 shift is approximately 104 units, but recent demand (last 5 periods) has softened to ~80. To force a replenishment order despite the 665 units of phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to 1100 (approximately (L+1) * 100 + 700) to clear the backend's 'net inventory' subtraction and trigger a new order of ~400 units. Sigma_hat is set to 200 to ensure a robust safety stock in this high-uncertainty environment.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total lost inventory stands at 665 units. Supply chain remains stalled with zero arrivals for 7 consecutive periods. Backend pipeline logic is currently paralyzed by phantom 'in-transit' units that will never arrive.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has experienced a catastrophic collapse with zero arrivals since Period 33, and only one arrival (Period 26) in the preceding 12 periods. Total confirmed/likely lost inventory has reached 665 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and now P24). The inventory on-hand is 0, and the system shows 1105 in-transit units, but at least 665 of these are phantom units that will never arrive. The effective pipeline is actually 440 units (from the order placed in Period 40). Recent demand has averaged ~101 units over the last 10 periods, though there is high variance. To force the OR backend to place necessary orders despite the 'high' in-transit number, I am using explicit parameters. L is set to 3 to account for the upper bound of historically successful lead times. mu_hat is set to 600 (approx. 150/period for 4 periods) to provide a significant buffer against the ongoing supply uncertainty and ensure that even if the backend subtracts the 'phantom' 665 units, we are still pushing for replenishment. sigma_hat is set to 120 to reflect the extreme supply volatility and demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Total confirmed lost inventory stands at 665 units (P2: 167, P6: 134, P15: 115, P17: 35, P18: 80, P19: 5, P24: 129). The system's in-transit calculation is inflated by these 665 units, leading to persistent stockouts unless overridden by explicit parameters.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a critical state with no arrivals for 8 consecutive periods (P34-P41). Total confirmed lost inventory is 665 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). The current 'In-transit' of 1105 units includes these 665 lost units plus the order from P40 (440 units). Consequently, the actual effective pipeline is only 440 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1105 units from the base stock, it will not place any new orders despite persistent stockouts. To counter this, I am using 'explicit' parameters to force the system to acknowledge the need for inventory. Recent demand (P36-P41) has been lower (avg ~75), but over the last 15 periods, it averages ~93. Given the Lead Time (L) volatility (historically up to 3), I will set L=3. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*93 \u2248 372. sigma_hat is set at 60 to protect against demand spikes during the delivery lag.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Supply chain remains stalled (8 periods without arrivals). Effective pipeline is 440 units; total phantom \u2018in-transit\u2019 inventory is 665 units (confirmed lost). Explicit overrides remain necessary to bypass backend pipeline logic errors.

The total in-transit units (1105) are heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory' (confirmed lost shipments: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, totaling 665 units). The effective pipeline is actually 440 units (the order from P40). Because the OR backend ignores lost shipments and uses 'In-transit' as a deduction from the order quantity, it will continue to under-order or not order at all unless we use explicit overrides. Recent demand (P38-P42) has averaged 84 units. To ensure we have enough stock once the pipeline clears, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to target a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) exposure period (3+1=4 periods) plus a safety buffer, while ignoring the 665 lost units. I am maintaining L=3 as the planning horizon to balance potential delivery delays without over-ordering excessively if the crisis resolves.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: No arrivals for 9 consecutive periods. Effective pipeline is 440 units (P40 order); remaining 665 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost and must be bypassed via explicit parameter settings to avoid stockout persistence caused by backend logic.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the 440-unit order from Period 40 finally arrived (L=3), ending a prolonged 9-period arrival drought. This confirms that while the supply chain suffers from frequent lost shipments, it is not permanently stalled. The total confirmed lost inventory remains 665 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24). The current 'In-transit' figure is 1072 units, which includes these 665 lost units and the 407 units ordered in Period 43. Therefore, the true effective pipeline consists only of the 407 units from Period 43. With On-hand inventory at 322 units and demand averaging ~100-110 units, we have enough stock for ~3 periods. I will use 'explicit' values to bypass the backend's 'In-transit' calculation (which overcounts by 665 units). I am setting mu_hat to cover 4 periods (L+1 with L=3) at a slightly elevated rate of 115 units/period to account for recent demand volatility, and sigma_hat conservatively to handle the lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Supply chain flow resumed with the arrival of the Period 40 order (L=3). Effective pipeline is (In-transit - 665 lost units). Current effective pipeline is 407 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain flow has partially resumed with the arrival of the Period 40 order (440 units) in Period 43 (L=3). However, the system's 'In-transit' count (1072 units) is severely inflated by 665 units of confirmed lost inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24). The actual effective pipeline is 407 units (the order from P43). Current on-hand inventory is 252 units. Demand has averaged approximately 102 units over the last 10 periods (P35-P44). Given the 252 units on hand and 407 units in effective transit, the current total inventory (659) is sufficient to cover approximately 6+ periods of demand, which is well above the (L+1) requirement for L=3. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1072 in-transit units and potentially halting all future orders (which it will do because it believes the pipeline is full), I must maintain 'explicit' control to ensure we keep stock levels aligned with the effective pipeline, not the phantom one. I am setting L=3 to account for the upper bound of observed lead times.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Supply chain flow confirmed operational (P40 order arrived). Total confirmed lost inventory remains 665 units, which continues to inflate the backend's in-transit calculation. Effective pipeline is (Current In-transit - 665).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain flow has resumed with the arrival of orders from Period 40 (L=3) and Period 43 (L=2). However, the system's 'In-transit' calculation is still inflated by 665 units that were confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24). Current on-hand inventory is 596 units, which is sufficient to cover 5-6 periods of demand at the recent average of ~100 units/period. The objective now is to maintain this safety stock while accounting for the backend's significant overestimation of pipeline inventory. Since L=2.5 on average and demand is stable, a base stock targeting roughly 400-500 units (L+1 periods) is appropriate. Because the backend thinks there are 665 units in-transit plus 596 on-hand (total 1261), it will not place any new orders unless parameters are extremely high. Since we currently have high on-hand stock and no more periods remain to see the results of a new order (Lead Time \u2265 2, Game Ends P50), we will use 'default' or 'recent' parameters to allow the on-hand inventory to serve the remaining demand, avoiding further holding costs.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain flow has stabilized following the arrival of orders from Period 40 (L=3) and Period 43 (L=2). On-hand inventory is healthy at 508 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 665 units is entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24), meaning the actual pipeline is zero. However, since the current on-hand inventory (508) is sufficient to cover approximately five periods of demand (recent 10-period mean ~101), and there are only four periods remaining in the simulation (P47-P50), no further orders are required. The priority is now to minimize holding costs by selling down the existing stock. I will use 'explicit' parameters to account for the phantom in-transit units and ensure the base stock calculation does not trigger unnecessary replenishment, while maintaining a safe buffer for the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain operationality regained with L=2 and L=3 observed in P45 and P43. Existing on-hand inventory (508 units) is sufficient to cover remaining simulation demand until P50. Total 'In-transit' units in the system (665) remain confirmed losses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $752.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 445 units. Historical demand data shows a stabilization around 100-110 units per period. With only 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), the total expected demand is approximately 300-330 units. The 445 units currently on hand are sufficient to cover this remaining demand without any further orders. The 665 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed losses from previous supply chain failures and should be ignored. Since the cost to hold inventory is $1.0/unit while the profit is $19/unit, and we already have a surplus that exceeds expected demand until the end of the simulation, the goal is to prevent the OR backend from placing any new orders. I will use 'default' lead time (2) and set 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' to very low explicit values to ensure the base stock calculation (which looks at on-hand + pipeline) doesn't trigger a replenishment, given that 445 >> 0.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 400 units. The historical demand average sits around 101-107 units per period. Since only one period remains (Period 50) after the current decision, the existing 400 units are more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the final period (likely < 150 units). Consequently, no further orders are necessary. The 'In-transit' figure of 665 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) as detailed in the carry-over history, so the effective pipeline is zero. Given the game ends at Period 50, ordering now would only incur acquisition costs without any opportunity to sell the stock, as the inventory would arrive at the earliest during Period 50 or 51 (after the game concludes). Parameters are set to maintain a zero-order signal.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final period of the simulation. Current on-hand inventory is 322 units, which is significantly more than the mean demand of ~100 units observed in recent periods. Since this is the end of the game, any additional orders would only incur holding costs and contribute to dead stock (inventory remaining after demand resolution in Period 50). The supply chain resumed operation with lead times of 2-3 periods for the P40 and P43 orders, but total 'In-transit' remains inflated by 665 units of confirmed lost inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). No further ordering is required to maximize the total reward.
