The average demand across these five historical periods is approximately 109 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now in Period 1 will arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 4. In the meantime, I have zero on-hand inventory to satisfy demand in Periods 1, 2, and 3. My primary goal is to establish a pipeline to meet future demand while minimizing holding costs. Since lead time (L) is 2, I need to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods to ensure stock availability once the first shipment arrives. Based on the historical average of 109 units per period, 3 periods of demand equates to approximately 327 units.

P1 (ordered P1, arrived P4) and P4 (ordered P4, arrived P7) confirm L=3. The P2 order (110 units) should have arrived at P5 conclude; it is now Period 8 and it has not arrived.

Recent observations (P38-P40) show highly efficient 1-period actual lead times, though historical data shows a high frequency of lost shipments and occasional 3-period lead times. On-hand inventory is currently 119 units. The active pipeline consists of orders from P37 (130 units) and P40 (100 units). However, the order from P37 is now 4 periods old without arrival; based on the established pattern where orders not arriving by the 4th period are essentially lost, I am discounting P37 entirely. The legacy 1115 units in-transit are also confirmed lost. Thus, the reliable pipeline only contains the P40 order (100) arriving in P41. Expected stock for P41 demand resolution is 119 (on-hand) + 100 (arriving) = 219 units.
