Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we start with 0 on-hand inventory and no in-transit units for 'chips(Regular)'. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data shows five periods with an average demand of 108.8 units (76, 130, 159, 101, 78). I will initialize parameters using the default methods, which utilize all available historical data. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50. Using default parameters allows the OR backend to establish a baseline base-stock level that covers the review period plus the promised lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). No anomalies or changepoints are detected yet as we are at the start of the game.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 168 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start observation. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 168 units in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 115 (higher than the provided historical average of ~109). Historical demand samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) show high volatility (std \u2248 35). Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50, which targets the median demand. Since we only have one period of live data and the historical samples, I will use 'recent_N' for demand with N=6 (5 historical + 1 live) to capture the recent mean, and keep L at the promised 2 periods using 'default'.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been P1: 115, P2: 109 (from conclude messages), while the pre-game samples showed a slightly different pattern (76, 130, 159, 101, 78). The average demand across these 7 samples is approximately 109.5 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (168 units) and P2 (162 units) are currently in transit (total 330). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase. Since on-hand is currently 0 and we have already missed demand in P1 and P2 (sold=0), we need to maintain a robust base stock to recover and meet upcoming demand. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=5) to capture the trend of the last few periods including the pre-game samples and the two actual periods observed. I will keep the lead time at the promised default of 2 until we see the first arrival confirmation in a 'conclude' message.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (168 units), Period 2 (162 units), and Period 3 (8 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 Start (Period 3 conclude). However, the history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 3 conclude, meaning the Period 1 order is delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and all units (338) are in-transit. Demand has been relatively stable (115, 109, 116, avg ~113). Since no stock has arrived yet, we have experienced 100% lost sales. I will set L to 3 to account for the observed delay and use the mean of all 5 available demand samples (Period 1-5 from the provided context: 76, 130, 159, 101, 78; mean = 108.8) to stabilize the forecast, as the initial samples show higher variance than the game history. mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean = (1+3)*108.8 = 435.2. sigma_hat will be based on the standard deviation of all samples (~35.6) scaled by sqrt(1+L), which is ~71.2.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Historical demand for the first four observed periods was 115, 109, 116, and 107 (average ~111.75). The current on-hand inventory is 69 units. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 260 units, which includes orders from Period 2 (162 units) and Period 4 (98 units). Lead time analysis: Order from Period 1 arrived at Period 4 (L=3), and order from Period 3 arrived at Period 4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. Since lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 3, I will set L to 2 (promised/average). Demand is stable around 112 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this stable regime, and 'default' for sigma_hat as the variance is relatively low. mu_hat will target demand over (L+1) = 3 periods, approximately 336 units.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 115, 109, 116, 107, 107 (average: ~111). The promised lead time is 2. However, look at the arrival history: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time 3), and Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time 1). Period 2 order (162 units) has not arrived as of Period 5 conclude, meaning it has been in transit for 4 periods already (placed P2, now starting P6), suggesting a possible loss or extreme delay. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 267. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed longer lead time of the larger P1 shipment and the delay of P2. For demand (mu_hat), the samples are very stable around 111; I will use the mean of all 5 samples (110.8) multiplied by (1+L) = 4, resulting in 443.2. For sigma_hat, the demand is very stable (std approx 4), so I will use an explicit value reflecting low volatility across the lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability observed: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, P2 is overdue (4+ periods).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 109 units (last 6 periods range: 99-116). Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to shipping delays. Lead time observation: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P2 (ordered in Period 2) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. Promised lead time is 2. To account for this volatility and the missing P2 stock, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to increase the pipeline safety buffer. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 6 to capture the stable mean of ~109. Sigma_hat is set to 15 (explicit) because the historical standard deviation is low (approx 6), but given the stockout and lead time uncertainty, a slightly higher volatility estimate will help the OR backend maintain a higher base stock to recover from the current zero-inventory state.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: P2 shipment (ordered Period 2) confirmed missing/lost (5 periods elapsed with no arrival); Lead time mean excluding lost shipments is 2 periods but variance is high (1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Historical demand (P1-P7) averages 101.8 units/period, but Period 7 saw a significant drop to 58 units. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (avg ~88) to adapt to this potential shift while maintaining some buffer. Lead time (L) is unstable: P1 and P4 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P2 (ordered P2) is confirmed lost. My carry-over insight notes the missing shipment and variable lead times (mean 2.33, range 1-3). I will set L to 'explicit' with a value of 2.33 to acknowledge the average delay beyond the promised 2 periods without being overly pessimistic. Sigma_hat will use recent_N=5 to capture the higher volatility seen in earlier periods. On-hand is 40, and in-transit is 338 (P5, P6, P7 orders), covering approximately 3-4 periods of demand at current rates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the context shows a stabilization of demand following a higher initial phase. Demand over the last 3 periods (P6-P8) has averaged 72 units, compared to the overall average of ~97. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect this lower current demand regime. Regarding lead times, we have observed values of 1, 3, 3, and 1, with one lost shipment (P2). The average of converged shipments is 2.0 periods, which matches the promised lead time, so I will use 'calculate' for L. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility without being overly influenced by the very high initial demand variance. The backend will use these to calculate a base stock. With 39 on-hand and 280 in-transit (orders from P6, P7, and P8), the system likely has enough pipeline to cover the near-term, but these parameters will ensure the OR engine maintains an appropriate buffer against further lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Average demand decreased from ~111 to ~60 (-46%) over the last three periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Reviewing the history: demand shifted lower starting at Period 7. The last three periods (P7-P9) recorded demands of 58, 59, and 77, averaging 64.6, compared to the initial periods which averaged ~110. Lead times are highly variable: we have seen 1-period arrivals (P3, P7) and 3-period arrivals (P1, P4, P5). Importantly, P2 (ordered Period 2) is definitively lost, and P6 (ordered Period 6, now 4 periods late) is also likely lost. Because the backend 'In-transit' figure of 280 units still includes these lost shipments (P2=162 units and P6=118 units), the OR engine will mistakenly believe we are overstocked and stop ordering. To force the engine to order and compensate for the 280 'phantom' units that will never arrive, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I'll set mu_hat = (forecasted demand for review+lead time) + (lost units). With L=2, review+lead = 3 periods. Forecasted demand = 65 * 3 = 195. Lost units = 162 + 118 = 280. Total mu_hat = 475. I will set L to 2 (promised) as it remains the central tendency despite the high variance.

Carry-over insight: P6 shipment (118 units ordered Period 6) confirmed missing/lost (4 periods elapsed); Total lost inventory currently recorded in pipeline: 280 units (P2 and P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 10 periods, there have been significant inventory stockouts and lead time reliability issues. We have identified two lost shipments: Period 2 (162 units) and Period 6 (118 units). The 'In-transit' figure is currently 456 units (P10: 176, plus the presumed lost units of 162 and 118). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the target base stock, it will under-order if it believes these 280 lost units are coming. However, I cannot manually subtract them; I must adjust the parameters to force an order. Demand has been volatile: Periods 1-6 averaged ~109, Periods 7-9 dropped to ~65, then Period 10 spiked to 146. This suggests high volatility or a and potential return to a higher demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the recent spike while acknowledging the low-demand dip. For L, although the promised lead time is 2, the actual observed lead times (3, 1, 3, 3, 1) average about 2.2; I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average valid arrivals. To account for the lost stock and high stockout risk (current on-hand is 0), I will set an explicit, higher sigma_hat to increase the safety stock buffer and partially override the 'pipeline' deduction by increasing the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Demand volatility confirmed: Periods 7-9 averaged ~65, but Period 10 spiked to 146, suggesting a possible return to high demand or high variance regime.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the system is facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) of 456 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments: P2 (162 units, Period 2) and P6 (118 units, Period 6) are now 10 and 6 periods overdue respectively and must be considered lost. True pipeline inventory is effectively 176 units (ordered Period 10). Lead times remain erratic, varying between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue using an explicit L=2 estimate. Regarding demand, following a low-demand regime (Periods 7-9 avg ~65), Period 10 spiked to 146 and Period 11 was 99. The average of the last 5 periods (77, 59, 58, 146, 99) is approximately 88. I will set mu_hat based on these last 5 samples to capture the recent volatility and the apparent shift away from the low-demand valley while acknowledging the high variance by using an explicit sigma_hat. This approach aims to replenish stock sufficiently despite the lost orders and high demand uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: True pipeline inventory is significantly lower than reported due to lost shipments: P2 (162 units) and P6 (118 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 280 ghost units in transit.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the reported 'In-transit' inventory of 280 units consists entirely of lost shipments: Period 2 (162 units, 11 periods ago) and Period 6 (118 units, 7 periods ago). Since the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, these 'ghost' units prevent any new orders from being placed. To bypass this, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at 110 units per period (returning to the pre-drop mean after the Period 10 spike of 146 and Period 12 demand of 103). With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the system needs to cover 3 periods of demand (330 units). To force an order despite the 280 units of ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the expected coverage to bridge the gap created by the lost shipments. Setting mu_hat to 600 (approx. twice the required coverage) should trigger a replenishment order of roughly 320 units (600 - 280), ensuring we don't stock out while waiting for new arrivals.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory Situation: Current on-hand is 0 following a stockout in Period 13 where demand (157) exceeded on-hand (73). Pipeline inventory is reported as 527. However, historical evidence (Carry-over insights) confirms Period 2 (162 units) and Period 6 (118) are lost, totaling 280 units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 247 units (ordered Period 13), which is not expected until Period 15/16. Demand Analysis: Demand has returned to a high-volatility, high-volume regime. Recent samples (P10: 146, P11: 99, P12: 103, P13: 157) average 126.25, significantly higher than the P7-P9 era (~65). Lead Time Analysis: Observed lead times are 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2. The average is 2.16. I will use L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the 'lost' pipeline units. To recover from the current stockout and bridge the gap until the P13 order arrives, I need the OR backend to order immediately. By setting mu_hat high (based on the recent 4-period mean of 126.25 * (1+L)), the backend will see the current effective inventory (reported 527 - lost 280 = 247) as insufficient to cover the risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Period 13 demand (157) confirms a return to a high-volume regime (Avg P10-P13 = 126.25). Total lost inventory in pipeline remains 280 units (P2 & P6).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently reporting an in-transit inventory of 527 units (P2: 162, P6: 118, P13: 247). However, history confirms that P2 and P6 (totaling 280 units) are lost, meaning true pipeline inventory is only 247 units. At the start of Period 15, we have 0 on-hand inventory. Demand has stabilized into a high-volatility regime; while Period 14 dipped to 80, the previous four periods averaged ~126. Given the lost shipments and the 2-period promised lead time, we must ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead-time window plus current period demand (L+1). I am setting L=2 (promised) to trigger orders, mu_hat=384 (representing (2+1)*128 to reflect the recent high-demand regime), and sigma_hat=55 (sqrt(3)*32) to account for high variance and protect against stockouts which have been frequent.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and high demand volatility. Demand in the last two periods was 80 and 119, following a high of 157. The average demand across the last 6 periods (P10-P15) is approximately 117 units. The lead time has been observed at 1, 2, and 3 periods, with a significant issue regarding lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (162 units) and P6 (118 units) are confirmed lost (ghost inventory), totaling 280 units that the OR engine incorrectly counts as pipeline inventory. The current 'In-transit' is 527 units, but the true physical pipeline is 527 - 280 = 247 units (which is exactly the P13 order). Since P13 was ordered with a promised lead time of 2, it should have arrived in P15. Its absence in the P15 conclude message suggests a lead time of at least 3 periods or another lost shipment. To compensate for the 280 ghost units and the current stockout, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1=4) period window: Mean Demand (117) * 4 = 468. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 280 ghost units, I add them back to the requirement: 468 + 280 = 748. Setting mu_hat to 748 ensures the backend sees a need for more inventory despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. L is set to explicit 3 to reflect the current delay of the P13 order.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: True pipeline inventory verified as 247 units (Order P13); 280 units (P2, P6) remain lost 'ghost' units. P13 order is now overdue (3+ periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-75.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe an on-hand inventory of 161 units (remaining after P16's demand of 86). The reported in-transit amount of 501 units is highly misleading. Based on historical data, Order P2 (162 units) and Order P6 (118 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 280 units that will never arrive. Additionally, Order P13 (247 units) arrived in Period 16. Subtracting these from the total (501 - 280 - 0 currently arriving) leaves Order P16 (221 units) in transit. Thus, the 'true' pipeline inventory is 221 units. Lead times for concluded orders have been 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3 periods (Average: 2.28). I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent delays. Demand has stabilized into a high-volatility regime with a recent mean (P10-P16) of approximately 113 units per period. To ensure the backend calculates an appropriate base stock covering (L+1) or 4 periods of demand, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this current regime's behavior while the system's internal logic handles the lost unit reconciliation through the explicit L adjustment.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Order P13 (247 units) successfully arrived after 3 periods. Confirmed 'ghost' inventory persists at 280 units (P2, P6). Current demand regime (P10-P16) average is 112.8 units.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current state transition: The system shows 286 units on-hand and 280 units in-transit. Based on historical data (Carry-over insights and Game History), the 280 units in-transit are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P2: 162 units, P6: 118 units) that will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory from its order calculation; to counter this, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to ensure the backend generates an order when needed, accounting for the 280 unit deficit. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=8) to capture the current demand regime (Periods 10-17 average: 110.75), and 'explicit' for L to account for the high lead-time variance recently observed (range 1-3). Given on-hand inventory is currently high (286), the backend will likely not order this period, which is appropriate given the current regime mean.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: On-hand inventory now fully replenished by P16 arrival; demand regime remains stable around 110-112 units (P10-P17 mean = 110.75). Pipeline inventory still contains 280 'ghost' units from P2 and P6.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the system shows 248 units on-hand and 280 units in-transit. However, the in-transit units are confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (162 units) and Period 6 (118 units). Because these 'ghost units' will never arrive but are included in the OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), the backend will under-order unless the pipeline is corrected or demand parameters are inflated. The demand regime has stabilized since Period 10, with an average demand of approximately 103 units per period (P10-P18). Current on-hand inventory (248) is sufficient for roughly 2.4 periods. Given the ghost inventory of 280 units, I must use 'explicit' methods to ensure the backend sees a target base stock that accounts for these lost units. I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I will use an explicit value calculated as (L+1) * Mean_Demand + Total_Ghost_Units. (3 * 103) + 280 = 589. This forces the base stock high enough to offset the 280-unit pipeline deficit and maintain the desired service level despite the lost shipments. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=9, covering the Period 10-18 regime) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Pipeline inventory correction required: 280 units (from P2 and P6 orders) are permanently lost; explicit mu_hat used to offset these 'ghost' units in the OR calculation.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a lower-volume regime compared to mid-game spikes, with an average demand of approximately 72 units over the last three periods (P17-P19). The system reports 341 units in-transit, but 280 units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost 'ghost' units. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is only 61 units (the order from P19). The on-hand inventory is 180 units. To account for the 280 units of ghost inventory that the OR backend erroneously includes in its 'on-hand + pipeline' calculation, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. This value (600) is calculated to ensure the backend sees a required base stock high enough to trigger the necessary ordering, effectively offsetting the 280-unit deficit (Base Stock - (On-hand + Reported Pipeline) + Offset). I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to fluctuate, with Period 20 seeing a return to a high-volume state (122 units) compared to the low of Period 18 (38 units). The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 101.5 units, which serves as a stable baseline for forecasting. Regarding the pipeline, there is a persistent inventory discrepancy: orders from Period 2 (162 units) and Period 6 (118 units) are permanently lost (ghost units), totaling 280 units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its 'pipeline inventory' calculation. To counteract this 'ghost' inventory, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the target base stock (\u03bc\u0302) as (1 + lead_time) * average_demand. Using L=2 and mean=101.5, the base stock is 304.5. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 280-unit ghost inflation, I add 280 to this target, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 584.5. This ensures the system maintains enough physical stock to meet the (L+1) period demand while ignoring the nonexistent units in transit. Lead time remains variable (1-3 periods), so I maintain the default L=2 to balance responsiveness.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is out of stock (On-hand: 0). The reported in-transit inventory of 527 units is heavily inflated by 280 'ghost units' from Period 2 (162) and Period 6 (118) which are confirmed lost. Thus, the real pipeline is only 247 units (Orders from P19, P20, P21). Demand has returned to a high-volume state, with recent periods (P20-P21) averaging 136 units, significantly higher than the previous high-volume average of ~112. I am adjusting mu_hat to an explicit value of 408 (consisting of 3 periods \xd7 136 avg demand) to account for this surge and to force the OR backend to order more aggressively. This explicit mu_hat also helps offset the 280-unit 'ghost' inventory which would otherwise cause the system to stop ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Average demand increased significantly to approximately 136 units (P20-P21). Confirming ghost inventory of 280 units persists at P22.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 Status: On-hand inventory is 0 after stockouts in Periods 21 and 22. In-transit inventory is 527 units, but this includes 280 units confirmed as lost (Orders P2/P6). The effective pipeline is 247 units (P19, P20, P21). The demand regime has shifted upwards starting at Period 20, with the last three periods averaging 132 units (122, 150, 124). Lead times show high variance (1-3 periods), so I use L=2 (promised) while adjusting mu_hat. To overcome the OR backend's inability to ignore 'ghost' inventory (280 lost units), I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Using the recent mean of 132 units/period, the target base stock is approximately 396 units. To force an order that accounts for the 280 units of ghost inventory, I set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 280' results in a desirable order volume. However, because the backend is capped and uses base stock logic, setting mu_hat explicitly to the target base stock (approx. 400-500) ensures the system attempts to reach that level despite the ghost units. I will use a high explicit mu_hat to ensure inventory replenishment given the current stockout.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, on-hand inventory is 40. Historical data reveals two major challenges: First, 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 280 units (lost orders P2 and P6) which the OR backend incorrectly counts as incoming stock. Second, a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 20 (Avg P20-P23 = 135.5 units/period). Lead times remain volatile (ranging 1-3 periods), with recent arrivals for P20 (3 periods) and P21 (2 periods). To prevent stockouts caused by the OR engine's 'ghost' inventory perception (In-transit: 494 units, of which 280 are nonexistent, leaving only 214 units real pipeline), I am using an explicit mu_hat. This mu_hat is calculated to cover approximately 3 periods of demand (L+1 with L=2) at the current regime (~136 units/period) plus an offset of 280 units to negate the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline subtraction: (3 * 136) + 280 = 688. This ensures the OR engine places an order that accounts for both the demand spike and the missing units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains high (Period 20-23 average: 135.5). Ghost inventory (P2, P6) continues to distort the reported 'In-transit' metric by 280 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit quantity is 648 units, but this includes 280 units from P2 and P6 that are confirmed lost ('ghost units'). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 368 units (648 - 280). To ensure the OR engine orders correctly despite these ghost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The demand regime has shifted upwards since Period 20, with an average demand of 135.5 units (P20-P24). With a promised lead time of 2 (L=2), the target base stock is meant to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. My demand forecast for 3 periods is 135.5 * 3 = 406.5 units. However, to account for the 280 ghost units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its 'on-hand + in-transit' calculation, I must inflate mu_hat by 280 units. Target mu_hat = 406.5 + 280 = 686.5. This allows the OR engine's formula (base_stock - reported_pipeline) to result in a physical order that considers only the 368 real units in transit. Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current demand volatility.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current on-hand inventory is 60 units. The reported in-transit inventory is 534 units, but this includes 280 'ghost' units from lost orders P2 (162 units) and P6 (118 units) that have never arrived. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 254 units (orders from P24 and P25). The demand regime has shifted since Period 20, with an average demand of approximately 126.8 units (P20-P25: 122, 150, 124, 146, 122, 93). Lead times remain variable, averaging 2.33 periods over the last 6 arrivals (3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2). To account for the 280 units of ghost inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock calculation (effectively causing it to under-order), I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. Calculation: Projected required base stock for (L+1=3) periods is ~380 units. The backend subtracts pipeline (534) from base stock. To offset the -280 error, I set mu_hat to a value that forces the order to bridge the gap. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 500, I ensure the backend targets a high enough base stock to trigger an order despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P20-P25) at an average of 126.8 units per period. Ghost inventory remains at 280 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Reported In-transit is 534 units, but this includes 280 units from lost shipments (P2 and P6), making the 'real' pipeline 254 units (orders from P24 and P25). Demand analysis shows the most recent regime (P20-P26) has stabilized at an average of 120.9 units (122, 150, 124, 146, 122, 93, 99). 

Lead Time: The average observed lead time is approx 2.2 periods, but there is high variance (1-3 periods). 

Adjustment Strategy: To account for the 280 units of 'ghost' inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate mu_hat. The backend calculates order as: min(base_stock - (Real_Pipeline + 280), cap). To offset the -280 reduction, I add 280 to the target base_stock by using an explicit mu_hat. 

Target mu_hat calculation: (1 + L) * average_demand + Ghost_Units. 
With L=2 and Avg=121, expected base_stock demand component is 3 * 121 = 363. 
Inflated mu_hat = 363 + 280 = 643. 
I will use explicit sigma_hat based on the recent regime standard deviation (~20) scaled for L=2: sqrt(3)*20 \u2248 35.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the system reports On-hand: 0 and In-transit: 643 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, orders P2 (162 units) and P6 (118 units) are confirmed lost, meaning the 'ghost' inventory of 280 units must be subtracted. This leaves a valid pipeline of 363 units (P24, P25, and P27). The demand regime has stabilized since Period 20, with a recent average of approximately 119 units (P20-P27). To account for the 280-unit deficit in the OR's perception of the pipeline, I set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*mean + ghost_offset. With L=2, (3 * 119) + 280 = 637. This forces the backend to place an order that treats the 280 lost units as non-existent inventory. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current volatility of the stable regime.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 29 shows 0 units on-hand and 643 units reported as In-transit. Historical analysis from Carry-Over Insights confirms that 280 units (from orders in Period 2 and Period 6) are 'ghost' units that will never arrive. Thus, the effective pipeline is 643 - 280 = 363 units. This effective pipeline consist of orders from Period 24 (154), Period 25 (39), and Period 27 (109). Demand has shown high volatility recently: while the P20-P25 average was 126.8, the most recent three periods (P26-P28) averaged 87.0. Given the current stockout and the need for the OR engine to account for the 280-unit reporting error in the pipeline, I use an explicit mu_hat. This is calculated to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1 = 3) at a conservative rate of 115 units/period (blending recent low demand with the previous high regime) plus the 280-unit 'ghost' correction. This 625 target ensures the backend places an order that recognizes the true inventory deficit. L is set to calculated to reflect the high variance observed (1-3 periods).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized but volatile, with a recent average (P20-P29) of approximately 113.9 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' metric of 534 units is heavily distorted by 280 'ghost units' (P2 and P6) which are confirmed lost. This means the actual functional pipeline is only 254 units (534 - 280). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these ghost units, mu_hat must be set explicitly high to offset the 280 units of phantom supply. Setting mu_hat explicitly to incorporate (1+L) * mean_demand + 280. With an estimated L=2 and mean demand ~114, functional base stock should be ~342. Adding the 280 ghost offset, I set mu_hat to 622. Sigma_hat is calculated for a 3-period window (1.73 * std) to manage the observed volatility.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we face 0 on-hand inventory and a distorted 'In-transit' figure of 622 units. Crucially, 280 of these units (from P2 and P6) are documented 'ghost' units that will never arrive. The adjusted pipeline inventory is actually 342 units (622 - 280). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these ghost units, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to provide a base stock target that overrides the perceived pipeline surplus. Looking at recent demand, the mean for P20-P30 is approximately 107.2 units. Using L=2 (promised), a (L+1) window requires covering 3 periods of demand (~321 units). However, given the lost sales and 0 on-hand, I will set a target base stock that forces an order. The OR engine calculates order = max(0, base_stock - in_transit). To compensate for the 280 ghost units, I set mu_hat explicitly to the expected (L+1) demand + 280. Expected 3-period demand (107.2 * 3) is 322 + 280 = 602. I will set mu_hat to 610 to ensure the backend places an order to cover current stockouts and upcoming demand while ignoring the 280 lost units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Reported In-transit is 622, but this includes 280 units of 'ghost inventory' (P2 and P6) that were confirmed lost in earlier carry-over insights. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 342 units (622 - 280). No orders arrived in Period 31, and demand has shown significant variability recently (P30: 47, P31: 94). 

Strategy: To maintain the service level while accounting for the lost shipments, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. The calculation targets a demand for (L+1) periods. Using a rolling average of the most recent 6 periods (P26-P31: 99, 95, 67, 114, 47, 94), the average demand is 86. With L=2, the required coverage is 86 * 3 = 258 units. However, because the backend logic 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory' counts the 280 lost units as available, I must inflate mu_hat by 280 to neutralize them, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 538 (258 + 280). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect the current volatility.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 622 units. However, based on the carry-over insights and history, 280 units from Period 2 (162) and Period 6 (118) are confirmed permanently lost ('ghost inventory'). Additionally, we are waiting for deliveries from Period 24 (154 units, overdue), Period 25 (39 units), Period 27 (already arrived in P29), and Period 30 (88 units). The actual viable pipeline inventory is 622 - 280 = 342 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has trended lower recently, with an average of roughly 82 units over the last 6 periods (P27-P32). To compensate for the 280 units of ghost inventory that never arrive but still reduce the OR engine's order quantity, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. This is calculated as: Forecasted Demand x (1 + L) + Ghost Inventory. Recent demand mean ~82, L=2 (promised), so (82 * 3) + 280 = 526. This forces the OR backend to 'over-order' by exactly the amount of missing stock to maintain availability despite the distorted in-transit metric.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 0 on-hand inventory and 622 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 280 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost/ghost units, meaning the effective in-transit inventory is 342 units. Recent demand (P27-P33) has shifted to a lower regime, averaging approximately 85.3 units per period. The arrival from Period 30 (88 units) is currently expected during Period 34 (lead time of 3-4 periods is common). Given the high reported in-transit (even after subtracting ghost units) and the drop in demand mean, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the corrected pipeline inventory. I utilize an explicit L=2 (promised) to stabilize the baseline but adjust mu_hat to be conservative (approx 3 periods of demand at the recent mean of 85 = ~255), which will likely result in the OR backend placing a small or zero order to allow the pipeline to clear and on-hand inventory to reset, thus avoiding excessive holding costs given current stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: Average decreased from ~126 to ~85 (-32%) based on the last 7 periods (P27-P33). Missing/lost shipments (P2, P6) continue to inflate 'In-transit' inventory by 280 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 27, averaging 85 units per period. The current 'In-transit' figure of 622 units is heavily distorted by 280 'ghost units' from two historically lost shipments (Period 2: 162 units; Period 6: 118 units) that never arrived but remain in the pipeline calculation. To calculate the necessary order, the backend inventory balancing (base_stock - pipeline) must be corrected. At the current demand (avg=85) and standard lead time (L=2), the desired base stock is approximately (L+1) * 85 = 255. However, since the reported pipeline (622) is much higher than the target base stock, the OR backend would normally order 0. To force a replenishment order that overcomes the on-hand stockout (On-hand: 0), I use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I set mu_hat = (Target Base Stock + Ghost Units) = (3 * 85) + 280 = 535. This ensures the backend calculates an order requirement despite the 280 phantom units. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=8) to capture the volatility of the current demand regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 622 units in-transit, but 280 of these are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P2 and P6) that will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline inventory consists of the order from P24 (154 units), P25 (39 units), P27 (109 units), and P30 (88 units), totaling 390 units. However, we are currently at Period 36 and none of these have arrived since Period 29, suggesting a significant lead-time extension or further losses. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 27 (average ~85 units). To compensate for the 280 ghost units inflating the OR backend's inventory calculation, I will use an explicit mu_hat. Following the formula: base_stock = \u03bc\u0302(1+L) + z*\u03c3\u0302\u221a(1+L). Based on the 280 unit inflation and a lead time of 2, I need to set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom 280 units. I will use a conservative demand estimate of 90 units/period. With L=2, the required pipeline should be ~3-4 periods of demand (~360 units). Given current valid pipeline is ~390 units but heavily delayed, and 280 units are ghosts, the backend thinks pipeline is 670. I will set mu_hat to 190 (explicit) to force the backend to recognize the need for more inventory despite the ghost units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' metric (622 units) is severely inflated by historical 'ghost' inventory from failed shipments P2 and P6 (280 units total) and potentially overdue recent orders. Orders from P30 (88 units) and P24 (154 units) have exceeded their promised lead time (P24 is significantly overdue and potentially lost). The demand regime has stabilized following a decrease at P27; the average demand for the last 10 periods (P27-P36) is approximately 88.1 units. To correct for the 280 units of ghost inventory that the OR backend incorrectly assumes can satisfy demand, I use an explicit mu_hat adjustment. A base stock target should cover (L+1) periods. With lead time L=2, target = 3 * 88.1 \u2248 264. To offset the 280 ghost units, I add them to the target: 264 + 280 = 544. This forces the backend to place an order despite the high reported pipeline. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=10) to reflect local volatility (std dev of ~18, so 18 * sqrt(3) \u2248 31).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant inventory discrepancy due to 280 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 2 and 6) that remain in the 'In-transit' metric. Current In-transit is reported as 622, but the true actionable pipeline is 342 units (622 - 280). On-hand inventory is currently 0. Demand from Period 27 to 37 has averaged 87.7 units per period, showing a stabilized lower-demand regime compared to the Period 20-25 peak. To correct for the 280-unit ghost inventory, I must inflate mu_hat. The backend calculates order = base_stock - In-transit. By adding 280 units to the expected demand over the lead time (L=2, so 3 periods: 3 * 87.7 = 263), I ensure the OR engine targets the correct physical stock level. Using explicit mu_hat = 543 (calculated as 263 + 280) and recent_N for sigma to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Confirmed demand regime stability (P27-P37) at ~88 units/period. Persistent ghost inventory of 280 units continues to require manual offset in mu_hat calculations to prevent stockouts.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we are in a stable demand regime of approximately 88 units/period (P27-P38 mean \u2248 88). However, the system reports 0 on-hand inventory and 622 units in-transit. Based on historical data, this 'in-transit' figure contains 280 units from Period 2 and Period 6 that are confirmed lost ('ghost units'). Excluding these, the effective pipeline is 342 units. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory. If we allow the backend to use the inflated pipeline (622), it will order 0 units perpetually, causing stockouts. To mitigate this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) period (where L=2) as (2+1) * 88 = 264 units. To force the OR engine to place an order when the true pipeline (342) plus on-hand (0) is insufficient for the high service level required (profit=1, holding=1 -> 50% service level base, but the cap and safety stock logic apply), I must provide a mu_hat value that offsets the ghost inventory. Since the ghost inventory (280) is heavily suppressing orders, I set mu_hat to a value that reflects the desired base stock plus the ghost inventory (approx 264 + 280 = 544), adjusted to trigger replenishment. Given the massive overdue gap, L is set to 'calculate' to reflect historical variability.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 622 units. However, based on the chronic lack of arrivals and cumulative 'carry-over insights', 280 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed as permanent 'ghost' units. Furthermore, no arrivals have occurred since Period 29, meaning orders from Period 30 (88 units) and subsequent periods are either significantly delayed or lost. Currently, On-hand is 0 and demand is approximately 85-90 units per period (P27-P39 mean ~86). To prevent continued stockouts, I must force the OR backend to place a new order despite the inflated 'In-transit' metric. The OR engine calculates order = max(0, base_stock - pipeline_inventory), where pipeline_inventory = on_hand + in_transit. With on_hand=0 and in_transit=622, I need base_stock to exceed 622. Since profit=1 and holding_cost=1, q=0.5 and z=0, making base_stock = mu_hat. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 800 (calculated as roughly 9 periods of demand at 90 units/period) to overcome the 622 ghost/delayed units and trigger a reorder that accounts for the current demand regime and the high probability of further shipment losses.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at an average of approximately 88 units (P27-P40 mean = 88.3). On-hand inventory is 0, and the reported 'In-transit' inventory of 800 units is heavily distorted by long-standing 'ghost' orders (P2: 162 units, P6: 118 units, and potentially more recent un-concluded orders including the 178 from P40). However, the critical issue is the 280 units confirmed lost. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' to calculate order quantities (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). Since 'pipeline_inventory' includes the 280 ghost units, it under-orders. To fix this, I utilize an 'explicit' mu_hat. The adjustment is: mu_hat = (Expected demand over Review + Lead time) + (Ghost Inventory). Here, review+lead = 3 periods. Expected demand = 3 * 88 = 264. Adjustment = 280. Total mu_hat = 544. This forces the OR engine to order as if the ghost units do not exist. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=14) to reflect the current regime's volatility.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P27-P41) has averaged 87.5 units per period, with a slight uptick in the last two periods (115 each). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the reported 'In-transit' inventory is 800 units. However, this includes 280 units from orders P2 and P6 which were long ago confirmed as lost ('ghost' inventory). Therefore, the functional pipeline is 520 units (800 - 280), primarily consisting of the large order placed in Period 40 (178 units) and other subsequent attempts to stock. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3. I will continue using an explicit mu_hat based on the current regime (approx 88 per period) but must offset the 280-unit 'ghost' inventory. To correct for the backend's (In-Transit - 280) logic, and considering we need to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand (3 * 88 = 264 units), the explicit mu_hat is set to 544 (264 + 280) to neutralize the ghost units. Sigma_hat is set to default as the demand variance in the current regime is relatively stable.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the system reports 0 On-hand and 800 units In-transit. Based on Historical Insights, 280 units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed permanently lost 'ghost' units. Additionally, orders from P24 (154 units), P25 (39 units), P30 (88 units), and P40 (178 units) are currently undelivered, totaling 459 plausible units plus the 280 ghost units (Total: 739 reported). The discrepancy indicates a likely further loss or severe delay. Since P40 (178 units) was ordered 3 periods ago and has not arrived, and On-hand is 0, we are in a stockout. Demand has shifted back to a higher regime: the average for P40-P42 is 121 units, compared to the previous ~88. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture this pivot. To handle the 280 ghost units in the pipeline, I use 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculation: Required Base Stock = (1+L) * Forecast * ServiceLevel. With L=2, Forecast=121, and a high service level (~1.6 standard deviations for 50/50 profit/holding), Base Stock should be ~450. To force the OR backend to order despite 280 ghost units and ~459 plausible units in-transit (Total 739 reported), I set an explicit mu_hat = 1100. This ensures the backend sees (mu_hat - Pipeline) as positive (~1100 - 800 = 300) to trigger a replenishment order and recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40: Average demand increased from ~88 to ~121 (+37.5%) based on the last 3 periods (P40-P42). Persistent ghost inventory of 280 units (P2, P6) continues to distort pipeline metrics.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 44, we are managing the 'chips(Regular)' SKU with a promised lead time of 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 64 units following the arrival of the Period 40 order (178 units) in Period 43 (Actual LT=3). The reported 'In-transit' inventory is 922 units, but this includes 280 units from Period 2 and Period 6 that are confirmed 'ghost' inventory (permanently lost). Subtracting these, the real pipeline is 642 units (including the 300 ordered in Period 43). There is a confirmed demand regime shift starting at Period 40, where demand moved from ~88 to an average of ~119.25 across the last four periods (115, 115, 133, 114). To account for the 280-unit pipeline distortion in the OR backend's logic (which calculates order = base_stock - pipeline), I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. The calculation is: Target Base Stock (for L=3) = (1+3) * 120 = 480 plus a safety buffer (~1.5 * std dev of 15 * sqrt(4) = 45), totaling ~525. To offset the 280 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 525 + 280 = 805 units. This ensures the OR engine places an order sufficient to maintain local service levels despite the inflated pipeline metric.

Carry-over insight: Persistent ghost inventory of 280 units (P2, P6) continues to distort pipeline metrics in Period 44. Demand regime (P40-P43) stabilized at ~119 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 40, currently averaging 113.4 units over the last 5 periods (P40-P44). On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 922 units, but this includes 280 units from historical 'ghost' orders (P2: 162, P6: 118) that are confirmed lost. Adjusting for these, the true pipeline is 642 units (including the P43 order of 300 units). Lead times have fluctuated between 1-3 periods, with the most recent arrival (P40) taking 3 periods. To account for the 280-unit 'ghost' inflation in the OR backend's inventory check, I will increase the explicit mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand; with L set to 3, this is 4 periods. True demand needs ~454 units (113.4 * 4). Adding the 280 units to offset the backend's false pipeline assumption results in an explicit mu_hat of 734.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-132.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing a demand regime that recently shifted. While P40-P43 averaged 119 units, the last two periods (P44-P45) have shown lower demand (90, 84). Using a recent window (N=6) captures this transition, providing an average of ~108 units per period. The critical issue remains the 280 units of 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments P2 and P6, which still reside in the system's recorded 'In-transit' count of 622 (actual reliable in-transit is 342). Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (including ghosts) from the target base stock, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target by 280 units. This ensures the backend orders enough to cover actual demand despite the phantom inventory. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P40, P43) show a mean of 2.5 periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Reliable pipeline inventory is 342 units; 280 'ghost' units (P2, P6) continue to persist. Current demand regime (P40-P45) average is 108.5 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-70.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P40-P46) shows an average of 103.4 units, fluctuating from a high of 133 to a low of 73. This is lower than the initial P40-P43 average (~119), which prompted the large order in P43. Current on-hand inventory is 143 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 622 units is heavily distorted by 280 'ghost' units (orders from P2 and P6 that are long-lost). Therefore, the functional pipeline is 342 units (622 - 280). With 143 on-hand and 342 in functional transit, the system has 485 effective units. Given the current average demand of 103 units and a promised lead time of 2, the desired base stock is roughly (L+1)*demand = 3*103 = 309. Since 485 > 309, no new order is required. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 280 units of non-existent stock and potentially under-ordering in the future, I use 'explicit' mu_hat to control the order logic while accounting for the ghost inventory distortion.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Demand average for current regime (P40-P46) is 103.4 units/period, showing a slight softening from the P40-P43 peak. Functional pipeline is 342 units; ghost inventory remains 280 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-17.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a softening phase. Since the last documented regime shift at P40 (avg ~121), demand has consistently decreased: P44(90), P45(84), P46(73), P47(63). The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P43-P47) is ~84.8 units. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this downward trend and prevent excessive holding costs. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=8 to capture the volatility during this transition. Regarding inventory: the 'In-transit' metric of 622 units is heavily distorted by 280 'ghost' units from lost orders P2 (162) and P6 (118). The actual functional pipeline is 342 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these ghost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculation: Estimated Demand (1+L)*Mean = (1+2)*84.8 = 254.4. To offset the 280 ghost units, I add them to the mu_hat: 254.4 + 280 = 534.4. This ensures the base_stock calculation accounts for the fact that 280 units in the 'pipeline_inventory' subtraction will never arrive. Lead time remains consistent with the promised 2 periods (recent arrivals P43: 3 periods, P45: 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand softening trend confirmed: P43-P47 average is 84.8 units, down from the P40-P43 average of 119 (-28.7%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 49. On-hand inventory is 29 units. Reported 'In-transit' is 622 units, but this includes 280 'ghost' units (P2/P6) that will never arrive. The functional pipeline is 342 units (622 - 280). Demand is in a cooling phase: the average for the most recent regime (P43-P48) is 79.2 units, significantly lower than the P40-P43 peak of ~119. I will set L to 3 periods to account for observed arrival delays (recent orders have taken 2-3 periods). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current softening trend (period 43-48: 114, 90, 84, 73, 63, 51). Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat to offset the 280 ghost units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock (approx) = (1+L) * Mean = 4 * 79.2 = 316.8 units. To force the backend to account for the ghost inventory, I set mu_hat = (Target Base Stock + Ghost Inventory) / (1) = (316.8 + 280) = 596.8. This ensures the order logic doesn't starve the on-hand inventory due to non-existent pipeline units.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. Analysis of recent history confirms a sustained softening of demand. The average demand from Period 43 to Period 49 is 80 units/period, compared to the peak of 119 in the P40-P43 window. Inventory status: On-hand is 0. Reported in-transit is 622 units. However, persistent 'ghost' inventory of 280 units (lost orders P2 and P6) remains in the system. Thus, the reliable pipeline is 622 - 280 = 342 units. Despite 0 on-hand, 342 units are expected to arrive in the coming periods, which covers over 4 periods of demand at the current rate of ~80. The OR backend will see 'pipeline inventory' as 622. If I set mu_hat to the true demand forecast (~80 * 3 = 240), the backend will calculate order = max(0, 240 - 622) = 0. This is the desired outcome since we are currently over-leveraged in the pipeline even after accounting for losses. To ensure the backend doesn't over-order despite the ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the recent demand softening and allow the in-transit units to flush through. Lead time remains approximately 2-3 periods; 'default' (2) is sufficient as the pipeline is full.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening trend confirmed: P43-P49 average is 80 units/period, approximately 33% lower than the P40-P43 peak. Reliable pipeline (excluding 280 ghost units) is 342 units.
