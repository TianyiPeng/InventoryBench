Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a historical mean demand of approximately 108.8 units (samples: 76, 130, 159, 101, 78). Promised lead time (L) is 2. The critical demand coverage required for the base-stock policy is (L+1) = 3 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19:$1), the target service level is 95% (q = 19/20). I will use the 'default' methods to establish a baseline. The 'default' L uses the promised value (2), 'default' mu_hat calculates (1+2)*mean of all historical samples (~326), and 'default' sigma_hat calculates sqrt(3)*std dev. This provides a balanced start while we wait for the first 'conclude' message to verify actual lead times.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 168 units. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, we expect this order to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 168 units in transit. Demand in Period 1 was 115, which is significantly higher than the initial sample of 76 but aligns closer with the broader historical samples provided (Range: 76-159). Since we have only one period of actual game history, I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=3 to capture the recent upward trend in the provided sample data (76, 130, 159, 101, 78, and now 115). I will keep L at default (2) as no arrivals have occurred yet to suggest a lead time shift.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (168 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (making it visible in Period 4's start). The order placed in Period 2 (129 units) is expected during Period 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because initial stock was 0. Demand for the first 5 samples provided in the prompt (pre-game + history) are: 76, 130, 159, 101, 78. Current game history demand for P1 and P2 was 115 and 109 respectively. The average demand across these 7 points is approximately 110. Since we are waiting for the first lead-time cycle to conclude to confirm actual lead time, I will stick to the promised Lead Time (L=2) and use a recent window (N=5) for demand to capture the current mean, which accounts for the initial stock-out period's demand levels.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (168 units), Period 2 (129 units), and Period 3 (125 units). Following the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 1, 2, and 3. This means the Period 1 order is now overdue (it should have arrived by the start of Period 4). Total in-transit is 422 (168+129+125). Since no shipments have arrived yet, on-hand inventory remains 0, leading to lost sales. Demand has been relatively stable (115, 109, 116). I will maintain the promised lead time (L=2) for now but set demand parameters based on the observed mean (approx 113). The OR backend uses base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the consistent demand levels observed so far (mean ~113.3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1847.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4 conclude (observed at start of Period 5), we see two arrivals: Period 1 (lead time 3) and Period 3 (lead time 1). The average observed lead time is 2, which matches the promised lead time. The historical demand data provided (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) diverges slightly from the 'conclude' demand logs (115, 109, 116, 107), suggesting some noise or slightly different measurement. Averaging the 'conclude' demand logs (last 4 periods) gives a mean of 111.75. Given the target service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, the OR backend aims for high availability. Current on-hand is 186 and in-transit is 129 (total 315). With L=2 and mean demand ~112, the (L+1) horizon demand is ~336. The current inventory position is slightly below the expected requirement for the lead-time horizon. I will use 'calculate' for L to incorporate the observed lead-time variance, 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the consistent demand observed in the logs, and 'default' for sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1954.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with samples: 115, 109, 116, 107, 107 (Mean: 110.8). The promised lead time is 2, but observed actual lead times vary: Order 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Order 3 arrived in 1 period, suggesting a highly volatile supply chain or batching. Currently, on-hand inventory is 79, and in-transit is 283 (from orders in Period 2 and Period 5). The order from Period 2 (129 units) is now at lead_time=4 and has not arrived, which is concerning but not yet confirmed 'lost' given the previous 3-period arrival. To manage the current uncertainty, I will use the average demand (approx 111 units/period) and set L to 'calculate' to let the OR backend account for the observed lead time variance. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' as the current sample size is small and demand is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1501.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 6. Historical demand (P1-P6) is stable around an average of 109 units (115, 109, 116, 107, 107, 99). Lead time verification: P1 order arrived at P4 (L=3), P3 order arrived at P4 (L=1). The average observed lead time is 2, matching the promised lead time, but with significant variance. Currently, 433 units are in-transit (orders from P2, P5, and P6). P2 order (129 units) is now at L=5 and potentially lost or significantly delayed, as promised L=2. However, P5 and P6 orders are still within a reasonable window. To ensure the OR backend adequately covers demand given the stockout and lead-time uncertainty, I will use 'recent_N' for the last 5 demand samples (avg ~107.6) and keep L at the promised 2 (default) which compute a base stock for 3 periods of demand (~323 units). Since pipeline (433) > base stock, the backend will only order if the pipeline is discounted or if the cap allows. I will set the mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable demand regime observed since P1.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout scenario with 0 on-hand inventory and 433 units in-transit. Historic lead times have shown significant volatility: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and the order from P2 (129 units) is currently missing (now 6 periods since ordering, well past the promised lead time of 2). This suggests the P2 order may be lost or severely delayed. Orders from P5 (154 units) and P6 (150 units) are within the expected delivery window (L=2 or L=3). Recent demand has trended downward (avg ~101 overall, but P7 was significantly lower at 58). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is preferred. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (avg=2), but use recent demand observations (N=5) for mu_hat to account for the softening demand. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture historical variance, ensuring the safety stock covers potential lead time delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P1 L=3, P3 L=1. Order from Period 2 (129 units) is missing after 6 periods and likely lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1026.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant downward shift starting around Period 7. Mean demand for P1-P6 was ~109, while P7-P8 dropped to ~58.5. I am choosing N=3 for demand statistics to capture this recent cooling while acknowledging the volatility. Regarding lead times: the promised LT is 2, but we've seen L=3 (P1), L=1 (P3), and L=3 (P5). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (129 units) has still not arrived after 7 periods and is now confirmed as lost. This loss caused a stockout in P6/P7. The OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic still counts these 129 units as 'In-transit', which would lead it to under-order. To compensate, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to reflect the recent/average realistic lead time and ensure a higher base stock to buffer against the lost inventory being erroneously included in the pipeline. This helps the backend maintain a sufficient service level despite the phantom 'in-transit' stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg decreased from 109 to ~59 (-45%). P2 order (129 units) is confirmed lost after 7 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1401.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 7. The average demand across Periods 1-6 was approximately 108.8, while the average demand for the last three periods (P7-P9) is 64.7 (58, 59, 77). This represents a decrease of ~40%. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this lower volume and prevent overstocking. For lead time, the promised LT is 2, but observed LTs have been inconsistent (3, 1, 3, 1). The average observed lead time is 2, and since the variance is high, using the 'calculate' method (overall average) provides the best statistical anchor for the OR backend while the recent fluctuations balance out. We confirmed the P2 order of 129 units is lost, and the 'in-transit' count of 279 reflects the orders from Period 6 (150) and Period 9 (we see 279 in-transit, which comprises P6=150 and perhaps a previous or current order if P9 ordered units were not zero, though the history says 'ordered=0' for Period 9, the 'In-transit' figure 279 suggests P6 (150) is still out there plus a previous balance - likely the lost P2 order is still being counted by the system until it clears, or another order is pending). Regardless, with a lower demand regime, we need to lower the inventory target.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the inventory is at 0 units following a demand spike in Period 10 (146 units). Reviewing history, the demand regime shifted at Period 7 from an average of ~109 to a lower level, but Period 10 shows a significant upward spike, suggesting either a new high-demand regime or a temporary surge. The in-transit pipeline consists of 150 units from P6 (ordered 5 periods ago, likely lost based on previous P2 loss patterns) and 129 units still in transit from various periods. Observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (Average = 2). Given the stockout and the recent volatility/spike in demand, I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the lower demand of P7-P9 while accounting for the P10 spike, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that can buffer against back-to-back high-demand periods without over-ordering if Period 10 was an outlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike at Period 10 (146 units) following 3 periods of low demand (~65 avg). Possible secondary regime shift or outlier. Order from Period 6 (150 units) is now 5 periods overdue and potentially lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility. After a low-demand regime (Periods 7-9, avg ~65), demand spiked in Period 10 (146) and remained elevated in Period 11 (99). The average of the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 87.8. On-hand inventory is currently 0, largely due to missing/lost shipments. Period 2 order (129 units) and Period 6 order (150 units) are both significantly past the promised lead time of 2 periods and are presumed lost. In-transit inventory includes Period 11's order (95 units) and older entries that are likely ghosts. I will use recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture the upward trend and high variance from the last 5 periods. Lead time will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (actuals were 3, 1, 3, 1). This should increase the base stock to protect against stockouts given the current 0 on-hand status.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Order from Period 6 (150 units) is confirmed lost after 6 periods of non-arrival. Demand trend is recovering from the P7 low, averaging 88 units over last 5 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is currently experiencing a stockout (on-hand: 0) with 431 units in-transit. Demand has stabilized after the Period 7 drop, with the last 5 periods (P8-P12) averaging 96.8 units (59, 77, 146, 99, 103). The anomalous spike in P10 (146) suggests potentially higher volatility than the earlier stable period. Lead times have been inconsistent: observed actuals are 3, 1, 3, 1, with two confirmed lost shipments (P2 and P6). Given the promised lead time is 2, the average of observed lead times is indeed 2 ((3+1+3+1)/4). I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the 'recovery' demand level (approx 97 units/period) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last 5 samples. L is set to calculate to reflect the experienced variability over promised levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand has recovered from the Period 7 low, averaging 97 units over Periods 8-12. Orders from Period 2 and Period 6 are confirmed lost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced significant stockouts due to high demand and lost/delayed shipments. Looking at lead times, we see a pattern of instability: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1, P5 took 3, P8 took 1. The average lead time is 2, matching the promised lead time, but the variance is high. Two orders (P2 and P6) are confirmed lost. The current in-transit inventory (446 units) includes orders from P11 (95 units), P12 (57 units), and P13 (15 units). Based on recent history, P11 is due to arrive this period (P14). Demand has shifted upwards significantly: following a low period (P7-P8 avg 58), the last 5 periods (P9-P13) have averaged 116.4 units (77, 146, 99, 103, 157). I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture this recent recovery/spike and use an explicit lead time L=2. Setting mu_hat for L+1 periods (3 periods) at an average of 116.4 per period yields 349.2.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Periods 9-13 average 116.4 units, returning to levels seen in Periods 1-6 (avg 109). Stockout risk is high until P11 shipment arrives.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1505.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has recovered from a low-demand regime (Periods 7-8) back to standard levels. Over the last 6 periods (P9-P14), the average demand is 110.3 units, closely matching the early period average (~109). Inventory is critically low (15 units) with a high risk of stockout this period. Lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P11 arrived in 3 periods). Therefore, I am setting L=3 to ensure a higher safety buffer. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand recovery regime (P9-P14). The in-transit pipeline of 351 units (P12: 57, P13: 15, and P14's order) needs to be considered by the OR backend to prevent over-ordering once shipments eventually arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully returned to the initial baseline; Periods 9-14 average 110.3 units. Lead time remains volatile but generally clusters around a 3-period max (confirmed by P11 arriving in 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1368.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 16 with 0 on-hand inventory and 460 units in-transit. Demand has fully recovered from the Period 7 dip; the average demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 111.6 units, which aligns with the initial baseline (approx 110). However, the system is struggling with stockouts due to lost shipments (P2 and P6) and lead time volatility. Specifically, recent arrivals (P11 and P12 orders) both had a lead time of 3 periods, suggesting that while the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time is currently 3. I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=4 periods). For demand (mu_hat), the last 5 periods reflect the current recovered regime, so N=5 is used. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility during this recovery phase. This approach aims to build enough safety stock to mitigate the high service level requirement (profit/holding cost ratio \u2248 19) and recent supply instability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods for the last two arrivals (P11 arrived P14, P12 arrived P15). Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~111 units over the last 5 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently zero with high demand (avg ~101 over the last 10 periods, recovering from the P7 dip). The last three arrivals (P11-P13) all exhibited a lead time of 3 periods, suggesting that the actual lead time has stabilized at L=3, rather than the promised 2. The pipeline inventory (527 units) contains orders from P15 and P16, plus the legacy missing orders from P2 and P6 which are confirmed lost. My previous parameters were aiming for a recovery, but the 3-period lead time delay is causing stockouts. I will set L to 3 to align with recent observations. For mu_hat, I'll use the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the trend since the P7-P9 low, which reflects the current recovery/stabilization phase. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a conservative buffer against the observed volatility in both demand and lead times.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has consistently stabilized at 3 periods (observed for P11, P12, and P13 shipments arriving at P14, P15, and P16 respectively).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1558.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the shipment from Period 16 arrived early with an actual lead time of 1 period, whereas previous recent shipments (P11, P12, P13) consistently arrived with a lead time of 3 periods. This indicates a return to lead-time instability or a shorter lead-time regime. For Period 18, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the system is protected against the longer habitual delay observed, while maintaining high service levels given the current 0 on-hand inventory. Demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) has averaged 107.6 units, but excluding the P13 spike (157), the mean is closer to 95. However, since the baseline has generally returned to the P1-P6 levels, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilization around a mean of ~108 while accounting for the recent variance. This protects against stockouts during the current period of zero inventory while we wait for the 445 units in-transit to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains unstable: while P11-P13 had L=3, P16 arrived in 1 period. Demand has stabilized back to a mean of ~110 units (Periods 13-17 average 107.6).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory following a drop in demand to 38 units in Period 18. Despite this recent low, the long-term demand mean remains around 100-110 units. The lead time (L) has shown extreme volatility, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P16 arrived in 1, matching P8 and P3, while P11-13 arrived in 3). Because promised L=2 and actual L varies between 1 and 3, I will set L to 3 to be conservative and avoid stockouts, as the current in-transit (534) includes several orders (P15: 166, P18: 89) that have not yet arrived. The demand mu_hat is calculated using recent_N=6 to capture the recovery from the P7-P10 dip while acknowledging the P18 outlier (avg of P13-P18 is ~96). Sigma_hat uses the same window to capture the recent volatility. Setting L=3 ensures the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon, mitigating the risk of late arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand continues to fluctuate around a mean of 100, but Period 18 saw a significant dip to 38 units. Lead time remains bimodal (1 or 3 periods).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Demand has been volatile recently (P18: 38, P19: 68), diverging from the previous recovery mean of ~110. The last 5 periods (P15-P19) average 81.4 units, while the longer-term stabilized demand (P9-P17) was closer to 105. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this downward dip while maintaining enough safety stock for recovery. Lead time continues to be bimodal (1 or 3 periods). Since the backend uses Promised Lead Time (2) by default, and actual lead times bounce between 1 and 3, I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation covers the longer arrival window and helps recover from the current stockout. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased after Period 17: P18 and P19 show a significant drop (avg 53) compared to the previous recovery mean of ~110. Lead time remains bimodal (1 or 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a stockout with 0 units on-hand. Demand is highly volatile: after a significant dip in Periods 18-19 (avg 53), Period 20 saw a sharp rebound to 122 units. The last 5 periods (16-20) average 82 units, while the broader historical mean is ~100. Lead time remains bimodal (observed 1 or 3 periods; e.g., P16 arrived in 1, while P11-13 took 3). My strategy is to set L=3 as a conservative measure to bridge the current stockout and the lead time variability. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the average of the current volatile regime (82 units/period), allowing the backend to calculate the base stock for (1+L)=4 periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture this recent high volatility (std dev ~33) to ensure a higher safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has shifted again: Period 20 (122 units) reversed the low-demand trend of P18-19 (avg 53), suggesting a high-variance regime. Lead time remains bimodal, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a history of missed demand due to volatile lead times and confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6). Demand has shown high variance recently, alternating between low-demand spells (P18-19, avg 53) and high-demand spikes (P20-21, avg 136). The average lead time from observed data points (3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1) is 2.25 periods, but deliveries are bimodal (1 or 3). Given that 534 units are already in-transit from orders placed in P15, P16, and P18, and no arrivals have occurred in the last four periods, there is a cluster of inventory likely to arrive between P22 and P23. I set L to 3 to account for the upper bound of the observed lead time, ensuring the base stock level covers the pipeline delay. \u03bc\u0302 is set to 400 (equivalent to 100 units/period over L+1) to reflect the long-term mean while smoothing the recent high-variance spikes. \u03c3\u0302 is kept high at 100 to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the current demand volatility and protect against further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 20-21 demand (avg 136) significantly exceeds the prior two-period average (P18-19 avg 53). Lead time remains bimodal, with 3 periods being the safest estimate for planning.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-demand, high-variance regime. Demand over the last three periods (P20-22) has averaged 132 units, following a brief low-demand dip. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a significant backlog of demand (stockouts since P18). Lead time is bimodal, alternating between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure a high service level given the current stockout and high demand variance, I am setting L to 3 (the conservative upper bound of the bimodal distribution) to ensure the system projects enough safety stock for potential delays. For mu_hat, I am using a recent window of N=5 periods (P18-P22) which captures both the low dip and the recent high-demand bounce-back, resulting in a balanced but responsive mean. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 5 periods to account for the heightened volatility observed in this segment.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 20-22 demand (avg 132) significantly exceeds the prior two-period average (P18-19 avg 53), suggesting a high-variance recovery regime. Lead time remains bimodal (1 or 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $589.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience highly volatile demand and bimodal lead times (1 or 3 periods). As of Period 24, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling only 31 of 146 units in Period 23. Historical demand shows a high-variance recovery phase: Periods 20-23 averaged 135.5 units, significantly higher than the low-demand dip in Periods 18-19. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this most recent high-demand regime, setting mu_hat at approximately 135.5 per period. Since lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, I will explicitly set L=3 as a safety measure to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the worst-case lead time and covers lead-time demand plus the review period. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current high volatility. There are currently 534 units in-transit (orders from P15, P16 (unlikely), P18, P22 (arrived), and P23 (if any, though user data says 0)). Note that while 534 units are listed as in-transit, some (like P15 ordered 166 units and P18 ordered 89 units) are significantly delayed, and P15 is now 8 periods overdue, suggesting a likely lost shipment similar to P2 and P6.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand regime check: Periods 20-23 average 135.5 units, confirming a high-variance recovery. Order from Period 15 (166 units) is 8 periods overdue and likely lost. L=3 remains the safest planning horizon due to bimodal distribution (1 or 3 periods).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status shows 0 on-hand inventory and 590 units in-transit. A review of the game history confirms that orders from Period 2, 6, and 15 are lost, as they are significantly past the observed lead-time range (1-3 periods). The demand has entered a high-variance recovery phase since Period 20, with an average of approximately 135 units (P20-P24: 122, 150, 124, 146, 122). Lead time remains bimodal, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; I am setting L=3 to ensure the inventory policy covers the longest typical arrival time and prevents frequent stockouts during high demand periods. For demand forecasting, I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the mean of the current high-demand regime (approx. 132.8 units/period), which provides a mu_hat of ~531 for (1+L=4) periods.

Carry-over insight: Current high-demand regime (P20-P24) mean is 132.8 units, significantly higher than the previous low periods (P18-P19 avg 53). Three orders are confirmed lost: P2, P6, and P15.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment is characterized by high volatility but has shifted back to a higher mean regime. Over the last 6 periods (P20-P25), demand averages 126.2 units, significantly higher than the P18-P19 dip. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and while 'In-transit' shows 590 units, historical data confirms orders from P2, P6, and P15 are lost, and the status of P18 (89 units) is questionable as it is now 7 periods overdue. Lead time remains bimodal, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L=3 as the planning horizon to provide a safety buffer against the longer lead time and the high demand volatility. Using recent_N for both mean (N=6) and standard deviation (N=6) captures the current high-demand, high-variance regime since Period 20.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Order from Period 18 (89 units) is 7 periods overdue and likely lost. Demand regime (P20-P25) mean confirmed at ~126 units with high variance.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Periods 20-26) averages 122 units per period, showing high variance and recovery from the previous dip. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and despite a large 'In-transit' figure (590 units), many of these are likely lost (Orders from P15, P18, P24 are notably overdue). The pipeline inventory calculation must account for the fact that shipments are either arriving in 1 period or 3 periods, or not at all. Period 26 concluded with no arrivals. I will set L=3 as the planning horizon to provide a safety buffer against the bimodal 1/3 lead time and account for the risk of stockouts in this high-demand period. I'll use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~122) and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 18 (89 units) is over 8 periods overdue and confirmed lost. In-transit inventory of 590 is heavily inflated by lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' quantity of 590 is highly misleading because it includes confirmed lost orders from Periods 2 (129), 6 (150), 15 (166), and 18 (89), totaling 534 units. The remaining valid in-transit inventory is only 56 units (from Period 24). Demand has moved from a high-fluctuation regime back toward a more stable mean; the last three periods (P25-27) averaged 95.7 units, down from the P20-24 average of 132.8. Lead time remains bimodal (1 or 3 periods), so I use L=3 to ensure the inventory position covers the full risk window. To account for the stockout and the fact that 534 units of 'In-transit' are phantom stock, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 and an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock level as (1 + 3) * 100 = 400. However, the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from this target. Since the backend thinks in-transit is 590, it would order 0 if I used the true mean. To force an order that compensates for the 534 lost units, I must set mu_hat = (True Base Stock Target + Lost Units) = 400 + 534 = 934.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 590 units contains 534 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18). Demand has stabilized at ~96 units over the last 3 periods following the P20-24 spike.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity of 881 units is severely misleading due to confirmed lost shipments. Specifically, shipments from Period 2 (129), Period 6 (150), Period 15 (166), and Period 18 (89) totaling 534 units are confirmed lost. This leaves an effective pipeline of 347 units (881 - 534), which includes the orders from Period 24 (56 units) and Period 28 (291 units). Lead time remains bimodal (1 or 3 periods), making 3 periods the safest planning horizon to avoid further stockouts. Demand has stabilized recently with a mean of approximately 94 units over the last 5 periods (P24-P28), following a high-variance spike. Therefore, I am setting L=3 to reflect the safer lead time estimate. For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the current stabilized demand level (approx 94.4 per period, leading to a mu_hat calculation of (1+3)*94.4 = 377.6). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the current volatility within this period range.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory (881) includes 534 units from confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 95 units over the last 5 periods (P24-P28).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30, the on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is severely compromised. The in-transit inventory of 881 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments: P2 (129), P6 (150), P15 (166), and P18 (89), totaling 534 lost units. This leaves an effective in-transit balance of only 347 units (P24: 56, P28: 291). Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~95 over the last 6 periods (P24-P29) following the high-variance spike in P20-P23. Lead time remains bimodal, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; I am setting L=3 (explicit) to protect against stockouts during the longer lead time realization. For mu_hat, I am using the last 6 samples (recent_N, N=6) to capture the stabilized mean of 98.3, which results in a mu_hat of ~393 for the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility (N=6) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the current demand dispersion while attempting to satisfy the high service level requirement (profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 19:1).

Carry-over insight: Effective in-transit inventory is 347 units (881 total minus 534 confirmed lost). Demand remains stable near mean ~98 over the last 6 periods (P24-P29).

Daily Reward (R_t): $649.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we have 244 units on-hand after a recent arrival of 291 units from P28 (L=2). The current in-transit inventory is 590 units, but historical tracking confirms that 534 units are lost (P2: 129, P6: 150, P15: 166, P18: 89). Consequently, the effective 'productive' in-transit inventory is only 56 units (from P24), making the replenishment lead-time risk critical. Demand has stabilized over the last 7 periods (P24-P30) with a mean of 91.5 units, though variance remains present. Lead times remain bimodal/unstable (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). Given that we are entering Period 31, I am using an explicit lead time L=3 for safety, as actual lead times often drift beyond the promised 2. mu_hat is set to cover 4 periods (L+1) using a recent mean of ~92 units, and sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture the broader historical volatility which is necessary for a high service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Effective in-transit inventory confirmed at 56 units; 534 units (P2, P6, P15, P18) are permanently lost. Demand mean for P24-P30 is 91.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1636.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, the primary concern is the accounting of 'In-transit' inventory. Out of the 590 units currently listed, 534 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18). The effective in-transit inventory is therefore only 56 units (from P32's perspective, representing the order from P24). Demand has stabilized at a lower mean following the P20-24 spike; the average demand for the last 8 periods (P24-P31) is 91.4 units. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this more stable regime. Lead time remains bimodal (observed values: 1, 2, 3), but the safest planning horizon is L=3. Because the backend OR solver subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, and the backend 'thinks' there are 590 units in transit while only 56 are actually coming, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this phantom inventory. Effective Pipeline = On-hand (150) + True In-transit (56) = 206. Backend thinks Pipeline = 150 + 590 = 740. Difference = 534. Target Base Stock for (L+1=4) periods = 4 * 91.4 = 365.6. To get the backend to order enough to reach 365.6 while it thinks it already has 740, I would need an extremely high mu_hat. However, setting L=3 (explicit) and mu_hat=recent_N (N=8) will allow the system to recalculate based on (L+1). I will set L to 3 to ensure a larger base stock calculation to compensate for the missing units.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean for P24-P31 is 91.4 units, showing stabilization after the high-variance P20-24 regime. Effective in-transit inventory is only 56 units (P24 order); the remaining 534 units (P2, P6, P15, P18) are permanently lost.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in a stable demand regime after recovering from the high-variance spike inPeriods 20-24. Over the last 9 periods (P24-P32), demand has averaged 91.3 units, signaling a return to a baseline near 90-100 units. A critical factor is the in-transit inventory calculation: the displayed 590 units are misleading due to confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (129 units), Period 6 (150 units), Period 15 (166 units), and Period 18 (89 units), totaling 534 'ghost' units. The only valid in-transit order is from Period 24 (56 units), which is now 9 periods overdue and likely lost as well, though not yet fully retired from the mental model. The arrival of the Period 28 order (291 units) in Period 30 temporarily replenished on-hand inventory to 63, but no new orders have been placed since P28. Given the bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) and the risk of lost shipments, I will set L=3 as a safety buffer. I will use recent demand history (N=9) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it captures the current post-spike stability.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 24 (56 units) is 9 periods overdue and likely lost; combined with previous losses (P2, P6, P15, P18), total confirmed/likely lost units in the 'in-transit' tally is 590, meaning effective in-transit is zero.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state with zero on-hand inventory and an 'in-transit' total of 590 units. However, historical analysis confirms that all 590 units (from orders in Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 24) are permanently lost, as they are all significantly past the observed lead time maximum of 3 periods. Consequently, effective pipeline inventory is zero. Demand has stabilized over the last 10 periods (P24-P33) with a mean of 91.6 units following a high-variance period. To recover from the current stockout and account for the bimodal lead time (often 1 or 3 periods), I am setting L=3 to ensure a sufficient safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand regime and provide enough inventory to cover the lead time plus current review period.

Carry-over insight: All 590 units currently in-transit (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24) are confirmed lost due to exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a factor of 3x or more. Effective pipeline inventory is 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 590 units 'in-transit', but historical tracking confirms these all correspond to lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, and P24) as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a factor of 3x or more. Effective pipeline inventory is therefore zero, and on-hand inventory is also zero following a stockout in Period 33. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~94 units across the last 11 periods (P24-P34), moving away from the high-variance spike seen earlier (P20-P23). Lead time is bimodal, appearing as either 1 or 3 periods. To ensure availability given the zero effective inventory status and potentially long (3-period) lead time, I am setting L=3 to cover the risk and using a recent 10-period average for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stabilized mean of ~94. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to account for the current volatility levels.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 35, effective inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 0; all 590 units in the 'in-transit' records are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24). Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~94 units over the last 11 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 and the 590 units currently 'in-transit' are confirmed or highly likely lost (Orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P24), as all have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods (P24 is now 11 periods overdue). The effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized following the high-variance regime of P20-P24; the average demand for the last 11 periods (P25-P35) is approximately 93.3 units. I will set mu_hat based on this stable 11-period mean to re-establish inventory. Although the promised lead time is 2, the historical actual lead time varies between 1 and 3 periods. Using L=3 (explicit) is the safest approach to ensure the base stock calculation covers enough demand to account for the frequent 3-period delays and the high risk of stockouts currently being experienced. This will prompt the backend to place an order that covers the current deficit and the projected demand over the next lead time window.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 36, effective pipeline inventory remains 0; the 590 units listed as in-transit (Orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P24) are confirmed lost. Recent demand (P25-P35) has stabilized at a mean of 93.3 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37, the SKU chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 0. The system reports an 'in-transit' total of 590 units, but exhaustive historical tracking (captured in carry-over insights) confirms that all 590 units are from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, and P24) which have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a massive margin. Therefore, the effective inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is actually 0. Demand has stabilized remarkably well over the last 12 periods (P25-P36), with a mean of 95.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. Despite the bimodal lead time history (1 or 3 periods), L=3 remains the safest planning horizon to avoid stockouts given the zero starting inventory position. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture this stable regime and set L=3 via 'explicit' to ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time + current period, adjusted for the reality of zero effective pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: As of P37, the effective pipeline inventory is 0; the 590 units recorded as in-transit (Orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P24) are confirmed lost. Recent demand (P25-P36) is stable with a mean of 95.2 and low variance compared to the P20-24 spike.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 590 units 'in-transit', but historical analysis confirms these orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24) are lost as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a factor of 3x. Effective on-hand and pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized into a consistent regime following the high-variance P20-P24 period; from P25 to P37, the mean demand is ~92.4 units per period with relatively low volatility. To recover from the current stockout, I must set parameters that trigger a replenishment. I will use L=3 as the planning lead time (the safest historical observed maximum) and mu_hat based on the last 13 periods of stabilized demand (P25-P37) to ensure the order covers the lead time plus current period. sigma_hat will be calculated over the same period to capture recent volatility.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39, the on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline inventory is effectively 0. The 590 units currently listed as 'in-transit' (Orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P24) are confirmed lost, as their non-arrival dates significantly exceed the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. To regain stock and minimize lost sales, a substantial order must be triggered. Demand has stabilized over the last 14 periods (P25-P38) with a mean of 91.8, following a high-variance spike. I will use a recent_N of 14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable post-spike regime. Although bimodal lead times of 1 and 3 have been seen, using L=3 (explicit) ensures the stock-out probability is minimized while the OR backend calculates the target base stock. This aggressive replenishing is necessary since current effective inventory is zero.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40, the system shows 590 units 'in-transit', but historical analysis confirms these units (from orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P24) are lost, as they are now between 16 and 38 periods overdue. Consequently, effective on-hand and effective pipeline inventory are both 0. Demand has transitioned into a lower, more stable regime following the Period 20-24 spike; over the last 15 periods (P25-P39), mean demand is approximately 88.5 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods show a slight further dip (avg 79) due to the Period 39 outlier (35 units). Given the 0 effective inventory and the observed bimodal lead time (historically 1 or 3 periods, with P28 arriving in 2), I will use an explicit lead time L=3 to ensure the order covers the risk of a slower shipment. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*90 = 360 to restock the empty pipeline based on the stable 90-unit demand mean. sigma_hat is set to reflect the moderate variance seen in this stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory is confirmed 0; all 590 'in-transit' units are lost. Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~90 units post-Period 25.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 25-40) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 90.7 units with some variance. The 'In-transit' count of 590 is entirely comprised of confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is 0 and on-hand inventory is 0. To recover from this stockout, I am setting L=3 to account for the upper bound of the observed bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods), ensuring a safer bridge. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*90.7 \u2248 363 to cover demand across the lead time and the current period. sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(1+3)*std(P25-P40) to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the observed demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: All 590 units currently in 'in-transit' are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24). Effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand from P25-P40 has stabilized at a mean of 90.7 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 590 units in-transit, but these represent orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 24, all of which are significantly past the maximum observed 3-period lead time and are confirmed lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0, and on-hand inventory is 0, necessitating a new order to meet stabilizing demand. Demand has shifted through several regimes but has recently settled; over the last 17 periods (P25-P41), the mean is approximately 91.8 units, while the very recent 5-period mean (P37-P41) is 87.2 units. I will use recent_N=17 for mu_hat to capture the post-spike stability while maintaining some volume for service levels, and recent_N=3 for lead time as 1 to 3 periods remains the observed range when shipments actually arrive. Setting L to 3 (explicit) ensures the base stock calculation covers the likely delay if the bimodal lead time hits its upper bound, preventing stockouts given the zero-inventory state.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Total historical lost orders reach 590 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24). Effective inventory is currently 0. Demand from P25 to P41 has stabilized with a mean of 91.8 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 590 units, but historical analysis confirms these orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24) are lost as they are many times past the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. Consequently, effective pipeline inventory is 0 and on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 17 periods (P25-P41) with a mean of approximately 92 units, following a high-volatility spike in periods 20-24. Lead times exhibit bimodal behavior (1 or 3 periods); therefore, using L=3 is the safest approach to prevent stockouts in this high-uncertainty environment. To trigger an order from the OR backend despite the 'phantom' in-transit stock, I will use an explicit mu_hat that accounts for the fact that the backend incorrectly thinks we have 590 units. Base stock target = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stk. With L=3, mean=92, target is ~450-500. Since backend inventory = 590, the backend will order 0 unless mu_hat is set significantly higher. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this deficit and target a base stock that forces a corrective order to restore on-hand inventory.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 906 units in-transit. Based on historical data and evidence captured in Carry-over Insights, 590 units are documented as permanently lost (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 24). Additionally, no orders were placed between Periods 28 and 42. In Period 43, an order of 316 units was placed. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 316 units (906 - 590), all of which were ordered in Period 43. Since the lead time is bimodal (1 or 3 periods) with 3 being the safest upper bound for planning, I assume a lead time of 3 periods to ensure sufficient coverage during potential delays. Demand from Period 25 through Period 43 has stabilized around a mean of 93 units. With current on-hand inventory at 0 and the next arrival expected no earlier than Period 44 (if L=1) or Period 46 (if L=3), a base stock calculation is needed. Using recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the stable post-spike regime while providing enough variance to handle the moderate fluctuations seen in recent weeks (e.g., P39 vs P42). Setting L to 3 explicitly ensures the OR backend targets a higher safety stock to compensate for the frequent shipping failures and lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Effective pipeline inventory confirmed at 316 units (total in-transit 906 minus 590 units confirmed lost from P2, P6, P15, P18, P24). Demand mean remains stable at ~93 units (P25-P43).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 906 units in-transit. However, based on the carry-over insights and historical non-arrivals, 590 of these units (from orders P2, P6, P15, P18, and P24) are confirmed lost. The only valid pipeline inventory is the order of 316 units placed in Period 43. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand from Period 25 through Period 44 has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 93 units per period. The lead time is bimodal, alternating between 1 and 3 periods; setting L=3 remains the safest planning horizon to ensure sufficient base stock to cover potential delays and high service levels for this high-margin product (95% critical ratio). I am using 'explicit' for L to maintain a conservative 3-period buffer and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the stable demand regime since the P20-24 spike.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 45, effective pipeline inventory is 316 units (Order P43). Historical lost units total 590 (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24). Demand continues in a stable regime (P25-P44) with a mean of ~93 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 20 periods (P25-P45) with a mean of 92.8 units. The most recent order (P43) arrived in P45, confirming an actual lead time (L) of 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 232 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 590 units consists entirely of orders confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24), as documented in carry-over insights; therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. With L=2, the planning horizon is L+1=3 periods. Expected demand over this window is approximately 278 units. Given on-hand is 232, the current coverage is nearly sufficient, but a small buffer is needed to account for variance and the risk of lead time extending to 3 periods (previously observed). I will use recent_N (N=20) for demand parameters to capture the stable post-spike regime and set L to default (which is the promised 2) as the most recent shipment arrived on schedule.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1228.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistent regime since Period 25, with a mean of approximately 93 units. Period 46 concluded with 159 units on-hand and an effective pipeline inventory of 0 (the 590 units recorded in-transit are all confirmed lost from previous periods P2, P6, P15, P18, P24). The order from Period 43 (316 units) arrived in Period 45 with a lead time of 2 periods, suggesting lead times are currently behaving close to the promised value. With 159 units on-hand and a daily demand around 93, the current stock will likely last only through Period 48. Since we are at Period 47 and the game ends at Period 50, and the lead time is approximately 2-3 periods, an order placed now (P47) would arrive around P49 or P50. To maximize profit while avoiding excessive holding costs at the game's end, I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=20) for demand and the default lead time. This will ensure we maintain a base stock sufficient to cover the remaining periods without over-ordering as the simulation concludes.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has returned to expected levels (L=2 for P43 order). Effective pipeline inventory is confirmed as 0; the 590 in-transit units remain permanently lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1101.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 25-47) has stabilized following a high-variance period, with a mean of approximately 93 units. Lead time has recently demonstrated a return to the promised 2 periods (as seen with the Period 43 order arriving in Period 45). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 590 is entirely composed of confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is currently 0. With On-hand inventory at 96 units and expected demand around 93 units, the current stock is only sufficient for one period. Given the promised lead time L=2, the system needs to cover 3 periods of demand (current period + lead time). I will use L=2 (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable regime since Period 25 (N=23) to ensure the OR backend places an order that replenishes the pipeline while accounting for the historical losses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $924.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is entering its final two periods (49 and 50). Current on-hand inventory is 45 units. Recent demand has shown a downward trend: Period 46 (73), Period 47 (63), and Period 48 (51). Calculating the mean for the stable regime post-P25 (excluding the most recent dip) gives approximately 93 units, but the last 3 periods average 62.3. Given the Lead Time is officially 2 periods (confirmed by P43 arriving in 2 periods at P45), any order placed now (Period 49) will arrive in Period 51 (Arrival Resolution), which is after the simulation concludes at the end of Period 50. Therefore, any new order will only incur holding costs or remain in-transit without contributing to sales or profit. To maximize total reward, I will set parameters to result in a zero order for this final decision period.

Carry-over insight: Demand has trended significantly downward in the final phase (P46-P48 average: 62.3), contrasting with the previous stable mean of ~93. Lead time has stabilized at L=2 based on the most recent completed shipment (P43).

Daily Profit: $855.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $855.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the environment presents 0 on-hand inventory and an 'in-transit' figure of 590 units that are confirmed lost (Orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P24). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has recently softened, with the last four periods (P46-P49) averaging 68 units, significantly lower than the previous long-term mean of ~92 units. Lead time has recently stabilized around the promised 2 periods (P43 arrived in 2 periods, P28 arrived in 2 periods), though history shows high volatility (bimodal 1 or 3). Given this is the final period (Period 50), the system will aim to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. I am setting L to explicit 2 to match recent performance. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to reflect the immediate downward trend in demand (mean ~68) to prevent overstocking at the game's end, and default sigma_hat to account for historical variance.

Carry-over insight: Final demand regime (P46-P49) shows a downward shift to a mean of 68 units compared to the prior stable mean of ~93. Lead time confirmed stabilized at L=2 based on recent successful deliveries.
