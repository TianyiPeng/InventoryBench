Demand analysis shows recent spikes in P12 (158) and P13 (150). Given the historical average of ~110 and recent higher peaks, I'll forecast demand at ~120-130 per period. Lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with significant risks of lost shipments (P2 and P6 orders confirmed lost). For Period 14, my on-hand inventory is 0. My pipeline (In-transit) is 540 units, consisting of orders from P11 (130), P12 (110), P13 (120), and pending arrivals. Based on lead time history: the P11 order (placed 3 periods ago) is likely to arrive in the Period 14 resolution phase. The P12 order (placed 2 periods ago) might also arrive if LT=2. However, I am currently stocked out (Ending inventory Period 13 = 0). To cover demand for the lead time plus one period (3+1 = 4 periods) at ~125 units/period, I need a target inventory position of 500 units. Current In-transit is 540 units, but assuming one of the older orders (like P11 or P12) might be lost given the history of lost shipments (P2, P6), I will place a safety order of 110 units to maintain a robust pipeline against potential loss and continued demand strength.",

Current on-hand inventory is 151 units. With a perceived lead time of 1-3 periods, current stock will likely cover the demand for Period 43 and possibly Period 44, but presents a stockout risk by Period 45 if no arrivals occur. Reviewing the 'In-transit' pipeline of 1270 units: Period 33 (110 units) is now 10 periods old; Period 37 (110 units) is 6 periods old. Both follow the established ~30% loss pattern and are likely lost. However, there are no recent orders (Periods 39-42) to arrive soon. To maintain a safety stock level that accounts for the frequent shipment losses while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit/period), I need to resume ordering to ensure availability for Periods 45-47. I will order 120 units to target an arrival in approximately 2-3 periods, which aligns with covering one period's demand plus a small safety buffer, acknowledging that the pipeline is otherwise empty of viable/recent shipments.",

Total presumed lost units are 1270, meaning the 'effective' in-transit is closer to 400 units (1670 - 1270). The recent orders from P43 (120) and P44 (280) are still within the normal lead-time window (1-3 periods). Since we are currently at 0 inventory and nearing the end of the game (P45 of 50), we must ensure we have enough stock to cover the remaining 6 periods (demand ~600 units).

The 'In-transit' balance of 1800 is heavily inflated by accumulated lost shipments. Based on the Carry-Over Insights, cumulative lost units were approximately 1270 prior to recent periods. Applying the observed ~30% loss rate and identifying long-overdue specific orders (P33, P37), the 'actual' reliable pipeline consists of orders from P44 (280 units) and P45 (250 units). History shows lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods. The P44 order (280) is expected to arrive during P45, P46, or P47. Since it did not arrive in P45 (see P45 conclude), it is expected in P46 or P47. To cover the remaining 4 periods (P46-P50) and account for the high loss risk, I will maintain an aggressive ordering stance to ensure inventory availability for the final stretch, targeting a stock level that mitigates the high probability of further shipment failures while acknowledging we are near the end of the game (P50).

Looking at recent orders: P44 (280 units) is due now (L=3), P45 (250 units) is due in P47 or P48, and P46 (150 units) is due in P48 or P49. To cover the remaining 4 periods (47, 48, 49, 50) and account for the high probability of shipment failure, I need to ensure an effective pipeline of ~400 units. Adding the P44/45/46 orders together gives 680 units; however, given the historical 30% loss rate, only about 476 units are 'reliable'.

The P44 order (placed 5 periods ago) should have arrived by now if not lost; its absence suggests it might be added to the lost list. However, P45, P46, and P47 are still within the 'active' lead time window. Given that arrivals for orders placed in P49 or P50 will arrive too late to be sold (lead time minimum is 1 period, meaning a P49 order arrives during P50 resolution), and we already have substantial units (500+) in the 'likely' pipeline vs. expected demand of ~100-150 for the final two periods, placing any further orders would only risk increasing holding costs at the end of the game with no guaranteed profit.",
