Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 with no historical observation of lead times or delivery behavior. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows five previous periods (pre-game) with values [118, 124, 116, 96, 91], suggesting an average demand around 109 units per period with a slight downward trend. Since there's no confirmed changepoint yet, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (matching the provided history) to estimate mean and standard deviation. The OR backend will calculate base_stock to cover (L+1) periods. Given on-hand and in-transit are both zero, an initial order will be triggered to establish the pipeline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 133 units, which is currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Historical demand data for Period 1 shows 102 units (while the user-provided sample list showed 118 for the same period, I will rely on the specific 'conclude' message for the most recent observation where available, though both suggest a mean around 110-120). Demand for the last 5 samples (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) averages 109. Using a recent_N approach for demand estimation is appropriate to capture the current volume. I will maintain the default lead time of 2 as there is no evidence yet to suggest a deviation from the promised timing.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (133 units) and Period 2 (129 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (after this decision) and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Therefore, seeing 'arrived=0' in Period 1 and 2 'conclude' messages is expected. On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales for Period 1 (102 units) and Period 2 (87 units) because the initial inventory was 0 and no arrivals have occurred yet. For the demand forecast, I observe samples: P1=118, P2=124, P3=116, P4=91, P5=91 (Wait, the historical samples provided in the prompt are 118, 124, 116, 96, 91, but the game history shows actual demand for P1=102 and P2=87). I will use the actual game history demand (avg ~95) for mu_hat. Since we are in the very early stages (N=2), I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to react to the slightly lower observed demand compared to the initial seed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (133 units) were expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase, making them visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This indicates either a delay in lead time (L=3 or more) or a lost shipment. Historical demand for the first 5 samples provided (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) shows an average of ~109. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand with 299 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Since we have 0 on-hand and 0 sales due to lack of stock, it is critical to account for the lead time extension. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the observation that Period 1's order has not arrived by the start of Period 4. Demand seems relatively stable, so I will use the mean of the 5 historical samples provided to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $270.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the last 5 periods has been [118, 124, 116, 96, 91], showing a slight downward trend or stabilization around 100-110 units. However, we have a significant lead time volatility issue: Promised LT is 2, but observed LTs were 3 (Period 1 order) and 1 (Period 3 order). Notably, the order from Period 2 (129 units) has not arrived yet (it's been 3 periods since the order), which suggests either a delay or a potential loss, although P1 took 3 periods. Current on-hand is 82. Pipeline is 263. Given the variability in lead time (ranging from 1 to 3), I will set L to 3 to be conservative and ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum observed lead time plus the review period. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent mean (~109), and for sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent volatility. This conservative L=3 helps the OR backend maintain a higher safety stock to buffer against late deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed LTs of 1 and 3 periods against a promised 2. Period 2 order is currently late (3 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $328.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The current state is critical: On-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 5. The historical demand for chips(Regular) averages 103.6 units (samples: 102, 87, 126, 88, 115). Lead time (LT) is highly unstable: the Period 1 order took 3 periods, the Period 3 order took 1 period, and the Period 2 order (129 units) is currently 4 periods overdue (ordered P2, start of P6, no arrival), suggesting it might be lost or significantly delayed. Pipeline inventory is 341 (P2: 129, P4: 134, P5: 78). Given the promised LT of 2, but actual observations ranging from 1 to 3+ (and a likely lost P2 order), I will set L=3 to be conservative. For mu_hat, I'll use the average of all 5 demand samples (approx 103.6) multiplied by (1+L)=4, totaling 414.4. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(4) * std(samples) \u2248 2 * 16.5 = 33. This configuration ensures the base-stock target accounts for lead time variability and the risk of lost shipments while attempting to recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability persists: Period 2 order (129 units) is over 3 periods late and potentially lost. Actual lead times observed: 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 with 0 on-hand inventory and 451 units in-transit. The demand history (102, 87, 126, 88, 115, 88) suggests a relatively stable mean around 101 units per period. The primary challenge is lead time instability. We have observed lead times of 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order). Crucially, the P2 order (129 units) is now 5 periods old (ordered P2, still not arrived at P7 start) and must be treated as lost to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering based on ghost inventory. To account for this, I am setting L to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the actual variability (average of 3, 1, and the likely lost/delayed P2). For mu_hat, I am using the mean of the most recent 6 periods (all available data) to forecast next period demand. For sigma_hat, I use N=6 to capture the observed demand volatility (std \u2248 15.5), which helps maintain a safety stock against the current stockout situation.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: P2 order (129 units) confirmed lost/extensively delayed (5 periods elapsed). Lead time remains unstable with observed values {1, 3}.

Daily Reward (R_t): $246.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, the supply chain for chips(Regular) remains highly volatile. Historical observations show lead times of 1, 3, and 3 periods, while the Period 2 order (129 units) has failed to arrive after 6 periods, signaling a lost shipment. The OR backend does not know about lost orders and subtracts full in-transit units from the base stock. Currently, in-transit is 317 units, but 129 of those (P2) are likely non-existent. To compensate for this 'ghost' inventory and ensure the OR engine orders enough, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to temporarily inflate the target stock level. Demand is relatively stable, averaging ~97 units per period. I am setting L=2 (promised) but calculating mu_hat as (1+L) * 97 + 129 = 420. This forces the system to treat the lost 129 units as needed demand, effectively neutralizing their presence in the pipeline calculation. sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=7) to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (129 units) confirmed lost: 6 periods elapsed with no arrival. In-transit inventory overstates actual supply by 129 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $339.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU shows a current on-hand inventory of 41 units. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is reported as 310 units, consisting of orders from P2 (129), P6 (110), and P8 (71). Historical evidence confirms the P2 order (129 units) is lost as 7 periods have elapsed. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, my parameters must account for this dead inventory. Since the backend computes 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)', if in_transit is inflated by 129 units, the order will be 129 units too low. I am setting L=2 (promised) but using 'explicit' mu_hat to handle the adjustment. Calculated demand mean (P1-P8 excluding P1-P5 from user prompt which were sample data, focusing on actual game history demand: 102, 87, 126, 88, 115, 88, 76, 95) is approx 97 units. (1+L)*mean = 3 * 97 = 291. To offset the lost 129 units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 291 + 129 = 420. This ensures the OR engine targets a higher base stock to compensate for the phantom inventory. I am using default sigma_hat as volatility remains consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $273.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 88.2 units over the past 5 periods (P5-P9), compared to the initial 105 units. Lead time continues to be highly volatile, with observations of 1 period (P3, P8 orders) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 orders), while the P2 order of 129 units is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Current on-hand is 35 units. The in-transit inventory of 332 includes the lost 129 units (P2), 110 units (P6), and 93 units (P9). Adjusting for the lost shipment, effective pipeline is 203. I will set L to 2 (calculated average for logic, but explicit to handle variance) and mu_hat to cover 3 periods (1+2 L) of recent demand. sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for both demand and lead time uncertainty.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Demand has been stable around an average of 95 units (samples range 76-126). Lead time is highly variable (observed L: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1) and the shipment from Period 2 (129 units) is confirmed lost, as it has not arrived after 9 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit of 332 units includes the 129 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 203 units (from Period 6 and Period 9 orders). Given the lead time instability (averaging ~2.2 periods) and the need to recover from a stockout, I will set L to 3 periods to ensure the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient for the (L+1)=4 period risk horizon. I will use the recent mean demand (approx 95 units) to forecast.

Carry-over insight: Effectively lost shipment: Period 2 order (129 units) is 9 periods overdue; in-transit inventory is inflated by 129 units.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown a slight downward trend recently (avg of last 5 periods ~85 vs. overall avg ~94). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed values are {3, 1, 3, 3, 1}, averaging 2.2 periods. Critically, the Period 2 order (129 units) is now 10 periods overdue and confirmed lost; however, the backend OR engine still counts it in the 'pipeline_inventory'. This causes the backend to under-order by 129 units. To compensate, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. Calculations: Expected (L+1) demand using recent context (N=5avg=84.8, L=2) is ~254 units. To offset the 129 units the OR engine thinks we have (but don't), I set mu_hat to 254 + 129 = 383. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time (~2.2) which increases the safety stock buffer.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13, the 'chips(Regular)' inventory situation is critical. On-hand inventory is 3, following stockouts in Period 10 and 11. The Period 2 order (129 units) is now 11 periods overdue and effectively lost, meaning the reported in-transit of 314 units is actually 185 units of realistic supply (Period 6: 110, Period 11: 75). Observed lead times are highly variable at {1, 3, 3, 1, 3}, averaging 2.2. Given this instability and the previous lost shipment, I am using an explicit lead time of 3 to provide more buffer. Demand has been relatively stable; I'm using the mean of the last 10 periods (avg ~101.9) to set mu_hat, resulting in a forecast of 408 (101.9 * (1 + 3)). Sigma_at is set to capture recent volatility. The OR backend will see the inflated pipeline (314), so mu_hat must be high enough to trigger an order despite the 'ghost' inventory from Period 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Period 2 order (129 units) is 11 periods overdue and confirmed as a structural loss in pipeline accounting. Current lead time observations average 2.2 periods with high variance {1, 3}.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 433 units in-transit. Based on Carry-Over Insights, the Period 2 order of 129 units is 12 periods overdue and definitively lost. This means the functional pipeline inventory is actually 304 units (433 - 129). The on-hand inventory is 0. Observed lead times have been highly variable {1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3}, averaging approximately 2.33 periods. Based on this, I will set L to 2.33 periods using the 'explicit' method. Demand over the last 13 periods has been relatively stable, averaging 94.4 units per period (sum: 1228 / 13). With L=2.33, the 'review + lead time' window is 3.33 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full recent history since no distinct seasonal shift is yet visible in the data samples (118, 124, 116, 96, 91 for the first 5 periods vs recent demand around 90-110). Setting L=2.33 slightly higher than the promised 2 periods helps the OR engine account for the frequent 3-period arrivals.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging around 95 units over the last 15 periods (Mean=95.3, Std=14.5). However, inventory management is severely hampered by lead-time instability (actual LTs vary between 1 and 3 periods) and a specifically confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (129 units). The current 'In-transit' balance of 358 units includes this lost 129 units, meaning the real pipeline is only 229 units (orders from P13 and P14). On-hand inventory is currently 0. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory of 129 units in the OR backend's logic, I will use an 'explicit' L to handle the planning horizon (L=3 based on frequent max delay) and 'explicit' mu_hat to adjust for the lost units. I set mu_hat = (1+L) * mean_demand + Lost_Units = (4 * 95) + 129 = 509. This forces the engine to order enough to cover current needs plus the gap left by the missing 129 units. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Structural inventory gap confirmed. In-transit count is inflated by 129 units (P2 order) which has not arrived after 13 periods. Explicit parameters are required to bypass the OR engine's reliance on inflated pipeline data.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 508 units in transit. However, based on the carry-over insights, the order from Period 2 (129 units) is 14 periods overdue and confirmed lost. The internal OR engine's 'pipeline' calculation includes these lost units, causing it to under-order and leading to frequent stockouts (evident in Period 15, where 112 demand resulted in 0 sales). To correct for this 129-unit 'ghost inventory', I am using 'explicit' parameters. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times average 2.4 (values of 1 and 3). I will set L=3 to be safe given the stockouts and arrival volatility. Looking at demand history, it remains stable with a mean of approximately 96 units over the last 15 periods. For mu_hat, I'll use (1+L)*mean = (1+3)*96 = 384 units. For sigma_hat, I'll use a slightly elevated value of 35 to account for the supply-side uncertainty and stockout history.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed structural inventory gap of 129 units due to lost Period 2 order persists. Observed lead times now cluster at the high end (3 periods) necessitating an adjustment to L=3 for the base stock calculation.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a stable regime around an average of 95 units per period. Lead times are inconsistent, frequently hitting 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, P8, P12, P14, P16). Most critically, the Period 2 order (129 units) is 15 periods overdue and effectively lost. The backend OR engine counts this 129 units in 'pipeline inventory' (in-transit), which causes it to under-order by exactly that amount, leading to stockouts. To fix this, I utilize the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using L=3: Base Stock = (L+1) * Mean + Z * Sigma * sqrt(L+1). With Mean ~ 95, Sigma ~ 15, and critical ratio q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8 (Z ~ 0.84), theoretical base stock is (4 * 95) + (0.84 * 15 * 2) = 380 + 25 = 405. However, since the engine will subtract the 'phantom' 129 units plus the real 260 units (389 total in-transit), I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter to ensure the engine places an order that covers current demand. I set L=3 to reflect the realistic lead time and mu_hat explicitly to account for the pipeline gap.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and the Period 2 order (129 units) is confirmed lost, inflating the pipeline inventory by a significant amount. This phantom inventory prevents the OR engine from ordering enough to cover demand. Lead times continue to cluster at 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. Demand remains stable around a mean of 97. Using L=3, \u03bc\u0302 (demand across lead + review time) is estimated at 388 (97 * 4). However, to account for the 129 units of lost pipeline inventory and the fact that we are starting at 0 stock, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. By setting mu_hat = 517 (388 + 129), I force the backend to place an order that restores the target base stock level while ignoring the non-existent Period 2 shipment. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a structural stockout (On-hand: 0) and an inflated pipeline inventory. The Period 2 order (129 units) is now 17 periods overdue and is definitively lost. The OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation includes this ghost order (547 total units in-transit includes the 129 units from P2), which leads the engine to under-order. To correct for this, I must set 'L' to 3 (reflecting the observed modal lead time) and use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This allows the order quantity (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to remain high enough to cover the actual inventory gap. Demand has recently softened (P17: 53, P18: 30), so I am adjusting the mean demand down to ~85 units/period for the forecast period (1+L=4 periods). This results in a mu_hat of 340 (4 * 85) and an explicit sigma_hat of 50 to maintain a high service level while account for current order instability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the inventory state is critical: on-hand is 0, and common demand patterns suggest 50-100 units per period. The pipeline inventory is listed as 547 units, but this includes 129 units from the Period 2 order, which is now 18 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 418 units. Historical lead trials show a high frequency of 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P13 all took 3 periods). I will set L to 3. Demand has shown a slight downward trend recently (P17-P19: 53, 30, 50), but overall the mean is approximately 90. To ensure the OR engine overcomes the inflated in-transit count (the engine thinks we have 547 units, while we effectively have 418), I must set mu_hat explicitly. Following the logic base_stock = (L+1)*demand, and needing to order when (base_stock - effective_pipeline) > 0, I calculate base_stock to cover current demand and the missing gap. With mean demand ~90 and L=3, base_stock should be ~360. However, the OR engine subtracts the full 547 in-transit. To force an order and maintain stock, mu_hat must be set high enough to represent both future demand and the lost 129 units. (4 periods * 90) + 129 = 489. I will use 500 to provide a small safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Structural inventory gap of 129 units still present in pipeline data. Observed lead times predominantly 3 periods (6 occurrences). Recent demand (P17-P19) dipped below 60 units, potentially signaling a new lower-demand regime.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a dual challenge: a structural inventory gap of 129 units (the lost Period 2 order) and a recent demand shift. Demand over the last 4 periods (P17-P20) has averaged 54.75 units, significantly lower than the historical average of ~90 units. I am setting the demand regime length (N) to 4 to capture this shift. The actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in most recent arrivals P12, P14, P16), so I am setting L=3. Because the OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' inventory (547 units) which includes the phantom 129 units, the base_stock calculation will be artificially depressed. To compensate and ensure we achieve a base stock that covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand at the new rate, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand per period = 55; Required Base Stock = (3+1) * 55 = 220. However, the backend sees 547 in transit. If I use mu_hat=220, the order becomes 0. To 'force' an order to replenish the 0 on-hand stock and account for the 129 lost units, mu_hat must be set high enough to offset the phantom inventory. I set mu_hat explicitly to provide a target base stock that reconciles the 129-unit error.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 17: Average demand decreased from ~90 to 55 units (-39%). L is effectively 3 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a structural inventory gap: the Period 2 order (129 units) is confirmed lost (20 periods overdue), but remains in 'In-transit' inventory (547 units). Total actual in-transit is 418 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand shifted downward starting Period 17; the last 5 periods (P17-P21) average 57 units/period, down from the previous average of ~93. Lead times are unstable but predominantly 3 periods. To account for the lost 129 units and the lower demand, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I set L=3 based on historical mode. For mu_hat, I forecast demand for (1+L=4) periods using the new regime average: 4 * 57 = 228. For sigma_hat, I provide a volatility estimate covering the lead time window. Using explicit values allows us to bypass the OR engine's reliance on the inflated 547 in-transit units, as the base_stock (mu + z*sigma) will be compared against the pipeline to determine the order size.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand inventory = 0) despite extremely high in-transit inventory (547 units). This disparity is driven by two factors: 1) a critical structural inventory gap of 129 units from the lost Period 2 order (overdue by 21 periods), and 2) a significant delivery delay where no orders have arrived since Period 16. Specifically, the P15 order (150 units) and P18 order (158 units) are now 8 and 5 periods old respectively, suggesting lead times are currently far exceeding the promised 2 periods (likely 8+ or lost). Furthermore, a demand regime shift confirmed in Period 21 shows avg demand dropped from ~90 to ~55 units (recent P17-P22 avg is 53.6). To force the OR backend to place orders despite the 'ghost' pipeline units, I am using explicit parameters. I set L=3 as the planning horizon, mu_hat = 220 (calculated as (1+3) * 55 to cover 4 periods of demand), and sigma_hat = 40 to maintain service levels. This approach bypasses the OR engine's reliance on the inflated in-transit value to ensure we start replenishment for the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Lead time crisis confirmed: No arrivals for 7 periods (P17-P23); orders from P15 (8 periods ago) and P18 (5 periods ago) are significantly overdue or lost, suggesting L is effectively > 6 or supply is stalled.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of severe disruption. There have been no arrivals since Period 16, despite orders placed in Periods 15 (150 units) and 18 (158 units). The Period 2 order (129 units) is also confirmed lost. Current 'In-transit' inventory (547) includes 129 units from Period 2 and 150 units from Period 15, both of which are highly likely lost or severely delayed. This leaves approximately 268 units in actual potential transit (primarily the Period 18 order). On-hand inventory is 0 for the 7th consecutive period. Demand has shifted downwards since Period 17, averaging ~49 units. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' (547) from the 'base_stock', and 547 is much larger than any reasonable base stock for the current demand regime, the backend will fail to place new orders. To force an order and account for the supply stall and systemic inventory gap, I am setting L explicitly to 6 (reflecting the prolonged delay) and mu_hat calculation to an explicit high target. This target is designed to overcome the 547 units of 'phantom' inventory while providing coverage for (L+1) periods of demand at the current rate (~49 units/period). Base Stock goal = 547 (offset) + 343 (7 periods * 49) = 890. Given the cap mechanism, I use explicit mu_hat to push the backend to order.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Total supply stall confirmed. No arrivals for 8 periods. Pipeline inventory (547) includes at least 279 units of 'lost' inventory (P2 and P15). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~49 units since P17.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are experiencing a severe supply chain crisis with a total stall in arrivals since Period 16. The demand has also shifted to a lower regime (approx. 49 units/period) starting from Period 17. The 'In-transit' figure of 712 units is extremely misleading: it includes several lost or indefinitely delayed shipments: P2 (129 units), P6 (110 units), P15 (150 units), and P18 (158 units). Excluding these 'ghost' units, the effective pipeline is significantly lower. Furthermore, the observed lead time L has increased from 3 to effectively >8 periods. Because the OR backend relies on (In-transit + On-hand) to calculate orders, it will incorrectly refrain from ordering due to the inflated 712 units. I will use 'explicit' parameters to force a large enough order to restore inventory once the logjam breaks, while projecting demand at the current lower rate of ~50 units across a conservative lead time of 6 periods to ensure the 'base_stock' calculation (which subtracts the 712 units) still triggers an order.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Supply stall continues; no arrivals for 9 periods. Cumulative lost/stalled pipeline inventory now estimated at 547 units (P2, P6, P15, P18). Effective lead time L > 8 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is in a state of indefinite stall. No orders have arrived since Period 16 (10 consecutive periods with zero arrivals). Orders from periods as far back as Period 2 (24 periods ago), Period 6 (20 periods ago), Period 15 (11 periods ago), and Period 18 (8 periods ago) are missing. This has resulted in a massive 'In-transit' figure of 934 units which does not represent realistic future arrivals. The promised lead time of 2 is irrelevant. Explicit parameters are used to bypass the OR engine's reliance on this inflated pipeline. I set L=9 to represent the current empirical wait time since the last arrival. Demand since Period 17 has settled into a lower regime averaging ~48 units per period (N=9). mu_hat is set to (1+L)*48 = 480. sigma_hat is set conservatively to reflect the high volatility (recent std dev ~19) and the risk of the supply stall ending in a sudden bulk arrival.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Supply stall duration reached 10 periods (no arrivals since P16). Cumulative stalled pipeline inventory is 934 units, including highly likely lost orders from P2, P6, P15, and P18. Effective L is \u2265 10 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of total collapse with no arrivals observed since Period 16 (11 consecutive periods). The 'In-transit' figure of 934 units is profoundly misleading because it includes orders from as far back as Period 2 (25 periods ago) and Periods 6, 11, 15, and 18, which must be considered lost at this point. Relying on this pipeline inventory prevents the OR engine from placing any new orders. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the total in-transit quantity. This forces the (base_stock - pipeline) calculation to remain positive, triggering new orders. For demand, the regime shifted at Period 17, with the last 10 periods (P17-P26) averaging ~48 units. I will use a conservative mu_hat based on an effective L=10 and this lower demand mean to ensure the 'cap' allows sufficient ordering to restart the flow once the stall breaks, while assuming L=2 for the engine's internal calculations to maximize the order volume.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Supply stall reaches 11 periods. Pipeline inventory is 100% decoupling from arrival reality. Manual 'explicit' mu_hat override required to force orders past the inflated in-transit hurdle.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a total stall, with no arrivals since Period 16 (11 consecutive periods). While the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time is effectively infinite or at least 12 periods. The OR engine's 'inventory view' shows 1465 units in-transit, but since none have arrived for 11 periods, these orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, etc.) must be treated as lost or non-existent for planning purposes. The on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shifted to a lower regime since P17, averaging approximately 50.3 units per period (P17-P27). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the massive 'phantom' pipeline, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that exceeds the phantom in-transit (1465) plus the desired safety stock. Setting mu_hat to 2000 (roughly 40 periods of demand) is a necessary 'brute force' move to trigger the OR engine's replenishment logic despite its belief that the pipeline is full. This is a risk for future holding costs if a massive backlog arrives at once, but the immediate priority is overcoming the stockout which has persisted for 11 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Supply stall reaches 12 periods. Phantom pipeline inventory (1465 units) is now 29x the current mean demand, necessitating extreme explicit parameter overrides to trigger any procurement.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a complete breakdown, with no arrivals since Period 16 (13 consecutive periods of zero replenishment). The 'In-transit' figure of 1665 units is entirely composed of 'phantom' inventory from orders that are significantly overdue or lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P27). Actual demand has settled into a lower regime of approximately 50 units per period since Period 17. Because the OR backend subtracts the inflated 'In-transit' value from the base stock calculation, it will not place any new orders unless mu_hat is set to an extraordinarily high value that exceeds the phantom pipeline. To force a new order and attempt to break the stockout, I am setting mu_hat to 2000 (roughly 40 periods of demand) and L to 3 (the last observed functional lead time). This is a survival tactic to bypass the 'In-transit' hurdle.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Supply stall reaches 13 periods. Phantom pipeline inventory (1665 units) now exceeds 33x current mean demand. Total decoupling of system state from physical reality persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-256.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply stall that began after Period 16 has finally broken. In Period 29, 531 units arrived (ordered in Period 27), confirming a return to the promised lead time of 2 periods (arriving during P29). This arrival satisfies current demand and leaves 476 units on-hand. However, the system still tracks 1,499 units in-transit, which includes multiple 'lost' or 'ghost' orders (specifically the 129 units from P2, 110 from P6, 150 from P15, and 158 from P18). These 547 units are effectively phantom inventory that would prevent the OR backend from ordering if the base_stock calculation remains standard. Demand has settled into a lower regime of approximately 50 units per period since Period 17 (mean of P17-P29 is 49.7). Given the high on-hand inventory (476 units) relative to this demand (covers ~9 periods), we must prevent excessive ordering while acknowledging that the pipeline data is still structurally decoupled from reality. I will set L to the promised 2 periods and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the current lower demand regime (N=13). This will result in a base stock level lower than current on-hand + (inflated) in-transit, directing the backend to place an order of 0, which is appropriate given the current inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Supply stall broken at Period 29: Order from Period 27 arrived with L=2. Phantom pipeline inventory remains approximately 547 units (P2, P6, P15, P18). Demand regime remains stable at ~50 units/period since Period 17.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply stall that lasted 12 periods was broken in Period 29. Orders from P27 and P28 arrived exactly on the promised lead time of 2 periods. However, a significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains: orders from P2 (129), P6 (110), P15 (150), and P18 (158) are long overdue (ranging from 12 to 28 periods) and are confirmed lost. These 547 units are included in the 'In-transit' figure of 1299, but will never arrive. Additionally, an order from P24 (165) is now overdue by 6 periods, and P25 (222) by 5 periods, suggesting volatility still exists or these are also potential losses. Since Period 17, demand has stabilized into a lower regime averaging approximately 50 units (Mean P17-P30 \u2248 51). On-hand inventory is currently significantly high (614 units) due to the arrival of the large P27 and P28 recovery orders. This on-hand inventory alone covers over 12 periods of demand. No new orders are needed. To prevent the OR engine from reacting to the 'phantom' pipeline or placing unnecessary orders given the high on-hand stock, I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture the lower demand regime and 'default' lead time of 2, as the most recent successful arrivals were on time.

Carry-over insight: Supply stall recovery: Arrival of P27 and P28 orders confirms a return to L=2 for recent shipments. Phantom pipeline inventory remains fixed at 547 units (P2, P6, P15, P18) and should be discounted from future procurement logic.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply stall that previously paralyzed the inventory system has broken, confirming a return to a lead time (L) of 2 periods (as seen in Period 29 and 30 conclusions). However, the system's pipeline inventory remains heavily inflated by approximately 547 units from likely lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18), which the OR engine will still count as forthcoming supply. Current on-hand inventory is 584 units, which is extremely high (providing over 10 periods of cover) given the current demand regime of ~50 units/period (average demand since P17 is ~49.3). To maximize total reward, we must avoid further holding costs. I will set L to 2 (promised) and use recent demand data (N=15, covering the current low-demand regime since P17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will result in a base stock level significantly lower than our current inventory (on-hand + phantom pipeline), causing the OR engine to correctly place zero orders (order=0) until on-hand levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply recovery at Period 29 with L=2. Phantom pipeline inventory (lost orders) estimated at 547 units (P2, P6, P15, P18). Demand regime remains stable at ~50 units/period since Period 17.

However, the system's pipeline inventory (1299 units) remains significantly inflated by 'phantom' lost orders from Period 2 (129 units), Period 6 (110 units), Period 15 (150 units), Period 18 (158 units), Period 24 (165 units), and Period 25 (222 units), totaling approximately 934 units that are unlikely to arrive. The current on-hand inventory is 560 units, which at the current demand regime of ~50 units/period (average since P17 is ~48), covers over 11 periods of demand. This high stock level is a direct result of the large manual 'explicit' orders placed during the supply drought. Given the high on-hand stock and the return to L=2, further procurement is not required. I will set parameters to facilitate a natural drawdown of existing stock while using 'explicit' methods to prevent the backend from being confused by the distorted pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply return to L=2 since Period 29. Demand regime remains stable at ~48 units/period since Period 17. Phantom pipeline inventory (lost/stalled orders) estimated at 934 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25), leading to a high on-hand surplus that requires depletion.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a major disruption. Recent arrivals (P27 and P28 orders) confirm that lead time (L) has returned to the promised 2 periods. Demand has settled into a lower regime since Period 17, averaging approximately 50 units per period. However, the system currently has a significant on-hand inventory of 497 units, resulting from the bulk arrivals of P27 and P28. Additionally, the in-transit field is severely inflated by approximately 1299 units (including the long-lost P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, and P25 orders). With on-hand inventory (497) already covering nearly 10 periods of demand (at ~50 units/period), no new orders are necessary. To ensure the OR backend does not place orders, I am setting L and demand parameters to reflect the current stable state while the on-hand surplus is naturally depleted. The OR backend's inventory position (on-hand + inflated in-transit) is extremely high, so the policy will correctly result in zero orders.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following a massive disruption. Recent arrivals (P29, P30) confirm a return to the promised lead time of 2 periods. Demand has shifted into a lower regime since Period 17, averaging approximately 48-50 units per period. The primary challenge is the surplus on-hand inventory (479 units) and the presence of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (estimated at 934 units from likely lost orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25). With on-hand inventory alone covering nearly 10 periods of demand at the current rate (479 / 48 \u2248 10), and the backend's base-stock logic considering the inflated in-transit figure (1299 units), no new orders should be placed until this surplus is depleted. I am setting parameters to reflect the current demand regime (recent_N=18 to cover the period since P17) and lead time (recent_N=3), while allowing the existing stock to be consumed. No explicit overrides are needed this period as the natural logic will correctly result in zero orders given the high inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Average demand since P17 is ~48 units per period. Supply stability: Lead time L=2 confirmed for post-stall arrivals.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following a massive disruption. Recent arrivals (P27 and P28 orders) confirmed a return to the promised lead time of L=2. Demand is now in a lower regime, averaging approximately 48.4 units per period since Period 17 (N=19). Currently, the system has 419 units on-hand, which is significantly more than needed to cover the (L+1) demand window (approximately 150 units). The 'In-transit' figure of 1299 is heavily inflated by phantom inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P29 totaling ~1299 units). Because on-hand inventory is already excessively high, the goal is to allow it to deplete naturally toward a target base stock. I will set parameters to reflect the current demand regime and the stabilized lead time, knowing the OR engine will correctly calculate an order of zero until on-hand levels normalize.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following a massive 12-period stall (P17-P28), with recent arrivals (P27, P28) confirming a return to the promised lead time of 2 periods. However, significant 'phantom' inventory exists in the pipeline. Orders from P2 (129), P6 (110), P15 (150), P18 (158), P24 (165), and P25 (222) are substantially overdue and almost certainly lost. This results in 934 units of 'In-transit' inventory that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available supply. Currently, on-hand inventory is 385 units, which is 8x the average demand of ~48 units/period observed since the regime shift at P17. No new orders are needed until this on-hand surplus is depleted to service levels compatible with the current demand regime (~50 units/period). Setting L=2 (confirmed recent performance) and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the post-P17 regime (N=20). The high on-hand and phantom pipeline will naturally suppress ordering via the backend's base-stock logic without needing explicit overrides this period.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized since the major disruption, with lead times for recent successful arrivals at 2 periods. However, a significant 'phantom pipeline' of 1299 units exists, consisting of lost orders (Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 24, 25) and more recent orders (Period 26, 29). The system currently has 316 units on-hand, which is sufficient to cover approximately 6-7 periods of demand under the current low-demand regime (~48 units/period since Period 17). To avoid excessive holding costs and the OR engine factoring in the inflated 'in-transit' figure, I am maintaining mu_hat and sigma_hat at levels that prevent new orders until the existing physical surplus is depleted and the pipeline clears. I will continue using explicit parameters to bypass the decoupling between the backend's pipeline tracking and physical reality.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following a massive disruption. Recent lead times for fulfilled orders (P27, P28) returned to the promised L=2. However, a significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory exists due to lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P29). Demand has shifted to a lower regime since Period 17, averaging approximately 48 units per period (last 22 periods). Current on-hand inventory is 261 units, which covers over 5 periods of demand at the current rate. The goal is to continue depleting this surplus to minimize holding costs. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method (N=22 to capture the post-P17 regime), the base stock calculation will reflect the lower demand. The large in-transit figure (1299) will prevent new orders from being placed until the structural surplus is cleared, which is appropriate given the current overstock situation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Average demand since P17 is ~48 units per period. Supply stability: Lead time L=2 confirmed for post-stall arrivals. Phantom pipeline inventory (lost orders) remains high, necessitating use of recent demand data to avoid further over-ordering.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system state currently shows a high on-hand inventory of 199 units and an extremely inflated in-transit figure of 1299 units. This in-transit figure includes approximately 934 units from lost or stalled orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25) which have not arrived for many periods. Since Period 29, supply has normalized to the promised lead time of L=2 (P27 and P28 arrived with L=2). Demand has also stabilized in a lower regime since Period 17, averaging approximately 48 units per period. With 199 units on-hand and a target base stock for a (1+L)=3 period window (approximately 144-150 units), there is currently an inventory surplus. To prevent the OR engine from further over-ordering due to the high in-transit data and to allow the current surplus to deplete towards the target level (around 150 units), I will set the L to 2 and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the recent demand regime (last 23 samples since P17). This will likely result in an order of 0 for this period, which is appropriate given the current excess.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently recovering from a major supply stall (Periods 17-28) and a subsequent inventory surplus. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 17, averaging approximately 49 units per period (P17-P40 mean). Lead times for recent successful deliveries (P27, P28) returned to the promised 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 134 units with a massive in-transit figure of 1299. However, our carry-over insights confirm that a significant portion of this in-transit inventory (specifically orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P26 totaling 934 units) is likely lost or permanently stalled. If we use 'default' or 'recent_N' parameters, the OR engine will see 134 on-hand + 1299 in-transit = 1433 units of pipeline inventory, which far exceeds the base stock for a 49-unit demand regime. This would prevent the system from ordering until the on-hand inventory is completely depleted and the (phantom) in-transit units 'arrive'. To prevent a stockout once the 134 on-hand units are gone, we must use 'explicit' values. We calculate mu_hat for L=2 as (1+2) * 49 = 147. Since current actual pipeline (134 on-hand + ~365 viable in-transit from P29) is already > 147, the OR engine will naturally order 0 this period, which is correct as we bleed off the surplus. Using explicit values allows us to ignore the 934 phantom units in the backend's internal logic later.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime of approximately 48 units per period since Period 17 (N=25). Currently, the system has 90 units on-hand, which covers nearly 2 periods of the current demand regime. However, there is a massive 'In-transit' figure of 1299 units. As identified in previous carry-over insights, at least 934 of these units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25) are effectively lost or permanently stalled. If we use the default OR logic, the backend would subtract this 'phantom' 1299 from the target base stock, preventing any new orders from being placed until on-hand inventory is depleted and the pipeline is perceived as low. While lead time for recent arrivals has returned to L=2, the inflated pipeline necessitates a careful approach. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=25) and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and 'calculate' for L. By setting mu_hat to the recent mean, the backend's capped policy will eventually trigger orders as on-hand inventory drops, though the phantom inventory still poses a risk of starving the supply if not bypassed by explicit values. For this period, with 90 units on-hand and mean demand ~48, we are safe to maintain current parameters to bleed off inventory.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a recovery phase following a major supply stall that ended in Period 29. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~48-50 units per period since Period 17 (N=26). On-hand inventory is now 40 units, which is less than the expected demand for the current period (the mean for the last 26 periods is approximately 48.7). Pipeline inventory (1299 units) is extremely inflated due to prehistoric lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P29) and must be ignored. To ensure a new order is triggered despite this phantom inventory, I am using explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat values. I've set L to the promised 2 periods (supported by P27 and P28 arrivals). To force the order, mu_hat is set to the sum of the desired base stock (approximately (L+1) * 50 = 150) plus enough to 'cancel' the phantom pipeline (1299), totaling 1450. sigma_hat is set to a reasonable volatility estimate for the current regime (approx 15 * sqrt(3) \u2248 26).

Currently, on-hand inventory is low (14 units) following a long depletion phase of overstock. However, the 'In-transit' figure (1432 units) is severely inflated by multiple 'phantom' or lost orders (Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 24, 25, 29) totaling approximately 1432 units. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders, it will incorrectly assume we are overstocked and will not place new orders despite our low on-hand inventory. To circumvent this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. By setting mu_hat to a value higher than the phantom pipeline (1432) plus the desired base stock (approx 150), I can force the backend to place an order that covers our immediate needs. I set L=2 (promised and recent actual). I set mu_hat to 1600 to trigger a net order of roughly 150 units. Sigma_hat is set based on recent demand volatility (approx 15) scaled by sqrt(1+L), which is approx 26.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Confirmed phantom in-transit inventory of 1432 units consists of lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, and P29. Supply is operational with L=2. Demand is stable at ~48 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and we have entered a stockout (14 units sold vs 42 demand in P44). The 'In-transit' figure of 1608 units is misleadingly high due to roughly 1432 units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P29). Since Period 29, the supply chain has stabilized with a lead time (L) of 2 periods. The demand regime since Period 17 has been steady at an average of approximately 48 units per period. To counter the 'phantom' pipeline inventory and trigger necessary orders to meet demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock as (L+1) * mean_demand = 3 * 48 = 144 units. By setting mu_hat to a value that reflects this target plus the volume of lost shipments (approx 1432 + 144 = 1576), I force the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated 'in-transit' count. L is set to 2 to match the current observed stability.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an actual lead time (L) of 2 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 43 order in Period 45. Demand remains in the lower regime established since Period 17, averaging approximately 48 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 1432 units, which consists of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P29). These 1432 units are visible to the OR engine but will never arrive. To ensure the engine continues to place orders despite this inflated pipeline, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for a service level of ~80% (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) using the recent demand mean (~48) and a safety buffer. Base Stock = (L+1)*mean + z*sigma*sqrt(L+1). For L=2, mean=48, and assuming sigma~15, Base Stock \u2248 144 + 0.84*15*1.73 \u2248 165. To bypass the 1432 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 1600. This forces the OR engine to see a 'need' (1600 vs 1432+91) and place orders to maintain on-hand inventory for the final periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an actual lead time (L) of 2 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 43 order in Period 45. However, there is a massive 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 1639 units, largely comprised of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P29). Because the OR backend subtracts total in-transit from the base stock, it will not place any new orders unless I use an 'explicit' mu_hat to overcome this hurdle. Current on-hand is 53 units, and demand has been stable around 48 units/period since Period 17 (most recent demand samples: 44, 50, 26, 42, 42, 38). To maintain a safety stock that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 144 units), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order that accounts for the phantom pipeline. Total Target (Base Stock) = On-hand + In-transit + New Order. Given In-transit is 1639 and on-hand is 53, I set mu_hat to a value that forces the backend to recognize a need for fresh stock despite the inflated pipeline.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 48 with an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit inventory of 1821 units. However, there is a confirmed structural inventory gap of 1432 units due to historical lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P29). Subtracting this phantom inventory (1821 - 1432) reveals an effective pipeline of 389 units. These units correspond to orders from P44 (176), P45 (164), and P47 (182), which are following the recovered L=2 lead time pattern. Since P44 (ordered P44, arrived resolution P46) should have arrived by now but hasn't appeared in a 'conclude' message yet, and on-hand is 0, we are currently experiencing stockouts. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 48 units per period since Period 17 (N=31). To force the OR backend to place orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 as (2+1)*48 = 144 units. To bypass the 1432 units of phantom inventory, I set mu_hat to 144 + 1432 = 1576. This ensures the backend sees a requirement that exceeds the phantom pipeline.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 49, the second to last period. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime (~48 units/period) since Period 17. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1821 units is heavily inflated by approximately 1432 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost or indefinitely stalled orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P29). Recent operational history (P43 to P45) shows a reliable lead time of L=2. To overcome the inflated pipeline inventory and ensure we have stock for the final period (Period 50), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. With L=2, mu_hat needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Using the recent average demand of 48, my base stock target is roughly 144 units. However, because the OR backend subtracts the massive pipeline inventory (1821 units) from its base stock calculation, it will output zero unless mu_hat is set higher than the pipeline. Since the capped policy also limits the order, I am setting mu_hat to 2100 to force an order that compensates for the physical stockout and addresses Period 50 demand, while L is set to its proven recent value of 2.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an actual lead time (L) of 2 periods, as confirmed by orders from P43 and P27-P28. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure (2121 units) is heavily inflated by 'phantom' inventory from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P29) and recent large orders (P47, P49). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with demand since P17 averaging approximately 48 units per period (standard deviation ~15). The OR backend's capped policy will fail to order if the pipeline inventory (2121) exceeds the calculated base stock. To ensure stock availability while bypassing this inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly based on the recent demand regime (last 33 periods). I am targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 144 units). By providing an 'explicit' mu_hat that is high enough to overcome the pipeline deduction while remaining within the backend's internal 'cap' logic, I aim to maintain a consistent flow of fresh inventory despite the accounting decoupling.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Supply operates at L=2. Demand is stable at ~48 units/period since P17. Phantom in-transit inventory remains at approximately 1432 units, necessitating explicit parameter overrides to ensure procurement continues despite high theoretical pipeline levels.
