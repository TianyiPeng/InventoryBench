The orders from P40 and P41 should arrive in the next 1-2 periods.

Specifically, 80 units from P44, 40 from P45, 40 from P46, 40 from P47, and 40 from P48. Given that actual lead times recently range from 1 to 3 periods, I expect high probability of arrivals in P49 and P50 from these recent orders.
