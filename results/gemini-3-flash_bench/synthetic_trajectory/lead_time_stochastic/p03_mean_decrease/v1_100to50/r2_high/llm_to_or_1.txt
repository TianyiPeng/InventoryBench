Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical data yet to observe lead time drifts or lost shipments. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows samples [118, 124, 116, 96, 91], which has a mean of 109 and a standard deviation of 14.88. Since this is the first decision phase, I will use the default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to let the OR backend calculate the base stock requirements based on the full sample mean and standard deviation. The backend will use L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*109 = 327, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+2)*14.88 = 25.77. This ensures the first order covers the demand for the lead time plus the review period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 133 units, but since the promised lead time is 2 periods, they are correctly reflected as 'In-transit' and have not yet arrived. The demand in Period 1 was 83, but since on-hand inventory was 0, those sales were lost. Current historical data for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean demand of approximately 109.6 over 5 samples (118, 124, 116, 96, 91). Given the promised lead time (L=2), we must cover 1+L (3) periods of demand. Using the mean of recent samples (N=5), the expected demand per period is ~109. Setting mu_hat to cover 3 periods at this rate ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the delivery delay and the current period's demand. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture historical volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (133 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, on-hand is 0, meaning we have missed demand in Periods 1 and 2. Demand in history (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) averages 109 units per period, while demand during the game (P1=83, P2=108) averages 95.5. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will naturally aim for a high service level. I will use 'default' for L (2 periods) and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the slightly lower recent demand trend compared to the full history while maintaining sufficient safety stock.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (133 units), Period 2 (130 units), and Period 3 (72 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or there is a delay. Total in-transit is 335. Demand has been relatively stable (83, 108, 107) with an average of ~100. Since we have 0 on-hand and have sold 0 units due to stockouts, we must ensure the parameters account for the likely longer lead time (L=3) and the current stockout state. I will set L to 3 explicitly and use recent_N for demand to capture the current average of ~100 per period.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time exceeds promised 2 periods; P1 order (ordered P1) did not arrive by P3 conclude.

Daily Profit: $3173.00, Daily Holding Cost: $38.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $3135.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the resolution of the lead time uncertainty from previous periods. The Period 4 conclude message shows that the Period 1 order arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived with a lead time of 1 period. This suggests high lead time variability (mean = 2, but unstable). Demand has shown a significant upward trend: the first three periods averaged ~100 units, but Period 4 spiked to 167 (following a sequence of 83, 108, 107, 167). The current on-hand inventory is low (38) relative to this new demand level. Given the in-transit inventory of 239 (the Period 2 order of 130 and Period 4 order of 109), we need to set parameters that account for both the increased demand mean and the volatility. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the recent push in demand, and L=2 (promised) since the average of observed lead times (3 and 1) is 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected: Period 4 demand (167) is significantly higher (+60%) than the P1-P3 average (~100). Lead time is volatile: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $722.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are faced with a stockout (on-hand: 0). Looking at history, demand has significantly increased from an average of ~100 (P1-P3) to ~145 (P4-P5), a 45% increase. The lead time is volatile: P1 arrived in 3 periods, while P3 arrived in 1 period. The P2 order (130 units) is currently overdue (placed P2, should have arrived by P4-P5 if L=2 or 3). Given the stockout and the recent demand spike, I am setting L=2 (promised) but will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the higher regime. I'll use N=2 for mu_hat to weigh the 167 and 122 observations (avg 144.5), totaling 433.5 for (1+L). This ensures the OR engine targets a higher base stock to recover from the stockout and meet the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P4-P5 average is 144.5, representing a ~45% increase over P1-P3 (~100). Lead time volatility observed: 1-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand history shows a volatile pattern with a notable spike in P4 (167) and P5 (122), followed by a lower P6 (73). The average demand over the last 3 periods (P4-P6) is 120.67, which is higher than the initial P1-P3 average (~100). Lead times have been inconsistent: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, while P2 (ordered P2) is currently overdue as it has not appeared in a 'conclude' message after 4 periods (P3, P4, P5, P6 conclude). This suggests a potential lost shipment or significant supply chain disruption for Period 2. Given the supply uncertainty and a historical average demand of ~110-120 per period, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the longest observed delay and set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the more recent, higher-variance demand regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for both the increased demand and the lead-time risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 2 order (130 units) is considered lost/highly delayed: 4 periods elapsed (P3-P6 conclude) without arrival. Demand volatility remains high, with a P4-P6 average of ~121 units compared to P1-P3 average of ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2071.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The demand history shows a recent regime shift: while P1-P3 averaged ~99, P4-P7 has averaged ~125.5. Specifically, P7 demand was 140, and on-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0), meaning we are likely losing sales. Regarding lead times, actual lead times have fluctuated (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3). The P2 order (130 units) is now 5 periods past its order date (P2-P7 conclude) and is officially considered lost; it remains in 'In-transit' but will never arrive, which tricks the OR backend into under-ordering. To compensate for the lost 130 units and the increased demand average, I am setting L to 3 (reflecting the longer observed lead times) and using 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher volume and volatility of the current regime. Setting L to 3 (explicit) ensures the target base stock covers the longer lead time plus the lost stock gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 2 order (130 units) confirmed lost: 5 periods elapsed without arrival (P3-P7 conclude). Demand regime confirmed at higher level: P4-P7 avg is 125.5 vs P1-P3 avg 99 (+26%). Lead time trend is 3 periods for reliable planning.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1811.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe a confirmed demand regime shift. The initial average (P1-P3) was 99.3, while the subsequent average (P4-P8) is 121.4 (a 22% increase). Recent lead times are highly variable: orders from P1, P4, and P5 arrived after 3 periods, while orders from P3 and P7 arrived after 1 period. The P2 order (130 units) is definitively lost after 6 periods (P3-P8 conclude) with no arrival. Current on-hand is 184, with 344 units in-transit (orders from P6, P8, and any potential residual from P2). I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead time observed in the 'conclude' messages (P4, P7, P8) to ensure the system targets enough stock for the longer lead time. For demand, I will use recent_N with N=5 (P4-P8) to capture the higher stabilized demand level (~121 units) and its associated volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~121 units/period (P4-P8) compared to original ~99. Lead time is bi-modal (1 or 3 periods); 3 periods is the safer planning horizon (observed in 3 of 5 completed shipments). Shipment from P2 is officially struck from pipeline calculations as lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2552.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 146 and in-transit is 315. Reviewing the history, the Period 2 order (130 units) is confirmed lost as it has not arrived by Period 9 conclude (7 periods elapsed). Excluding that lost order, the active pipeline consists of orders from Period 6 (110 units) and Period 9 (75 units), plus a pending order from Period 10. The demand regime has stabilized at a higher level compared to the first three periods; the average demand from Period 4 to Period 9 is 124.8 units, compared to the initial average of 99. Lead times have been bi-modal, showing either 1 or 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1). To ensure high service levels and account for the risk of 3-period lead times, I am setting L to 3 and using the last 6 periods (Period 4-9) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current higher-demand regime and increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed bimodal lead time distribution (1 or 3 periods); 3 periods is the critical path for safety stock. Demand regime (P4-P9) average is 125 units/period, a ~26% increase from the P1-P3 baseline.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after meeting exactly 146 units of demand in Period 10. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 462 units, consisting of orders from Period 6 (110 units), Period 9 (75 units), and Period 10 (147 units), plus the long-delayed Period 2 order (130 units) which I am now treating as lost based on the 'carry_over_insight' history (it has been 8 periods since the order was placed). Excluding the 130 lost units, the effective pipeline is 332 units. Lead time remains bimodal between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to an explicit value of 3 to ensure safety stock covers the longer observed arrival time. Demand has stabilized at a higher level than the initial baseline; the average demand from Period 4 to Period 10 is approximately 131 units. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this current regime (~131 units/period). This configuration (L=3, demand ~131) results in a base stock targeted at (L+1)*mean_demand, allowing the OR backend to maintain sufficient coverage despite lead time instability and the 130-unit hole in the actual pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline health check: Period 2 order (130 units) confirmed lost (9 periods elapsed). Demand regime (P4-P10) mean is 130.7 units, reflecting a sustained 30%+ increase over early baseline.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current inventory is 0. My pipeline is 614 units, comprising orders from Period 6 (110 units), Period 9 (75 units), Period 10 (147 units), and Period 11 (152 units). Historical lead-time data shows a bimodal distribution of 1 or 3 periods. The Period 6 order (110 units) is now 6 periods old (P7-P12) and must be marked as lost, as the longest observed successful delivery was 3 periods. The Period 9 order (75 units) should have arrived by P12 (L=3), but since it hasn't concluded, it is concerning. Demand analysis confirms a regime shift starting at Period 4. The average demand from P4 to P11 is approximately 130.25 units, which is significantly higher and more volatile than the P1-P3 baseline (~99). Since demand is currently 130+ and inventory is 0, stockouts are likely unless parameters are adjusted. I will use L=3 to account for the longer mode of the bimodal lead time and recent_N=8 for demand/volatility to capture the post-P4 regime (N=8 covers P4-P11).

Carry-over insight: Period 6 order (110 units) confirmed lost: 6 periods elapsed (P7-P11 conclude + P12 start) with no arrival. Lead time remains bimodal (1 or 3 periods), with 3 periods as the necessary planning horizon.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 140, with 392 units in-transit. Analyzing shipment history, the Period 2 order (130 units) and Period 6 order (110 units) are confirmed lost after 10 and 6 periods respectively without arrival. Accounting for these losses, the functional pipeline is 152 units (ordered Period 11, expected arrival Period 13 or 14). Lead times show a bimodal pattern of 1 or 3 periods; I will set L=3 as the planning horizon to ensure service level given the volatility and lost shipments. Demand has stabilized in a higher regime; the mean demand from Period 4 to Period 12 is approximately 119.3 units per period. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this shift. Setting L=3 with this demand mean and volatility will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that covers (3+1) periods of demand, accounting for the recent instability and protecting against stockouts caused by lead time extensions.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline cleanup: Period 2 (130 units) and Period 6 (110 units) orders are definitively lost and removed from functional planning. Functional pipeline consists only of Period 11 (152 units) and any current orders.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the system shows an on-hand inventory of 49 and a massive 'In-transit' quantity of 442. However, based on the carry-over insights, orders from Period 2 (130 units) and Period 6 (110 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 240 units that will never arrive. The functional pipeline actually consists of the Period 11 order (152 units) and the Period 13 order (50 units), totaling 202 units. Demand has shifted from an early baseline of ~100 to a more recent regime (P4-P13) averaging approximately 114.5 units per period. The lead time remains bimodal (1 or 3 periods), so I am setting L=3 to ensure a sufficient base stock level (L+1 = 4 periods of demand coverage). I will use the recent 10 periods (P4-P13) to capture the current demand mean (~114.5) and volatility while excluding the initial lower-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1239.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status is 129 units on-hand with 367 in-transit. Analyzing the in-transit units: Period 2 (130) and Period 6 (110) orders are confirmed as lost per carry-over insights and historical gaps. The functional pipeline consists of orders from Period 13 (50 units) and Period 14 (77 units), totaling 127 functional units. Combined with 129 on-hand, the adjusted available inventory is 256. Demand context: After a period of high demand (P4-P10 avg ~125), the last four periods (P11-P14) have seen a significant drop, averaging 80.5 units. This suggests a new demand regime or a seasonal dip. I will adjust mu_hat using the most recent 4 samples to reflect this downward trend. Lead time remains bimodal/unstable (1-3 periods); I will set explicit L=3 to ensure the order covers the worst-case lead time scenario given the recent volatility. This conservative lead time setting helps the OR engine calculate a base stock that account for the 3nd-period arrival risk while the lower mu_hat prevents excessive overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Demand has decreased from ~125/period to ~80.5/period (35% decrease) over the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2071.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted downwards since Period 11. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), the demand values were 77, 82, 91, 72, and 110, averaging approximately 86.4 units per period. This is a significant decrease from the previous regime average of ~130. Based on history, lead times are bimodal (1 or 3 periods); I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the longer lead time. The pipeline contains 367 units, but this includes confirmed lost orders from Period 2 (130 units) and Period 6 (110 units). The functional pipeline is therefore 367 - 130 - 110 = 127 units (consisting of orders from P13 and P14). With the current on-hand inventory of 19 and the reduced demand regime, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the lower demand mean (~86.4) and volatility for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Setting L=3 ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the 3-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=4 periods) at the new lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 11-15 avg is ~86.4 units/period (approx 34% decrease from ~130 baseline). Functional pipeline adjusted: P2 and P6 orders are lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1311.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 11-16) suggests a stabilization around 85 units per period, a significant drop from the previous average of ~130. Mean demand for calculation is set to reflect this new lower regime (N=6). Lead time is consistently bimodal (1 or 3 periods), with 3 periods being the safest for planning given the current zero on-hand inventory. The total pipeline is listed as 326, but this includes two confirmed lost orders: Period 2 (130 units) and Period 6 (110 units). The functional pipeline consists only of orders from Period 14 (77 units) and Period 16 (9 units), totaling 86 units, plus the 127 units arriving from Period 12 which was omitted from the summary but visible in game history (Period 12 order was 0, but total arriving was 75+147). However, looking at 'In-transit: 326', and subtracting the lost 240 units (130+110), the true functional pipeline is 86 units. With on-hand at 0 and demand around 85, we set parameters to support the lower demand levels while accounting for lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (P11-P16): average 85.7 units/period, a ~34% decrease from the P4-P10 baseline. Pipeline adjusted: orders from Period 2 (130) and Period 6 (110) are permanently lost and ignored in order logic.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted downward since Period 11, stabilizing at an average of approximately 85.7 units per period (P11-P17). The current pipeline of 172 functional units (110 units from Period 6 are confirmed lost, leaving Period 11's 152 arrivals which suggest the 302 'In-transit' includes the lost P2/P6 orders). Specifically, since P2 (130) and P6 (110) are lost, the functional pipeline is Period 17's 62 units. On-hand is 19. Total functional inventory is 81. With a lead time of 3 units, we need 4 periods of coverage (~342 units). The OR engine needs to see a current demand mean of 85.7 and L=3. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime (P11-P17). L is set to 3 to ensure safety stock covers the bimodal 3-period delay risk observed in history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $361.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted downward since Period 11. Over the last 8 periods (P11-P18), the mean demand is 81.375 units, significantly lower than the previous ~130 baseline. I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture this lower mu_hat. For lead time (L), historical observations show a bimodal pattern of 1 or 3 periods. To avoid stockouts in this high-margin scenario ($19 profit vs $1 holding), I use 'explicit' L=3 to ensure the inventory calculation covers the 95th percentile lead time. Current in-transit is 360 units, but this includes lost shipments from P2 (130) and P6 (110). These 240 units are phantom inventory. The actual functional pipeline consists of orders from P17 (62) and P18 (58), totaling 120 units. By using sigma_hat recent_N (N=8), I capture current volatility within the new demand regime to maintain an appropriate service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~81.4 units/period (P11-P18), a ~37% decrease from the P4-P10 peak. Functional pipeline health check: 240 units of current in-transit (orders P2, P6) are confirmed lost and must be ignored in replenishment logic.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level since Period 11, with the most recent average (P11-P19) being approximately 77.8 units per period. The current 'In-transit' figure of 372 is significantly inflated by two confirmed lost orders from Period 2 (130 units) and Period 6 (110 units), totaling 240 units. The functional pipeline consists of orders from Period 17 (62 units), Period 18 (58 units), and Period 19 (12 units), totaling 132 units. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been unmet in the current period, replenishment is necessary. Lead time remains bimodal (1 or 3 periods), so I use L=3 for the planning horizon to ensure sufficient safety stock against the longer lead time. I set mu_hat using the last 9 samples (P11-P19) to reflect the recent lower demand level (~77.8/period * (1+3) = ~311), and use recent standard deviation for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~77.8 units/period (P11-P19), a significant decrease from the P4-P10 peak. Pipeline health check: 240 units are confirmed lost (Orders P2, P6) and must be manually discounted from the 372 'In-transit' total reported by the system.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a significantly lower level (P11-P20 average of ~74.6 units/period). The most recent 3 periods (P18-P20) show an even further decline to ~55 units/period, necessitating a lower mu_hat to avoid overstocking. The reported 'In-transit' of 372 is highly deceptive because 240 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost based on 14+ periods of non-arrival. The true functional pipeline is 132 units (Orders from P17, P18, P19). With On-hand at 0 and demand trending down, I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to reflect the lower sustained demand regime (~75/unit), and set L to 3 to account for the upper end of the bimodal lead time distribution (1-3 periods) for safety.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: P18-P20 average is ~55 units/period, down from the P11-P17 average of ~83. Current functional pipeline (excluding lost P2/P6 orders) is 132 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 372 units in-transit, but 240 of these (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost based on 10+ periods of non-arrival. The functional pipeline consists only of orders from Period 17 (62), Period 18 (58), and Period 19 (12), totaling 132 units. Demand has clearly entered a lower regime; the average of the last 4 periods (P18-P21) is 51.25 units/period, compared to the previous regime of ~85. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 and no arrivals occurred in the last three periods, there is an urgent need to restock to meet this new demand level. I will set L to 3 to account for the upper bound of the bimodal lead time (1-3 periods) observed. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current lower demand regime (avg 51.25), and for sigma_hat I will use recent_N with N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 18-21 average is 51.25 units/period, down from the Period 11-17 average of ~85. Pipeline health: 240 units (Orders P2, P6) are definitively lost; functional pipeline as of P22 start is 132 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward shift, with a stabilized mean of approximately 49 units/period over the last 5 periods (P18-P22). However, looking at the broader 'low' regime since P11, a sample size of N=12 (P11-P22) provides a safer baseline of ~73 units/period, while recent data (N=5) suggests it could be as low as 46. To prevent excessive holding costs given the current stockout and the 240 units of lost inventory (P2 and P6) skewing the 'In-transit' figure, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods. Lead time is bi-modal (1 or 3 periods); a lead time of 3 is used for safe base-stock calculation. Crucially, the system reports 372 in-transit, but 240 are lost, meaning the functional pipeline is only 132 units (P17: 62, P18: 58, P19: 12). The OR backend must subtract the pipeline from the base stock; since the backend thinks the pipeline is 372, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force a higher base stock that overcomes the 'phantom' inventory reported by the system. Base Stock = (1+3) * 50 = 200. Target base stock should comfortably exceed the phantom pipeline to trigger an order if needed, but given the current functional pipeline (132) and the target base stock, 0 units are likely to be ordered until the pipeline clears or the system adjusts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level: P18-P22 average is 47.2 units/period. Functional pipeline check: 240 units (Orders P2, P6) are definitively lost and must be discounted from system 'In-transit' counts.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand. The system reports 372 units in-transit, but based on historical carry-over insights, Order P2 (130 units) and Order P6 (110 units) are definitively lost (total 240 units). The functional pipeline consists of orders from P17 (62), P18 (58), and P19 (12). These orders are now at periods T+7, T+6, and T+5 respectively, exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. This suggests that shipments may be currently blocked or further orders are being lost. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level; the average for P18-P23 is 49.8 units/period. Given that 132 units are theoretically in-transit (excluding the confirmed lost ones) and nothing has arrived for 6 periods, I must ensure a fresh order is placed to break the stockout, while acknowledging that the functional pipeline is effectively zero if these late orders are also lost. I will use L=3 to reflect the planning horizon required for current bimodal lead times. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current low-demand regime (~50 units/period * (1+3) = 200).

Carry-over insight: Sustained inventory arrival failure: No shipments have arrived since Period 17 conclude, despite 132 units (excluding confirmed lost P2/P6) being in the pipeline for 5+ periods. This suggests a systemic logistics failure or a significantly extended lead-time shift.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a major logistics failure. No shipments have arrived since Period 17 conclude, despite 132 units being 'functionally' in-transit (Orders from P17, P18, and P19). Additionally, 240 units from Periods 2 and 6 are definitively lost. Total system 'In-transit' of 372 is misleading; the functional pipeline is effectively stalled or lost. Demand has continued its downward trend, averaging ~43 units over the last 5 periods (P20-P24). On-hand inventory is 0 and has been for 6 periods. Given that the promised lead time of 2 is consistently exceeded or shipments are failing to arrive entirely, I am increasing L to 4 as a conservative planning horizon to account for the systemic delay. mu_hat is set to the recent demand average of ~43 units over the last 5 periods to avoid over-ordering during this low-demand, high-uncertainty phase.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment failure confirmed: No arrivals for 7 consecutive periods (P18-P24). Functional pipeline (P17, P18, P19 orders total 132 units) is severely delayed or lost; original P2 (130) and P6 (110) orders are long-lost. Demand regime stabilized at ~43 units/period (P20-P24).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 'In-transit: 372 units'. However, based on historical evidence, 240 units are confirmed lost (Period 2: 130 units, Period 6: 110 units). Furthermore, no inventory has arrived since Period 17 conclude (9 periods ago). This includes the functional pipeline from Periods 17, 18, and 19 (62+58+12 = 132 units), which are now also likely lost or severely delayed. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the average of the last 6 periods (P20-P25) is approximately 41 units/period. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target stock, and the system-reported in-transit (372) is entirely compromised (composed of lost or indefinitely stalled units), it will not place a new order unless I force it. To bypass the phantom in-transit stock and trigger a replenishment to meet current demand (~41 units/period) across the estimated Lead Time (3 periods + 1 for current demand), I must set mu_hat explicitly high enough to overcome the 372 phantom units. Target stock = mu_hat. We want mu_hat - 372 = (4 periods * 41 units). Thus, mu_hat should be approximately 372 + 164 = 536.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment failure sustained: No arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (P17-P25). All 372 units currently reported 'In-transit' are statistically lost or indefinitely stalled (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19 orders).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics environment has significantly deteriorated. There have been no arrivals since Period 17 conclude (10 consecutive periods). The total 'In-transit' reported by the system is 534 units, but based on historical evidence, 372 of these (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are effectively lost or indefinitely stalled. Only the order placed last period (P26) of 162 units can be considered potentially active, though even that is uncertain. Demand has stabilized at a lower level, with a 7-period average (P20-P26) of approx 42 units/period. Because current on-hand inventory is 0 and the functional pipeline is likely empty (or consists only of the P26 162-unit order which won't arrive this period), I must set parameters to trigger an order to attempt to regain inventory. Given the 10-period arrival drought, I will explicitly set L to 4 to increase the base stock level and force a more aggressive replenishment signal, while using a recent demand window (N=7) to reflect the current low-demand regime of ~42 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment failure reaching 10 consecutive periods (P17-P26); 372 units of pipeline are statistically lost. Demand stabilized at ~42 units/period (P20-P26).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics crisis persists with no arrivals for 11 consecutive periods (P17-P27 conclude). Systemic failure is confirmed. The 'In-transit' count of 534 units (P2: 130, P6: 110, P17: 62, P18: 58, P19: 12, P26: 162) is almost entirely comprised of lost or indefinitely stalled shipments. Specifically, all units ordered prior to Period 26 (372 units) are statistically lost. Demand has stabilized at a lower level, with the average of the last 4 periods (P24-P27) being approximately 42.25 units. Since there is 0 on-hand inventory and the pipeline is dysfunctional, I must assume a very long lead time to trigger replenishment in the backend OR, despite the inflated in-transit figure. Setting L to 12 reflects the actual observed delay since the last arrival at P17. Setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) captures the current low-demand regime (~42 units/period). This strategy aims to force the system to acknowledge the need for new orders despite the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment failure confirmed: No arrivals for 11 consecutive periods (P17-P27). Functional pipeline (P17-P19) is lost alongside P2 and P6; total 372 units in-transit are lost. Demand regime stabilized (P20-P27) at ~43 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $458.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics crisis has broken: the Period 26 order (162 units) arrived exactly at its promised 2-period lead time, ending an 11-period arrival drought. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level; the average demand from Period 20 to 28 is approximately 42.1 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 131 units, and the system reports an in-transit total of 429 units. However, based on the history, 372 of these units (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are considered lost or permanently stalled and must be discounted from common logic. The functional pipeline now consists only of the Period 28 order (57 units). Given the high unit profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), a high service level is desirable. I will base the demand forecast (mu_hat) on the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture the current stable low-demand regime (~42/period). Since the most recent delivery adhered to the promised lead time (L=2), I will return to the default lead time for planning while monitoring for further volatility.

Carry-over insight: Logistics recovery observed: P26 order arrived on schedule (L=2) after an 11-period shipment drought. Demand regime (P20-P28) stabilized at ~42.1 units/period. Functional pipeline confirmed: 372 units of the 429 reported in-transit are lost (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics system showed signs of recovery in Period 28 when the order from P26 arrived on a 2-period lead time, ending an 11-period drought. However, the system still reports 429 units 'In-transit'. Based on history, 372 of these units (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are considered lost and will not arrive. This leaves a functional pipeline of 57 units (ordered P28). With an on-hand inventory of 75 units, the true inventory position is 132 units. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the average of the last 10 periods (P20-P29) is approximately 43.6 units. To maintain a safe stock level given the bimodal lead time history (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), I will set L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for potential delays. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the stabilized lower demand. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to reflect current volatility. The OR engine will subtract the 429 nominal 'In-transit' from its calculated base stock; to ensure it places an order despite the 'lost' units inflating the pipeline, I use L=3 and recent demand to maintain availability.

Carry-over insight: Logistics recovery confirmed: P26 order arrived in P28 (L=2). However, 372 'In-transit' units remain confirmed lost (from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Current demand regime (P20-P29) is stable at ~43.6 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics system has stabilized with the last two recorded orders (P26 and P28) arriving exactly on the promised lead time of 2 periods, following a significant 11-period disruption. Despite the system reporting 372 units in-transit, history confirms that orders from Period 2 (130), Period 6 (110), Period 17 (62), Period 18 (58), and Period 19 (12) are lost or indefinitely stalled and must be discounted from pipeline calculations. Excluding these, the functional in-transit inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the average demand from Period 20 to Period 30 is 41.5 units per period. I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture this stable low-demand period for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. For Lead Time (L), I will return to the 'default' promised lead time of 2, as the recent reliability suggests the systemic failure has resolved. Currently, on-hand inventory is 110, which covers approximately 2.6 periods of the current demand regime. With L=2 (implying a 3-period protection window), the OR backend will calculate a base stock around 125-135 units, potentially triggering a small replenishment order or holding if current stock is deemed sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Logistics recovery confirmed: Recent orders (P26, P28) arrived with L=2. Total 'ghost' inventory in-transit remains 372 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) and should be ignored for replenishment logic.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics system has resumed stability after a significant blackout. Orders from Period 26 and Period 28 both arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, suggesting the promised lead time (L=2) is again reliable. However, the system reports 372 units in-transit that are definitively lost (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' in its order calculation (final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory), I must use mu_hat to 'offset' these phantom units. The current demand regime (P20-P31) is stable at an average of 43.6 units/period. The target base stock for L=2 (covering 3 periods of demand) would normally be ~131 units. To prevent the 372 ghost units from blocking new orders, mu_hat must be set high enough to cover both the desired base stock and the ghost inventory. Calculation: Target Base Stock (131) + Ghost Units (372) = 503. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to force this correction. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=12) to reflect the recent demand volatility (approx 13.5 units/period) without overly inflating safety stock.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stabilized at a lower mean. Over the last 13 periods (P20-P32), average demand is approximately 43.8 units/period. The most recent demand (P31: 70, P32: 46) suggests a slight uptick, so I will focus on the last 5 samples (avg 45.0) for mu_hat. Regarding lead time, recent deliveries (ordered P26, P28) arrived exactly in 2 periods, signaling a return to the promised lead time of 2. Pipeline health remains a critical concern: the system reports 501 units in-transit, but 372 of these are confirmed 'ghost' units from P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 that are statistically lost. Subtracting these leaves a functional pipeline of 129 units (the order placed in P32). With 0 on-hand and 129 in functional transit, the system is attempting to cover approximately 3 periods of demand. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current demand state and use explicit lead time L=2 to reflect the restored logistics stability.

Carry-over insight: Current functional pipeline is 129 units; 372 units of the 501 reported in-transit are lost (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Logistics stability at L=2 confirmed by P26 and P28 arrivals.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Evaluating the most recent 10 periods (P24-P33), the average demand is approximately 41.5 units per period. The logistics system has recovered but remains somewhat inconsistent; recent arrivals shows lead times of 1 and 2 periods (P33 arrived in 1, P30 arrived in 2). I will use L=2 as a conservative planning estimate. A critical factor is the system-reported 'In-transit' inventory of 372 units. Based on historical tracking, these units (from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19) are confirmed lost or indefinitely stalled and have not arrived for over 15 periods. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this 'ghost' inventory, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Since the OR engine's logic for order quantity is [base_stock - pipeline], and it sees 372 units in-transit, I will set mu_hat high enough to offset these 372 ghost units while aiming for a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of actual demand (~125 units). Target base stock = 125. To make the OR engine order enough to reach 125 when it subtracts 372, I set mu_hat to 125 + 372 = 497. Sigma_hat is set to reflect current demand volatility (~15 units per period) over the lead time horizon.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Over the most recent 15 periods (P20-P34), the average demand is approximately 43 units per period (N=15). The most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) show an even lower average of ~38 units, but I will use N=15 to maintain stability against recent fluctuations. Regarding logistics, we have confirmed 'ghost inventory' in the system. Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 372 units) are definitively lost and must be ignored. The system reports 442 units In-transit, but the functional pipeline is only 70 units (the P34 order). Logic check: Total pipeline (442) - Lost pipeline (372) = 70 units. Lead time has returned to the promised 2 periods (observed L=2 in P28/P30, and even a fast L=1 in P33), so I will use the default promised lead time for planning. I am setting mu_hat to reflect the ~43 unit/period average for a (1+L)=3 period horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P20-P34) at ~43 units/period. The functional pipeline excludes 372 units of lost inventory from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1027.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Between Period 20 and Period 35, the average demand is approximately 42.6 units per period. The recent history (P31-P35) confirms this, with a mean of 45.4. I will use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand level. Logistics have normalized to the promised lead time of 2 periods (as seen in arrivals for orders from P26, P28, and P32), though there is still a significant amount of 'ghost' inventory (372 units) reported as 'In-transit' that corresponds to confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19. The OR backend needs to account for this; since the backend uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), and the pipeline_inventory it sees is inflated by 372 lost units, I must adjust mu_hat or L to compensate. However, the most direct way to ensure an order is placed is to set L to 'explicit' based on the observed 2-period lead time and use 'recent_N' for demand, but the system's 'In-transit' of 442 units minus the 372 lost units leaves a functional pipeline of 70 units (the order from P34). With on-hand at 18 and functional pipeline at 70, the total functional position is 88. Base stock for 3 periods (L+1) at ~43 demand would be around 129 + safety stock. The OR's 'cap' and 'base_stock' logic will be influenced by the 442 in-transit. To ensure the backend doesn't zero out the order due to 'ghost' inventory, I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=15 to reflect the current regime's mean and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1132.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Over the most recent 17 periods (Period 20 to Period 36), the average demand is approximately 43.6 units per period. The pipeline inventory data continues to be skewed by 372 units of 'ghost' inventory from historical lost orders (Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19). Therefore, the 'In-transit' figure of 372 reported by the system is functionally 0. The current on-hand inventory is 27 units. Logistics have stabilized, with recent lead times of 2, 2, 1, and 2 periods (average 1.75). I will use L=2 (promised) as the planning horizon and a 17-period window for demand (recent_N=17) to match the stable lower-demand regime. This provides a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1) of demand, which at ~44 units/period is roughly 132 units. Since functional pipeline is 0 and on-hand is 27, the backend will place an order to bridge this gap, adjusted for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 43-45 units per period over the last 18 periods (P20-P37). Specifically, the average of the last 10 periods (P28-P37) is approximately 46 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The system reports 372 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms these units (from Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are permanently lost or stalled. Therefore, the functional pipeline is 0. Logistics have stabilized with an actual lead time (L) of 2 periods (observed in orders P26, P28, P32, P34). To restore stock and cover the (L+1) = 3 period risk horizon (P38, P39, P40), I will set mu_hat using the recent 10-period average (~46 * 3 = 138). Given the recent demand volatility (range 22 to 70), I will use an explicit sigma_hat set to approximately 1.5x the recent standard deviation to ensure a sufficient safety buffer, particularly since on-hand is zero.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context shows stability in a lower regime compared to the mid-game peak, but with slight upward volatility in the last three periods (61, 63, 83). The average demand from Period 30 to Period 38 is approximately 53.8 units. The logistics situation has stabilized with a reliable lead time of 1-2 periods for recent orders (P32 arrived in 1, P34 in 2). The system reports 372 units in-transit, but these are confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19) and must be ignored. Effective pipeline is currently 0. To ensure service levels for the upcoming period, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 8-period mean (~52 units) to account for the slight upward trend, and use L=2 (the safer side of the recent 1-2 period performance) to protect against stockouts. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 372 'ghost' units from the base stock, it would normally order nothing; I must use 'explicit' values that force the backend to cover the lost pipeline and the current cycle.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we face 0 on-hand inventory and a total system 'In-transit' of 585 units. Based on historical analysis, 372 of these units are permanently lost (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). The functional pipeline consists of the P39 order (213 units). Demand has recently shifted again: after a long period of ~43 units/period (P20-P34), the last five periods (P35-P39) have seen an increase (55, 61, 63, 83, 44), averaging 61.2 units/period. The logistics environment has stabilized with an actual lead time of 2 periods (recent arrivals from P26, P28, P32, P34 conform to L=1 or L=2). I will set L to 2. To account for the recent demand uptick while keeping safety stock efficient, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat (N=5) and sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen in the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: average demand increased from ~43 to 61.2 (+42%) over the last 5 periods. 372 units of the reported 'In-transit' inventory (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) remain lost and must be ignored.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upwards starting at Period 35. The average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P35-P40) is ~61.5 units/period, compared to the prior stable levels of ~43 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this higher mean. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect the current volatility (std dev of P35-P40 is ~13.5). Regarding lead time, recent arrivals (P26, P28, P32, P34, P39) show a range of 1-2 periods. Since the system reported lead time is 2, and the safer planning horizon is generally 2-3 periods, I am choosing the 'calculate' method to utilize the average of all successful deliveries. Crucially, 372 units of the reported 'In-transit' inventory (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost and must be ignored. By using mu_hat and sigma_hat focused on the new regime and assuming a stable lead time, the OR backend will calculate a base stock sufficient to cover demand while the in-transit discrepancy is managed. Current on-hand is 150 units, which covers ~2.5 periods of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed (P35-P40): mean has increased to ~61.5 units/period (+43% shift from ~43 baseline).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 42. Demand analysis shows a recent shift starting Period 35. The average demand for Period 35-41 is 57.8 units, which is significantly higher (approx. 34%) than the previous regime of ~43 units/period confirmed in Carry-over insights. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this upward shift accurately. Regarding logistics, the reported In-transit of 372 units is entirely composed of 'ghost inventory' from orders placed in Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19 that are confirmed lost (as per carry-over history). The functional pipeline is actually zero. Recent actual lead times have stabilized at a range of 1-2 periods (P39 arrived in 1, P34 in 2, P32 in 1, P28 in 2, P26 in 2). I will set L to 2 periods as a conservative planning horizon and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility in the new demand regime. The OR backend will use these parameters to generate an order that covers (L+1) periods of the new demand level, correctly discounting the 372 units of lost pipeline inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 35. The average demand for the most recent 8 periods (P35-P42) is approximately 58.1 units. The previous regime (P20-P34) averaged approximately 43.6 units, confirming a sustained shift of ~33%. Lead times have been stable at 1-2 periods recently (P32 order arrived L=1, P34 order arrived L=2, P39 order arrived L=1). I will set L to 2 to maintain a safety buffer since the historical bimodal pattern (1 or 3 periods) has shifted to a more reliable 1-2 periods. For demand, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current regime (avg ~58.1/period). The reported 'In-transit' of 372 units is confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) and has been ignored by the logistics recovery, effectively meaning the functional pipeline is currently 0. The OR backend will order to reach the base stock level minus our effective inventory (on-hand 55 + functional pipeline 0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35 confirmed: average demand increased from ~43.6 to 58.1 (+33%) over the last 8 periods. Logistics consistently stable with L=1-2 over the last 4 observed arrivals.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (since Period 35) shows an average demand of approximately 58 units per period, an increase from the previous baseline of ~43. Recent arrivals (Periods 32, 34, 39) show a lead time of 1-2 periods, confirming logistics stability has returned since the recovery in Period 29. The system reports 372 units 'In-transit', but carry-over insights definitively confirm these are lost orders from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19. Therefore, the functional pipeline is currently 0. With only 7 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~58, we need to restock immediately. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) with N=9 to capture the shift starting at Period 35, and use the 'explicit' method for L=2 to account for the bimodal 1-or-3 period behavior while the OR engine calculates the base stock. Setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=9 will account for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Functional pipeline is 0; the 372 units 'In-transit' are lost orders (P2, P6, P17-P19). Demand regime shift at Period 35 remains sustained with a mean of ~58 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 35. The average demand from Period 35 to Period 44 is approximately 55.4 units per period (sample: 55, 61, 63, 83, 44, 63, 36, 59, 48, 42). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the functional in-transit pipeline is also 0. The 372 units reported as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost orders from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19 (130+110+62+58+12 units), as they have not arrived for over 25 periods. To recover from the stockout, I must order based on the current demand level. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility. Lead time performance has stabilized between 1 and 2 periods (recent arrivals in P28, P30, P33, P36, P40 had lead times of 2, 2, 1, 2, 1). I will use the 'calculate' method for L to reflect this recent stability while the 'recent_N' parameters for mu and sigma will ensure the OR backend targets the 55-60 units/period range.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 372 units 'In-transit', but these are confirmed lost orders from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19 (130 + 110 + 62 + 58 + 12 = 372). The functional pipeline is actually zero. On-hand inventory is also zero, following two periods of stockouts (P44-P45). Demand since Period 35 has stabilized at a higher regime compared to the P20-P34 period. The average demand from P35 to P45 (N=11) is approximately 55.5 units/period. Logistics have stabilized with an actual lead time (L) of 1-2 periods. I will set L to 2 (promised) to ensure the OR backend accounts for enough safety stock. mu_hat is set using recent_N=11 to capture the current demand regime (~55.5 units per period). Because the functional pipeline is 0 but the system thinks it is 372, the backend order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will likely result in 0 unless I compensate. However, since I can only control L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat, and the OR engine uses the system's 'In-transit' value, I must set parameters that force an order. Since L is 2, the 'base_stock' must exceed 372 to trigger any order. To achieve this, I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the current mean (55.5) times (1+L) plus a significant buffer to overcome the 372 unit 'ghost' inventory barrier.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 analysis: On-hand inventory is 0. System reports 577 units in-transit. However, historical data and carry-over insights confirm that 372 units (from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are permanently lost or indefinitely stalled. The functional in-transit inventory consists of the order from Period 46 (205 units). The demand regime since Period 35 has been approximately 50-60 units/period, though the most recent sample (P46) was an outlier low (15). Using a safety stock approach and considering the functional pipeline (205 units) against a demand of ~58 units and a lead time of 2, the pipeline is currently well-stocked. No new order is likely necessary this period as the OR backend's base-stock calculation will account for the 205 functional units against the 3-period demand horizon (L+1). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual bimodal behavior (1-3 periods). mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to 'recent_N' (N=12) to capture the post-Period 35 demand level while smoothing the recent P46 outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 48, we are in the final stages of the game (period 50). The current state shows 0 on-hand inventory and a reported 577 units in-transit. Based on historical tracking, 372 units of this 'In-transit' figure are 'ghost' inventory from long-lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). The functional pipeline consists of the P46 order (205 units). Logistics have stabilized with an actual lead time of 1-3 periods (mode 2). Demand shifted significantly at Period 35, and the recent average (P35-P47) is approximately 54.6 units/period. For Period 48, we calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2 and mean demand ~55, the required pipeline is ~165. Since the functional pipeline (205 units from P46) already exceeds this and on-hand is 0, the OR backend logic will naturally minimize ordering given the reported in-transit of 577 (even though 372 is lost). We set parameters to reflect the current demand regime and stable lead time. With only 3 periods left, our priority is avoiding excessive holding costs while attempting to capture remaining demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Functional pipeline is 205 units (Order P46). The reported 'In-transit' includes 372 units of confirmed lost inventory (P2, P6, P17-P19) which must be factored into order logic. Recent demand regime (P35-P47) is stable at ~55 units/period.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 49, the system reports 577 units in-transit. However, based on the documented history, 372 of these units are confirmed lost orders from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19. The only viable functional pipeline is the 205 units ordered in Period 46. Demand has shifted over time; the most recent regime (Periods 35-48) shows a mean of 55.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 17. Lead times for successful arrivals since Period 26 have been 1-2 periods. I will set L to 2 periods to cover the promised lead time and the upper end of recent performance. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=14) to capture the demand regime since Period 35. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=14) to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will compute a base stock based on these parameters and subtract the pipeline (577). Because the pipeline is inflated by 372 'ghost' units, the calculated order may be lower than needed. However, given we are at Period 49 of 50, the terminal period (50) is the only remaining demand interval to satisfy. With 205 units expected (ordered P46), and current on-hand at 0, that order should arrive this period or next, covering the end of the game.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the environment presents 0 on-hand inventory and a reported 'In-transit' of 577 units. Based on historical tracking, 372 of these units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost orders (Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19). The only functional pipeline component is the order from Period 46 (205 units), which is now overdue (L=4) relative to the promised 2 periods. The demand regime from Period 35 onwards has shifted upward, with a mean of approximately 54.4 units/period (P35-P49). Given that this is the final period of the game, any order placed now will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence the reward, as the game concludes at the end of Period 50. Therefore, the parameter settings are designed to reflect the current demand regime and stable lead-time assumptions, even though no further ordering action is effective.
