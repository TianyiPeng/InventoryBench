Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for the 'chips(Regular)' SKU. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows a mean of 109 units (118, 124, 116, 96, 91). There is a slight downward trend in the last two periods, but with only 5 samples, I will use all available history to establish a baseline. Since lead time (L) is 2, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. For mu_hat, using the 'default' method will calculate (1+L) * mean_demand = 3 * 109 = 327. For sigma_hat, the 'default' method will use the standard deviation of all samples adjusted for the lead time square root. No shipments are in transit yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 133 units. Since the promised lead time is 2, we expect this order to arrive during Period 3 (visible at Period 4 start). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 133 units in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 83 units, which matches the historical average (~109 over 5 samples, but specific sample Period 1 was 118; the game history P1 demand was 83). Since historical demand shows a slight downward trend (118 to 91 in the provided pre-game samples) and the first actual game period was 83, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture this lower volume and avoid over-ordering, especially given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50%. I will use the promised lead time (default) as there is no evidence yet of delays.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (133 units) and Period 2 (131 units). Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message (read at Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all demand in Periods 1 and 2 has been lost. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including the 2 observed) shows a mean of 109 (118, 124, 116, 96, 91). I will use the default lead time (2) and calculate parameters based on the available history of 5 samples to stabilize the base stock level against the holding cost, which is equal to the profit ($1.0).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2. Orders placed in Period 1 (133 units) and Period 2 (131 units) have not yet arrived. Following the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (viewable at the start of Period 4). However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates either a delay or that the order arrives later in the sequence. Applying the timing example: an order placed in P1 with lead_time=2 arrives during P3 resolution and is confirmed in the P3 conclude message. Since it shows 0, the actual lead time is likely > 2. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including provided samples) are: 118, 124, 116, 96, 91. The realized demand in P1-P3 was 83, 108, 107. Mean demand is approx 106. Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 297. Since we have no stock and existing orders are delayed, I will maintain the base stock logic but use 'calculate' for Lead Time to allow the backend to adjust if it tracks the arrival delay, and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the slightly lower recent levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $166.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of the history shows that the promised lead time of 2 periods is inconsistent. Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 3), while Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 1). Currently, 131 units ordered in Period 2 are in-transit and overdue based on the promised lead time. Demand samples show significant variance (83, 108, 107, 167) with an average of approximately 116. Since inventory is at 0 and we are facing high demand volatility, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most relevant demand data (N=4) and keep the lead time estimation at the promised 2 periods (using 'calculate' to incorporate the observed 1 and 3 period arrivals) to balance the base stock calculation.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for chips(Regular) shows an average of approximately 117.8 units/period (83, 108, 107, 167, 122). There was a notable demand spike in Period 4 (167), but Period 5 returned closer to the mean (122). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 307 units in-transit. Regarding lead times: the promised lead time is 2. However, P1's order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), and P3's order also arrived in Period 4 (L=1). P2's order of 131 units is still missing (ordered P2, currently P6, suggesting L > 3 or a lost shipment). Since the promised lead time (2) has been unreliable and we've faced stockouts in Period 5, I will utilize 'recent_N' for demand to capture the slightly higher recent volumes and 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to use the observed average (currently (3+1)/2 = 2) while I monitor for the missing P2 shipment. I am setting N=5 for demand to encompass all available samples and stabilize the forecast.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 470 units in transit. Looking at the history, demand has fluctuated between 73 and 167. Period 4 saw a significant spike (167), but the most recent two periods (5 and 6) had demands of 122 and 73. The average demand across all 6 periods is approximately 110. Regarding lead time, the promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1 arrived after 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived after 1 period. Notably, the order from Period 2 (131 units) is still missing after 4 periods (it should have arrived by Period 5 if L=3), suggesting it might be lost or severely delayed. Orders from Period 5 (176) and Period 6 (163) are currently in transit. Given the inventory is empty and one large order is potentially lost, I will stick to the promised lead time (L=2) for calculations to avoid over-ordering through the 'cap' mechanism, while using a 6-period recent window to capture the average demand of ~110. This results in a mu_hat of approx 330 (110 * 3) to cover current and lead time demand.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is zero, and we have significant unmet demand from previous periods. Examining the lead time history: the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), while the order from Period 3 also arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). The promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 2 (131 units) is now 6 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting it may be lost. The orders from Period 5 (176 units) and Period 6 (163 units) are within a reasonable window for a 2-3 period lead time. Demand is relatively stable but shows volatility (mean ~112, std ~30). Since we are currently stock-out with high in-transit (470 units), including the potentially lost Period 2 order, I will set L to 3 to reflect the observed longer lead time and use recent_N for demand to capture the current average. This will help the OR backend set a slightly higher base stock to account for the supply uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is inconsistent (observed 1 to 3+ periods); Period 2 order (131 units) likely lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 71 units following the arrival of the Period 5 order (176 units). The lead time remains highly unstable: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P5 arrived in 3 periods. The P2 order (131 units) remains missing and is likely lost. Demand is currently averaging approximately 109 units per period across the history (8 samples), with no clear seasonal trend yet. Given the high volatility in arrivals (L varies between 1 and 3+) and the loss of the P2 shipment, I will use an explicit lead time L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high delivery risk. Demand is set using recent_N=5 to capture the most recent mean (~108 units) which aligns with the overall average, and sigma_hat is set to default to capture the variance across the full history.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time instability: Observed L values of 1, 3, and 3; Shipment ordered in P2 (131 units) is over 6 periods late and is deemed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 with 0 on-hand inventory and 415 units in-transit. Historical lead times have been highly volatile: 1, 3, 1, and 3 periods, with one shipment from Period 2 (131 units) now almost certainly lost. This loss is significant because it leads to inventory stockouts. Currently, 284 units (from Period 6 and 9) are in the pipeline, as the 131 units are likely non-recoverable. Since the promised lead time is 2, but the average observed (excluding the lost one) is roughly 2.2, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the risk of delays and the lost shipment, ensuring the OR engine targets a higher inventory position. For demand forecasting, I'll use the last 5 periods (Period 5-9) which average ~116.6 units, or the full history (all 9 periods) which averages ~116. The demand appears stable around ~115-120 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture a stable mean while acknowledging the significant variance (std ~30). The explicit L=3 will push the base stock to cover (1+3)=4 periods of demand (~460-480 units), which is necessary given the stockout at Period 9 and the missing P2 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Shipment loss of 131 units (ordered P2) confirmed as it is 8 periods since order. Actual lead time varies between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand is volatile but averages around 120 units per period. Lead time (L) is unstable: observed values are 1, 3, and 3 periods, with a major shipment (131 units from P2) confirmed lost. Currently, there are 466 units in-transit (orders from P6, P9, and P10). The P6 order is now at L=5, suggesting it may also be lost or severely delayed. Because of the frequent stockouts and lost shipments, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the realistic arrival delay. I will use a 'recent_N' of 5 for mu_hat to capture the recent upward trend in demand (averaging 131 over the last 5 periods), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for high volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for both the delay and the risk of further losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Shipment ordered in P6 (163 units) is now 5 periods late, increasing probability of loss or extreme lead time variance.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is consistently being lost. Lead time is highly unstable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with significant evidence of shipment loss: the P2 order (131 units) is 10 periods late and definitively lost, and the P6 order (163 units) is now 6 periods late and likely lost. The in-transit total of 485 units includes the P6 order (163), plus orders from P9 (121), P10 (51), and P11 (19). However, because the OR backend calculates the order as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and the pipeline inventory is inflated by these likely lost/severely delayed units, the system is under-ordering (only 19 units ordered in P11). To force a larger order to reach a state where demand can be met, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3.0 to reflect the maximum observed lead time and 'explicit' mu_hat. Demand averages around 110-120 units. With L=3, the coverage period is (L+1)=4. I will set mu_hat to 500 (representing 125 units * 4 periods) and sigma_hat to 100 to ensure a robust safety stock. This higher mu_hat aims to overcome the stagnant pipeline inventory and trigger a new shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Shipment ordered in P6 (163 units) is now 6 periods late and likely lost, mirroring the confirmed loss of the P2 order. Inventory pipeline is currently unreliable for automated OR calculations.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally received orders from P9 and P10 (172 units total), leaving us with 90 units on-hand for Period 13. However, the supply chain remains unreliable. The P2 order (131 units) is 11 periods old and the P6 order (163 units) is 7 periods old; both are almost certainly lost. This is critical because the OR backend includes these 'lost' units in the pipeline inventory calculation (pipeline = in-transit + on-hand), which causes it to under-order. To compensate for the ~294 units in the pipeline that will never arrive, I must set mu_hat ('explicit') significantly higher than the actual forecasted demand. Demand has averaged ~111 units over the last 12 periods. With a lead time L=2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is 333. By setting mu_hat to 630, I am effectively adding the 300 missing units back into the safety stock calculation to force the backend to place a real order despite the ghost inventory. I'll use calculate for L and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (163 units) is now 7 periods late and confirmed lost, following the P2 loss pattern. Total 'ghost' inventory in pipeline is approximately 294 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 13. Current in-transit inventory is 538 units, but 294 of these (P2: 131 units, P6: 163 units) are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights and excessive delays. This leaves an effective pipeline of 244 units (from P11, P12, P13). Lead times observed range from 1 to 3 periods, averaging 2.4. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the risk of longer arrivals. Demand mean has recently fluctuated; I'll use the last 5 periods (P9-P13) to calculate mu_hat, resulting in a mean of ~107.6. Since L=3, the lead+review period is 4 periods. mu_hat = 4 * 107.6 = 430.4. sigma_hat will be calculated using the recent 5 samples to reflect recent volatility. These parameters help the OR engine ignore the 'lost' units by setting a high enough base stock to trigger necessary ordering despite the ghost pipeline.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and high demand volatility. Historical data analysis reveals significant supply chain issues: the promised lead time is 2, but actual observations are 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, and 3. Two large orders (P2: 131 units and P6: 163 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 294 'ghost' units in the pipeline (In-transit: 519 units). Since ending inventory is 0 and demand is stable around 100 units/period, we must order aggressively. To account for the 'ghost' units, I set L = 3 (max consistent lead time) and use recent demand (N=5, avg ~80), while manually inflating mu_hat with 'explicit' to ignore the 294 lost units in the pipeline calculation (OR formula: order = base_stock - pipeline). To ensure an order is triggered despite the 519 'in-transit' units, the mu_hat must be set to cover the desired base stock plus the volume of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: P14 confirms 19 units arriving on time (L=3), but also confirms that the pipeline still contains 294 units of lost inventory (P2 and P6 orders) which will never arrive, causing the OR engine to under-order unless mu_hat is manually adjusted.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 685 units in-transit. However, historical evidence from Periods 8-15 confirms that two specific shipments (131 units from P2 and 163 units from P6) are lost, totaling 294 'ghost' units. The actual pipeline inventory is therefore 685 - 294 = 391 units. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (which includes the lost units) to calculate orders: order = max(0, base_stock - pipeline_inventory). To force the engine to order correctly despite this 294-unit pipeline inflation, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base_stock based on an average demand (~110) over (L+1) periods (3+1=4), which is 440 units, and then ADD the 294 lost units to the target so the subtraction results in the desired physical order. 440 + 294 = 734. Lead time L is set to 3 based on recent arrivals (P11, P12). Average demand across all samples is approximately 110.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the on-hand inventory is 128 units. The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 524 units. However, previous history and carry-over insights confirm that 294 units from that pipeline (ordered in P2 and P6) are lost and will never arrive. The OR backend uses the full 'In-transit' value (524) to calculate the order, which leads to a massive under-order because it mistakenly believes 294 units are coming. To correct for this 'ghost' inventory, I am using 'mu_hat' with the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean demand of ~108 (last 16 periods) and L=3 (L+1=4 periods), which is 432 units. To force the OR engine to order despite the ghost inventory, I set mu_hat to 726 (432 target + 294 lost units). This 'tricks' the backend into seeing a deficit that accounts for the lost items. L is set to explicit 3 based on the most frequent actual lead time observed (Periods 1, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 13).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized with an average of approximately 82 units over the last 5 periods (P13-P17). Total in-transit inventory is 549 units, but my Carry-Over records confirm that 294 units (from P2 and P6) are lost and will never arrive. The OR engine is unaware of these 'ghost' units and will subtract the full 549 from its target stock, leading to severe under-ordering. To compensate, I am manually increasing 'mu_hat' using the 'explicit' method. For a target lead time (L) of 3, the desired base stock should cover (L+1)=4 periods. Expected demand is 82 * 4 = 328 units. To neutralize the 294 lost units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 328 + 294 = 622. Since the inventory on-hand (110) + remaining real pipeline (549 - 294 = 255) equals 365, which is already slightly above the required 328 for a 4-period window, the OR engine will likely order a small corrective amount or nothing, but the explicit mu_hat prevents it from seeing a massive surplus that doesn't exist. I've set L=3 as it is the most frequent recent actual lead time.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19, the demand for chips(Regular) appears to have stabilized into a lower regime. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P12-P18) is approximately 82 units, compared to the overall historical mean of 105 units. I will use N=7 for mu_hat to capture this recent trend. Regarding lead time, observations show high variability (1 to 3 periods). The most frequent recent lead time is 3 periods, though P16 arrived in 1 period (observed in P17 conclude). Furthermore, the pipeline inventory of 549 units is heavily inflated by 294 units of confirmed lost inventory (P2 order of 131 and P6 order of 163). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this 'ghost' pipeline, I must forcefully inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. My target base stock Calculation: (L+1) * Expected Demand = (3+1) * 82 = 328 units. Because the backend subtracts the pipeline (549) from base_stock, and 294 of that pipeline is non-existent, the effective pipeline is 255. To get an order that reaches the 328 target, the input base_stock (mu_hat) needs to compensate for the 294 loss. I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide enough coverage while the system processes the in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: avg demand approx 82 units since P12 (down from ~120). Effective pipeline is (In-transit - 294) due to confirmed losses in P2 and P6.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: On-hand is 0, demand in P19 was 49 (downward trend), and in-transit is 582. However, based on the carry-over insights, 294 units in the pipeline (ordered in P2 and P6) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline is 582 - 294 = 288 units. The OR engine (mu_hat/sigma_hat calculation) does not know these units are lost, so it thinks the pipeline is full and will under-order. This has resulted in a stockout at Period 19. Demand has shifted to a lower regime (~80 units/period) since Period 12. To force the OR engine to order despite the 'ghost' inventory, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Formula: Target Stock = (Effective mu_hat) + (Ghost Inventory). Mean demand since P12 is approx 82. For L=2, Target Stock for (L+1) periods = (3 * 82) + 294 = 540. L is set to explicit 2 (the promised lead time) as recent arrivals have varied between 1 and 3.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 21. Demand has significantly decreased since Period 12, stabilizing around 70-80 units, and the most recent observations (P19, P20) show a further drop to late 40s. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline (582 units) is severely distorted by 'ghost inventory' from Period 2 (131 units) and Period 6 (163 units), totaling 294 units that are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock, it believes we have 294 units more than we actually do, leading to massive under-ordering. To compensate, I must set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value. Calculation: Demand regime avg \u2248 75. Recommended base stock for L=3 is (3+1)*75 = 300. Adding the 294 lost units to 'offset' the OR engine's subtraction: 300 + 294 = 594. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-3 periods). Sigma is set to recent_N (N=9, covering the lower demand regime) to provide a localized volatility estimate.

Carry-over insight: P19 and P20 suggest a secondary demand drop to ~47 units; monitoring to see if this sustains for 3+ periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 22. In-transit inventory stands at 594 units, but significant portions are 'ghost' inventory (P2 order: 131, P6 order: 163). Additionally, the P15 order (181 units) and P17 order (74 units) are now overdue by promised lead time (L=2) and even beyond typical actual lead time (L=3), totaling 255 units. With 294 units confirmed lost and 255 units highly suspect, the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' view of 594 is extremely inflated compared to the likely reality. Average demand has shifted significantly: P1-P11 averaged ~112, P12-P18 averaged ~82, and P19-P21 averaged ~45. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime. To counter the OR engine's reliance on phantom pipeline stock and prevent stockouts, I will use an 'explicit' L value of 10. While actual lead time is likely 3, providing a high L value forces the base_stock calculation higher, compensating for the unavailable units in the 'pipeline_inventory' term (base_stock - pipeline).

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand drop confirmed: Period 19-21 average demand is 45 units (down from ~82 in the previous regime). Increasing evidence that P15 (181 units) and P17 (74 units) orders may also be lost or severely delayed, as they are 7 and 5 periods late respectively.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by severe supply chain instability and a declining demand regime. Demand analysis: Demand has shifted from ~120 units (P1-P6) to ~82 units (P12-P18), and now to a third regime averaging 46.5 units over the last 4 periods (P19-P22: 49, 46, 40, 51). Management of the pipeline is critical because of lost shipments. Confirmed lost shipments include P2 (131) and P6 (163). Furthermore, orders from P15 (181) and P17 (74) are now 8 and 6 periods late respectively, significantly exceeding the typical L=1-3 range; these are now treated as lost to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering. Total suspected lost 'ghost' inventory is 549 units (131+163+181+74). With a total In-transit of 594, only 45 units (from P19 and P21) are likely to arrive. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To force an order despite the 'ghost' pipeline units, mu_hat is set using 'explicit' to a value that covers the new demand regime (approx 47 units/period) across the lead time (avg 3) plus the current period, while L is set to its observed average of 3 to ensure sufficient safety stock. This helps offset the backend's deduction of the 549 lost units from the ordering target.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~47 units/period (P19-P22). Pipeline integrity severely compromised: orders from P2, P6, P15, and P17 (total 549 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost. Only 45 units in the pipeline (from P19, P21) are considered valid.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips has shifted significantly. We are now in a low-demand regime where the average demand from Period 19 to 23 is approximately 45.8 units. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with clear evidence of lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (131), P6 (163), P15 (181), and P17 (74) are significantly past the observed lead times (3 periods max) and are confirmed or highly likely to be lost. This 'ghost' inventory totals 549 units out of the 723 units in transit. The OR backend naturally subtracts 'In-transit' from the 'base_stock' to calculate the order. If we use the default calculation, it will assume 723 units are coming and order nothing, leading to stockouts. To correct for this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock (assuming L=3 and a high service level due to equal cost/profit) based on the current 46-unit demand regime. Using mu_hat = (L+1) * mean_demand = 4 * 46 = 184. By setting mu_hat = 184 + 549 (lost units) = 733, the backend calculation [base_stock (at least 733) - in-transit (723)] will trigger an order that compensates for the lost pipeline and targets a 4-period safety coverage. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the recent volatility in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline integrity verification: Orders from P2, P6, P15, and P17 (Total 549 units) are confirmed lost. Effective pipeline is (Total In-transit - 549). Demand regime since P19 is stable at ~46 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a low-volume regime since Period 19, averaging approx 43 units per period. The primary challenge remains the inventory pipeline: orders from P2 (131), P6 (163), P15 (181), and P17 (74) are officially considered lost (totaling 549 units), as they are significantly past even the longest observed lead times (~3 periods). The OR engine currently sees 'In-transit: 733', but 549 of those units are 'ghost' units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, I must manually adjust mu_hat to account for this 549-unit deficit. Calculation: Target Base Stock (for L=3) = 43 * (3+1) = 172 units. The OR engine thinks the pipeline is 733, so it will not order unless mu_hat is set to override this. By setting mu_hat = 721 (approx 549 ghost units + 172 target), I ensure the engine places orders to meet actual demand while the 549 units remain stuck in its pipeline calculation.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline ghost inventory verified: Total of 549 units (P2, P6, P15, P17) confirmed lost. Demand regime since P19 is stable at ~43 units/period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime starting at Period 19, with an average demand of approximately 42 units per period (P19-P25 samples: 49, 46, 40, 51, 43, 33, 33). The actual lead time remains volatile, typically oscillating between 2 and 3 periods for successful deliveries. A critical systemic issue exists regarding 'ghost' inventory: orders from P2 (131), P6 (163), P15 (181), and P17 (74) totaling 549 units are confirmed lost, as they are significantly past even the longest observed successful lead times. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 592 units, but subtracting the 549 lost units leaves only 43 valid units in the pipeline (the P24 order of 10 units plus 33 units from P19). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period coverage (L=2 + 1) at approximately 126 units (42 * 3). With 108 units on hand and 43 valid units in transit, the pipeline is nearly full for the current demand regime. However, to ensure the OR engine orders only what is necessary despite the 549-unit ghost inventory bias, I set mu_hat to 720 (42 * 3 + 594 approx)\u2014effectively tricking the backend into seeing the real demand plus the offset of lost units. Setting sigma_hat to 15 reflects the reduced volatility in this lower demand regime.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a secondary lower regime since Period 19, with an average demand of approximately 43 units per period. The pipeline inventory currently shows 592 units, but internal tracking confirms that 549 units from orders in P2 (131), P6 (163), P15 (181), and P17 (74) are lost and will not arrive. This creates 'ghost' inventory that misleads the OR engine's base-stock calculation. The true 'effective' pipeline is only 43 units (592 - 549), which is roughly one period of demand. With On-hand inventory at 59 and a promised lead time of 2, we need to ensure the system continues to order to meet future demand. Using a 'recent_N' of 8 for mu_hat (covering Periods 19-26) targets the current lower-demand regime (~43 units/period). I use 'explicit' for L to maintain a buffer for lead-time variance and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility in this new regime.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime starting from Period 19, with an average demand of approximately 44 units per period (P19-P27: 49, 46, 40, 51, 43, 33, 33, 49, 54). The pipeline inventory remains deceptive: of the 592 units 'in-transit', 549 are confirmed lost (P2: 131, P6: 163, P15: 181, P17: 74), leaving an effective pipeline of only 43 units (from P19: 33 and P24: 10). With 5 units on-hand and 43 in valid transit, current coverage is ~48 units, which is approximately one period of demand. Since the promised lead time is 2, we need about 3 periods of demand coverage (~132 units). To force the OR engine to order despite the 'ghost' inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * Forecast * (Total In-transit / Effective In-transit) to offset the base-stock calculation's subtraction of the 549 lost units. Adjusted mu_hat = (1+2) * 44 * (592 / 43) \u2248 1816. This extreme value is necessary to overcome the 592 units the OR engine thinks are coming.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 19 has stabilized at a significantly lower average (~44 units/period), contrasting with earlier phases where demand was ~120 and then ~80. The inventory pipeline is heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory'\u2014orders that have exceeded realistic lead times and are considered lost in transit. Specifically, orders from P2 (131), P6 (163), P15 (181), and P17 (74) total 549 units of lost volume. Furthermore, the massive order of 580 units in P28 (likely triggered by the OR's perception of zero on-hand and zero pipeline) will drastically oversupply the system if it actually arrives. At a demand of ~44, the 1172 units 'in-transit' represent over 25 periods of supply. Therefore, I must stop ordering immediately. To prevent the OR backend from placing more orders, I set mu_hat to a very low explicit value (1) and L to 2, which effectively makes the base stock calculation negligible compared to the massive (though mostly lost) reported pipeline. This is a defensive stance to mitigate the risk of high holding costs should the P28 order arrive, while acknowledging that the pipeline units are likely to never manifest.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Pipeline integrity check. In-transit count (1172) is dominated by 'ghost' units (549 confirmed lost: P2, P6, P15, P17) and an extreme outlier order from P28 (580 units) which exceeds demand by ~13x. Net physical pipeline is likely only the P19, P21, P23, P24, and P28 orders, though P28 alone is excessive.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P19-P29) has stabilized at an average of approximately 45 units per period. The inventory pipeline is heavily distorted: out of 1172 units 'in-transit', 549 units are confirmed lost (from P2, P6, P15, P17). Furthermore, the 580 units ordered in Period 28 is an extreme outlier, representing over 12 periods of demand. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand was 56, we are currently out of stock. Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the massive 'in-transit' number and stopping all orders, I must manually inflate mu_hat to account for the 'ghost' inventory (549 units). Additionally, since the system has a profit/holding ratio of 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to capture the steady ~45 unit regime, but I'll increase L to 3 to ensure the order covers the max typical lead time. Sigma_hat is set significantly lower to reflect the reduced volatility in this lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Total confirmed lost (ghost) inventory is 549 units. Effective pipeline = (Total In-transit - 549). Current demand regime (P19-P29) mean is ~45 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we have 558 units on-hand after a large arrival of 580 units from the Period 28 order. The demand regime since Period 19 has balanced at approximately 43 units per period (P19-P30 average). Historical data shows that orders from P2, P6, P15, and P17 (totaling 549 units) are confirmed lost and will never arrive; these 'ghost units' must be excluded from pipeline considerations. The total In-transit reported is 592, which consists of the 549 ghost units plus 43 units from orders in P19, P21, P23, and P24. Since 558 units on-hand far exceeds the expected demand over the lead time (L=2) and the review period (1+2=3), no additional units should be ordered. I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the current demand regime (~43 units/period) and L to the promised 2 periods. The OR engine will see the high on-hand stock and the pipeline (even with ghost units) and correctly place a zero order.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we have 488 units on-hand and 592 units in-transit. Based on historical analysis, 549 units in the pipeline (from P2, P6, P15, and P17) are confirmed losses ('ghost inventory') and will never arrive. The effective pipeline is therefore 592 - 549 = 43 units. Demand transformed effectively since Period 19, stabilizing at an average of ~44.4 units per period (N=13). Despite the large arrival in P30 (580 units from P28), which significantly boosted on-hand inventory, we must set parameters that allow the OR engine to recognize it does NOT need to order more while also accounting for the ghost inventory that inflates 'pipeline_inventory'. By using 'explicit' L=2 (promised) and 'recent_N' N=13 for mu_hat (approx 133 units) and sigma_hat, the backend will compare base_stock (~165-180) against (on-hand 488 + effective pipeline 43). However, the OR engine sees 'Total In-Transit' (592). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering in future periods due to the 549 ghost units blocking the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly high enough to eventually offset the ghost units or rely on the massive current on-hand surplus to cover near-term demand. For this period, with 488 on-hand and demand at ~45, we are stocked for ~10 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent stable regime (P19-P31) to maintain a realistic target once the surplus is consumed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-396.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at approximately 45 units per period (the average from Period 19 to 32 is ~43.7 units). Significant pipeline issues were previously identified: 549 units (from P2, P6, P15, and P17) were confirmed as 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive. The current inventory status shows 442 units on-hand and 592 units in-transit. Taking the in-transit (592) and subtracting the ghost units (549), the actual physical pipeline consists of only 43 units (likely the orders from P23/P24 that haven't arrived or other small remnants). Crucially, the massive order of 580 units from P28 arrived in Period 30, which is why on-hand inventory is so high (442). At the current demand rate of ~45 units/period, this stock will last nearly 10 periods. The OR backend will see (On-hand: 442 + In-transit: 592) = 1034 units. Even subtracting the ghost units (1034 - 549 = 485), the 'real' inventory (485) is far above the required base stock for a 3-period window (estimated at ~200 units). I will set L=3 (recent observed maximum) and use the recent demand regime (last 14 periods) to ensure the OR engine recognizes the lower mean. No orders should be triggered given the current excess.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Excess inventory confirmed; on-hand 442 units will cover ~10 periods of current demand (~45 units/period). Pipeline ghost units (549) still persist in the 'In-transit' accounting.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for chips(Regular) remains in a state of extreme excess due to the Period 28 outlier order of 580 units. Currently, there are 411 units on-hand, which at the current stabilized demand regime of ~45 units/period (observed since Period 19), covers approximately 9+ periods of demand. The in-transit pipeline (592 units) consists mostly of the 549 'ghost' units (confirmed lost orders from P2, P6, P15, and P17) and 43 legitimate units from recent smaller orders. However, total stock (On-hand + effective In-transit) is far beyond the required safety levels. To prevent any further ordering and to avoid compounding holding costs, I am keeping parameters conservative. mu_hat is set to reflect the current regime (~45 units/period over 1+L periods), while L is set to 'calculate' to gradually incorporate actual lead time variance into the model. No new orders are expected or desired given the current surplus.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation remains dominated by the massive order from Period 28 (580 units) which arrived in Period 30. With current on-hand inventory at 386 units and a stable demand regime of approximately 45 units per period (the average since Period 19), there is enough stock on hand to cover over 8 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 592 units consists primarily of 549 'ghost' units from historically lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17) plus small recent orders. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high on-hand levels, the objective is to prevent any further ordering. Setting \u03bc_hat and \u03c3_hat using recent_N (N=16, covering the stable lower-demand regime since P19) will generate a base stock level far below current physical and pipeline inventory, ensuring the OR backend correctly outputs an order quantity of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-276.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a massive overstock situation. On-hand inventory is 331 units, which at the current demand regime of ~44 units/period (average P19-P35), covers approximately 7.5 periods of demand. Additionally, the 'In-transit' figure of 592 units is heavily skewed by 'ghost' inventory. Specifically, orders from P2 (131), P6 (163), P15 (181), and P17 (74) totaling 549 units are long overdue and confirmed lost. Subtracting 549 from the current 592 In-transit units leaves only 43 units of valid pipeline inventory (likely the P33 order, though history shows no order placed then, P24 order of 10 might still be floating). Regardless of the ghost units, the on-hand stock alone is far too high relative to demand. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs and stop the OR engine from ordering more (which it might attempt if it believes the ghost inventory is real and needs replenishment), I will use 'explicit' parameters. I will set mu_hat to a value lower than current on-hand + valid pipeline to ensure the order quantity remains zero.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Massive overstock persists (331 on-hand vs ~44 avg demand). Total ghost inventory in pipeline remains 549 units (P2, P6, P15, P17). Current demand regime (P19-P35) mean is 43.6 units/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for chips(Regular) remains characterized by significant overstock. Current on-hand inventory is 270 units, while the mean demand since the regime shift (Period 19 onwards) is approximately 43.8 units per period. This on-hand balance alone covers more than 6 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' count of 592 is heavily skewed by 549 'ghost' units (confirmed lost orders from P2, P6, P15, and P17). Adjusting for these, the effective pipeline is 43 units (likely the P24 order). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the fact that current stock far exceeds the required base stock for a 3nd-period lead time horizon, no new orders are needed. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed lead time variance (avg ~2.4). mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using recent_N=18 (P19 to P36) to reflect the current lower-demand regime (~44 units/period) and its associated volatility.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a significant overstock position with 207 units on-hand, which covers approximately 4.7 periods of the current demand regime (~44 units/period). The 'In-transit' figure of 592 units is dominated by 549 'ghost' units (confirmed lost orders from P2, P6, P15, and P17), meaning the real physical pipeline is only 43 units. However, because the on-hand inventory is already high and the OR engine uses the inflated 'In-transit' figure (592) in its logic, it would naturally order 0 even without intervention. I will maintain recent_N settings to reflect the current lower demand regime (avg ~44 units desde P19) and use the calculate lead-time method to account for the observed variance and the backend's default logic. No new orders are needed at this time.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation remains dominated by the massive overstock from the Period 28 order (580 units arrived in P30). Current on-hand inventory is 124 units, which at the current stabilized demand regime of approx 44 units/period (P19-P38 mean), provides roughly 2.8 periods of coverage. The 'In-transit' figure of 592 units is largely comprised of 'ghost inventory' (549 units from P2, P6, P15, and P17) which has been confirmed lost over multiple periods. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously halting orders due to this 'ghost' pipeline, L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual lead time of ~2-3 periods, and mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=20, covering the stable lower demand regime since P19). Since on-hand is still sufficient to cover more than (L+1) periods of demand, the OR engine's capped policy should naturally result in a zero or small order, which is desired to continue bleeding off the excess stock before placing new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a regime of approximately 45-50 units per period starting from Period 19. Since the massive overstock event in Period 30 (580 units arrived), I have been bleeding off inventory to minimize holding costs. Current on-hand is 80 units, with an 'In-transit' count of 592 units. However, my carry-over insights confirm that 549 units in pipeline are actually 'ghost' inventory (orders from P2, P6, P15, and P17) that are long-lost and will never arrive. Subtracting these from the 592 in-transit units reveals an effective pipeline of 43 units. Given current on-hand (80) + effective pipeline (43) = 123 units, I am reaching a point where replenishment might be needed soon if demand rises, but at 45 units/period, I have nearly 3 periods of stock remaining. The OR backend's pipeline calculation is still distorted by the 549 ghost units; it thinks I have 592 + 80 units, so it will not order. To force a correct base stock calculation, I will provide mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current regime (P19-P39) and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 2-3 period lead time for valid orders. No ordering is expected this period due to the remaining on-hand stock.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the inventory situation is critical as on-hand stock has depleted to 17 units while demand remains stable in the current regime (P19-P40) at an average of 47.9 units. The in-transit pipeline of 592 units consists almost entirely of 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost orders from P2, P6, P15, and P17 totaling 549 units) and a few small orders from P19/P21/P24 that are now so late they must also be considered lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. To trigger an order from the backend OR engine, mu_hat must be set to a value high enough that (mu_hat - pipeline_inventory) is positive. Since the OR engine sees 592 units in transit, I must set mu_hat explicitly to exceed this 'ghost' pipeline plus the required safety stock to cover the lead time (L=2). A value of 750 for mu_hat (representing approx 15 periods of demand) is chosen to overcome the 592 ghost units and secure an order to prevent further stockouts. Sigma_hat is set to a moderate level to account for the consistent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline integrity remains zero: 549 units (P2, P6, P15, P17) plus subsequent small orders (P19, P21, P24) are confirmed lost. Total ghost inventory is ~592 units. Demand regime (P19-P40) mean is 47.9 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we are at zero on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' count of 733 units is largely comprised of 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17 totaling 549 units, plus smaller orders from P19, P21, P24 totaling 55 units, for a total of 604 ghost units). The only likely valid shipment in transit is the 141 units ordered in P41. Demand has been stable in a lower regime since P19, with a mean of approximately 48 units (P19-P41 avg: 47.9). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the inflated pipeline, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. This value is calculated as (L+1) * mean_demand + ghost_inventory. With L=2, (3 * 48) + 604 = 748. This 'tricks' the backend into seeing a higher target base stock, effectively neutralizing the 604 units of phantom inventory it thinks we have. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual arrival time (approx 2.4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory in pipeline increased to 604 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P21, P24). Demand regime (P19-P41) remains stable at mean 47.9 units/period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (P19-P42) is stable with a mean of approximately 47.9 units. I am observing Period 43 with 0 on-hand inventory. The In-transit figure is 748, but my carry-over insights confirm that 604 of these units are 'ghost' inventory (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P21, P24 that never arrived and are over 15 periods late). This leaves a real pipeline of 144 units (from P41 and P42). Since the promised lead time is 2, the total pipeline requirement (L+1 periods) is roughly 3 * 47.9 = 143.7 units. The 144 units in the real pipeline (141 ordered P41 + 15 ordered P42 = 156 total real in-transit) are sufficient to cover this. I will set L to 2 (promised), mu_hat (1+L)*47.9 = 143.7, and sigma_hat based on the recent regime (P19-P42) which shows a standard deviation of approximately 15. Using recent_N for both mu and sigma ensures the OR engine doesn't over-order based on the high early-game demand or under-order due to the ghost inventory masking the need for stock.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory in pipeline remains 604 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P21, P24). Demand regime (P19-P42) mean is 47.9 units/period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 19 remains stable with a mean of approximately 47.9 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline shows 748 units in-transit. Based on historical tracking, 604 units are confirmed lost ('ghost' inventory from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 19, 21, and 24). This leaves an effective physical pipeline of 144 units (748 - 604), which includes the orders placed in P41 (141 units) and P42 (15 units). The P41 order is expected to arrive in Period 44 (the current period resolution), assuming a lead time of 3. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 604 ghost units, I must adjust mu_hat. The target base stock for a lead time of 2 (promised) plus the review period is 3 periods of demand. At 47.9 units/period, target inventory is ~144. Pipeline (excluding ghosts) is 156. No new order is needed yet. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the ghost inventory: the backend sees 'In-transit = 748', so to result in a near-zero or small order, mu_hat must be set to approximately the level of the in-transit inventory plus one period of projected demand, or I can use the 'recent_N' method to reflect the current regime and allow the cap to regulate. However, with 748 units reported, the OR engine will definitely not order unless it thinks demand is massive. This is safe as we have 156 real units coming.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 19 onwards) remains stable with a mean of approximately 47.9 units. The pipeline inventory is currently reported as 607 units, but 604 of these are confirmed 'ghost' units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P21, P24) which will never arrive. The only valid recent order is from Period 42 (15 units). On-hand inventory is 99 units, which covers approximately 2 periods of demand. To ensure the OR backend places an order, I must set mu_hat to a value that reflects the actual demand regime while compensating for the fact that the OR engine incorrectly believes there are 607 units in transit. By settting L=2 and mu_hat to 740 (calculated as (1+L)*48 + 600 approx), I 'trick' the base stock calculation into covering the ghost inventory gap. Given the game is at Period 45 of 50, and actual lead times are ~3 periods, this order will arrive around Period 48, securing availability for the final frames.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed ghost inventory in pipeline increased to 604 units. Effective pipeline is (Total In-transit - 604). Demand regime (P19-P44) consistent at ~48 units/period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 with 57 units on hand. The current demand regime (since P19) is stable with a mean of approximately 48 units. Historical analysis confirms a cumulative 'ghost' inventory of 604 units (from periods P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P21, P24) that remains in the 'In-transit' count but will never arrive. The reported In-transit is 626 units; subtracting the 604 ghost units leaves an effective pipeline of only 22 units (the P45 order of 34 minus the 12 unit difference from partial arrivals/accounting), though the OR engine sees 626. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target stock (base stock) for (L+1=3) periods should cover roughly 3 * 48 = 144 units plus safety stock. Since the OR logic subtracts the full 626 in-transit from the base_stock, I will set mu_hat high enough to trigger the necessary order. However, since the system is near the end (P46/50) and current inventory (57) plus recent orders (34 from P45) covers over 1.5 periods, I will set mu_hat to a level that maintains a steady flow without over-ordering as we approach the game end. I'm using L=3 based on recent arrival observations from P44 and P45.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 19 has remained stable with a mean of approximately 48 units/period. Currently, the system shows 42 units on-hand and 626 units in-transit. Crucially, the 'ghost' inventory persists: 604 units in the pipeline (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P21, P24) are confirmed lost based on the extreme elapsed time since their placement. The OR backend uses 'Total In-Transit' in its order calculation; to prevent it from under-ordering due to these ghost units, mu_hat must be set to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the ghost inventory or offsets it. Since (Total In-Transit - Ghost) = (626 - 604) = 22 units of real pipeline inventory, and we have 42 units on-hand, our total 'real' inventory position is 64 units. Given a lead time L=2, the base stock should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. At 48 units/period, target base stock is ~144 units. To force the OR engine to order approximately (144 - 64) = 80 units today while it believes the pipeline is 626 units, we set mu_hat explicitly high. Specifically, setting mu_hat to 720 (effectively simulating a demand of 240/period for the L+1 window) will signal the backend to increase the order size despite the bloated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline ghost inventory remains at 604 units. Effective pipeline inventory = (Total In-transit - 604). Demand regime since Period 19 stable at 48 units/period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable at approximately 48 units per period based on data since Period 19. Inventory management is complicated by 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline (units recorded as In-transit that will never arrive). Confirmed ghost inventory includes orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P21, and P24, totaling 604 units. The current total In-transit is 678, meaning the effective physical pipeline is actually 74 units (orders from P45 and P47). Since current on-hand is 0 and we are at Period 48 of 50, we must ensure enough stock for the final two periods. I will set mu_hat to cover the remaining periods' demand and use explicit L to reflect the observed 3-period lead time. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 604 ghost units, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat at a value that forces an order sufficient for the final demand burst, while accounting for the fact that only 74 real units are in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 604 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P21, P24). Demand regime since Period 19 stable at ~48 units/period.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity is 750 units, but historical evidence confirms that 604 of these units (from orders in P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P21, and P24) are lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline physical inventory consists of orders from P45 (34 units), P47 (52 units), and P48 (72 units), totaling 158 units. Since the current demand regime has stabilized at a mean of approximately 48 units (recent 30 periods), and the effective pipeline (158 units) already covers over 3 periods of demand (L+1 with L=2), the OR engine would normally order zero. However, there is a risk of a stockout in Period 49 as on-hand is zero and the P45 order (34 units, L=3 expected) is the earliest possible arrival. I will maintain a lead time of 2 (default) and use recent_N (N=30) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the stable (~48 unit) demand regime since Period 19. The 'ghost' inventory of 604 units will continue to cause the backend to under-order, but given the current effective pipeline of 158 units against a demand forecast of ~48, the system is sufficiently covered for the final two periods of the game.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 analysis: Current on-hand inventory is 0. Total in-transit is 750 units. According to historical tracking, 604 units are confirmed lost 'ghost' units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P21, P24). Subtracting these results in an effective pipeline of 146 units (orders from P45: 34, P47: 52, P48: 72, though slightly exceeding 146, we use the reported total). Demand since Period 19 has averaged ~48 units/period. The backend uses (1+L) * mu_hat. With L=2, (1+2)*48 = 144 units. Since our effective pipeline (146) is almost exactly the target base stock, the OR engine will likely order 0 or very small amounts. However, following the loss pattern, shipments are frequently arriving with L=3 rather than L=2. To prevent stockouts due to the 0 on-hand balance and the high probability of delivery delays/losses, I am setting L=3 to increase the base stock calculation, while using a recent_N average for demand to reflect the established ~48 unit regime. Lead time method 'calculate' is chosen to let the backend reflect the physical delivery reality of 2-3 periods.
