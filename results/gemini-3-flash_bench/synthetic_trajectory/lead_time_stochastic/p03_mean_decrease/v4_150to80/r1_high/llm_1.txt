Period 1 showed an outlier high (216), followed by a lower, steadier regime around 125-130 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since there is 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, I need to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (total 3 periods) of demand to reach a stable state. Target inventory = (Estimated Demand * (L+1)) + Safety Stock. Estimating demand at ~140 units and wanting a safety buffer due to the initial stockout, I will order 500 units to establish a pipeline that covers the next 3-4 periods of demand.",

Lead times are volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods; the order from P40 arrived in P43 (3-period lead time). Based on historical data, shipments from P29, P30, and P33 are confirmed lost. The current pipeline shows orders from P41, P42, and P43 (each 250 units) are the only reliable ones. Order P41 is expected to arrive during P44's execution (making it visible in P45). With 193 units on hand and 57 units sold in P43, I have enough stock to cover P44 demand. My objective is to maintain a rolling inventory that covers the next (L+1) periods of demand (~3 periods * 82 = 246 units), while accounting for the high probability of order loss. Since I already have 750 reliable units in transit vs. a total demand of ~574 units remaining in the game (7 periods * 82), and my on-hand is 193, I am currently over-buffered. However, given the extreme history of lost orders (over 700 units lost), I will place a moderate order to ensure I don't stock out if lead times stretch or the P41/P42 orders fail.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Order loss remains a high risk: ~45% of total units ordered since P1 have never arrived. Reliable pipeline contains only orders from P41 onwards.",

  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues in the low-volume regime established around Period 13, with the most recent 10-period average around 81 units. However, Period 42 and 44 showed demand spikes (119 and 138), suggesting potential variability or a slight upward trend. Lead times remain inconsistent (1-3 periods), and order loss is a significant factor (approximately 45% historical loss rate). Current on-hand inventory is 305 units. Comparing this to the reliable pipeline: the order from P41 arrived in P44. We expect the order from P42 (250 units) to arrive in P45 or P46, and the order from P43 (250 units) to arrive shortly after. Total reliable pipeline (orders from P42, P43, P44) is 650 units. While the system shows 1380 units in-transit, most of these are older orders (pre-P40) confirmed lost in previous insights. With 305 units on-hand and an average demand of ~85, we have ~3.5 periods of stock. Considering the high risk of order loss and the desire to maximize profit while managing holding costs, I will place a moderate order of 150 units to maintain the pipeline as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).",

(c) Lead time and reliability: Lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods. The current 'In-transit' of 1030 is heavily inflated by legacy lost orders (P29, P30, P33). Reliable pipeline: Order P44 (150 units) and P45 (150 units). P44 order arrived at 3-period lead time? No, P44 started its timer then. Let's re-verify pipeline: P44 (150) placed at P44 start, expected P45-P47. P45 (150) placed at P45 start, expected P46-P48. (d) Inventory Assessment: On-hand is 649. With roughly 4 periods remaining (P47, 48, 49, 50), total expected demand is ~328 units (4 * 82). (e) Order Logic: Given that 649 units are on-hand and the remaining demand is only ~328, I am significantly overstocked for the end-of-game.

Historically, lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods, and there is a significant risk of order loss (estimated at 45% based on carry-over insights). The large 'In-transit' figure (1,030 units) is unreliable, as many of those units likely date back to earlier periods and are confirmed lost. However, there are recent orders from P44 and P45 (150 units each) that may still arrive. Given the current high on-hand inventory relative to the low demand regime and the per-unit holding cost, no additional order is required this period.
