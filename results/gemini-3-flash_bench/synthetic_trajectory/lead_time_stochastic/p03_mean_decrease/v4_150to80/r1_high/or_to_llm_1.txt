This leaves only P17 (150) and P21 (54) as potentially viable arrivals. Demand: Since Period 16, demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~85 units. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely due to the unadjusted 'In-transit' figure (678). However, excluding the 354 lost units and considering P15 (120) is likely lost, the 'real' pipeline is roughly 204 units (P17 + P21).

The recent demand in P23 was even lower (31), but a conservative estimate remains ~80-100 units. Supply Analysis: The lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely due to the massive (though largely phantom) pipeline inventory of 724 units. Strategy: To cover demand for the next 3 periods (L+1 + safety) at the current regime (~255-300 units total), we need to ensure the viable pipeline and on-hand inventory are sufficient.

Total estimated lost units = 204 + 150 + 120 + 150 = 624 units. Viable pipeline = 864 - 624 = 240 units. Specifically, these viable units are from P24 (80), P25 (80), and P26 (80).

Given the current stockout (On-hand 0) and the likelihood that P24 (ordered 3 periods ago) should arrive during Period 27 or 28, we need to ensure local availability. The OR recommends 0 because it sees 864 units in transit against a low demand of 85. However, since the defunct units won't arrive, we must order to maintain the pipeline. Targeting a base stock for 3 periods (L+1) at 85 units/period = 255 units. Current viable pipeline is 240.

Based on the carry-over insights, P2 (204), P6 (150), P15 (120), and P17 (150) are lost, totaling 624 units. Additionally, P12 (which ordered 150) only saw 150 arrive in Period 15, so that is accounted for. The viable pipeline consists of orders from P24 (80), P25 (80), P26 (80), and P27 (80), totaling 320 units. Lead times are volatile (1-3 periods).\n\n2. **Demand Analysis**: As noted in Period 20, demand shifted from ~150 to ~85 units/period. Recent demands (P24-P27) are 91, 54, 86, and 81, confirming this lower regime (avg ~78).\n\n3. **Inventory Position**: Current On-hand is 0. Viable In-transit is 320. To cover the current period plus the 2-period lead time (L+1=3), we need enough stock for approximately 3 * 85 = 255 units. With 320 units in the viable pipeline, even with 1-3 period lead times, we have sufficient coverage for the next few periods.\n\n4. **OR Baseline Reconciliation**: OR recommends 0 because the raw 'In-transit' (944) is far above the base-stock level calculated for the current demand regime. While the 944 is fake, the actual viable pipeline (320) still exceeds the safety stock requirement for the reduced demand regime.

However, my 'Carry-over Insights' indicate that a massive portion of these units are lost/defunct. As of Period 42, 1,094 units were confirmed defunct. Since then, P43 (90 units) and P44 (85 units) were placed. Looking at the In-transit balance: 1314 total units. Subtracting the defunct pool (~1094) leaves a viable pipeline of approximately 220 units (which includes P42, P43, P44). Demand has slightly increased recently, with Period 44 peaking at 138. To cover the remaining 5 periods of the game and account for a volatile lead time (1-3 periods), I need to ensure a steady flow. With 0 on-hand inventory, I will ignore the OR 0 and order 100 units to maintain the pipeline, as the 220 units currently in the 'viable' pipeline are staggered across future periods.",

Current on-hand inventory is 126 units, which already covers the expected demand for the upcoming period. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable, with a significant portion of the 'In-transit' inventory (1,209 units) being defunct. Based on previous carry-over insights, at least 1,094 units are recorded as lost/defunct (P2, P6, P12 part, P15, P17, P24, P25, P29, P33). Analyzing the more recent history, Order P37 (80 units) is now at Period 46 and has not arrived (LT=9), and Order P40 (80 units) arrived at LT=3. The viable pipeline consists of P44 (85 units) and P45 (100 units). Given that the on-hand inventory (126) is sufficient for P46 demand and we have 185 viable units arriving in the next 1-3 periods, the total inventory position (On-hand 126 + Viable In-transit 185 = 311) reflects about 3.6 periods of demand. The OR recommendation is 0, which aligns with the fact that we are currently overstocked relative to the 85-unit demand mean.

To cover the remaining three periods (48, 49, 50) and account for lead time volatility (1-3 periods), we need to maintain a base stock. Average demand since Period 16 is ~85 units. Total units needed for P48-P50 is ~255 units. With 115 units in the viable pipeline and 0 on hand, we are facing a deficit. However, since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (P48) with a lead time of 2-3 periods would arrive during Period 50 or after the game concludes.

Therefore, the viable pipeline is actually 200 units (1374 - 1174). These viable units are from recent orders: P44 (85 arrived P44 - wait, checking history...

Specifically, the orders from P44 (85), P45 (100), P47 (80), P48 (85), and P49 (85) are expected to arrive soon, given the observed lead time of 1-3 periods. The OR recommendation of 0 units is based on the inflated 'In-transit' figure and fails to account for the massive number of lost shipments. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~85 units/period. To maintain a safety stock and cover the (L+1) window, the target inventory position should be around 255-300 units.
