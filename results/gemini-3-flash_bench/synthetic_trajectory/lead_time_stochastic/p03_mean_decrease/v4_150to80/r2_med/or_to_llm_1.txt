Given that we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and the demand seems slightly trending downward or stabilizing around 120-130 units, the OR recommendation of 212 units provides a safe buffer (approximately 1.45x the mean) to cover the 3-period risk window (L+1 = 2+1) while respecting the cap.

Strategy: The OR recommends 0 units because it views the total in-transit (604) as sufficient to cover the base stock level. However, filtering out the lost 204 units leaves 400 in the pipeline. With a mean demand of ~145, we need to cover roughly 3 periods (L+1) of demand, which is ~435 units. Current On-hand (75) + Effective Pipeline (400) = 475 units.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been stable (P12 was low at 82, but prior periods P8-P11 averaged 144). Average demand is ~145. 5. Decision: The OR recommendation is 0 because the raw in-transit number (854) is huge. However, removing lost orders shows we have 400 units incoming.

The pipeline currently consists of: P11 (250, likely lost), P12 (150), and any orders from P13 (0). Although OR recommends 0 units, this is likely because it treats the 400 total units from P11 and P12 as pending arrivals. Since P11 is likely lost (matching the pattern of P2 and P6), the 'real' pipeline is only 150 units (from P12). Current inventory (0) + adjusted pipeline (150) is insufficient to cover the next 3 periods (average demand 145/period * 3 = 435 units).

Orders from Period 2 (204), Period 6 (250), Period 11 (250), and Period 14 (200) have never arrived and are confirmed or presumed lost. This means the reported 'In-transit' of 854 is almost entirely phantom inventory (204+250+250+200 = 904 units across the history, though the 854 current in-transit represents the sum of all orders not yet arrived). The only 'live' orders potentially in transit are from Period 15 (150), Period 16 (150), and Period 17 (250). However, P15 and P16 should have arrived by now (P22), suggesting they may also be lost. Only P17 (250 units) is recently placed enough to be potentially active.\n\n2. **Demand Analysis**: As noted in Period 20, there is a clear demand regime shift. Demand dropped from an average of ~145 to ~67.4 over the last 5 periods (49, 70, 53, 89, 76). The OR recommendation of 0 is likely based on the inflated (phantom) pipeline inventory.\n\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand inventory is critically low at 13 units. If the P17 shipment (250 units) is not lost and arrives in Period 22 or 23, we will be fine. If it is lost (like ~25% of previous orders), we will stock out immediately. \n\n4. **Strategy**: Given the low current inventory and the high risk of shipment loss, I must place a small defensive order.

Analysis of history confirms P25 (150 units) is now 4 periods old and likely lost. The only 'real' pipeline inventory currently in motion consists of orders from P27 (150 units) and P28 (150 units). Demand Analysis: Recent demand has fluctuated but shows a slight rebound from the previous low regime, with P28 demand at 104 and a recent 5-period average around 83 units. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 because it incorrectly treats the 1304 'In-transit' units as available pipeline, leading it to calculate a massive oversupply. Strategy: We must reconcile the pipeline by ignoring historical losses. We need to cover demand for Period 29, 30, and 31 (L+1). At an estimated 90 units/period, we need ~270 units. We have 46 on-hand + 300 in active transit (P27, P28) = 346 units.

Shipments from P29 and P30 (150 units each) have not arrived after 5 and 4 periods respectively, which strongly matches our established pattern of lost shipments (approximately 25-30% loss rate). \n2. **Inventory & Pipeline Analysis**: The reported 'In-transit' of 1604 units is heavily distorted by 1604 units of historical losses (P2, P6, P11, P14, P15, P17, P25, P29, P30). Specifically, P29 (150) and P30 (150) are now past the typical 3-period maximum delivery window and are likely lost. Consequently, the true active pipeline is composed of orders from P31, P32, P33, and P34 (all 150 units each). However, P31 and P32 (150 each) already arrived in P32 and P33. P33 (150) should have arrived in P34 but didn't, and P34 (150) is in transit. Therefore, the reliable active pipeline is roughly 150-300 units depending on P33's fate.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Demand has settled into a regime of approximately 90-100 units per period (P24-P34 average ~94). \n4. **Correction of OR Baseline**: The OR recommends 0 because its 'pipeline' calculation sees 1604 units in transit (which it assumes will arrive). By subtracting the 1604 units of confirmed/likely losses, the OR would recognize a need for stock. To cover 3 periods (L+1) at ~95 units/period, we need ~285 units. With 98 on-hand and 150 likely reliable in transit (P34), we are near that target but must account for the high loss probability.

Based on historical data through Period 45, we have 1,604 confirmed lost units (P2, P6, P11, P14, P15, P17, P25, P29, P30). Subtracting these from the current In-transit leaves an active pipeline of 300 units (the orders from P44 and P45). Our current on-hand inventory is 167 units. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 75 units per period over the last 10 periods (avg ~80). With a promised lead time of 2 periods, we need to cover demand for the current period (P46) plus the lead time (P47, P48). Total inventory needed = 75 units/period * 3 periods = 225 units. Currently, on-hand (167) + active pipeline (300) = 467 units. This is more than sufficient to cover demand through Period 48, even accounting for potential shipment losses. Since we are nearing the end of the game (Period 46 of 50), it is prudent to stop ordering to avoid high holding costs and leftover inventory at Period 50.",

Decisions made now (Period 49) will result in arrivals during Period 49, 50, or 51 (after the game ends). Given the promised lead time of 2 periods and the observed range of 1-3 periods, any order placed now is highly unlikely to arrive in time to satisfy demand for the final period (Period 50). The 'In-transit' figure of 1,904 units is confirmed to be composed of 1,604 units of historical losses plus active orders from Periods 44 and 45 (150 units each). These active orders (300 units total) are expected to arrive during the resolution of Periods 49 or 50. With 0 on-hand inventory but 300 units of true pipeline inventory versus a demand regime of ~90 units/period, there is sufficient stock already in transit to cover the final period's demand if it arrives.

The true active pipeline consists only of orders from Period 44 onwards. Looking at the history, orders from P43 arrived in P45 (LT=2). Orders from P44 (150 units), P45 (150 units), and the current inventory state must be reconciled. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at roughly 80-90 units per period. We have 150 units from P44 expected to arrive imminently (LT is usually 1-3). Since we are currently at 0 on-hand and have been stocking out for the last three periods (P47-P49), we need to place an order to resume supply. The true active pipeline is only 300 units (P44 and P45). With demand averaging ~85, a cycle of (L+1) = 3 periods requires ~255 units. Given we are at 0 on-hand and want to recover from stockouts, ordering 150 units aligns with the recent ordering pattern that successfully met demand before the P46-P49 pause.",
