Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1. There is no historical performance or lead time data yet, but we have 5 demand samples (mean: 126.2, std: 51.5). The lead time is promised at 2 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the system should target a high service level. For this initial decision, I will use the default methods which utilize all available historical samples to set the base stock level. I will use the promised lead time (L=2) as the starting point. The goal is to establish an initial pipeline that covers demand for 3 periods (L+1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we are dealing with chips(Regular). The pre-game demand average was 145.4 units, while Period 1 demand was 134 units, showing a slight decrease but remaining within a consistent range. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory because the Period 1 order (212 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible/usable at the start of Period 4. Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is occurring, we are currently losing sales. To address this, I will use a forecast based on the last 6 samples (5 pre-game + Period 1) to set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. The target service level derived from the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1) is 80%, which the OR base-stock policy will aim for. I am keeping L at the default promised value of 2 as we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. According to historical data provided, demand for Period 1 was 216 and Period 2 was 129 (though the 'conclude' messages show 134 and 195 respectively; I will prioritize the 'conclude' message data for actual sold/lost sales tracking). On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (212 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in Period 4's start. This means we have had stockouts for the first two periods. The 'In-transit' total of 416 units corresponds to the orders from P1 (212) and P2 (204). Since we are in the initial phase and have no concrete evidence that the actual lead time differs from the promised 2 periods (as P1's order isn't due until the end of this period), I will stay with L=default. For demand forecasting, the average demand of the first two periods is approximately 165. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand, mu_hat should be around 495. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=2 to capture the most recent demand levels while we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders placed in P1 (212 units), P2 (204 units), and P3 (141 units) are in transit. Based on the lead time definition (L=2), the P1 order should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This suggests either a lead time delay (L >= 3) or a lost shipment. Given the 'chips(Regular)' description and the available data (mean ~145), the pipeline inventory (557 units) is significantly higher than 3-4 periods of demand, but zero sales have occurred due to stockouts. I will maintain the default lead time for now but monitor P4's arrival closely. I'll use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to capture the volatility (range 115-216), using N=5 to include all historical samples.

Daily Profit: $652.00, Daily Holding Cost: $190.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $462.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the previous orders from Period 1 and Period 3 arrived simultaneously in Period 4. The actual lead times were 3 periods and 1 period respectively, averaging exactly the promised 2 periods (L=2). The on-hand inventory is currently 190, with 204 units (from Period 2) still in transit. Historical demand over the first 5 periods (including samples) shows values of 216, 129, 138, 129, 115, 134, 195, 130, and 163. The mean demand is approximately 150. Based on the date information provided (Period 1-5), there is no clear seasonal indicator yet. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to let the backend average observed arrivals, and 'recent_N' for demand with N=5 to capture the most recent volatility while smoothing out noise. The pipeline inventory (204) + on-hand (190) = 394 units, which covers nearly 2.6 periods of average demand, providing a reasonable buffer while the OR engine calculates the next optimal order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $560.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 134, 195, 130, 163, 150. Average demand is ~154. Looking at lead times: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 3), and the Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 1). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance (1 and 3). Current inventory is 40 on-hand with 404 in-transit (orders from Period 2 and Period 5). The Period 2 order (204 units) is expected to arrive soon as it has been 4 periods since ordering. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend average the observed values (1 and 3), and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the stable mean of ~154 per period. This approach balances the stock levels against the moderate holding cost ($1) and healthy profit ($4).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 with zero on-hand inventory and 602 units in-transit. Demand over the first 6 periods has been relatively stable, averaging 152.5 units per period. Historical demand samples provided are: P1: 216, P2: 129, P3: 138, P4: 129, P5: 115, and observed demand from history is P1: 134, P2: 195, P3: 130, P4: 163, P5: 150, P6: 143. The promised lead time is 2 periods. However, looking at the concluded history: P1 order arrived at P4 (lead time 3), and P3 order arrived at P4 (lead time 1). P2 (ordered 204) and P5 (ordered 200) have not yet arrived. P2 is now significantly overdue (ordered P2, currently P7 start, that is 5 periods elapsed). This suggests potential shipment loss or high lead time variance. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend find the average of observed lead times (3 and 1), which is 2. For demand, I'll use recent_N=6 to capture the observed mean from the game history (avg ~152), which is higher than the initial samples. This will help the OR engine set a base stock that accounts for both the mean demand and the volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability observed: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. P2 order (204 units) is currently missing/overdue after 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand (P1-P7) for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of ~153.5 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 651 units in-transit. Crucially, the order from Period 2 (204 units) is now 6 periods old, far exceeding the promised lead time of 2 and even the observed max lead time of 3. I am treating the P2 order as a lost shipment to avoid under-ordering based on ghost inventory. The remaining pipeline consists of P5 (200), P6 (198), P7 (49), and the current P8 order. Lead times are volatile: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to average the observed 3 and 1 (giving 2). For demand, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the trend of 130-163 units. The OR backend will see (1+L=3) periods of demand. By assuming P2 is lost, the OR engine will trigger a larger order to recover the stock-out position (sold 0 in P7).

Carry-over insight: P2 order (204 units) confirmed lost/missing after 6 periods (Promised 2). Demand stable around 153/period.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The current on-hand inventory is 124. Reviewing the lead time history: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period, Period 5 arrived in 3 periods, and Period 7 arrived in 1 period. The Period 2 order (204 units) is now 7 periods old and confirmably lost. This indicates a binary lead time pattern (alternating between 1 and 3 periods), averaging to 2, but with high risk of stockouts if we assume 1. The promised lead time is 2. Demand is relatively stable. The average demand across all 8 periods is (134+195+130+163+150+143+160+125)/8 = 150. Based on the last 5 periods (P4-P8), the average is (163+150+143+160+125)/5 = 148.2. I will use the last 5 periods to estimate demand as it reflects the current regime better. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed 1, 3, 1, 3 sequence, effectively treating L as 2. Because of the lost shipment in Period 2 and the high variance in arrival, maintaining a slightly higher safety stock is prudent.

Carry-over insight: Lead time exhibits a binary pattern of 1 or 3 periods (Average 2). Period 2 order (204 units) is officially categorized as lost (7 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Reviewing history: Demand for chips(Regular) appears stable, with a recent mean of approximately 147 over the last 9 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory consists of orders from Period 6 (198 units), Period 9 (93 units), and the order placed in Period 10 (not yet seen in history but reflected in in-transit). Crucially, the Period 2 order (204 units) is confirmed lost after 8 periods, which has significantly depleted our stock. Lead times are volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2), but the loss of the P2 order is the primary driver of current stockouts. To recover, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods of demand (mean ~144) to capture the stable but slightly lower recent demand, and keep lead time at the promised 2 periods (the average of 1 and 3). Given the previous stockouts and the lost shipment, the backend OR logic needs to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods. I will use recent_N for both mu and sigma to reflect the current market regime.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 with 0 on-hand inventory and 597 units in-transit. Demand is stable, with a recent 5-period mean of 149.6 units (Periods 6-10). Lead time (L) fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2 periods. The order from Period 2 (204 units) is confirmed lost after 9 periods. The current in-transit inventory (597 units) consists of orders from P6 (198), P9 (93), and P10 (102), totaling 393 units known; the remaining 204 in the 'In-transit' figure likely represents the phantom P2 order which will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to cover the (L+1)=3 period window (P11, P12, P13), I will set L to 2 (avg), mu_hat to 450 (150/period * 3 periods), and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the current stockout and the high likelihood that the P6 order (198 units) arrives this period or next (L=2 or 3).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system follows a binary lead-time pattern of 1 or 3 periods (average 2), but we are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. Period 2's order is confirmed lost. Since Period 8, we have had multiple orders (P6, P9, P10, P11) that haven't concluded yet. Given the lead time pattern, the P6 order (placed Period 6) is now 5 periods old, which is concerning but not yet definitively 'lost' based on the history of P2. However, we have 621 units in transit, which should theoretically cover multiple periods of demand once they arrive. Recent demand (last 8 periods) averages 148.5 units/period. Period 12's decision must account for the high pipeline inventory while ensuring we recover from the current stockout. I will maintain L=2 as the effective average and use recent_N (N=8) for demand forecasting to capture the current mean of ~148 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Pipeline inventory is very high (621 units) relative to recent demand avg of 149, yet on-hand remains 0 due to lead-time jitter (P6 order now 6 periods since placement, potentially lost).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. Current on-hand is 113. In-transit is 426, consisting of Period 6 (198 units - 7 periods elapsed, likely lost), Period 11 (24 units - 2 periods elapsed), and potentially recent un-logged orders. Reviewing history: P6 (ordered 198) is severely overdue (7 periods vs 2-3 observed), mirroring the P2 loss. P11 (24 units) is still within a plausible lead-time window. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages 131.8, while the all-time mean is ~145. Demand appears relatively stable despite the lower Period 12 value (82). The lead time pattern is jittery (1, 2, or 3 periods) but averages 2. To account for the likely loss of the 198 units from P6, I will set L to 2 (promised/observed average) and use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the slightly lower recent demand trend. Given the high pipeline (exclusive of the likely lost P6 order), the OR backend will moderate new orders naturally if the stock position is sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Period 6 order (198 units) confirmed lost/missing after 7 periods elapsed (Promised 2). Demand regime remains stable with slight downward variance (avg ~132 vs historical 145).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are again at 0 on-hand inventory. History shows a pattern of lost shipments (Period 2 and Period 6 orders) and binary lead times (1 or 3 periods). The high pipeline inventory (426 units) consists of orders from Period 11, 12 (though 0 units were ordered), and 13 (though 0 units were ordered). Actually, tracking the In-transit balance: P11 (24 units) is in transit. Previous periods (P12, P13) show 0 ordered. Wait, looking at 'In-transit: 426 units' - this implies shipments from P11 (24) and perhaps unrecorded or late-arriving orders from earlier. Note: Period 11 ordered 24, Period 10 arrived (P12), Period 9 arrived (P12). The 426 in-transit includes units that haven't arrived yet. Historical mean demand is approx 145/period. Recent 5-period demand (P9-P13) is (140+170+142+82+147)/5 = 136.2. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the longest observed successful lead time and frequent stockouts. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~141/period) while smoothing the low P12 value. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to manage variability during these lead-time jitters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 581 units. Looking at the history, arrival lead times for chips(Regular) have fluctuated between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with orders from Period 2 and Period 6 confirmed lost. Specifically, Period 11's order arrived in Period 14 (L=3), while the order from Period 14 (179 units) is in-transit. The in-transit total of 581 includes the Period 14 order (179) and potentially very old/lost shipments or more recent orders not yet showing in the 'conclude' arrival logs because they were placed in the immediately preceding 'decision' phases (P12-14). Demand is relatively stable, with the last 5 samples (P10-P14) averaging 140 units. Since current on-hand is 0 and pipeline is substantial (581 units), but shipments are unreliable (L=1 to L=3 + lost units), I will set L to 3 (the observed maximum successful lead time) to ensure the OR logic accounts for a wider protection window. For demand, I'll use the most recent 10 periods (including those in the system-provided historical list) to capture the current mean of ~135-140 per period. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=10 to smooth out recent variance. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to capture the true volatility in demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P11 took 3 periods). Shipment losses are significant (P2 and P6 confirmed lost).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment exhibits high lead-time volatility (1-3 periods) and frequent shipment loss (Period 2 and Period 6 orders never arrived). In Period 16, on-hand inventory is 0 despite 609 units in-transit. These 609 units represent orders from Period 14 (179 units) and Period 15 (28 units). However, the in-transit total also includes the missing orders from P2 (204) and P6 (198), totaling 402 units that are likely lost. The OR backend treats all in-transit units as 'pipeline inventory' and subtracts them from the order quantity. To ensure the backend places orders that cover actual needs, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at 150/period. With a promised lead time (L=2), the base stock calculation should cover (L+1)=3 periods, which is 450 units. Since the OR engine subtracts the 609 pipeline units, it will order 0 unless I adjust mu_hat to account for the ~400 units of 'phantom' inventory. I will set mu_hat to 850 (450 target + 400 lost) and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high demand variance and supply uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Supply chain stress confirmed - 402 units in pipeline (P2, P6 orders) are effectively lost, causing a 0 on-hand inventory state despite high in-transit numbers.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 17 with 0 on-hand inventory and 901 units in-transit. Historical data reveals a high rate of shipment loss: orders from Period 2 (204 units) and Period 6 (198 units) are confirmed lost (7+ periods elapsed). This means out of the 901 units in-transit, 402 are 'ghost inventory' that will likely never arrive. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' in its base-stock calculation. If it counts those 402 lost units, it will under-order, perpetuating the stockout. To compensate, I must adjust mu_hat or L to increase the base stock level. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.25 for successful deliveries). Demand has slightly dropped recently (79 in P16), but the average remains around 140. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the missing 402 units and bridge current stockouts, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as: (1+L)*AverageDemand + LostVolume. With L=2, (1+2)*141 + 402 = 825. Using an explicit L of 2 to match the promised lead time while mu_hat handles the safety buffer and replenishment needs. sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a high service level given the high profit margin and supply instability.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: Total of 402 units (P2, P6) confirmed lost. In-transit inventory overestimates actual supply by ~45%, requiring mu_hat inflation to force replenishment.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, two large orders arrived (P14 and P16), bringing on-hand inventory to 422 units. The current pipeline inventory (In-transit: 430) is inflated by 402 units from P2 and P6, which have been confirmed lost (7+ periods elapsed). To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly assuming this phantom inventory covers future demand, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to adjust the base stock calculation. I am setting mu_hat = (1+L) * average_demand + lost_units. With L=2, recent demand average is ~134 (last 10 periods), giving (3 * 134) + 402 = 804. This ensures the backend maintains a target safety level that accounts for the permanent loss of the P2 and P6 shipments while managing the current high on-hand stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-72.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 352 units, which is high relative to recent demand. However, the supply chain remains unreliable. Historically, orders from Period 2 (204 units) and Period 6 (198 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 402 phantom units in the 'In-transit' count (453 current in-transit - 402 lost = 51 actual units in transit). The OR backend calculates orders based on 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit). If I use the default L=2, mu_hat becomes (1+2)*138=414. With 352 on-hand + 453 in-transit, the backend sees 805 units, far exceeding the base stock, and will stop ordering. Since 402 units are lost, I must inflate mu_hat to 'mask' these losses and ensure the OR engine doesn't under-order in future cycles. Recent demand has also dropped significantly (avg of last 5 periods ~90, vs. historical ~140). I will use explicit mu_hat = (1+L) * 140 + 400 \u2248 820 to compensate for the lost units while monitoring if the lower demand persists or is a temporary dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: mean demand dropped from ~150 to ~90 over the last 5 periods (P14-P18). Lost shipment impact: 402 units (P2, P6) remain in pipeline count, artificially inflating perceived inventory by ~400 units.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we have an on-hand inventory of 299 units and an in-transit inventory of 560 units. However, the in-transit figure is severely compromised by historical shipping failures: Period 2 (204 units) and Period 6 (198 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 402 phantom units in the pipeline. Excluding these, the actual reliable in-transit inventory is 158 units (P15: 28, P18: 23, P19: 107). Demand has shifted significantly downward; the last 5 periods (P15-P19) show a mean of 83.6 units, compared to the earlier average of ~150. With 299 on-hand and 158 actual in-transit units, we have 457 units of real coverage. Given the new demand regime (approx 84/period) and a review+lead time of 3 periods (L=2), we need a base stock around 250-300 units. Since 457 > 300, no new order is required. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 'pipeline_inventory' as 560 and thus under-ordering in future periods (or now), I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat based on the new demand regime (84 * 3 = 252). I will set L to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals average 2.3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilization confirmed at lower level: Periods 16-19 mean demand is 62.7 units, suggesting a drop of >50% from the baseline of 150. Current reliable pipeline (excluding 402 lost units) is 158 units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, we have 210 units on-hand. The total 'In-transit' reported is 560 units, but 402 units from Period 2 and Period 6 are confirmed lost based on historical carry-over. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 158 units (560 - 402). Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has shifted significantly lower, averaging 68 units per period compared to the previous 150. Given the lead time variability (range 1-3 periods, average 2), I am setting L to the prometed 2 periods. To account for the sharp demand drop and prevent overstocking, I'm using N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. I'm also using 'explicit' for mu_hat to proactively adjust for the 402 units of ghost inventory in the backend calculation: the OR engine sees 560 units in transit, so I must inflate mu_hat by 402 to ensure the base stock calculation targets the correct order quantity (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline). Target Base Stock \u2248 (1+2)*68 + Z*sigma \u2248 204. To get a base stock that results in a correct replenishment considering the phantom 402 units, mu_hat is set to 204 + 402 = 606.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at new lower level (Periods 16-20 avg: 68). Phantom inventory of 402 lost units persisted in pipeline through Period 20.

However, we have confirmed that 402 units (orders from P2 and P6) are lost. This leaves a 'real' pipeline of 158 units (P15: 28 units, P18: 23 units, P19: 107 units), all of which are already past or at their promised lead time. With an on-hand inventory of 134 units and real pipeline units expected soon, the total available inventory (~292 units) is sufficient to cover more than 4 periods of demand at the current rate (69 units/period). I will update mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the lower demand regime and use calculate for L to account for the observed lead-time jitter (averaging 1-3 periods). No new orders are likely given the current stock level relative to the new demand mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~70 units/period (P16-P21 average is 69.3). Supply chain jitter persists with lead times between 1-3 periods. Verified phantom inventory (lost shipments) from P2 and P6 (402 units total) still resides in the system's in-transit calculation.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level following a regime shift around Period 16. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P16-P22) is 68.57 units. On-hand inventory is currently 70 units. The pipeline inventory is reported at 560 units; however, historical data confirms that orders from Period 2 (204 units) and Period 6 (198 units) are lost, totaling 402 units of 'phantom' inventory. Subtracting these from the total pipeline leaves a reliable in-transit amount of 158 units (P15 order of 28, P18 of 23, P19 of 107). Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average 2). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the phantom inventory, I am setting L to the promised 2 periods and using an explicit mu_hat. This mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * recent_mean = 3 * 70 = 210. This ensures the base stock calculation accurately reflects the current lower demand while accounting for lead time requirements.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime following a shift around Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to 23 is approximately 71 units per period. The supply chain continues to exhibit a 'phantom inventory' issue: 402 units from orders in Period 2 (204 units) and Period 6 (198 units) are confirmed as lost but remain in the pipeline inventory calculation used by the OR backend. As of Period 24, on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (2 units). The current total in-transit is 560 units. Subtracting the 402 lost units leaves a realistic pipeline of 158 units (comprised of orders from P15, P18, and P19). Since the OR engine's formula (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will count the full 560 units, I must inflate mu_hat to overcome this 402-unit 'phantom' hurdle and trigger a replenishment order. Setting mu_hat to approximately 650 ((1+L)*71 + 402) ensures the backend perceives a need for fresh stock. Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods), so I will use a recent average for L to buffer against arrival jitter.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~71 units/period (P16-P23 avg). Phantom inventory of 402 units (lost orders P2, P6) persists in system's in-transit total, requiring sustained mu_hat inflation.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 25 appears stable following the drop observed around Period 16. The average demand for the last 9 periods (P16-P24) is 72.2 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an in-transit (pipeline) inventory of 671 units; however, historical data confirms that orders from Period 2 (204 units) and Period 6 (198 units) are lost. This results in 402 units of 'phantom' inventory that will never arrive. The actual reliable pipeline is 269 units (671 - 402), consisting of orders from P15 (28), P18 (23), P19 (107), and P24 (111). Since the OR engine subtracts the full pipeline (671) when calculating orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock and counteract this 402-unit subtraction. Calculation: Base Stock = (1+L) * mu_target + buffer. With L=2, mu_target ~ 73, and q=0.8, the base stock target is ~260. To get the OR engine to order approximately 100 units (to cover 0 on-hand and 0 expected arrivals this period), and given it subtracts 671, I set mu_hat to a value that reflects (Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory) / (1+L). (260 + 402) / 3 \u2248 220. This forces an order despite the inflated in-transit count.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upwards again. After a period of low demand (~70 units), the last two periods (P24, P25) have seen demand of 102 and 123 respectively, suggesting a new mean around 110-115 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts. The in-transit inventory is listed as 671 units, but 402 of these (orders from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, leaving only 269 units as reliable pipeline. To compensate for the 'phantom' inventory of 402 units that the OR engine incorrectly subtracts from the order quantity, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To calculate the needed mu_hat: I want a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the 402 lost units. With an estimated demand of 115 units and L=3 (to be safe against lead time jitter), target inventory is (4 * 115) + 402 = 862. This will force the OR engine (which subtracts 671) to order enough to reach a healthy stock level for the current demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from P24: mean increased from ~70 to ~115 (+64%). Supply chain phantom inventory remains at 402 units (P2, P6).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that shifted at Period 24. While the most recent demand (P26) was 72, the preceding periods (P24-P25) saw demand spikes of 102 and 123. The transition from ~70 units/period to ~115 units/period is substantiated by the carry-over insights. Total In-transit is 900 units, but 402 units (P2, P6) are confirmed lost, leaving a reliable pipeline of 498. Since On-hand is 0, we must force the OR backend to place orders by inflating mu_hat to account for this 'phantom' inventory. Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods). I will use N=3 for demand to capture the recent spike (Avg P24-P26: ~99), then multiply by (1+L) where L=2, and add the 402 phantom units to mu_hat. This targets a base stock that compensates for the 402-unit gap in the system's pipeline logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: mean increased from ~70 to ~100 based on recent 3-period average (P24: 102, P25: 123, P26: 72).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 24, averaging approximately 89 units over the last 4 periods (P24: 102, P25: 123, P26: 72, P27: 59), up from the previous low of ~70. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline shows 900 units. However, we must account for the 402 units (P2, P6) confirmed lost in previous carry-over insights. Subtracting these from the current 'In-transit' of 900 yields a 'reliable' pipeline of 498 units. Since the OR backend is unaware of these losses, it overestimates available stock by 402 units. To force the base-stock level high enough to trigger an order despite this phantom inventory, I will explicitly set mu_hat to cover the actual average demand (~90) for (L+1=3) periods, plus an inflation factor equal to the missing 402 units. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (1-3 periods). mu_hat value calculation: (3 periods * 90) + 402 \u2248 672. sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent high volatility in demand (ranging from 59 to 123).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 confirmed: avg increased from ~70 to ~89 (+27%) based on P24-P27 samples. Phantom inventory from lost orders P2 and P6 remains at 402 units in the system's pipeline total.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 24. For the last 5 periods (P24-P28), demand values are 102, 123, 72, 59, and 104, averaging 92 units per period compared to the previous regime of ~68. We observe that 402 units (orders from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' total of 671 units. The REAL pipeline inventory is therefore 671 - 402 = 269 units. To compensate for the 402 phantom units that the OR backend incorrectly subtracts from the order quantity, I am inflating mu_hat. Base stock is calculated for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods). Targeted Base Stock = 3 * 92 = 276 plus safety stock. To force the backend to place an order when on-hand(125) + real_pipeline(269) = 394, while it sees on-hand(125) + system_pipeline(671) = 796, I must add 402 to the desired mu_hat. Desired mu_hat \u2248 3 * 92 + 402 = 678. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR logic overcomes the phantom inventory drag while reflecting the current higher demand level.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards at Period 24, averaging ~93 units over the last six periods (P24-P29: 102, 123, 72, 59, 104, 93). I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture this higher mean. Lead times remain erratic (1-3 periods), but the 'calculate' method will average these observations. The critical issue is the 'phantom inventory' of 402 units (orders from P2 and P6) that are lost but remain in the system's pipeline total (671 units). Currently, only 269 units (671 - 402) in the pipeline are likely to arrive. To force the OR engine to order despite this 402-unit phantom offset, I must inflate mu_hat. Following the logic: Base Stock \u2248 (L+1)*Demand. With L=2 (promised), (2+1)*93 = 279. To offset -402 units of fake inventory, I need the base stock to be at least 402 units higher than it would otherwise be. I will use the explicit method to set mu_hat to 800, which should trigger a sufficient order to replenish the zero/low on-hand state while accounting for the 402 units that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 93 units/period (P24-P29 avg). Phantom inventory of 402 units (P2, P6) persists in the system's pipeline, requiring mu_hat inflation to trigger orders.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 93 units/period (avg of P24-P30 \u2248 87.4, but slightly higher recently). We are in a state of 'stockout' with On-hand: 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 807 units, but 402 of these (orders from P2 and P6) are long-confirmed lost shipments that never arrived. The effective pipeline inventory is actually 405 units (807 - 402). The OR backend's capped policy uses the raw 'In-transit' number (807), which makes it believe we are heavily overstocked relative to current demand, preventing it from ordering despite 0 on-hand. To force the backend to place necessary replenishment orders and overcome this 'phantom' inventory of 402 units, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus a safety margin, then add the 402 units of phantom inventory to ensure the backend's calculation (base_stock - 807) results in a positive order. Given L=2, demand=93/period, 0.8 service level (z\u22480.84), and sigma approx 30: Target Base Stock \u2248 (3*93) + 0.84*sqrt(3)*30 \u2248 279 + 44 = 323. To make the backend order against a pipeline of 807, mu_hat must be set so the calculated base stock is significantly higher than 807. I will set mu_hat explicitly high to trigger orders until on-hand levels recover.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 24 onwards) has stabilized at approximately 94 units/period (P24-P31 average), significantly higher than the previous low-demand phase (~70 units). Currently, the system shows 0 units on-hand and an in-transit count of 807 units. However, this pipeline is severely compromised by phantom inventory. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (204 units) and Period 6 (198 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 402 units that the OR backend incorrectly perceives as available supply. Additionally, the order from Period 24 (111 units) is now 8 periods overdue, suggesting it is also likely lost. To force the OR backend to place a replenishment order despite this massive 'phantom' pipeline, I set mu_hat to 1350. This value is calculated to exceed the visible pipeline and lead-time demand: (Target Base Stock) - (Reliable In-transit) - (Safety Stock) logic is overridden by the need to 'out-shout' the 402+ units of phantom inventory. I am using 'explicit' for all parameters to ensure the backend bypasses its internal averages, which cannot account for the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 94 units/period (P24-P31). Supply chain reliability remains poor: P2, P6, and likely P24 orders (totaling 513 units) are lost/missing, causing persistent stockouts due to phantom inventory in the pipeline count.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable around 95 units/period (P24-P32 average is 95.7). However, the supply chain is severely compromised. Historical data shows orders from P2 (204 units), P6 (198 units), and now P24 (111 units) are likely lost, totaling 513 units of 'phantom inventory' that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available pipeline. With current in-transit at 1194, subtracting the 513 lost units leaves a reliable pipeline of 681 units. However, recent stockouts (on-hand is 0) despite this high pipeline suggest even more recent orders may be delayed or lost (e.g., P30 order of 136 is now 3 periods out). To force the backend to place an order despite the 1194 in-transit units, I must inflate mu_hat significantly. base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. To overcome a 1194 pipeline, mu_hat + safety stock must exceed 1194. With L=2, mu_hat (1+L)*mean would naturally be ~300. I am explicitly setting mu_hat to 1350 to ensure an order is generated to recover from the stockout state, accounting for the 513 verified lost units and potential additional delays in the remaining 681 units.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure exacerbated: total verified lost shipments (P2, P6, P24) equals 513 units. System in-transit count (1194) is highly unreliable; on-hand remains 0 despite promised lead time of 2. Inflation of mu_hat is required to bypass phantom inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we received 387 units (from the Period 32 order), resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 309. The system reports an in-transit count of 1011 units; however, historical data confirms that orders from Period 2 (204 units), Period 6 (198 units), and Period 24 (111 units) are lost, totaling 513 units of 'phantom inventory'. Subtracting these from the 1011 in-transit leaves 498 units of reliable pipeline. The demand regime from Period 24 onwards has stabilized at an average of approximately 93 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2, the total requirement for (L+1) periods is roughly 279 units. Since on-hand (309) plus reliable pipeline (498) is 807 units, we are significantly over-provisioned relative to the current demand level. I am opting to use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) over the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current stable regime (~93 units/period) while ignoring the extreme phantom inventory issues in the OR calculation by allowing the backend's default logic to see the high inventory levels and zero out new orders until the surplus is consumed.

Carry-over insight: System in-transit count includes 513 units of verified lost shipments (P2: 204, P6: 198, P24: 111). Subtract this total from 'In-transit' to determine the true reliable pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1011 units 'In-transit', but historical evidence significantly contradicts this. We have verified lost shipments from P2 (204 units), P6 (198 units), and P24 (111 units), totaling 513 lost units currently trapped in the pipeline calculation. Additionally, orders from P28 (which would be 7 periods old) and P30 (5 periods old) haven't arrived, suggesting further supply chain degradation or losses. Reliable demand has transitioned to a lower regime; the average of the last 11 periods (P24-P34) is approximately 92 units. To counteract the 'phantom inventory' (513 units) which prevents the OR engine from ordering even when stock is low, I'm using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock as (1 + 2) * 92 = 276. However, to 'trick' the backend into ignoring the 513 lost units, I must inflate mu_hat. Actual reliable pipeline is 1011 - 513 = 498. Since 498 > 276, and on-hand is currently 243, I will provide a mu_hat that maintains a healthy safety buffer while recognizing the supply chain volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total verified lost shipments (phantom inventory) remain at 513 units (P2, P6, P24). P28 and P30 orders are now high-risk/potentially lost (7 and 5 periods elapsed respectively). Demand regime since P24 is stable at ~92 units/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has stabilized at 92.5 units/period (P24-P35 average). However, the major challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Total verified lost shipments are 513 units (P2: 204, P6: 198, P24: 111). Additionally, the orders from P28 (0 units, not applicable) and P30 (136 units) are now highly suspect as they are significantly beyond the promised 2-period lead time. With an reported 'In-transit' of 1011 units and 143 on-hand, the system perceives 1154 units available. Correcting for the 513 lost units, the true inventory is only 641 units. To prevent stockouts caused by the OR backend underestimating order requirements due to these 'phantom' units, I am using an explicit mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3). My forecast is 92 units/period, requiring a base stock of approximately 276 plus a safety buffer. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 1011 in-transit, I am setting mu_hat to 1200. This value is chosen to exceed the reported in-transit + on-hand total, ensuring the cap-weighted policy triggers replenishment to maintain actual physical supply.

Carry-over insight: P30 order (136 units) now classified as high-risk/likely lost (6 periods elapsed). Total estimated phantom inventory in pipeline (P2, P6, P24, P30) is now 649 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 92 units per period since Period 24. However, the supply chain remains highly unreliable. There is a cumulative total of 649 units of 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline (orders from P2, P6, P24, and now P30 which is 6 periods overdue). The system's in-transit count of 1099 includes these 649 lost units, making the 'reliable' pipeline only 450 units. While we currently have 108 units on hand, we must maintain mu_hat inflation to ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover for the lost shipments that will never arrive. Using explicit mu_hat = (1+L) * 220 (inflated from the base demand of ~92) to force the policy to bypass the phantom stock and maintain a healthy service level.

Carry-over insight: P32 order (387 units) arrived in 1 period, confirming continued lead time jitter (1-3 periods). P30 order (136 units) is now 6 periods overdue and classified as lost, bringing total phantom inventory to 649 units (P2, P6, P24, P30).

Daily Reward (R_t): $269.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 is stabilized at an average of approximately 92.5 units per period. Lead times remain highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with significant shipment losses. Specifically, orders from P2 (204), P6 (198), P24 (111), and P30 (136) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 649 units. These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (1011), creating 'phantom inventory' that leads the OR backend's pipeline logic to under-order. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the reliable demand (92.5 * 3 periods = 277.5) and then inflate it by adding the 649 lost units to 'force' the backend to place orders despite the inflated pipeline count. Setting mu_hat to 927 (277.5 + 649) essentially neutralizes the phantom inventory. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=14) to capture the variance of the current demand regime starting from P24.

Carry-over insight: P32 order arrived in 1 period, but P30 (136 units) is now 7 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total phantom inventory in the pipeline is 649 units (P2, P6, P24, P30). Demand remains stable at approx 92.5 units/period.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 24 onwards has stabilized at a mean of 92.5 units/period (P24-P38 average). Supply chain issues persist: we have a total of 649 units of 'phantom inventory' in the system (P2: 204, P6: 198, P24: 111, P30: 136). These units are officially classified as lost because they have exceeded the promised lead time (2) by more than triple (7+ periods elapsed). The current in-transit count of 1011 units includes these 649 lost units, meaning the reliable pipeline is only 362 units. To prevent stockouts caused by the OR backend undercounting the required order due to this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on the stable mean (92.5) for the lead time plus review period (1+2=3), then add the 649 lost units as an offset. Base stock target = (3 * 92.5) + 649 \u2248 927. This ensures the backend places an order if the total pipeline (including lost units) falls below this inflated target.

Carry-over insight: P30 order (136 units) confirmed lost after 8 periods elapsed; total phantom inventory in pipeline (P2, P6, P24, P30) remains 649 units. Reliable in-transit inventory is currently 362 (1011 total minus 649 lost).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system records 1011 units 'In-transit', but 649 of these units are confirmed or highly likely lost (P2, P6, P24, and P30). The 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend is thus artificially inflated by approximately 179% (1011 actual vs 362 reliable). With an current on-hand of 0 and demand stable around 96 units/period (recent sample P39), we must force the OR backend to place an order despite this phantom inventory. To bypass the (base_stock - pipeline) calculation, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, significantly inflating it to account for the 649 lost units plus needed safety stock. Since the demand regime since Period 24 has averaged ~92 units and lead time is ~2-3 periods, a normal (1+L)*mu would be around 276-368 units. Adding the 649 phantom units to this baseline (276+649=925) suggests an explicit mu_hat of ~950 to ensure an order is triggered. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=16, dating back to the regime shift at P24) to capture the current volatility accurately.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 1,011 units 'In-transit', but 649 of these are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P24, P30). Subtracting these results in a reliable pipeline of 362 units. Since P33 (204 units) and P36 (88 units - already arrived) are the only recent orders, and P36 arrived at P37, the 'In-transit' figure is heavily skewed by old lost shipments. Current on-hand is 0 following demand of 99 in Period 40. The demand regime since Period 24 has stabilized around 92 units/period (P24-P40 mean). To trigger an order from the OR backend despite the 1,011 'phantom' pipeline units, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus a safety buffer. With L=2 (promised) and demand=92, the target is ~350-400 units. To overcome the 1,011 units already in 'In-transit', I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the phantom total plus the target inventory. Setting mu_hat to 1,450 will signal the OR backend that the current pipeline is insufficient, forcing a replenishment order to restore service levels.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 92-94 units per period since Period 24. Recent demand (P36-P41) shows a slight dip with an average of 78 units. However, the critical issue is significant 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Total confirmed lost shipments are 649 units (P2: 204, P6: 198, P24: 111, P30: 136). The system reports an in-transit inventory of 1489 units, but only approx. 840 are reliable. With 0 on-hand inventory and the backend's capped ordering logic, I must continue to inflate mu_hat to ensure the OR engine triggers replenishment despite the perceived (but false) high pipeline. I'll use explicit mu_hat based on the recent stable mean (~92) multiplied by (1+L) plus an adjustment for the lost units, and explicit sigma for current volatility. L is set to 2 to reflect the promised time while acknowledging the jitter.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory in pipeline confirmed at 649 units (P2: 204, P6: 198, P24: 111, P30: 136). Future decisions must subtract this from 'In-transit' to find true reliable supply.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 24 onwards) remains stable with an average of approximately 92 units per period. In Period 43, the system reports 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' total of 1489 units. However, as documented in the carry-over insights, 649 units of this 'In-transit' total are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P24, P30). Subtracting these phantom units reveals a reliable pipeline of 840 units (1489 - 649). Despite this reliable pipeline, on-hand inventory has been 0 for the last three periods, and the lead time continues to show significant jitter (varying between 1 and 3 periods). Given that we are near the end of the simulation (Period 43/50) and facing persistent stockouts due to the backend's miscalculation of available inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for both the expected demand and a correction factor to bypass the 649 units of phantom inventory. Average lead time (L) is set to 2. mu_hat is calculated as (L+1) * 92 + 649 = 925 units to ensure the OR engine triggers a replenishment order despite the inflated 'In-transit' count. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=19, from Period 24) to capture the current regime's volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 24 onwards remains stable at approximately 92 units per period (P24-P43 average: 88; most recent P35-P43 average: 83). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 1489 units. However, we have a total of 649 units of confirmed 'phantom inventory' from lost orders (P2: 204, P6: 198, P24: 111, P30: 136). Subtracting these results in a reliable pipeline of 840 units (1489 - 649). This reliable pipeline consists predominantly of the large P41 order (478 units) and the P33 order (204 units), which is now 11 periods old and highly likely lost. If we exclude P33 as well, the reliable pipeline drops to 636 units. Given the lead time is volatile (1-3 periods), 636 units is more than sufficient to cover 5+ periods of demand (92 * 5 = 460). Therefore, no new orders are needed. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the phantom inventory and stopping regular orders if demand spikes, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable P24-onward regime (N=20), using the default lead time. No mu_hat inflation is required this period as the reliable pipeline is healthy.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: P33 order (204 units) is now 11 periods overdue and highly likely lost. Total potential phantom inventory (P2, P6, P24, P30, P33) is now 853 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P24-P44) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 88.5 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 403 units. The system's 'In-transit' count of 1011 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived and are now confirmed or highly likely lost. Verified lost shipments include P2 (204), P6 (198), P24 (111), P30 (136), and now P33 (204), totaling 853 lost units. Subtracting these from the current 1011 units leaves a reliable pipeline of 158 units. The total reliable inventory is therefore 403 (on-hand) + 158 (reliable in-transit) = 561 units. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously halting orders due to the 853 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat. A base stock target for a 3-period window (L=2) at ~89 units/period would be ~267 units. To reach this target while the system thinks we have 1011 in-transit, I set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the phantom inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Total phantom inventory from lost/overdue shipments (P2, P6, P24, P30, P33) is now 853 units. Reliable pipeline = Total In-transit (1011) - 853 = 158 units. Demand remains stable at ~89 units/period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P24-P45) is stable at approximately 87.5 units per period. The supply chain continues to suffer from lost shipments and lead-time jitter (1-3 periods). A total of 853 units are currently confirmed lost or highly likely lost across P2, P6, P24, P30, and P33. These lost units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (1011), meaning the reliable pipeline is only 158 units (1011 - 853). Current on-hand inventory is 355 units. Given that we are at Period 46 and the simulation ends at Period 50, the total expected demand for the remaining 5 periods is approximately 438 units (5 * 87.5). Total reliable inventory (On-hand 355 + Reliable In-transit 158) equals 513 units, which is sufficient to cover the remaining demand plus a small safety buffer. To avoid over-ordering due to phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat using the recent 20-period average to reflect the ~89 unit/period demand, and L at the promised lead time of 2. No aggressive mu_hat inflation is needed this period as total reliable stock exceeds remaining game demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Reliable pipeline reflects total stock of 513 units against ~438 units of expected demand for the remainder of the game (P46-P50). Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains at 853 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 of 50. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 24 has stabilized at an average of approximately 89.5 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 236 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' total of 1011 units, but our historical tracking (Carry-over insights) confirms that 853 of these units (from orders P2, P6, P24, P30, and P33) are lost/phantom shipments. Therefore, the reliable pipeline is 1011 - 853 = 158 units. Adding on-hand (236) and reliable pipeline (158) gives a total reliable supply of 394 units. Given there are only 4 periods remaining in the game (47, 48, 49, 50) and the average demand is ~90, the total expected demand is approximately 360 units. Our current supply of 394 units is sufficient to cover all remaining demand with a small buffer. Ordering more would likely result in unnecessary holding costs at the end of the game. To prevent the OR backend from placing an order despite the phantom inventory problem, I will set mu_hat to reflects the current demand level (~90 units) and use the 'default' lead time. With base_stock \u2248 90 * 3 = 270, and system 'pipeline' at 1011, the OR engine will correctly calculate an order of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $199.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 149 units. Recent demand (P44-P47) has averaged 82.25 units per period. With only 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), the total expected demand is approximately 250 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1011 units is heavily inflated by 853 units of 'phantom inventory' (verified lost shipments P2, P6, P24, P30, P33). Subtracting these results in a reliable pipeline of 158 units. Combined with the 149 units on-hand, our total reliable inventory is 307 units. This is sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~250 units for the remainder of the game without incurring excessive holding costs or risking significant stockouts. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method (N=10) to reflect the current demand regime (~85 units/period), while relying on the existing stock to carry us through Period 50. No new orders are necessary.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the penultimate period (Period 49 of 50). The current on-hand inventory is 59 units. The average demand in the current regime (from Period 24 onwards) is approximately 89 units per period. With only two periods left (49 and 50), the total expected demand is roughly 178 units. We have 59 units on-hand. The system reports an 'In-transit' count of 1011 units, but our historical tracking (Carry-over insights) confirms that 853 units are lost/phantom shipments (P2, P6, P24, P30, P33). Therefore, the 'reliable' pipeline inventory is 1011 - 853 = 158 units. Adding on-hand (59) and reliable pipeline (158) gives a total reliable supply of 217 units, which exceeds our remaining expected demand of ~178 units. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs in the final period without the possibility of additional sales profit, as we already have sufficient stock coverage to finish the game.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final day of the game. On-hand inventory is 0, and there is no remaining demand period to satisfy since the simulation concludes after the current period's resolution. Any order placed now would arrive in Period 51 or later, beyond the game's horizon, and would only incur procurement costs without the possibility of generating sales. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to place an order of 0 to maximize the final total reward by avoiding unnecessary expenses.
