Following the strategy to cover (L+1) periods of demand (3 periods: current P1 + P2 + P3), I need to account for approximately 435 units (3 * 145).

Total required pipeline = 3 periods * 144 units/period = 432 units. Currently, I have 435 units in-transit (ordered in Period 1), which covers the target pipeline. Since I am at the start of Period 2, and the Period 1 order won't arrive until Period 3, I will experience another stockout in Period 2. However, placing an additional order now would only arrive in Period 4, potentially leading to excess inventory and high holding costs ($1.0/unit) if demand remains stable around 144. I will place a small order of 100 units to begin building a buffer for Period 4, as the 435 units arriving in Period 3 will likely be depleted by existing backlogged pressure or immediate demand in Periods 3 and 4.",

{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a regime averaging approximately 90 units per period (P24-P43 average is ~88, most recent 5 periods average ~83). The primary challenge is a highly unreliable supply chain where shipments frequently disappear. Analysis of the 'In-transit' quantity (1650) vs. game history confirms that the vast majority of these units (roughly 1400+) are lost. Viable pipeline units currently are only from Period 41 (100 units), Period 42 (100 units), and Period 43 (150 units). The order from Period 40 arrived in Period 43 (lead time 3). Given the current on-hand inventory of 45 and the expectation that only the P41 and P42 orders will arrive in the next 1-2 periods, I must continue ordering to maintain a buffer against potential shipment losses. An order of 150 units is placed to cover roughly 1.5-2 periods of demand, balancing the risk of stockouts due to lost shipments against holding costs, while acknowledging the game is nearing its end (Period 44 of 50).",
  "carry_over_insight": "Supply chain failure remains the critical factor: orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P34, P35, and P36 (totaling approx 1,400+ units) are confirmed lost. Viable pipeline consists strictly of orders placed within the last 3 periods (P41, P42, P43). Demand regime is stable at ~90 units/period.",

The viable pipeline consists only of orders from Period 42 (100 units), Period 43 (150 units), and Period 44 (150 units). Demand is currently stable in a regime averaging approximately 85-90 units per period (Periods 24-44), with the last few periods showing slightly lower than average demand (55, 75). With 70 units on-hand and 1700 technically 'In-transit' (of which only 400 are viable), I must continue to order to mitigate the high probability of future shipment losses. The goal is to maintain at least 2-3 periods of demand coverage (approx 270 units) in the viable pipeline. Ordering 150 units maintains a consistent pressure on the unreliable supply chain while preventing excessive holding costs should multiple shipments arrive simultaneously.",

Currently, orders from Period 44 (150 units) and Period 45 (150 units) are in-transit and expected to arrive within the next 1-2 periods. Given that the game ends at Period 50, I need to ensure sufficient stock for Periods 46-50 without incurring excessive holding costs. Total remaining demand is estimated at 450 units (5 periods * 90 units). Current inventory (272) + viable pipeline (P44=150, P45=150) equals 572 units, which is sufficient to cover the rest of the game even with some variance or potential minor shipment loss.

Recent demand in Period 46 was slightly higher at 119. On-hand inventory is currently 153. The supply chain is notoriously unreliable, with a massive cumulative loss of over 1,400 units (estimated based on orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P34, P35, and P36 which never arrived or arrived elsewhere). The 'In-transit' figure of 1650 is misleading; only recent orders from P44 (150 units), P45 (150 units), and P46 (50 units) totaling 350 units are considered viable. With the game ending at Period 50, I must ensure service levels for the final 4 periods (P47-P50) while avoiding excessive holding costs on the final period. Estimated demand for P47-P50 is ~370 units. Total viable inventory (OH + Viable Pipeline) is 153 + 350 = 503. This surplus (relative to mean demand) provides a buffer against further shipment losses. I will order a small amount (50 units) to maintain a continuous flow in case the P44/P45 orders are lost, but I start tapering off to minimize ending inventory as we approach Period 50.",

My viable pipeline includes orders from Period 44 (150 units - now 4 periods elapsed, likely lost), Period 45 (150 units - 3 periods elapsed, still viable), Period 46 (50 units), and Period 47 (50 units). Currently, 66 units are on-hand. Since any ending inventory after Period 50 carries a holding cost without further sale opportunity, I should aim to have just enough to cover Periods 48, 49, and 50. Expected total demand for the remaining 3 periods is ~270 units. Starting with 66 on hand, I need ~204 more.

The supply chain has a significant history of losses (approximately 1,400+ units across the game), making the 'In-transit' figure of 1,750 largely unreliable. Only recent orders (P44, P45, P46, P47, P48) totaling 550 units are considered viable. Since the game ends at Period 50, I need to cover demand for Periods 49 and 50. Total demand for two periods is roughly 180 units. In-transit viable units from P44 (150) and P45 (150) are expected to arrive in Period 49 and 50 based on the typical 1-3 period lead time.

Recent orders are: P44 (150 units), P45 (150 units), P46 (50 units), P47 (50 units), P48 (50 units), and P49 (50 units). Given the target lead time of 2 periods and the actual lead time observing as 1-3 periods, the orders from P44-P46 (350 units) should have arrived or be arriving now. However, P44-P45 have not arrived as of P49 conclude, suggesting potential loss or delay. To prevent stockouts in the final period (P50), which is common in this scenario, a maintenance order matching the current average demand (90 units) is placed. However, since P50 is the final period of this specific simulation block, the order placed now in P50 will arrive after the game ends. Typically, I would order to cover demand, but with on-hand at 0 and significant 'in-transit' (1800 total, mostly lost), I will place a hedge order of 100 units to ensure potential recovery if the scenario continues, while recognizing the immediate stockout risk for P50.",
