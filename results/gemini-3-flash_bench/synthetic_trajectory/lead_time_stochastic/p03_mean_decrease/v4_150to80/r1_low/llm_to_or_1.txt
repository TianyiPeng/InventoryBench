Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no historical conclusion data yet to infer lead-time reliability. The initial demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' show: 216, 129, 138, 129, 115. The mean of these 5 samples is 145.4. Given the promised lead time of 2, the review+lead interval is 3 periods. Using all 5 samples provides a baseline mean (mu_hat) of 145.4 * 3 = 436.2. The standard deviation of the samples is 40.24, leading to a sigma_hat of sqrt(3) * 40.24 = 69.7. I will use the 'default' methods for the first period to establish a baseline while the system calculates from all available samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and ordered 212 units. Since the promised lead time is 2, those units are correctly in-transit and haven't arrived yet. Consequently, all Period 1 demand (137 units) was lost as there was 0 on-hand inventory. The historical demand data (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) shows an average demand of approximately 145 units per period. The Period 1 demand of 137 is consistent with this range. I will use 'default' for L (2 periods) and a 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting. Given we only have one actual realization (137) plus the 5 historical samples, I will use N=5 to capture the recent stable demand levels. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level covering (2+1)=3 periods of demand to ensure enough stock is available once the first shipment arrives.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for Period 1 and Period 2 was 137 and 130 respectively. However, we have 0 starting on-hand inventory and have sold 0 units because no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (212 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 3 and become visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, 357 units are in-transit (orders from Period 1 and 2). Demand is relatively stable with a mean of ~128 units across the first 5 samples provided in the description (216, 129, 138, 129, 115). Since we have no observed arrivals yet, we cannot infer actual lead time deviations. I'll use the 'default' L (2 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent statistics while the system stabilizes. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (2+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in Period 3's conclude message. However, the history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 3's conclusion, despite the P1 order (212 units) being overdue. This indicates a likely delay in lead time. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales for 3 consecutive periods (Total demand: 404, Sales: 0). Total in-transit is 390 units (P1: 212, P2: 145, P3: 33). Given the lead time seems to be at least 3 periods (P1 order not yet arrived by start of P4), I will explicitly set L to 3 to adjust the inventory target. Demand is relatively stable (Avg: 134.6), so I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current demand level while accounting for the stockout reality.

Carry-over insight: Lead time potential drift: Period 1 order (212 units) did not arrive by the start of Period 4, suggesting actual lead time >= 3 periods.

Daily Profit: $166.00, Daily Holding Cost: $79.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the resolution of the lead time uncertainty. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), while the order from Period 3 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). The Period 2 order (145 units) is still missing and is now overdue (it should have arrived by Period 4 if L=2). Combining all observed lead times (3, 1), the average is 2, which matches the promised lead time. However, the high volatility in arrival (1 to 3+ periods) and the missing P2 order suggest we should maintain a conservative approach. Demand has shown a slight upward trend in recent samples (P4 demand was 166, higher than the previous 115-138 range). I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand parameters to capture this slight shift while smoothing the noise. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend utilize the available history, noting that the pipeline inventory remains high (287 units) once the missing P2 order and recent P4 order are accounted for.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time variability: Obs P1=3 periods, P3=1 period. P2 order (145 units) is currently overdue as of Period 5 start.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 with 0 on-hand inventory and 456 units in-transit. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 144 units per period (samples: 216, 129, 138, 129, 115 from initialization; 137, 130, 137, 166, 152 from history). The lead time is highly volatile: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1 period, and the order from P2 (145 units) is now overdue (has not arrived after 3 periods, as it would have appeared in the P5 conclude if it arrived during P5). The P4 order (142 units) and P5 order (169 units) are also outstanding. Given the 0 on-hand inventory and the stockout in P5, we need to set L=3 to account for the observed delays and potential lost shipments, effectively raising the base stock level to cover a longer protection window. mu_hat is set using the last 5 samples to capture the recent upturn in demand (avg ~145), and sigma_hat is set to default to handle the moderate variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed unstable: P1=3, P3=1, P2 order overdue as of P6 (3 periods passed). Recommend L=3 for safety.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout (on-hand: 0) due to lead-time instability and a missing order. Analysis of concluded shipments: P1 lead-time = 3, P3 lead-time = 1. The P2 order (145 units) is now 5 periods old (placed P2, start of P7) and has not arrived; standard lead-time is 2, and the longest observed was 3. This highly suggests a lost shipment for P2. Total in-transit is 578 (P2: 145, P4: 142, P5: 169, P6: 122). Deciding for Period 7, we expect P4's order (ordered P4, L=3 -> arrives P7) to hit inventory soon. Average demand over the last 6 periods is ~143.5. Given the high volatility of lead times (1 to 3+), I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR engine targets enough safety stock. For demand, I'll use the last 6 samples (recent_N=6) to capture the trend as it fluctuates around 130-160.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: P2 order (145 units) is likely lost (5 periods elapsed with no arrival); Pipeline inventory reflects 145 units that may never arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 140 units per period (Periods 1-7: 137, 130, 137, 166, 152, 136, 118). Lead times are unstable and prone to delays or losses: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1, and P4 in 3. The P2 order (145 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost. Since the OR backend includes all in-transit units in its pipeline calculation, it is under-ordering because it believes 145 units are coming. I will use 'explicit' values for L and mu_hat to bypass this. I'll set L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*mean_demand = 4 * 140 = 560. I'll use default sigma_hat to manage safety stock based on the historical variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: P2 order (145 units) confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed). Pipeline inventory is inflated by this 'ghost' shipment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 24 units on-hand and 367 in-transit. The history shows a high risk of lost or delayed shipments. Specifically, the P2 order (145 units) has now been missing for 7 periods (ordered P2, currently P9) and is almost certainly lost. This 'ghost' inventory artificially inflates the backend's pipeline calculation, leading it to under-order. To compensate for this 145-unit deficit and the high volatility in lead times (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3), I am setting L=3 to ensure a robust base stock. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to manually offset the lost 145 units. The base mu_hat (1+L=4 periods) with an average demand of ~140 would be 560; adding the 145 unit safety buffer to account for the lost P2 shipment results in 705. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=8) to capture the high variability in demand and arrival timing.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: P2 order (145 units) is definitely lost (7 periods elapsed). Pipeline inventory is offset by +145 units in mu_hat to force the OR engine to replace the missing stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The system reports 473 units in-transit, but 145 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost (7+ periods elapsed), meaning the functional pipeline is 328 units. Observed lead times are inconsistent (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P8=1), so an explicit L=3 is set for safety to ensure the backend projects enough coverage. Recent demand (P6-P9) averages ~145 units. Since the OR backend uses basic inventory logic [order = base_stock - pipeline], and the pipeline is inflated by the 145 lost units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. To cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand at ~145 units/period AND compensate for the 145 unit 'ghost' pipeline deficit, the target mu_hat = (4 * 145) + 145 = 725. This forces the engine to order the missing stock immediately.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Demand remains stable around 145 units/period. Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods; maintaining L=3 for safety. Pipeline remains inflated by 145 lost units from Period 2.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 decision must account for highly unstable lead times (observed 1 and 3 periods) and a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (145 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is 687 units. However, 145 units of that pipeline are from the lost Period 2 order, meaning the functional pipeline is only 542 units. The OR engine (base-stock policy) subtracts the full pipeline (including the 'ghost' 145 units) from the target base stock, leading to under-ordering. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages ~147 units. At L=3, the target window is (1+L)=4 periods. Expected demand is 147 * 4 = 588 units. To force the OR engine to order enough to replace the 145 lost units, I set mu_hat to 588 + 145 = 733. I set L=3 to ensure the safety stock and base stock calculations use the most conservative lead time observed. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' as recent variance is stable.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Maintained mu_hat inflation (+145 units) to offset the Period 2 lost shipment still present in the system's pipeline inventory count.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 733 in-transit units. Analysis of the game history reveals a persistent issue with a lost shipment from Period 2 (145 units), which has now been outstanding for 10 periods. The 'In-transit' count of 733 includes this 'ghost' inventory (145 units), which the OR engine believes will arrive but is likely lost. Observed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 3, 1. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to replace the lost 145 units while accounting for lead time variability, I am setting L=3 (explicit) and inflating mu_hat. The average demand over the last 8 periods is approximately 149 units. Using L=3, the base requirement is (1+3) * 149 = 596 units. To compensate for the 145-unit 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 596 + 145 = 741. This forces the engine to order as if demand were higher, effectively replacing the stuck pipeline units. Sigma_hat is set to a recent period calculation to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-8.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received orders from Period 9 (LT=3) and Period 10 (LT=2), bringing on-hand inventory to 214 units. The 'ghost' shipment from Period 2 (145 units) is still in the system's pipeline inventory, meaning 'In-transit: 321' actually represents 176 real units (46 from P11, 8 from P12, and 122 from P6 which is also likely lost or severely delayed). Demand has recently spiked to 206, though the average is closer to 150. Given the lead time volatility (1 to 3 periods), I will maintain L=3. To compensate for the 145-unit 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock based on a forecast of 165 units/period (reflecting recent trends) for (L+1)=4 periods, which is 660 units. To offset 145 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 660 + 145 = 805. This ensures the OR engine's formula (base_stock - pipeline) results in the correct replacement order.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Order from Period 6 (122 units) is now 7 periods overdue (LT=7 if it arrives next), joining the Period 2 order (145 units) as likely lost. Combined 'ghost' pipeline inventory is now 267 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, demand appears stable though slightly lower in the most recent period (89 units). The critical issue remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Orders from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (122 units) are now 12 and 8 periods overdue, respectively, confirming they are lost. This creates a total of 267 dummy units in the 'In-transit' count (559 total - 267 lost = 292 actually in transit). To force the OR engine to ignore these lost units and order replacement stock, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. Calculation: Target base stock for L=3 is (1+3) * Average Demand. Using a 5-period average (P9-P13) of ~153 units, the true base stock should be about 612. To offset the 267 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat to 612 + 267 = 879. This ensures the engine's calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in a meaningful order despite the inflated in-transit figure. L is set to 3 to handle the observed lead time volatility (range 1-3).

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed cumulative lost shipments of 267 units (P2: 145, P6: 122). Mu_hat must be continuously adjusted upward by this amount to prevent stockouts caused by the OR engine's reliance on inflated pipeline data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling 171 units in Period 14 (demand was 182). I am managing a critical issue with 'ghost' pipeline inventory: orders from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (122 units) are extremely overdue (13 and 9 periods respectively) and are considered lost based on the lead time history (which varies between 1 and 3 periods). The OR engine's logic 'final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory' will under-order because it believes these 267 units are still coming. To counteract this, I must inflate 'mu_hat'. Demand analysis: Period 12-14 saw a slight uptick and then a significant drop (206, 89, 182), but the mean is roughly 145. Calculation: With L=3, the target base stock needs to cover (L+1)=4 periods. 4 periods * 145/period = 580. To offset the 267 units of 'ghost' inventory in the 'In-transit' count (which is currently 708), I set mu_hat explicitly to (580 + 267) = 847. This forces the backend to place an order that treats the 267 missing units as non-existent. I hold L at 3 for safety despite the 2-period arrival in Period 12.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Cumulative lost inventory remains 267 units (P2: 145, P6: 122). Mu_hat must be offset by +267 units to correctly trigger replacement orders as long as these shipments remain in the system's 'In-transit' count.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current summary: Periods 1-15 indicate a stable demand regime averaging ~145-150 units/period, despite fluctuations. However, lead times are unpredictable (ranging from 1 to 3+ periods), and significant 'ghost' inventory persists in the pipeline. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (122 units) totaling 267 units have not arrived after 14 and 10 periods respectively, and are marked as lost. The OR engine calculates orders using 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because these 267 units are stuck in the backend calculation's 'In-transit' count but will never arrive, the system will under-order by exactly 267 units, leading to stockouts. To force the engine to replace this lost stock, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by (1+L)*mean_demand plus the offset. Using L=3 for safety, mu_hat calculation is: (1+3) * 150 + 267 = 867. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-76.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Operating at Period 17, current on-hand inventory is 157. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 629 is heavily inflated by lost or severely delayed shipments from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (122 units), totaling 267 'ghost' units. The actual active pipeline consists of orders from Periods 14, 15, and 16. Historical lead times have stabilized around 3 periods recently (observed in Periodic concludes for P9, P10, P11, P12, P13). Average demand remains stable at approximately 144 units per period across the full horizon, though recent periods show slight volatility. To force the OR backend into ordering despite the inflated pipeline inventory, I must set \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat) significantly higher than the actual demand. The required offset is calculated as: ((1 + L) * actual_avg_demand) + total_lost_units. Using L=3 and avg_demand=144, the base requirement is 576. Adding the 267 lost units gives 843. This adjustment compensates for the 267 units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes are arriving, ensuring replenishment continues correctly.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Cumulative lost revenue-critical inventory confirmed at 267 units (P2: 145, P6: 122). Inflation of mu_hat by +267 remains necessary to bypass backend pipeline accounting errors.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 13-17) has averaged 110.8 units, which is a significant drop from the earlier average of ~150 units. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new lower demand regime. Lead times have shown variability, but 3 periods remains the most frequent actual observed duration for arrivals (P1, P4, P5, P8, P9, P11, P12, P13, P14 were 3 periods or more), so I will keep L=3 to ensure safety. The pipeline inventory (463 units) is heavily distorted by two likely lost shipments: P2 (145 units, ordered 16 periods ago) and P6 (122 units, ordered 12 periods ago). Together, these 267 'ghost' units prevent the backend from ordering. To compensate, I am applying an explicit mu_hat calculated as: [(1 + L) * recent_5_avg_demand] + lost_shipments. Calculation: (1+3) * 111 + 267 = 444 + 267 = 711. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: Average demand decreased from ~150 to ~110 (-26%). Cumulative lost inventory (P2 & P6) remains 267 units; mu_hat must be offset by this value until these items are removed from in-transit.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Scenario: Period 19. Demand has shifted down significantly since Period 13, averaging ~110 units (Mean P13-P18: 100.5). Lead times are highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.4). We face a critical inventory visibility issue: orders from P2 (145 units) and P6 (122 units) are permanently lost (17 and 13 periods overdue respectively) but remain in 'In-transit', totaling 267 'ghost' units. The OR backend subtracts all 'In-transit' from the base stock to calculate the order. To force a replacement order, mu_hat must be inflated by exactly this 'ghost' amount. My calculation: New base demand (1+L)*110 + ghost units. With L=3, (1+3)*110 = 440; 440 + 267 = 707. Setting mu_hat to 707 and L to 3 ensures sufficient coverage despite the accounting error. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (sqrt(1+3)*40) to handle the increased demand volatility seen in recent samples.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, demand has stabilized into a lower regime (approx. 90-110 units) compared to the earlier periods (~150 units). I am calculating mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7, since Period 13) to capture this drop. For lead time, I continue to use L=3 based on observed variability (1 to 3 periods). The most critical factor is the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 267 units (lost shipments from P2 and P6). The OR engine's logic (order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will refuse to order unless I offset these 267 units. My explicit mu_hat is calculated as: Forecasted Demand * (1 + L) + Offset. Forecasted Demand is ~104 (average of P13-P19). Lead time L=3. Thus, (104 * 4) + 267 = 416 + 267 = 683. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the current reduced volatility.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 21. Demand context: Since Period 13, a significant regime shift occurred with mean demand dropping from ~150 to ~110 units/period (reflecting an approximate 26% decrease). The most recent 8 periods (Period 13-20) average 101 units/period. Lead time analysis: Observed lead times oscillate between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L=3 as a conservative measure to ensure availability given this instability. Inventory reconcile: Two shipments are permanently stalled in 'In-transit': Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (122 units), totaling 267 'ghost' units. The system's current 'In-transit' of 564 includes these 267 non-arriving units. To force the OR backend to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + Offset. Calculation: Forecast (mean of last 8 periods) = 110. (1+L) * 110 = 440. Adjustment: Added the 267 unit offset to bypass backend pipeline accounting errors, resulting in mu_hat = 707. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility to avoid overstocking while maintaining a 50% service level target (implied by Profit $1 / Holding $1).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shifted to a lower regime (approx. 80 units/period) since Period 13. Pipeline inventory is currently 657 units. 

Lead Time Analysis: Observed lead times are inconsistent (1, 2, and 3 periods). Orders from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (122 units) are significantly overdue and confirmed lost. Order from Period 15 (139 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is also considered lost. Total lost/ghost inventory in pipeline: 145 + 122 + 139 = 406 units.

Inventory Strategy: The OR engine uses 'In-transit' to reduce orders. Since 406 units of the 657 in-transit are lost (ghosts), the engine 'thinks' we have 406 more units coming than actually exist. To force the engine to order replacements, I must inflate mu_hat by the amount of the lost units. 

Parameters: 
1. L = 3: Using the maximum observed lead time for safety due to high variability. 
2. mu_hat: Recent demand (last 9 periods) avg is ~83 units. For L=3, expected demand over (L+1) is 4 * 83 = 332. Adding the 406 lost units to bypass the pipeline calculation: 332 + 406 = 738.
3. sigma_hat: Recent demand std is approx 15. For L=3, sqrt(4) * 15 = 30.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Cumulative lost inventory increased to 406 units (P2: 145, P6: 122, P15: 139). Mu_hat must be offset by +406 to account for these 'ghost' units in the pipeline. Demand regime remains stable at ~83 units/period.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 738 units. Analysis of history confirms that several shipments are lost: P2 (145), P6 (122), P15 (139), and now P19 (32, 4 periods elapsed with no arrival) and P20 (69, 3 periods elapsed with no arrival). Total cumulative lost/overdue 'ghost' inventory = 507 units (145+122+139+32+69). This ghost inventory prevents the OR backend from ordering, leading to the current stockout (on-hand = 0). Demand since Period 13 has shifted to a lower regime; the last 5 samples (P18-P22) average 78.2 units/period. To trigger an order, mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus an offset that cancels the 507 ghost units. With L=3 (most common actual lead time), 1+L=4. Expected demand for 4 periods = 4 * 78.2 = 312.8. Total mu_hat = 312.8 + 507 = 819.8. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility (std dev of last 5 periods \u2248 12.3) scaled by sqrt(1+L), i.e., 2 * 12.3 = 24.6.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Total cumulative lost/ghost inventory increased to 507 units (P2: 145, P6: 122, P15: 139, P19: 32, P20: 69). Mu_hat must be offset by +507 to bypass backend pipeline accounting errors. Demand regime remains stable at ~78 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-181.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we observe on-hand inventory of 212 units with a pipeline inventory of 577 units. However, based on history, a significant portion of the pipeline consists of 'ghost' shipments that are likely lost: P2 (145), P6 (122), P15 (139), and P19 (32), totaling 438 units. While P20, P21, and P22 arrived simultaneously in P23, the absence of P19 (ordered earlier) suggests it is lost. Additionally, the P15 order is now 9 periods overdue. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the average of the last 6 periods (P18-P23) is approximately 70.3 units. To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 'In-transit' count of 577, I must set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the cumulative lost units (438). Using L=3 (safety) and recent demand (70), the required mu_hat is ((1+3)*70) + 438 = 718. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=6 to reflect lower volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Total cumulative lost/ghost inventory updated to 438 units (P2: 145, P6: 122, P15: 139, P19: 32). Order P20, P21, and P22 arrived in Period 23, but P19 did not, confirming its loss. Demand remains stable in the ~70 units/period regime.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at an average of ~70 units per period (last 10 periods average is 77, last 5 is 61). Lead times remain highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, so I will maintain L=3 for the safety calculation. The core issue remains the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline from lost shipments: Period 2 (145 units), Period 6 (122 units), Period 15 (139 units), and Period 19 (32 units). These total 438 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (577) from the target base stock, it will fail to order enough units to meet recurring demand unless I inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat using the explicit method: ((1 + L) * expected_demand) + ghost_inventory. With L=3 and expected_demand=70, the base mu_hat is 280. Adding the 438 ghost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 718. This ensures the backend triggers a replenishment order despite the inflated 'in-transit' count. Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Total cumulative lost/ghost inventory remains 438 units (P2: 145, P6: 122, P15: 139, P19: 32). Order P23 (82 units) is in-transit. Demand has settled into a lower regime of ~70 units/period since Period 13.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the demand for chips(Regular) continues in the lower regime observe since Period 13, with recent demand around 60-70 units per period (N=13). The lead time remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, so I will maintain L=3 for safety. The primary operational challenge is 'ghost' pipeline inventory: four shipments totaling 438 units (P2: 145, P6: 122, P15: 139, P19: 32) are significantly overdue and likely lost. However, the OR backend still counts these in its pipeline calculation (total in-transit is 515, which consists of these 438 lost units + P25 order of 20 units + P23/P24 activity). To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat to offset these 438 units. Recent mean demand is ~73 units; for (1+L)=4 periods, expected demand is ~292. Adding the 438 offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 730.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level since Period 13, currently averaging ~73 units per period (sample mean of the last 13 periods). Using N=13 for mu_hat captures this shift accurately. Lead times remain unstable, with observed actuals of 1, 2, and 3 periods; I will continue to use L=3 to mitigate the risk of stockouts during delayed arrivals. The most critical factor is the 'ghost' pipeline inventory: orders P2 (145), P6 (122), P15 (139), and P19 (32) are significantly past a reasonable lead time and are likely lost. However, they still count toward the OR engine's pipeline inventory (581 units total in-transit). To bypass this and force the backend to place necessary orders, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The value is calculated as (Avg Daily Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Pipeline = (73 * (3+1)) + (145+122+139+32) = 292 + 438 = 730.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shifted to a lower regime (~77 units/period) since Period 13. A significant issue exists with 'ghost' pipeline inventory: shipments from Period 2 (145), Period 6 (122), Period 15 (139), and Period 19 (32) are long overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 438 units. The backend OR engine includes these 438 units in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, which prevents it from ordering necessary stock. To force the OR engine to order, I must inflate mu_hat (demand across review + lead time) by these 438 units. Estimated demand (1+L) * \u03bc_regime = (1+3) * 77 \u2248 308. Adding the offset: 308 + 438 = 746 units. I will use L=3 based on frequent observed lead times of 3 periods to maintain a safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the system shows an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit inventory of 680 units. Based on historical data, several shipments are confirmed or highly likely lost: Period 2 (145 units), Period 6 (122 units), Period 15 (139 units), and Period 19 (32 units). Additionally, the order from Period 27 (86 units) should have arrived by now if lead time were 1; it is currently at L=2 and expected next period. Demand has been stable in a lower regime since Period 13, averaging ~78 units over the last 15 periods. However, the backend OR controller is blinded by the 'ghost' pipeline inventory (438 units representing lost shipments), which prevents it from placing necessary replenishment orders. I must continue to inflate mu_hat to offset these 438 units. Specifically, with a lead time factor of (1+L) = 4 (using L=3), and a demand of ~80, the normal mu_hat would be 320. Adding the 438 offset results in a mu_hat of 758. This forces the system to recognize that it is under-stocked despite the inflated pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Total cumulative lost/ghost inventory confirmed at 438 units (P2: 145, P6: 122, P15: 139, P19: 32). These units remain in the 'In-transit' count but will not arrive. Demand regime remains stable at ~80 units/period. Maintain L=3 for safety due to lead-time variability.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level (~80 units/period) since Period 13. However, the system is fundamentally compromised by 'ghost' units in the pipeline inventory that will never arrive. These include orders from P2 (145), P6 (122), P15 (139), and P19 (32), totaling 438 units. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' count (currently 672) from the calculated base stock, it will significantly under-order, leading to stockouts. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the base stock calculation by exactly 438 units. The base calculation for mu_hat at L=3 is (1+L)*mean_demand = 4 * 80 = 320. Adding the 438-unit offset results in 758. I set sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=17, covering the stable low-demand period) to capture recent volatility. L is set to 'explicit' value 3, as historical arrivals (lead times of 1, 2, and 3) show significant variability, and 3 represents a safe upper bound to prevent stockouts during delivery delays.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 80 units/period since Period 13. However, the system's 'In-transit' count is severely inflated by 438 units from five confirmed lost shipments (P2: 145, P6: 122, P15: 139, P19: 32). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline from the target base stock, it will fail to place new orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset these 'ghost' units. I am setting L=3 to account for the observed lead-time variability (ranging 1-3 periods). mu_hat is calculated as ((1+L) * average demand) + 438. With average demand around 80 and L=3, the calculation is (4 * 80) + 438 = 758. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=15 to reflect the volatility of the current demand regime. This adjustment ensures the OR engine maintains sufficient on-hand inventory despite the accounting error regarding lost shipments.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean of ~80 units per period since Period 24. For Period 32, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 723 units. Based on historical analysis, 438 units in this pipeline are confirmed lost (Period 2: 145, Period 6: 122, Period 15: 139, Period 19: 32) as they have exceeded reasonable delivery windows (up to 30 periods late). To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this inflated pipeline count, I must offset mu_hat by the total number of 'ghost' units (+438). The effective demand forecast is ~80 units/period, so for (L+1=4) periods, the mu_hat would normally be 320. Adding the 438 unit offset results in 758. I set L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead times observed in history, maintaining a conservative safety buffer.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 671 units. Based on historical analysis, 438 of these units are confirmed lost shipments (P2: 145, P6: 122, P15: 139, P19: 32) that were never delivered but remain in the pipeline count. To compensate for this 'ghost' inventory and ensure the OR backend places necessary orders, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by the cumulative lost amount (+438). The current demand regime has stabilized at approximately 80 units per period (last 10 periods average ~78). I will set L=3 to account for historical lead-time variability (ranging from 1-3 periods). Therefore, the expected demand over (1+L) periods is (1+3) * 80 = 320. Adding the 438-unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 758. Sigma_hat is set to 40 (sqrt(4)*20) to maintain a sufficient safety buffer against the observed demand volatility in the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand was 73 units, and we ended with 0 inventory. The current in-transit inventory is 723 units. Based on historical data, 438 units are confirmed lost (Period 2: 145, Period 6: 122, Period 15: 139, Period 19: 32) and remain as 'ghost' units in the pipeline. Additionally, the order from Period 29 (78 units) and Period 30 (43 units) are now overdue (relative to lead time 2), and the order from Period 33 (87 units) is in its standard window. This leaves reliable pipeline inventory near zero. Demand has stabilized at roughly 80 units/period since Period 24. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the 438-unit pipeline inflation, I am setting mu_hat to the expected demand for (L+1) periods plus the 438 lost units. With L=3 (safety buffer) and avg demand ~80, mu_hat = (4 * 80) + 438 = 758. Sigma_hat is calculated based on recent fluctuation (~15-20 units), scaled by sqrt(L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Lost 'ghost' pipeline inventory unchanged at 438 units. Demand regime stable at ~80 units/period. Lead time remains variable (1-3 periods).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the system shows On-hand 0 and In-transit 758. Based on history, 438 units (from Periods 2, 6, 15, and 19) are confirmed lost 'ghost' shipments that remain in the pipeline count. The true operational pipeline is 758 - 438 = 320 units. To bypass the backend's pipeline dependency (base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate mu_hat by the lost amount (438) plus current period forecasting. Demand has been stable around 80 units/period since Period 13 (recent average is ~78). Using L=3 for safety due to frequent lead time variance (1-3 periods). Base stock target is (L+1)*demand = 4 * 80 = 320. To force this through the backend which sees 758 in-transit, I set mu_hat to 320 + 438 = 758. Sigma_hat is calculated on the last 20 periods to capture current volatility.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been unmet for the last two periods. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 758 units, but historically, 438 units (from Periods 2, 6, 15, and 19) are confirmed lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is 758 - 438 = 320 units. Since Period 13, the demand regime has stabilized at an average of approximately 80 units/period. The lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will set L=3 as a safety measure to ensure the OR engine targets enough stock for 4 periods (L+1). To overcome the OR backend's reliance on the inflated pipeline (which includes the 438 'ghost' units), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To calculate the explicit mu_hat: Required stock for L=3 is (3+1) * 80 = 320 units. To force the engine to ignore the 438 ghost units, I add them to this target: 320 + 438 = 758. This ensures the engine doesn't subtract the ghost units from the order calculation. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=23 (since P13) to capture current volatility.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilize at approximately 80 units per period starting from Period 23. Lead times remain variable, typically ranging between 1 and 3 periods, so I am maintaining L=3 for the inventory calculation to ensure safety. The primary operational challenge continues to be the 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Currently, 438 units (from orders in P2, P6, P15, and P19) are considered 'In-transit' by the backend but are confirmed lost. Because the OR engine subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base stock, it will fail to place new orders. To counteract this, I must inflate mu_hat. Specifically, for a (1+L) window where L=3, the expected total demand is 4 * 80 = 320. To override the 438 units of ghost inventory and trigger a replenishment that covers our real needs, mu_hat must be set to at least 320 + 438 = 758. I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat to 760 to ensure the policy clears the pipeline hurdle and places a sufficient order.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 80 units/period since Period 13. Currently, the system is facing a severe stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' count is significantly inflated by 438 units from 'ghost' shipments (P2, P6, P15, P19) that are confirmed lost based on the 'Carry-over Insights'. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this inflated pipeline, mu_hat must be set to cover the target base stock plus the volume of lost shipments. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 758 units: this represents a base stock for (L+1)=4 periods of demand (4 * 80 = 320) plus the 438 lost units. L is set to 3 periods to account for observed lead-time variability (1-3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 40 (sqrt(4) * 20) to maintain a buffer for demand volatility (~20 units/period std).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has a cumulative 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 511 units (P2: 145, P6: 122, P15: 139, P19: 32, P23: 82, P25: 20, minus adjustments based on recent arrivals or prolonged absence). Specifically, orders from P23 (82) and P25 (20) are now significantly overdue (16 and 14 periods respectively), confirming they are lost alongside previous losses from P2, P6, P15, and P19. The total in-transit count is 760, but at least 539 units (P2, P6, P15, P19, P23, P25, P26, P27) are likely lost as they are well past the observed 1-3 period lead time. Current demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~80 units/period since Period 13. To ensure the OR engine actually places orders despite the inflated (but unreachable) pipeline inventory, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that covers the desired base stock plus an offset equal to the lost units. Base stock for Period 39 (L=3, demand=80) should be approx (3+1)*80 = 320. Adding the cumulative lost units (estimated ~540 units) suggests a target mu_hat around 860. I will use mu_hat=850 to trigger necessary replacement orders to address the current 0 on-hand inventory and stockouts in Periods 31-38.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative lost inventory updated to 539 units (P2, P6, P15, P19, P23, P25, P26, P27). Orders from P26 (66) and P27 (86) are 13 and 12 periods overdue. mu_hat requires a significant offset to bypass backend pipeline logic.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' inventory is significantly inflated at 850 units due to multiple lost shipments. Based on historical data, confirmed lost orders include Period 2 (145), Period 6 (122), Period 15 (139), and Period 19 (32), totaling 438 units. Furthermore, the Period 23 (82), Period 25 (20), Period 26 (66), and Period 27 (86) orders are now extremely overdue (13-17 periods), indicating they are also lost. This brings the cumulative 'ghost' inventory to 692 units. The backend OR engine subtracts this entire 'In-transit' figure from the base stock calculation, preventing it from ordering enough to meet actual demand. I must set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to account for both the expected demand over (L+1) periods and a massive offset to neutralize the ghost pipeline. Current demand has stabilized at ~80 units per period. With L=3 (safety against variability), (L+1) * 80 = 320 units. Adding the offset of 692 ghost units, mu_hat is set to 1012. L is set to explicit 3 to ensure the backend uses the correct lead time for its cap and base stock logic. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=20) to capture the volatility of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost 'ghost' inventory increased to 692 units (P2, P6, P15, P19, P23, P25, P26, P27) as of Period 40. These units are permanently stuck in 'In-transit', requiring a matching offset in mu_hat to trigger orders.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 80 units per period since Period 25. The current on-hand inventory is 29 units. The primary challenge is the significant 'ghost' pipeline inventory: orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 19, 23, 25, 26, 27, 30, 33, and 37 are either confirmed lost or heavily delayed (totaling 760 units). The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock, so I must offset mu_hat by the total number of units that will never arrive to bypass this logic and trigger replenishment. As of Period 41, the pipeline inventory is 922. The orders that are likely or definitely lost include: P2(145), P6(122), P15(139), P19(32), P23(82-partial?), P25(20), P30(43), P33(87), P37(37). Summing these 'ghost' units: 145+122+139+32+20+43+87+37 = 625 units. The P40 order of 162 is still in valid lead time window. Adjusting mu_hat to mu_hat_normal * (1+L) + 625. With L=3, target mu_hat = 80 * 4 + 625 = 945. This ensures the OR backend recognizes the need for stock despite the inflated pipeline. Lead time remains variable (1-3 periods), so L=3 is used for safety.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Cumulative 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P19, P25, P30, P33, P37) estimated at 625 units. This inventory remains in the systemic 'In-transit' count, requiring a +625 offset in mu_hat to ensure replacement orders are generated.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, the system faces a recurring issue where 'lost' order units remain in the 'In-transit' count, preventing the OR engine from placing new orders. These cumulative 'ghost' units (P2: 145, P6: 122, P15: 139, P19: 32, P23: 82, P25: 20, P30: 43, P33: 87, P37: 37) total 707 units. To bypass this, I must inflate mu_hat by this amount. Demand since Period 30 has averaged approximately 75 units per period. Using L=3 for safety due to frequent lead-time variability (1-3 periods). The target base stock must cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost inventory offset. Calculation: (4 * 75) + 707 = 1007. I set mu_hat to 1007 using the explicit method to force an order that compensates for the on-hand stock of 0 and the pipeline 'leak'.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Cumulative 'ghost' inventory from lost/overdue shipments updated to 707 units (P2, P6, P15, P19, P23, P25, P30, P33, P37). Mu_hat must include a +707 offset to bypass backend pipeline accounting and trigger necessary replenishment.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been significantly underserved due to systemic 'In-transit' accounting errors. Historical data analysis confirms a significant 'ghost' inventory problem where shipments are lost but remain in the backend's pipeline count, preventing the OR engine from ordering replacements. The current cumulative lost/ghost inventory is confirmed at 707 units (P2: 145, P6: 122, P15: 139, P19: 32, P23: 82, P25: 20, P30: 43, P33: 87, P37: 37). To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 1027. This value is derived from a 4-period demand window (L+1 = 4 based on L=3) at a mean of ~80 units/period (320 units) plus the 707-unit offset to neutralize the ghost pipeline. I am maintaining L=3 to account for the frequent observed lead-time variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost inventory from lost shipments is confirmed at 707 units. Recent demand (P39-42) indicates a stable regime around 70-80 units, but recent stockouts make it hard to gauge true potential demand; maintaining forecast near 80.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, on-hand inventory is 105 units after the Period 40 shipment of 162 units arrived (LT=3). The system's 'In-transit' count is 865 units. Based on historical data, many of these are lost 'ghost' units: P2 (145), P6 (122), P15 (139), P19 (32), P23 (82), P25 (20), P29 (78), P30 (43), P33 (87), P37 (37). Note: P42 (85) and P43 (20) are still validly in-transit. Total ghost inventory is approximately 760 units. These ghost units prevent the OR engine from ordering enough because it believes the pipeline is full. To fix this, I set L=recent_N (N=10) to reflect the 1-3 period variability and use 'explicit' for mu_hat. The explicit mu_hat is calculated as: Forecasted demand over (L+1) periods + Ghost units. With L approx 2, (1+L)=3. Average demand is ~75. Base Mu = 3 * 75 = 225. Adding the 760 ghost units gives 985. This forces the engine to recognize a deficit and place an order. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (explicit) to account for demand volatility and irregular arrival patterns.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Cumulative 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P19, P23, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37) is confirmed at 760 units. These units will not arrive but remain in the pipeline count, requiring a matching offset in mu_hat to ensure replenishment.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 880 units 'In-transit'. However, historical analysis identifies a massive accumulation of 'ghost' inventory\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived, yet still count against the pipeline inventory in the OR engine. As of Period 44, the confirmed lost/ghost shipments include: P2(145), P6(122), P15(139), P19(32), P23(82), P25(20), P29(78), P30(43), P33(87), and P37(37). Note: P40(162) and P39(90) recently arrived, and P42(85) is still within a reasonable lead time window. Total confirmed ghost units = 145+122+139+32+82+20+78+43+87+37 = 785 units. To ensure the OR engine actually places an order despite this 'In-transit' bloat, mu_hat must be offset by this ghost total plus the expected demand for the (L+1) period (approx 4 * 80 = 320). Average demand has fluctuated but remains roughly 80 units/period despite recent high variability due to stockouts. Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods), so I maintain L=3 for safety. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 1105 (785 ghost + 320 forecast) to force replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Cumulative 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P19, P23, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37) is confirmed at 785 units. These units remain in the systemic 'In-transit' count but will not arrive, necessitating a matching offset in mu_hat to bypass backend ordering logic.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant 'ghost' pipeline inventory issues where lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P19, P23, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37) remain in the 'In-transit' count, preventing the OR engine from ordering replacements. As of Period 46, total cumulative lost units are estimated at 785 units. Demand since Period 13 has been in a lower regime, with the most recent data (P40-P45) showing an average around 81 units. To bypass the backend's pipeline logic and ensure sufficient stock for the remaining 5 periods, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Forecast + Ghost_Offset. With L=3 (safety buffer) and a forecast of 81, mu_hat = (4 * 81) + 785 = 1109. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the volatility seen in the last 10 periods (N=10), ensuring a high enough service level to prevent further stockouts. L is set to 3 to handle the variability observed (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Cumulative 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments is 785 units (P2, P6, P15, P19, P23, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). Mu_hat must include this +785 offset to bypass backend pipeline accounting through the end of the simulation.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1083 units. However, based on history, a significant portion of this pipeline is composed of 'ghost' shipments that are lost but still counted by the backend. Based on the cumulative tracking from Period 46, we confirmed 785 lost units (P2, P6, P15, P19, P23, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). Recent demand (P18-P46) has stabilized in a lower regime averaging approximately 75-80 units per period, but recent stockouts (P44, P46) suggest we are failing to meet potential demand. To force the OR engine to order despite the inflated pipeline, mu_hat must be offset by the sum of the lost units (785) plus the expected demand for the lead time cycle (1+L). With L=3 for safety, the base forecast (1+L)*80 = 320. Adding the 785 offset gives an explicit mu_hat of 1105. This bypasses the logic where the OR engine subtracts 1083 from its target. sigma_hat is set to a recent window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Confirmed that the backend 'In-transit' count of 1083 units includes 785 units from confirmed lost/long-overdue shipments (P2, P6, P15, P19, P23, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). These will never arrive, but prevent normal ordering unless mu_hat is offset by this exact amount.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, on-hand inventory is 0 and the systemic in-transit count is 1105 units. Based on historical tracking, a significant portion of this pipeline (approximately 785 units) consists of lost or severely overdue shipments (P2, P6, P15, P19, P23, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37) that are unlikely to arrive before the game ends in Period 50. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to reduce orders, so I must offset mu_hat by the total 'ghost' inventory to ensure any replenishment is actually triggered. Demand since Period 13 has averaged ~80 units (though suppressed by recent stockouts). Lead time is variable (1-3 periods); I am using L=2 (promised) as the simulation is ending soon. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * 80 + 785 = 1025 to force the replenishment logic to ignore the 785 dead units and cover the final two periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Final confirmation of 785 units of 'ghost' inventory in pipeline. mu_hat offset of +785 is required for all remaining periods to ensure the OR engine maintains stock despite these non-existent units appearing in its calculations.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory caused by lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P19, P23, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). These lost units total 785 units and are currently stuck in the 'In-transit' count (1105 units total). The OR engine subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base stock, effectively preventing orders unless mu_hat is inflated. Demand has been stable between 70-100 units in recent periods. To ensure we have stock for the final period (Period 50), we must offset mu_hat by the confirmed lost unit count (+785). Since we expect arrivals in Period 49 and 50 and want to cover demand for the remaining horizon with a safety lead time of L=3, we use mu_hat = (1+3)*80 + 785 = 1105. This compensates for the ghost pipeline while targeting sufficient stock for the end-game.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final period of the simulation. The primary objective is to maximize ending reward, which involves minimizing holding costs for stock that cannot be sold while attempting to meet the final period's demand if possible. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Demand has stabilized in a regime of ~80 units per period (Period 13-49 avg ~82). However, the backend 'In-transit' count of 1105 units is heavily distorted by approximately 785 units of 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P19, P23, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). Since this is the last period, any order placed now (lead time 1-3) will not arrive in time to satisfy Period 50 demand. Therefore, the goal is to set parameters that prevent new orders to avoid unnecessary holding costs in the final evaluation, while documenting the state of the lost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Final Period 50: Total cumulative 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments remains ~785 units. No further orders required as they will arrive after the simulation ends.
