The order placed in Period 1 (212 units) is expected to arrive in Period 3 (Period 1 + 2). The OR baseline recommends 204 units based on historical demand (~120-140 units/period). Given we have 0 on-hand and only 212 in-transit for a 3-period window (P2, P3, P4), we need to ensure we have enough stock. 212 units only covers about 1.5 periods of demand.

OR Analysis: The OR recommendation is 10 units. This low number is due to the base-stock calculation (assuming L=2, it wants to cover approx 144 * 3 = 432 units) and the fact that 416 units are already in the pipeline. 5.

With an effective pipeline of 484 units and an average lead time of 2-3 periods, the current pipeline covers roughly 3.2 periods of demand (484 / 150). \n4. **OR Baseline**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees the gross In-transit (828) as sufficient to cover the base stock level.

This surge in inventory is due to the simultaneous arrival of orders from P14 (lead time 3) and P16 (lead time 1), totaling 300 units, combined with two consecutive periods of low demand (81 and 80 units). The historical demand average has recently softened from ~150 units to a much lower level over the last few periods, though the long-term average remains around 140-150. Pipeline Analysis: The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 500 units. Accounting for confirmed lost shipments from P2 (204 units) and P6 (140 units), the true pipeline is 156 units (from P15, which is currently overdue at L=3). Even with the P15 order, our total inventory position (360 on-hand + 156 reliable in-transit) is 516 units. Given the most recent demand trend (~80-100 units), we have over 5 periods of supply on hand.

Demand Analysis: A sustained demand regime shift has been observed since Period 16. The average demand has dropped from ~150 to ~83 units per period. Recent samples (P20: 69, P21: 64) suggest demand may even be trending slightly lower. 3. Strategy: On-hand inventory is 46 units. The effective pipeline is 156 units (P15 order).

Given that the lead time can be up to 3 periods, ordering now is necessary to prevent a stockout in Period 24/25. 4.

If we exclude the lost P2/P6 units, the stock-on-hand + pipeline is only 276 (or 120 if P15 is lost).

Demand Analysis: Demand has shifted from ~150 to a lower regime. The average of the last 8 periods (P19-P26) is approximately 70.6 units/period. The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees the inflated 740 units in transit and assumes we are overstocked.\n4. Strategy: Using the reliable pipeline (240 units) and a safety stock level for roughly 3 periods of demand (avg ~75), we need 225-250 units in the pipeline. Total Reliable Pipeline (240) + current decision should cover demand for P27, P28, and P29. Since 240 is already in transit for those periods, and demand is around 75/period, we are currently at a reasonable level.

Thus, the reliable pipeline only includes the orders from P44 (100 units) and P45 (80 units), totaling 180 units. My current on-hand inventory is 81 units. Total reliable inventory (On-hand 81 + Reliable In-transit 180) is 261 units.

At an average demand of 85 units, I need ~340 units of reliable stock. The current 261 units leave a deficit of approximately 79 units.

To maintain a safety buffer and ensure availability against a mean demand of 80, I need about 240 units (L+1 periods) to be reliable. With 4 on-hand and 260 reliable units in transit, I am technically covered, but given the 50% historical loss rate of orders, I will place a maintenance order of 80 units to replace current consumption and mitigate against the risk of the P44/P45/P46 orders also failing to arrive.",
