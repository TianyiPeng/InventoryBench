Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a historical mean demand of approximately 92.2 units (P1-P5). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since No observations of actual lead time or on-hand inventory are available yet, I will use the default promised lead time (L=2). To estimate demand, I will use the mean of the 5 historical samples provided (109, 68, 99, 80, 105). Mean = 92.2. Standard deviation of these samples is approx. 17.5. The base stock level covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Thus, mu_hat should be around 3 * 92.2 = 276.6, and sigma_hat should be around sqrt(3) * 17.5 = 30.3. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both to capture this recent historical performance.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 122 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 2. As expected (Lead Time = 2), these units did not arrive in Period 1 (confirmed by 'arrived=0' in Period 1 conclude). Demand in Period 1 was 75, which resulted in 75 lost sales because on-hand inventory was 0. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the available samples (including the live Period 1) shows a mean of 75-109 range. Specifically, the provided samples are [109, 68, 99, 80, 105] (avg ~92) and the Period 1 live demand was 75. Averaging these 6 points gives ~89. Since the lead time L=2, mu_hat needs to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand. I will use the default method for now as there is no evidence yet that the lead time or demand regime has significantly shifted from the historical average, though I'll monitor for the Period 1 order to arrive in Period 3.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Evaluation of the history shows that orders placed in Period 1 (122 units) and Period 2 (118 units) are still in transit (total 240 units). Given a promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. As of the start of Period 3, on-hand inventory remains 0, and we have experienced missed sales due to the lead time delay. Demand for the first five historical samples (prior to game start) averaged 92.2, while the first two game periods saw 75 and 129. The mean across all 7 available data points is 95. Therefore, I will set mu_hat based on the mean of all samples (95) multiplied by (1+L). With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 95 = 285. This ensures the pipeline inventory (240 in-transit) is compared against a base stock targeting ~285 units, likely triggering a small supplemental order to cover the recent demand spike and standard safety stock requirements.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The SKU is 'chips(Regular)'. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Reviewing history: P1 order (122 units) has not arrived yet. Based on the lead time definition, an order placed in P1 with L=2 should arrive during P3's arrival phase and be visible in the P3 conclude message (at the start of P4). However, the P3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates either a lead time delay (actual L > 2) or a lost shipment. Given that no units have arrived yet, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have missed demand for three consecutive periods. I will maintain the lead time at 'default' (2) for now to see if the P1 order arrives in the next conclude message (P4 conclude), but I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the historical volatility. The existing in-transit pipeline (122+118+77=317) is significant, but since on-hand is zero, we must ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high historical demand (Mean ~92, Std ~22).

Daily Reward (R_t): $546.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), and Period 3's order also arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). Period 2's order (118 units) is currently overdue as it has been 3 periods since ordering and has not arrived. The promised lead time is 2, but the actual lead times observed are 3 and 1, averaging 2. Current in-transit is 122 units (118 from P2 and 4 from P4). Demand history shows significant variance: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105 (note: 'conclude' messages reflect realized sales/inventory logic, while the provided sample data lists exact demand). The mean demand over 5 periods is 92.2 and the standard deviation is 17.5. Since the lead time appears volatile (1 to 3+ periods) and a shipment is missing, I will use 'calculate' for lead time to average available data. For demand, I will use 'default' (all samples) to establish a stable baseline while allowing the OR engine to use the q-ratio (4/5 = 0.8) to determine the service level.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 109, 68, 99, 80, 105 (mean=92.2). However, game history shows actually realized demand in 'conclude' messages was: P1=75, P2=129, P3=93, P4=149, P5=140 (mean=117.2). There is significant variability. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times vary: P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), and P3 arrived in P4 (L=1). The P2 order (118 units) is currently overdue as of P5 conclude. Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 266 (composed of P2=118 and P5=144). I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed performance, and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (all available history) to capture the higher realized demand mean since the initial seeds.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 436 units in transit. Historical demand is quite volatile (samples: 75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99). The mean demand over 6 periods is approximately 114 units. Regarding lead time: the promised lead time is 2. However, P1's order arrived in P4 (LT=3) and P3's order arrived in P4 (LT=1), while P2's order (118 units) is currently overdue (it should have arrived by P4 or P5 at the latest). This suggests lead time variability and potential shipment loss or significant delay. Given the current 0 on-hand status and the stockouts in P5 and P6, we need to ensure the pipeline is sufficient. mu_hat should reflect the expected demand over (L+1) periods. Using L=2 (promised) as a baseline, (1+L)=3 periods of demand at a mean of ~114 is ~342. Since we have 436 in transit, the OR backend's base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) might not order much unless we signal higher volatility or a slightly higher mean to account for the stockouts and potential lost shipments. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) to capture the higher demand seen in P4-P5 while smoothing the P6 dip, and 'calculate' for L to let the backend use the average observed lead time (Avg of 3 and 1 is 2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a significant stockout situation with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, demand over the first 7 periods has averaged approx 117 units. Looking at the lead-time history: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods; Period 3 arrived in 1 period; Period 4 arrived in 3 periods. Period 2 (118 units) is currently 5 periods overdue, suggesting it may be lost. Period 5 (144 units), Period 6 (170 units), and Period 7 (97 units) are in-transit. The arithmetic average of observed lead times is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. However, given the variability (1 to 3+), using the promised lead time of 2 (default) is insufficient to buffer against the delays seen. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the actual average observed lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, demand has been relatively stable across the 7 observed periods (75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99, 134), so I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the most relevant demand mean and variance for the planning horizon.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed (range 1-3 periods). Period 2 shipment (118 units) likely lost as it is 5 periods past order date.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe significant lead time variability. Arrivals recorded so far show lead times of 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 periods. The mean observed lead time is 2.2 periods. Critically, the order from Period 2 (118 units) has not arrived after 7 periods and is now considered lost. Current on-hand inventory is 132 units with 288 units in-transit (from Periods 6 and 8). Average demand over the first 8 periods is approximately 111 units/period. Given the lead time volatility and the loss of a significant transit shipment, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time (2.2) rather than the promised 2. For demand, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the trend while smoothing out recent fluctuations. For sigma, I will use the recent N=5 to account for the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 2 order (118 units) confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Average actual lead time is 2.2 periods vs promised 2.0.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the supply chain for Regular Chips continues to show high lead time variability (range 1-3 periods). The Period 2 order of 118 units is confirmed lost (8 periods elapsed). Current on-hand inventory is 38 units with 409 units in transit (from Periods 6, 9, and 10). Observed demand across 9 periods has been relatively stable with a mean of ~114 per period. Given the lost shipment and lead time variability, I am setting L to 2.2 explicitly (based on Carry-over Insights) to account for the actual average delay. Demand (mu_hat) is set to (1+L) * mean of last 5 samples (~115) to track the recent demand stability. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 5 samples to capture the current volatility.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 with 0 units on-hand and 409 units in-transit. Historical demand over the last 10 periods (75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99, 134, 109, 94, 86) shows a mean of approximately 111. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Average: 2.2). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (118 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is definitely lost, and we have significant in-transit quantities from Periods 6 (170 units) and 9 (121 units) that have not arrived yet. Since the promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show a mean closer to 2.2-2.5 and higher variability, I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time to capture the current state. setting L to calculate uses all data, which is appropriate for the limited sample size.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Period 2 order (118 units) remains lost after 8 periods. Pipeline inventory currently includes orders from P6 (170 units, 4 periods elapsed) and P9 (121 units, 1 period elapsed). Performance is currently hampered by stockouts due to lead time variability and order loss.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' of 487 units includes: Period 2 (118 units, 10 periods elapsed - confirmed lost), Period 6 (170 units, 6 periods elapsed - likely lost or severely delayed), Period 9 (121 units, 3 periods elapsed - slightly beyond promised lead time), Period 11 (78 units, 1 period elapsed). Total likely lost/dead inventory = 118 + 170 = 288 units. This 'ghost' inventory prevents the OR backend from ordering because it believes pipeline_inventory is high. To resume ordering and recover the service level, I am setting L to 4 (explicitly accounting for recent lead time variability and transit delays) and using the 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the required base_stock for (L+1)=5 periods. Average demand is approx 107. Holding cost is high ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), so q = 0.8. Estimated demand for 5 periods is 535. To force the backend to place an order despite the 487 'in-transit' units, I set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order (mu_hat = 720, representing 5 periods of demand + a buffer for lost stock reconciliation).

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Period 6 order (170 units) likely lost or severely delayed (6 periods elapsed). Ghost pipeline inventory (P2 & P6 orders = 288 units) is causing chronic stockouts by inflating backend inventory math. Lead time average observed remains high at 2.4.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are consistently suffering from stockouts due to 'ghost' pipeline inventory\u2014orders that are almost certainly lost but still count towards the backend's inventory math. Evidence: Period 2 order (118 units, 11 periods elapsed) and Period 6 order (170 units, 7 periods elapsed) have not arrived, while subsequent orders from Period 7 and Period 9 have. This total of 288 'ghost' units prevents the OR engine from ordering enough. To compensate, I will use 'explicit' values. Demand (mu_hat) is stable around 100/period; for L=3, the target base stock is (1+3)*100 = 400. However, the backend sees 589 in transit (including 288 lost) and 28 on hand (Total=617), which is > 400, resulting in zero orders. To force an order that covers real demand, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 288-unit deficit. Calculation: Target Base Stock (400) + Lost Orders (288) = 688. I will set mu_hat to 688 and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure a robust safety stock. L is set to 'explicit' 3 based on the most frequent actual lead time observed (Periods 1, 4, 5, 9 all had lead_time=3).

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Confirmed two distinct lost shipments: Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (170 units). These 288 units are 'ghost' inventory. Total pipeline (589) minus ghosts (288) equals 301 actual units in transit. Parameters adjusted to force ordering despite these losses.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14 with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows significant lead time variability and order loss. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (170 units) are confirmed as lost, totaling 288 'ghost' units in the pipeline inventory of 787. The OR backend uses 'on-hand + in-transit' to calculate orders; therefore, it believes we have 787 + 0 units, even though only 499 are actually coming. This 'ghost' inventory of 288 units causes the backend to under-order, leading to chronic stockouts (sold 28 out of 33 last period). To counteract this, I must significantly inflate the 'mu_hat' (demand across review + lead time) to force the backend to place an order despite the 288 ghost units. Actual demand mean is approx 101 per period. With L=2, the backend expects 3 periods of demand (303). I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to (303 + ghost 288) = 591 to clear the inventory gap. I will use 'calculate' for L to acknowledge the observed average (approx 2.4-2.5) and 'recent_N' for sigma to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed cumulative ghost inventory is 288 units (P2 and P6 orders). Total in-transit (787) minus ghosts (288) = 499 units truly expected. Parameters remain inflated to bridge this 288-unit reporting gap.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 15 and currently have 0 on-hand inventory. The system reports 709 units in-transit, but based on history, we have confirmed that orders from Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (170 units) are lost. These 288 'ghost' units inflate the backend's view of our pipeline, causing it to under-order and leading to the chronic stockouts seen in Periods 13 and 14. To correct this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock for a (L+1)=4 period window (given observed L=3) at a mean demand of 96.5 is ~386 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 288-unit reporting error, I set mu_hat to 650. This effectively signals a demand requirement that accounts for the missing 288 units plus the next cycle's needs. L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 288 units. Actual lead time (L) is consistently 3 periods across recent successful arrivals (P5, P7, P9, P11).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 110 units on-hand and 486 in-transit. Based on historical data, 288 units in the pipeline (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost shipments ('ghost inventory'). The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (486) from the base stock calculation, which would result in under-ordering if not corrected. The actual viable pipeline is 486 - 288 = 198 units (the order from Period 13). Recent arrivals (P5, P7, P9, P11, P12) consistently show an actual lead time (L) of 3 periods, despite the promised 2. Average demand per period is approximately 98 (mean of all 15 samples). To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order, I must set the mu_hat parameter to cover the target stock level PLUS the 288 units of ghost inventory. Target base stock for L=3 is (L+1) * mean = 4 * 98 = 392. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 392 + 288 = 680, the backend calculation (680 - 486 pipeline) will target an order that effectively ignores the lost units. I set L to 3 and sigma_hat to explicit (sqrt(4)*std \u2248 2*28 = 56) to ensure stability.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we have 254 units on-hand and 420 units in-transit. However, historical data confirms that orders from Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (170 units) are lost, totaling 288 'ghost' units. The actual effective pipeline is 420 - 288 = 132 units (the order from P16). Recent successful arrivals (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12, P13) show a consistent actual lead time of 3 periods, despite the promised 2. Demand over the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 83 units per period. To prevent stockouts caused by the backend OR engine overcounting 'ghost' inventory, I am setting L=3 and using an explicit mu_hat. The calculation for mu_hat is based on coverage for L+1 (4) periods. Expected demand: 4 periods * 83/period = 332. To compensate for the 288 units of ghost inventory that the backend subtracts from the order quantity, I add 288 to the target mu_hat: 332 + 288 = 620. This forces the system to order enough to satisfy actual demand while accounting for the reporting discrepancy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-246.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 358 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 288 units is comprised entirely of confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (170 units). Since these units will never arrive, the actual pipeline inventory is 0. Recent demand has significantly dropped (28, 54, 113) compared to earlier periods, likely indicating a regime shift or seasonal lull. The observed actual lead time for recent successful deliveries has stabilized at 3 periods (P11, P12, P13 all took 3 periods), though P16 arrived in 1. I will set L to 3 to be safe. To account for the 288 'ghost' units in the backend's math, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. My target base stock is (L+1)*Demand + Ghost_Inventory. Using the recent demand average of ~70 units across 4 periods: (3+1)*70 + 288 = 568. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N to capture the lower volatility of the current period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand decreased from ~100 to ~40 (-60%) over the last two periods. Ghost inventory (288 units) continues to distort pipeline math.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-233.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are managing a significant demand regime shift that began in Period 16, where demand dropped from ~100 to ~40 units per period. The last three periods (P16-P18) recorded demands of 54, 28, and 25 (mean ~35.7). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (333 units) due to the arrival of previous large orders (P13 and P16) just as demand plummeted. The in-transit inventory of 288 units exactly matches the known 'ghost' inventory (P2 order of 118 and P6 order of 170) which are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts in-transit inventory from the base stock to calculate the order, these 288 'ghost' units act as a permanent brake on ordering. However, given our high on-hand stock and low current demand, no new orders are required. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the low-demand regime (approx. 36 units/period). I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect the consistent recent lead times (P12, P13, P14 orders all took 3 periods). The high on-hand inventory will prevent the system from over-ordering while we wait for the demand to stabilize or recover.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at low levels: P16-P18 average demand is 35.7 units/period. On-hand inventory (333) is now sufficient to cover approximately 7-9 periods of current demand.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we have an on-hand inventory of 317 units. Demand has shifted significantly downward starting around Period 16; the average demand over the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is 30.75 units (54, 28, 25, 16). The 288 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost orders in P2 (118) and P6 (170), meaning we actually have zero real pipeline inventory. However, with current demand at ~31 units and on-hand inventory at 317, we have over 10 periods of supply. The priority has shifted from avoiding stockouts to minimizing holding costs ($1/unit/period). I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime. This will set a base stock level significantly below our current on-hand + (ghost) in-transit, preventing any new orders from being placed while we bleed off the excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at very low levels: P16-P19 average demand is 30.75 units/period (down ~70% from previous levels).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-217.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant regime shift starting around Period 16, decreasing from a historical average of ~100 to a recent average (P16-P20) of 28.6 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 297 units, which covers over 10 periods of demand at the current rate. The in-transit inventory of 288 units consists entirely of 'ghost' orders from Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (170 units) which are confirmed lost and have not arrived despite 19 and 15 periods passing, respectively. Although the backend OR engine sees these 288 units in the pipeline, the massive on-hand surplus means no orders will be triggered anyway. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the new low-demand environment (avg ~28.6, std ~16). L is set to 'explicit' at 3 to align with the most frequent actual lead time observed recently, ensuring that even if the backend math uses the ghost units, the targets are grounded in the current lower demand reality to avoid over-ordering when stock eventually depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-20 average demand is 28.6 units/period, a ~70% decrease from the initial baseline.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is now firmly established. Over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), the average demand is 30.16 units/period, compared to the previous average of ~100 units. On-hand inventory is 259 units, which covers more than 8 periods of current demand. The 'In-transit' quantity of 288 units is entirely comprised of the historically identified 'ghost' inventory (Period 2 and Period 6 orders) which are confirmed lost. Because on-hand inventory is significantly higher than the required base stock for this low-demand regime, and the backend normally subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock targets, there is no risk of stockout. I am setting parameters to reflect the new low-demand regime (mu_hat based on last 6 periods) and a lead time of 3 (observed actual). This will lead the OR engine to place zero orders, allowing on-hand inventory to gradually deplete to more efficient levels.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level since Period 16. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P16-P22) is approximately 32.1 units per period, compared to the initial baseline of ~100 units. Current on-hand inventory is 215 units, which is sufficient to cover roughly 6-7 periods of the current demand regime. The 'In-transit' quantity of 288 units consists entirely of the 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments in Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (170 units). Since these units will never arrive, the actual physical pipeline is empty. However, because on-hand inventory is already high relative to current low demand, no new orders are needed. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 captures the lower mean of the current regime (~32.1), and L is set to explicit 3 based on the most frequent actual lead time observed (excluding lost orders and outliers). This configuration results in a base stock level that is lower than the current on-hand inventory, effectively preventing unnecessary new orders while the system works through the existing stock.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime starting at Period 16. Over the last 8 periods (P16-P23), demand has averaged approximately 32.5 units/period (54, 28, 25, 16, 20, 38, 44, 35). Currently, on-hand inventory is 180 units, which is sufficient to cover more than 5 periods of demand at this rate. The 'In-transit' quantity of 288 units consists entirely of 'ghost' inventory from orders placed in Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (170 units), which are long confirmed lost. Since the OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory (288 units) from the calculated base stock, it would normally prevent ordering. However, given our high on-hand stock and low demand, there is no need to order yet. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to reflect the low-demand regime and L=3 to reflect the observed actual lead time, which will result in a low base stock and prevent unnecessary ordering while we wind down on-hand inventory.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, decreasing from ~100 units/period to an average of 32.3 units/period over the last 9 periods (P16-P24). On-hand inventory is currently 149 units, which covers approximately 4.6 periods of current demand. The 'In-transit' quantity of 288 units consists entirely of the lost shipments from Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (170 units). Since the backend OR engine includes these 288 units in its pipeline inventory math, it will refrain from ordering until on-hand inventory is depleted or significantly lower. Given the current on-hand stock and the low demand regime, there is no immediate risk of stockout. Parameters are set to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=9) and the observed actual lead time (L=3), ensuring the OR backend correctly accounts for the current consumption rate while ignoring the ghost inventory which it already 'sees' as fulfilling the base stock requirement.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-9.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began at Period 16 is now firmly established. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the average demand has dropped to 31.9 units per period, a significant decrease from the initial baseline (~100). The current on-hand inventory is 121 units, which covers approximately 3.8 periods of the current average demand. The 'In-transit' quantity of 288 units consists entirely of 'ghost' inventory from Period 2 and Period 6 that will never arrive. Because the backend math uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), these 288 units are preventing the system from ordering. However, given the current low demand and high on-hand stock, no new orders are desired yet to avoid excessive holding costs. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect the new low-demand environment. I will keep L at explicit=3, as that was the dominant lead time before shipments stopped arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-25 average demand is 31.9 units/period (~70% decrease from baseline). On-hand inventory now provides sufficient coverage (approx 4 periods) for the lower demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began at Period 16 remains stable, with demand over the last 11 periods (P16-P26) averaging approximately 32 units per period. This represents a ~70% decrease from the initial baseline (~100 units). On-hand inventory is currently 87 units, providing nearly 3 periods of safety coverage at this lower demand level. The 'In-transit' quantity of 288 units is entirely comprised of the 'ghost' shipments from Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (170 units), which are confirmed lost. Although these ghosts have previously caused the OR backend to under-order, the current on-hand position is now aligned with the lower demand. I will continue using 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat to capture the low-demand regime and N=20 for sigma_hat to provide a conservative buffer against potential volatility or stockouts as lead times remain variable (avg ~2.4). I maintain L at 'explicit' value 3, as recent successful deliveries consistently showed a lead time of 3 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime starting from Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 27 is approximately 32.8 units per period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 46 units. The 'In-transit' count of 288 units consists entirely of 'ghost' inventory from Period 2 and Period 6, which are long-confirmed lost. Since the backend OR logic subtracts in-transit inventory from the target base stock, it will see 288 'ghost' units and refuse to order, even though nothing is actually coming. To force the system to keep ordering despite these ghosts, mu_hat must be set to cover both the required coverage (L+1) and the ghost inventory gap. Given a lead time (L) of 3, the target base stock for 4 periods of demand (~33 * 4 = 132) needs to be shifted by the 288 units lost, totaling ~420. Setting mu_hat to 420 using the explicit method will ensure the system places an order to replace the dwindling on-hand stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $139.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized at a lower level since Period 16. Analyzing the last 13 periods (P16-P28), the average demand is 33.1 units per period. On-hand inventory is currently low (9 units) following a long period of depletion. Pipeline inventory is reported as 392 units, but this includes a cumulative 'ghost' inventory of 288 units (orders from P2 and P6 which are long lost). The true pipeline inventory is 104 units (from the order placed in P28). I use L=3 based on consistent recent lead-time observations. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the new demand level (avg ~33) over the next 4 periods (L+1), while accounting for the 288 units of ghost inventory that will never arrive, I set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1)*Avg_Demand + Ghost_Units = 4 * 33 + 288 = 132 + 288 = 420. By setting mu_hat slightly above this (430) and using a modest sigma_hat, the OR engine will see Net_Inventory = 9 (on-hand) + 392 (reported pipeline) = 401. With a base stock around 420-430, it should place a small supplementary order to maintain the desired service level without overstocking, given that we've now right-sized the on-hand inventory for the lower demand regime.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 16 is consistently low, averaging 31.8 units per period over the last 14 samples. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 439 units in-transit. However, historical 'ghost inventory' (orders from P2 and P6 totaling 288 units) remains in-transit math, meaning the usable pipeline is actually 151 units (439 - 288). Recent orders from P28 (104) and P29 (47) are expected to arrive within 1-3 periods. To prevent prolonged stockouts while accounting for the backend's distorted pipeline view, I am using 'recent_N' with N=14 (the length of the low-demand regime). I maintain L=3 as the explicit lead time to ensure the base stock calculation covers the 3-period arrival cycle observed for most successful shipments. The mu_hat and sigma_hat are derived from the 14-period low-demand regime to avoid over-ordering as the ghost inventory gradually becomes a smaller fraction of the total calculation context.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (avg ~32 units) enters its 15th period. Ghost inventory of 288 units continues to inflate in-transit counts by approximately 9 periods of current demand.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a low level since Period 16, with an average of approximately 32 units per period (P16-P30). Currently, on-hand inventory is 77 units, and 'visible' in-transit inventory is 335 units. However, based on extensive history, 288 units in humanity's 'In-transit' count are 'ghost' units from lost orders in Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (170 units). Subtracting these ghosts leaves a true pipeline of 47 units (the order from Period 29). The observed lead time for the most recent arrival (P28 order arriving in P30) was 2 periods, matching the promised lead time. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 335 units of in-transit inventory and refusing to order, I must set mu_hat explicitly. My goal is to maintain a target inventory (Base Stock) that covers 3 periods (L+1) of demand at ~32 units/period, plus a safety buffer. Target inventory \u2248 32 * 3 + safety \u2248 130-150 units. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory (335 units) from the calculated base_stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset the 288 ghost units. Setting mu_hat to 450 (which is approximately 150 target + 288 offset + slight buffer) ensures the system places small replacement orders as demand consumes on-hand stock, while accounting for the reporting error.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 16 and has stabilized at a mean of approximately 32 units/period (Calculated from P16-P31). The ghost inventory (orders from P2 and P6 totaling 288 units) still persists in the pipeline math (total in-transit 387 - 288 ghost = 99 actual units in transit from P29 and P31 orders). At the current demand rate of ~32, the on-hand inventory (44) plus the real in-transit (99) equals 143 units, which provides approximately 4.5 periods of coverage. However, the OR backend sees the full 387 in-transit plus 44 on-hand (431 units total, or ~13.5 periods of coverage), which would prevent any new orders until on-hand is exhausted. To maintain a safe service level and offset the 288-unit reporting distortion, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly include the expected demand over (L+1) periods plus the 288 units the system 'thinks' we have but doesn't. With L=3 (consistent actual lead time) and mean=32, base stock should be (3+1)*32 + 288 = 416. Sigma reflects the recent variability (~9.5).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized at a low level; the average demand from Period 16 to Period 32 is approximately 31.5 units. The current on-hand inventory is 68 units, providing roughly 2.1 periods of coverage. In-transit inventory is 335 units, but this includes 288 units of 'ghost' inventory (orders from P2 and P6) that are confirmed lost. The actual expected in-transit inventory is 47 units (ordered in P29). Recent realized lead times have been 2 periods (P30) and 1 period (P32), suggesting a slight improvement, though 'ghost' inventory continues to distort the backend's pipeline math. To compensate for the 288 units of reporting bias that prevent the OR engine from ordering, I am using an explicit mu_hat that covers the true demand for the lead time plus review period (L+1) while adding the 288 ghost units back into the target base stock. This 'inflation' ensures the system triggers an order despite the phantom pipeline units. I set L=2 as a conservative middle ground.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 31 units per period (last 18 periods). Ghost inventory of 288 units (orders from P2 and P6) still accounts for a large portion of the reported 335 units in-transit. The actual in-transit inventory is 335 - 288 = 47 units (from Period 29's order), which is expected to arrive soon. Current on-hand inventory is 58 units, covering roughly 2 periods of current demand. To prevent stockouts caused by the OR engine's reliance on 'ghost' pipeline units, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for the low-demand regime: with L=2, review+lead time is 3 periods. Mean demand is ~31, so 3 * 31 = 93. To offset the 288 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 93 + 288 = 381. Sigma_hat is set to 30 reflecting the stability of the current regime. This ensures the backend places an order once on-hand inventory drops further, despite the phantom pipeline levels.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 31 units per period (P16-P34 average is 30.2 units). Current on-hand inventory is 26, which is barely enough for one period. The system reports an in-transit balance of 349 units, but historically confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost orders in Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (170 units) total 288 units. Subtracting these ghosts, the actual in-transit inventory is 61 units (P29 order of 47 and P34 order of 14). Total effective inventory (on-hand + true in-transit) is 87 units, which covers nearly 3 periods of the current mean demand. Lead times have been variable (1-3 periods), but recent arrivals (P28, P31) show a return toward the promised 2 periods (avg 1.5 for those two). To counter the backend's overestimation of inventory due to the 288 'ghost' units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock level of (L+1) * mean_demand + ghost_offset. With L=2, base stock should be (3 * 31) + 288 = 381. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the 288-unit reporting inflation.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 16-35 has stabilized at an average of approximately 31.5 units per period, down significantly from the initial baseline (~100 units). On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units). The reported in-transit inventory is 370 units, but this includes 288 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments in Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (170 units). Therefore, the actual effective pipeline is 370 - 288 = 82 units (consisting of orders from P29, P31, P34, P35, though P29 appears delayed). To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders despite the ghost inventory inflating the pipeline math, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (1+L) while adding an offset to 'nullify' the 288 ghost units. Actual lead time (L) has averaged 2-3 periods; I will use L=3 to be safe. Target base stock = ((1+3) * 32) + 288 = ~416. Sigma is set to reflect the recent volatility (std ~10 * sqrt(1+L)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in the low-regime phase established since Period 16, with the average demand over the last 20 periods (P17-P36) being approximately 32 units. The ghost inventory (P2 and P6 orders) totaling 288 units remains undelivered and continues to inflate the system's 'In-transit' count (currently 419). Subtracting these 288 'ghost' units leaves a real pipeline of 131 units (composed of P29, P31, P35, and P36 orders). With only 4 units on hand and 10 units demand last period, we are at risk of stockouts. To compensate for the 288 units of ghost inventory that the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to the expected demand over (L+1) periods plus the 288 missing units. For L=3 and avg demand=32, expected demand is 128. Adding 288 units gives an explicit mu_hat of 416 to force the backend to place an order that covers the gap created by lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in the low-level regime established around Period 16. Over the last 10 periods (P28-P37), the average demand is 27.6 units, while the 20-period average (P18-P37) is 29.5 units. I will use N=20 to capture this stabilized low demand while filtering out minor fluctuations. On-hand inventory is currently 67. The reported in-transit (pipeline) of 345 units is heavily distorted by the identified 'ghost inventory' from Periods 2 and 6 (totaling 288 units). These orders are confirmed lost. Subtracting them (345 - 288) leaves 57 units of actual in-transit inventory (the order from P37). The actual lead time has stabilized closer to the promised 2 periods lately (P34, P35 arrived in 2 periods; P36 in 1). I will set L to 2. To account for the backend's math (Inventory Position = On-hand + In-transit), I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 288 ghost units. Expected base stock (1+L)*30 + safety stock \u2248 120. To ensure the backend places an order if needed, I set mu_hat = (Ideal Base Stock + Ghost Units) = 120 + 288 = 408. This forces the backend to recognize that the 288 units will never arrive.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized at a lower level since Period 16, with the average demand over the last 23 periods (P16-P38) being approximately 30.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 46 units. The reported in-transit inventory is 356 units, but this includes 288 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost orders in Periods 2 and 6. Therefore, the true pipeline is 356 - 288 = 68 units. These 68 units consist of the order from Period 29 (47 units, 9 periods elapsed - possibly lost), and recent orders from P37 (10 units) and P38 (11 units). Given the target base stock needs to cover (L+1) periods of demand (approx 3 * 30.5 = 91.5 units), and the backend believes there are 356 units in transit, it will not order anything unless I use explicit parameters to offset the 288-unit distortion. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=23 to capture the current stable low-demand regime and an explicit L = 2 to match the promised lead time while acknowledging the reporting gap.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a low average of approximately 28 units/period since Period 16 (P16-P39 mean is ~27.9). The total In-transit inventory is currently 345 units, but this is heavily distorted by 288 units of 'ghost inventory' (Period 2 and Period 6 orders) which are confirmed lost. The actual expected pipeline is 57 units (orders from P29, P34, P37, and P38 are largely accounted for or expected). On-hand inventory is 43 units. With the low demand and the distortion in pipeline math, I must continue to use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bypass the backend's miscalculation of pipeline inventory. mu_hat is set to cover approximately 3.5 periods of demand (L+1=3) at the 28 unit/period rate, but slightly higher (130) to ensure the backend places small maintenance orders given the large perceived pipeline. L is set to explicit 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals have varied between 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (avg ~28 units) enters its 25th period. Ghost inventory of 288 units continues to inflate backend in-transit calculations by over 10 periods of current demand, requiring explicit parameter overrides to trigger necessary replenishment.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level since Period 16, averaging approximately 28 units per period over the last 25 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 35 units, and in-transit inventory is listed as 345 units. However, we must account for the 288 units of 'ghost inventory' (Period 2 and Period 6 orders) that were lost and never arrived. The effective pipeline inventory is 345 - 288 = 57 units (this includes the Period 29 order of 47 units which is now 12 periods overdue and likely also lost, and the Period 37 order of 10 units). Given current demand is approx 28 units/period, and observed lead times recently vary between 1-2 periods, we should target a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1 with L=2). Since the backend OR logic subtracts the full 345 units from the base_stock, we must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this 288-unit reporting gap to ensure the system places an order if necessary. However, with 35 on hand and 57 effective in-transit, we are sufficiently covered for the immediate 3 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for demand/volatility to capture the low-demand regime and 'calculate' for lead time, while monitoring the aging Period 29 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Effective pipeline inventory is only 57 units after accounting for 288 units of confirmed ghost inventory. The Period 29 order (47 units) is now 12 periods overdue and is likely lost, which would bring total ghost inventory to 335 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a lower state established around Period 16, with the average demand over the last 25 periods being approximately 28.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 41 ended with a stockout. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Historically, orders from P2 (118 units) and P6 (170 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 288 units. Period 29's order (47 units) is now 12 periods overdue and is also confirmed lost, bringing the total ghost inventory to 335 units. The system reports 345 units in-transit, but only 10 units (345 - 335) are genuinely expected to arrive. Since actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, I need to force an order to cover the current stockout and future demand. I will use 'explicit' parameters to bypass the backend's inflated pipeline calculation. I'll set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I'll target a base stock level that ignores the 335 dead units: (1+L)*30 units = 90. To force the order, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed the reported in-transit (345). A mu_hat of 450 (which is 345 + 105) will signal the backend to order approximately 105 units, enough to replenish on-hand inventory and cover the lead time for the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed total ghost inventory is 335 units (P2: 118, P6: 170, P29: 47). Genuine pipeline inventory is only 10 units. Demand continues to track at a mean of ~28-30 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the SKU is in a state of critical stockout (on-hand: 0). The primary challenge is the discrepancy between the system-reported in-transit inventory (468) and actual expected inventory. Analysis confirms 335 units are 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments: Period 2 (118), Period 6 (170), and now Period 29 (47), which is 13 periods overdue. The genuine pipeline is only 133 units (Period 37 order of 10 units, which is overdue/lost now, and Period 42 order of 123 units). Demand remains in a low-regime state since Period 16, with a recent mean of approximately 28 units/period. To trigger an order from the OR backend despite the high reported in-transit numbers, I am setting an explicit 'mu_hat' that incorporates the 335-unit gap plus the (L+Review) demand. L is set to explicit 3 based on the historical pattern of successful deliveries often taking 3 periods, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for sufficient lead-time coverage.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Total confirmed ghost inventory increased to 335 units (P2: 118, P6: 170, P29: 47). Genuine pipeline inventory consists only of the P42 order (123 units). Demand regime remains stable at ~28 units/period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 44. On-hand inventory is 0, and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 468 units. However, based on history, 335 of these units are confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory (P2: 118, P6: 170, P29: 47), meaning the genuine pipeline is only 133 units (comprising the P37 order of 10 units which is now 7 periods overdue and also potentially lost, and the P42 order of 123 units). Demand has stabilized in a low-regime for the last 28 periods, averaging approximately 28.5 units. To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend despite the high ghost in-transit count, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds (on_hand + pipeline). Since on-hand is 0 and pipeline is reported as 468, the base stock (approx mu_hat) needs to be significantly higher than 468. To ensure we have stock for the next 3-4 periods (L+1) while overcoming the 335-unit reporting gap, I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 500. This will signal the backend to target an inventory position around 500 units, effectively resulting in a real order of about 32-50 units once the cap is applied. Sigma is set to reflect the higher volatility observed in recent periods (e.g., the jump to 51 in P41).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Confirmed total ghost inventory is 335 units (P2: 118, P6: 170, P29: 47). The Period 37 order (10 units) is also likely lost (7 periods elapsed). Effective pipeline is currently 123 units (P42 order). Demand regime remains stable at ~28.5 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 with 0 on-hand inventory and a demand regime that has stabilized at approximately 28.5 units/period since Period 16. The high in-transit number (534) is significantly inflated by 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments): Period 2 (118), Period 6 (170), Period 29 (47), and Period 37 (10), totaling 345 units. The genuine pipeline inventory consists only of orders from Period 42 (123 units) and Period 44 (66 units), totaling 189 units. Since Period 42 is now 3 periods old and recent successful lead times have been 1-3 periods, it is expected to arrive during the current period (the conclusion of which we will see in P46). To ensure the OR backend triggers an order despite the 345 units of ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Theoretical base stock for a 2-period promised lead time (covering 3 periods of demand) at ~30 units/period is 90 units. Adding the 345 ghost units to this target yields 435. With 534 currently reported in transit, the standard calculation (base_stock - pipeline) would result in zero ordering. Therefore, I set mu_hat to 650 to force the backend to place a replenishment order to cover the current stockout and future demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Total confirmed ghost inventory is 345 units (P2: 118, P6: 170, P29: 47, P37: 10). Actual lead time remains variable (1-3 periods). Low-demand regime (avg ~29 units) is stable.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing a stable low-demand regime (~29 units/period) while navigating significant 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Total in-transit inventory is reported as 548 units, but history confirms 345 of these units are lost shipments (P2: 118, P6: 170, P29: 47, P37: 10). The genuine pipeline consists of the P44 order (66 units) and the P45 order (137 units). On-hand inventory is currently 104 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover future demand despite the 345-unit reporting inflation, I will use 'explicit' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * forecasted demand (3 * 29 = 87) plus a buffer (345) to neutralize the ghosts, totaling 432. Sigma_hat is set to cover the observed volatility in this low-demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual mean lead time (approx 2.4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $11.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 29 units over the last 30 periods. Ghost inventory (confirmed lost shipments) remains a significant factor, distorting the backend OR math. Currently, the system shows 548 units in transit. However, accounting for confirmed 'ghosts' (P2: 118, P6: 170, P29: 47, P37: 10, total = 345 units), the actual pipeline inventory is 203 units (P44 order of 66 and P45 order of 137). Current on-hand inventory is 81 units. With a combined actual inventory (on-hand + true pipeline) of 284 units and an average demand of ~29 units, we have coverage for nearly 10 periods. The OR backend uses (on-hand + reported in-transit) to determine order quantities. Since 'In-transit' is inflated by 345 ghost units, the backend will naturally stop ordering unless parameters are adjusted upward. However, given the high level of current true coverage (284 units vs 29 mean demand) and the game approaching its conclusion (Period 47 of 50), no new orders are necessary to meet demand for the remaining 3 periods. I am setting parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime and lead time reality without forcing new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a low level (mean ~29 units/period since Period 16). The critical issue remains the high volume of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, which the backend system erroneously includes in its stock-on-hand calculations. There are 345 confirmed lost units (P2: 118, P6: 170, P29: 47, P37: 10). Additionally, the P44 order (66 units) is now 4 periods old (promised 2), and P45 order (137 units) is 3 periods old. Current in-transit is 548. Subtracting the 345 ghosts leaves 203 viable units in transit (P44, P45). With on-hand at 50 units and lead times frequently hitting 3 periods, we need to ensure the backend triggers orders despite the reported 548 units in-transit. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that bridges this reporting gap. Calculated target base stock for a 3-period lead time (L+1 = 4) at ~29 units/period is roughly 150-160 units. To make the backend (which sees 50 on-hand + 548 in-transit = 598 total) place an order, the mu_hat must be set high enough to overcome this ghost-inflated inventory while considering current demand reality.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Total confirmed ghost inventory remains 345 units. Order from P44 (66 units) is overdue (4 periods), potentially lost. Current demand regime (P16-P47) mean is ~29.1 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are at zero on-hand inventory following a 56-unit demand spike in Period 48. Total reported in-transit is 622 units, but this includes 345 units of confirmed ghost inventory (P2, P6, P29, P37) and an increasingly suspicious P44 order (66 units, 5 periods elapsed). Subtracting confirmed ghosts leaves 277 units, and if P44 is lost, only 211 units are truly in the pipeline. The demand regime remains stable in a low-demand state averaging ~29.1 units (P16-P48), but exhibits volatility (peaks >50). Actual lead times fluctuate between 1-3 periods. To ensure availability given the zero stock and high ghost inventory which prevents the OR engine from ordering naturally, I am utilizing an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock level that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost inventory offset. With L=3 used as a conservative estimate and mean demand ~30, a base stock near 465 (120 for demand + 345 offset) is required to trigger replenishment. I set mu_hat explicitly to 430 and sigma_hat to 60 to maintain a high service level while accounting for the backend's lead-time math.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Order from P44 (66 units) is now 5 periods overdue and highly likely lost; total potential ghost inventory is 411 units. Demand volatility in the low regime (avg 29) occasionally spikes above 50 units (P41, P44, P48).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are managing a stable low-demand regime (avg ~29 units) that has persisted since Period 16. The primary challenge remains 'ghost inventory': orders from P2 (118), P6 (170), P29 (47), P37 (10), and now likely P44 (66) are lost, totaling 411 units that the backend incorrectly includes in pipeline inventory. With 0 on-hand and an 'In-transit' figure of 622 units, the backend sees 622 - 411 = 211 units truly expected (P45: 137, P48: 74). To ensure the backend places an order despite this ghost inflation, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the actual expected demand for the (L+1) window. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the low-regime average (approx 29) plus a significant buffer to negate the 411-unit reporting error. Effective demand needed to trigger an order = (True Demand Coverage) + (Ghost Inventory). For L=3, a 4-period window of demand is ~116 units. Adding the 411 ghost units requires a mu_hat of approximately 527. I will set mu_hat to 550 to ensure we maintain safety stock and account for recent demand spikes (up to 56).

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Order from P44 (66 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost; total ghost inventory is 411 units (P2, P6, P29, P37, P44). This ghost inventory persists in distorting the 'In-transit' calculation by over 14 periods of current average demand (~29 units).
