Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (samples provided) shows a mean of 88.2 units per period (109, 68, 99, 80, 105). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since there is no actual performance data yet to suggest a lead time deviation or a regime change, I will use the default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to establish a baseline order. These methods will utilize the historical samples to calculate the necessary base stock level to satisfy demand through Period 1 + Lead Time (3 periods total).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 122 units with a promised lead time of 2. As expected (Lead Time = 2), no units arrived during Period 1, and since starting inventory was 0, all Period 1 demand (75) was lost. The 122 units remain in-transit and are expected to arrive in Period 3 (viewable in Period 4). Current on-hand is 0, so Period 2 demand will also be lost. I will use the 'default' lead time (2) and the 'calculated' statistics based on the provided historical demand samples (Periods 1-5 mean: 88.2, std: 17.6) provided in the prompt's context to set the base stock level. mu_hat target should reflect (1+L) periods, i.e., 3 * 88.2 = 264.6. Since the OR backend uses all samples by default, I will stick to 'default' parameters to establish a baseline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. In the first two periods, we had 0 starting inventory and observed demands of 75 and 129 respectively, resulting in lost sales as no stock was on hand. We placed orders in Period 1 (122 units) and Period 2 (118 units), totaling 240 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the timing rule, the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message (which I will see at the start of Period 4). Therefore, current on-hand remains 0 for this decision phase. Demand history for the last 5 periods (including pre-game samples) is [109, 68, 99, 80, 105], and the game-time demands were [75, 129]. The average demand is approximately 95. Since we have no evidence yet that the actual lead time differs from the promised 2 periods, I will use L=2. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available historical samples (7 total) to establish a baseline forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The SKU is 'chips(Regular)'. In the first three periods, demand was 75, 129, and 93 (average ~99). Promised lead time is 2. Orders placed in P1 (122 units) should arrive during P3's arrival resolution and be visible in the P3 conclude message read at P4 start. However, P3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is likely 3 periods or more, or the shipment is delayed. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and have lost all sales so far (0 sold vs 297 demand), we need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2, demand is ~99/period, (1+L)*demand is ~297. Current in-transit is 285. I will maintain L=default (2) but use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility accurately, as the 'calculate' or 'default' methods for L only work once arrivals are confirmed. If P4 conclude still shows 0 arrivals, I will transition to explicit L=3 in the next decision.

Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that 'chips(Regular)' has an on-hand inventory of 18 and 130 units in-transit. Historical demand shows significant volatility (samples: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105; though conclude messages show demand: 75, 129, 93, 149). Lead times are unstable: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods (L=3), while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5) will be low, naturally leaning towards leaner inventory. However, the lead time instability and demand variance require a more robust buffer. I will use 'calculate' for L to average the observed lead times (3 and 1, avg=2) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture recent volatility while the backend manages the stock level according to the cost structure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we face a stockout after demand significantly exceeded our on-hand inventory in Period 5 (demand 140 vs on-hand 18). Historical demand shows an upward trend: early periods (P1-P3) averaged ~85 units, while recent periods (P4-P5) averaged ~144 units. This suggests a regime shift. Lead time is volatile: P1 took 3 periods, while P3 took 1 period, averaging 2 periods (consistent with promise). Current In-transit is 289 (from P2 and P5 orders). To stabilize, I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the average historical lead time. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_5' to capture the recent higher demand trend while ignoring the very first sample. For sigma_hat, 'recent_5' will also be used to capture the increased volatility seen in the last few periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, demand appears volatile with samples: [109, 68, 99, 80, 105] (pre-game) and [75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99] (observed). The average demand is approximately 104 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time is volatile: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3's order arrived in 1 period, despite a promised lead time of 2. Currently, orders from Period 2 (118 units), Period 5 (159 units), and Period 6 (170 units) are in transit (total 447 units). The 'In-transit' figure in the status (459) suggests the backend is tracking these plus the order from Period 4 (12 units), which has not yet concluded as arrived. Given the stockout in Periods 5 and 6, and a lead time that can drift to 3, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but calculating based on all historical demand to stabilize the forecast. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*mean demand. With L=2, mu_hat \u2248 3 * 104 = 312. Since holding cost equals profit ($1), the OR backend will target a 50% service level by default (q = 1/(1+1)), but our objective is to maximize reward. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average observed variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have been 3, 1, and 3. This indicates significant lead-time variance. Current inventory is 0 with 447 units in transit. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (118 units), Period 5 (159 units), and Period 6 (170 units) are still outstanding. If Period 2 arrives in Period 8, it would be a lead time of 6, which is highly unstable. Demand has shifted: Period 1-3 average was ~99, while Period 4-7 average is ~130. However, the initial five samples provided in the prompt (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) average to 92.2. The actual demand in Periods 4-7 (149, 140, 99, 134) shows an upward trend compared to the seed data. I will set L to 3 (the most frequent maximum lead time seen so far) and use recent_N=4 for demand to capture this higher mean (~130) versus the older seed data to prevent persistent stockouts. The OR backend uses profit and holding cost to set the service level; since they are equal ($1.0), the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.50, meaning we aim for the median demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analyzing lead times from concluding periods: P1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), P3 arrives in 1 period (P4), P4 arrives in 3 periods (P7), and P5 arrives in 3 periods (P8). Excluding the P3 outlier, the actual lead time L consistently appears to be 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. I will set L to 3. Inventory analysis: We have 50 units on-hand and 363 units in-transit (orders from P2, P6, and P8). Specifically, the P2 order (118 units) is extremely late (7 periods passed), suggesting it might be lost. The orders from P6 (170 units) and P8 (75 units) are within the observed 3-period lead time. Demand across the last 5 periods (P4-P8) shows a mean of 126.2 units, which is significantly higher than the initial 5 samples provided (mean 88.2). I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and volatility. With L=3, mu_hat will cover 4 review/lead periods ((1+3)*126.2 = 504.8). This helps the OR backend maintain a higher base stock to account for both increased demand and the extended actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is consistently 3 periods based on P1, P4, and P5 arrivals; Period 2 order (118 units) likely lost as it is 7 periods overdue; Demand regime shifted upward at Period 4 from avg 88 to avg 126.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 10, the inventory status shows 31 units on-hand and 380 units in-transit. Analyzing the lead time history: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 4 arrived in 3 periods, and Period 5 arrived in 3 periods. However, Period 3 arrived in 1 period and Period 8 arrived in 1 period. This suggests a bimodal lead time distribution around 1 or 3 periods, likely averaging to 2-3. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to remain conservative and cover the longer end of the observed lead time, especially given the lost order from Period 2. Demand analysis: Samples for P1-P5 were [109, 68, 99, 80, 105] (avg 92.2), while recent demand P1-P9 observed after game start was [75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99, 134, 109, 94] (avg 113.5). The upward shift starting Period 4 is sustained (averaging ~125). I will use mu_hat with recent_N=6 to capture this higher regime (P4-P9 demand avg ~120). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility. These parameters ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the 3nd-period arrival delay and the heightened demand plateau.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods; Period 2 order (118 units) is officially confirmed as lost (8 periods overdue); Demand remains in a higher regime (~120 vs original ~90) since Period 4.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand history shows a high-regime shift since Period 4, though the last three periods (P8-P10) have returned to slightly lower levels (avg ~96), bringing the overall mean since P4 to approximately 117. Lead times have been highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P8: 1). The P2 order is now confirmed lost. Given that Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, essentially targeting the mean demand. To account for lead time instability, I will set L to the average observed lead time (calculate) and use the recent demand regime (last 7 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Pipeline inventory of 453 units (orders from P6, P9, P10) should theoretically cover several periods, but with recent stockouts and lead time swings, a robust base stock is necessary.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: values alternate between 1 and 3 periods (avg 2.2). Demand mean stabilized at ~117 units/period since P4.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 453 units in-transit. Based on 'Carry-over insights', the Period 2 order (118 units) is confirmed lost. We have two pending orders from Period 6 (170 units) and Period 9 (92 units) which are overdue if the lead time were strictly 2 periods, but have not yet exceeded the 3-period observed maximum lead-time limit by enough to be confirmed lost. However, the Period 10 (73 units) and Period 11 (0 units) reflect a pipeline that is delayed. Historical lead times alternate between 1 and 3 periods (Average 2.2). Demand has recently softened (78, 86, 94 in the last 3 periods), though the P4-P11 average is ~110. I will use L=2.2 (explicit) to reflect the observed average lead time volatility. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 (the higher demand regime starting P4) to ensure the backend captures the ~110 units/period average while acknowledging the recent dip. This helps the OR backend maintain a safety stock that buffers against the lead-time uncertainty (1-3 periods) and prevents stockouts during the current zero-inventory state once arrivals resume.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received orders from Period 9 (lead time 3) and Period 10 (lead time 2). This continues the pattern of lead time volatility where actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.4 across observed arrivals (3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2). I am setting L to 2.4 explicitly to account for this uncertainty. Regarding demand, the recent trend reflects a potential softening or return to a lower mean; since Period 9, demand has been 94, 86, 78, and 93, averaging 87.75. This is lower than the ~120 mean observed between Periods 4-8. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh these most recent observations more heavily, allowing the model to adapt to this lower demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer for lead time variance. Note: The Period 2 order (118 units) remains lost and is excluded from pipeline inventory calculations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has shifted downward again from ~117 to ~88 starting Period 9; Lead time remains volatile between 1-3 periods with an average of ~2.4.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the on-hand inventory is 39 units with 0 units arriving this period (Period 13's order was 0). The demand history shows a significant downward shift starting from Period 9, with recent samples being 94, 86, 78, 93, and 33. The last sample (33) is particularly low, but to avoid overreacting to a single outlier while acknowledging the lower trend, I am using recent_N with N=5 for demand (avg ~77). Lead time remains volatile, with observations of 1, 2, and 3 periods; I'll use L=recent_N with N=5 to capture an average of approximately 2.0-2.2. The Period 2 order (118 units) is confirmed lost and no longer part of the pipeline. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend targets the 50th percentile (the mean) for the base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand has dropped from ~117 to ~77 units/period starting around Period 9. Demand in P13 (33) may indicate further downward volatility or a new lower floor.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 288 units in-transit. Historically, demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility and regime shifts. After a peak around Periods 4-8 (avg ~117), demand has dropped significantly from Period 9 onwards. The last six periods of demand (94, 86, 78, 93, 33, 101) average approximately 80.8 units per period. The spike in Period 14 (101) suggests the low of 33 in Period 13 was an outlier rather than a new lower floor. Lead times are highly unstable, alternating between 1, 2, and 3 periods (average ~2.3). To minimize stockouts while managing holding costs (which equal profit), I will use an explicit L of 3 to account for the upper end of the observed lead time volatility. For demand, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current lower demand regime (~81 units/period). This results in a mu_hat covering the review and lead period (1+3 periods).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 324 units in-transit. Historical demand has settled into a lower regime since Period 9, with recent samples (P12-P15) showing values of 93, 33, 101, and 113. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P9-P15) is approximately 85.5 units. Lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with an observed average of 2.33 periods (calculated from P1, P3, P4, P5, P8, P9, and P10 arrivals). Given the stockout in Period 15 and the high level of in-transit inventory relative to demand, the OR parameters need to stabilize. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=7) to capture the current lower demand regime and an explicit lead time of 2.5 to account for the volatility and prevent premature ordering while waiting for the 324 units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in the lower regime established around Period 9, averaging ~85 units/period (compared to the previous ~117 and original ~90). Lead time volatility is sustained, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17, current on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been unsatisfied for two periods. The historical demand data shows a regime shift around Period 9, decreasing from a mean of ~117 to ~85 units/period. The most recent demand samples are 33, 101, 113, and 54, illustrating significant volatility around this lower mean. Lead time has been highly unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2), necessitating a larger buffer. The Period 2 order (118 units) is confirmed lost, while orders from Period 6 (170 units), Period 11 (0), Period 12 (0), Period 13 (0), Period 14 (0), and Period 15 (36 units) make up the 'In-transit' figure of 324 (170+36+118 lost = 324). Note: the system still counts the lost 118 in pipeline. I will set L to 2.4 to reflect observed average delay and use recent_N (N=8) to capture the lower demand regime (~83 units/period) while ignoring the higher early-period spikes. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that accounts for both the lower average demand and the extended lead-time risk.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been significantly underserved due to ordering pauses in recent periods. Reviewing the history: demand shifted from ~117 down to ~85 units/period starting at Period 9, with the last 5 periods (P13-P17) averaging 65.8 units/period, though P17 was quite low (28). Lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.3). Total in-transit inventory is 324 units, which primarily stems from large orders placed earlier (P6: 170 units, or P15: 36 units). However, the P6 order (170 units) is now 12 periods overdue, significantly exceeding the max observed lead time of 3 periods; it is almost certainly lost. Excluding the likely lost P6 order, the reliable pipeline is only 154 units (potentially the P15 order and others). Given the stockout and the lead time uncertainty, I will set L to 3 (the upper bound of typical arrival times) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand, I'll use recent_N=9 to capture the current lower regime while accounting for the recent variability. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat with the same window to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 6 (170 units) is now 12 periods overdue and confirmed as lost; reliable pipeline inventory is roughly 154 units. Demand remains in the lower regime (avg ~80 since P9, though last 5 periods avg ~66).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 19 with 0 on-hand inventory. The total in-transit units are 324, but 288 of these (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights and historical evidence. Only the order of 36 units from Period 15 remains as a viable incoming shipment, putting the effective pipeline inventory at 36 units. Demand has shifted into a significantly lower regime; while the post-P9 average was around 80, the most recent 5 periods (P14-P18) show an average of 64.2 units/period (101, 113, 54, 28, 25). Lead time remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.3. To prevent stockouts while acknowledging the lower demand trend and avoiding excessive holding costs (since profit = holding cost), I am setting L to 2.3 (explicit) and mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods involving the last 5 samples to reflect the current downward volatility accurately.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Effective pipeline inventory is only 36 units; orders from Period 2 (118) and Period 6 (170) are permanently lost. Demand has reached a new low floor, averaging ~64 units over the last 5 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and low demand elasticity. Analysis of the history shows that orders from Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (170 units) are permanently lost (18 and 14 periods overdue respectively), making the effective pipeline inventory only 36 units (ordered Period 15). Demand has entered a severe downward regime: the last five periods (P15-P19) average ~47 units/period, but the most recent three periods (P17-P19) average only ~23 units. We must adjust parameters to account for the actual lead time (avg ~2.4) and the current low demand floor to prevent massive over-ordering if the backend assumes original demand levels. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.5 service level target mathematically, but practically we need to avoid excess stock of a declining product), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the sharp decline while maintaining some protection against demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand has collapsed to a new floor, averaging ~47 units over the last 5 periods and ~23 over the last 3; orders from P2 and P6 (288 units total) are definitively lost and must be ignored when calculating pipeline protection.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 Context: Demand has entered a severe downward regime, averaging ~47 units over the last 5 periods and dropping to an average of ~20 over the last 3 periods (P18-P20). Combined with the initial game history (Samples 1-5 mean ~92), the demand volatility is extremely high. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is listed as 324 units, but significant correction is required: orders from P2 (118) and P6 (170) are confirmed lost (now 19 and 15 periods overdue respectively). The only reliable item in the pipeline is the P15 order (36 units). Lead time remains volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, so I will use an explicit L of 3 to ensure protection during these longer arrival gaps. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (average ~20) to reflect the current collapsed floor, and sigma_hat using an explicit value of 40 to account for high relative volatility during this regime shift. These parameters aim to ensure the backend recognizes that current pipeline protection is dangerously low (only 36 units) against even this diminished demand, likely triggering a small defensive order.

Carry-over insight: Demand has collapsed further to a floor of ~20 units/period (average P18-P20: 20.3) from the previous ~64; In-transit values are misleading: P2 and P6 orders (288 units total) are definitively lost and current reliable pipeline is only 36 units (ordered P15).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has significantly collapsed, with the last 4 periods (P18-P21) averaging 24.75 units, down from historic 110+. The current in-transit inventory of 324 units is misleading because 288 units are confirmed as definitively lost (ordered in Period 2 and Period 6). The actual reliable pipeline only consists of 36 units ordered in Period 15, which are now 7 periods overdue but might still arrive given the lead-time volatility observed. On-hand inventory is currently 0. I will set the lead time to an explicit 3 periods to account for the upper end of the observed volatility. mu_hat will be set to an explicit value based on the new demand floor (~25 units) across the (L+1=4) review window, totaling 100 units. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the high relative variability in these low-demand numbers. This ensures the OR engine accounts for the 'lost' pipeline and orders enough to reset the on-hand inventory to meet the new, lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains at a new low floor (avg ~25 units/period over P18-P21); Pipeline inventory is comprised mostly of lost shipments (P2, P6), with only 36 units (P15) potentially recoverable.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0 and a misleading in-transit total of 324 units. Analysis from Carry-over Insights confirms that orders from Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (170 units) are permanently lost (over 15 periods overdue), totaling 288 units that will never arrive. The only valid pipeline inventory is the 36 units ordered in Period 15, which is now 8 periods old; given the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods, this order is also highly suspect but remains the only potentially 'active' shipment. Total demand has shifted significantly downward starting around Period 11, moving from ~117 to a current low-demand floor. Over the last 5 periods (P18-P22), demand has averaged 28.6 units/period (25, 16, 20, 38, 44), showing a slight recovery from the absolute floor of ~20. To recover from the stockout while acknowledging the lower demand regime and the unreliability of 'in-transit' data, I am setting L=3 (the historical maximum) to provide more protection. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility (28.6 avg) while ignoring the abandoned 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline via high base-stock targeting.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: The 36-unit order from Period 15 is now 8 periods overdue and likely lost, joining the P2 and P6 orders; total lost inventory in the 'In-Transit' view is likely 324 units (effectively zero reliable pipeline). Demand is stabilizing in a new low regime averaging ~29 units over the last 5 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 324 units in-transit, but historical evidence strongly suggests these orders (from Period 2, 6, and 15) are permanently lost, as they are now between 8 and 22 periods overdue. On-hand inventory is 0, and because the OR backend includes all 'in-transit' units in its pipeline calculation, it will erroneously believe no new orders are necessary. Demand has stabilized in a low-volume regime since Period 18, with the last 6 periods (P18-P23) averaging approximately 29.6 units per period. To force the OR backend to place a new order despite the phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to explicit values that exceed the 324-unit 'ghost' inventory. Specifically, I set mu_hat to 450 (which covers the phantom 324 units plus approx 4 periods of demand at the current rate) and sigma_hat to 100 to ensure the base stock calculation triggers an order of sufficient size to reach customers safely given the high lead-time volatility (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 24, the entire 'In-transit' quantity of 324 units is confirmed as lost (orders from P2, P6, P15). Demand remains in a low regime, averaging ~30 units/period over the last 6 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 13, with an average of approximately 34.5 units over the last 12 periods (P13-P24). The most recent 3 periods (P22-P24) show an average of 36.6. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this current low-demand floor (avg ~37) while balancing volatility. Regarding inventory: The 'In-transit' figure of 450 units is extremely misleading. Carry-over insights confirm that orders from P2 (118), P6 (170), and P15 (36) are lost, totaling 324 units. This leaves a reliable pipeline of 126 units (ordered P24), which is already reflected in the OR backend's logic once we correct for the phantom inventory. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 324 lost units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Usually, mu_hat = (1+L) * demand. With L=3 (observed max) and demand=37, mu_hat should be ~148. However, to account for the 324 lost units that the OR engine thinks are coming, I will set mu_hat = 148 + 324 = 472. This compensates for the 'ghost' inventory. L is set to 3 to reflect the high end of observed lead times and provide a safety buffer against volatility.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26, the demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low regime following several shifts. The average demand since Period 19 is approximately 29 units per period. The inventory situation is critical: the current 'In-transit' quantity of 472 units is largely illusory. Specifically, 324 units (ordered in P2, P6, and P15) are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights and extreme lead-time delays. Only the orders from P24 (126 units) and P25 (22 units) are considered reliable pipeline, totaling 148 units. With actual lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.4), the OR backend needs parameters reflecting the current low demand floor (~29 units) and the volatility in delivery. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the stable low demand since Period 19, and L to 'calculate' to account for historical volatility. Because profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the engine will target the median demand (z=0) to minimize total cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed reliable pipeline inventory includes only orders from P24 (126) and P25 (22); all previous 'In-transit' totaling 324 units (P2, P6, P15) are considered permanently lost. Demand remains stable in the low regime averaging ~29 units/period since P19.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a lower floor, averaging approximately 31.7 units over the last 8 periods (P19-P26: 16, 20, 38, 44, 35, 31, 28, 34). I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 samples (N=8) to reflect this current stability. The 'In-transit' count of 472 is highly misleading. It includes 324 units from orders P2 (118), P6 (170), and P15 (36) which are confirmed as lost shipments based on historical 'conclude' patterns and the length of time since ordering. Only the orders from P24 (126 units) and P25 (22 units) totaling 148 units are reliable. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (total in-transit) to calculate orders; since it cannot distinguish lost units, I must counteract this by over-estimating parameters or setting an explicit L that triggers ordering. However, to stay within the OR logic and minimize holding cost risks given the low demand, I will set L to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the volatile but generally longer actual lead time observed (avg ~2.4) and mu_hat to recent_N (N=8) to capture the low-demand regime. This keeps a low base stock to reflect the low demand environment while acknowledging the pipeline is likely non-responsive.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28, the on-hand inventory remains 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 472 units is largely composed of lost shipments. Based on history, orders from P2 (118), P6 (170), and P15 (36) are confirmed as permanently lost, totaling 324 units. The only reliable pipeline consists of the order from P24 (126 units) and P25 (22 units), totaling 148 units. The P24 order is now 4 periods old; given the historical lead time varies between 1 and 3 periods, this shipment is potentially overdue or lost. Demand has stabilized at a low regime since Period 19, with an average of approximately 34 units/period over the last 5 periods (P23-P27). To prevent continued stockouts caused by the unreliable pipeline, I will set L to 3 (the upper bound of observed actual lead times) and use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand stability while maintaining enough inventory to satisfy the next (L+1) cycles.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Reliable pipeline inventory (148 units from P24, P25) is now under scrutiny as the P24 order is 4 periods overdue; the original 324 units (P2, P6, P15) remain lost. Demand regime is stable at ~34 units/period.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 29. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 472 units is highly misleading: history confirms that orders from Period 2 (118), Period 6 (170), and Period 15 (36) are permanently lost, totaling 324 units. Additionally, the order from Period 24 (126 units) is now 5 periods overdue based on a lead time of 2-3, suggesting it is also likely lost or severely delayed. The only reliable recent order is from Period 25 (22 units). Demand has stabilized in a low regime since Period 19, with the last 10 periods averaging ~33 units/period (P19-P28). Due to the high failure rate of shipments (lost orders from P2, P6, P15, and potentially P24), the 'In-transit' view used by the OR backend will grossly overestimate protection. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and L to force the system to order despite the 'ghost' inventory. I set L to 3 (the upper end of observed lead times) and mu_hat to cover 4 periods of demand (1+L) at the current rate of 33 units/period (total 132). I set sigma_hat to 20 to account for recent demand volatility (range 16-44).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 29, the order from Period 24 (126 units) is 5 periods overdue and likely lost, joining P2, P6, and P15 (totaling 450 lost units in 'In-transit'). Reliable pipeline is effectively near zero.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low regime, averaging approximately 34 units per period since Period 24 (samples: 31, 28, 34, 41, 37, 33). The current in-transit inventory of 472 units is deceptive. Cumulative analysis indicates that shipments from Period 2 (118), Period 6 (170), Period 15 (36), and now Period 24 (126) are highly likely lost, as they are between 6 and 28 periods overdue. The only potentially reliable inventory in transit is the 22 units ordered in Period 25. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory (472) from the calculated base stock, it will likely place zero orders unless parameters are adjusted. To circumvent this, I am setting mu_hat to 500 (explicit) to force the OR backend's base stock calculation (mu_hat + safety stock) above the 472 units of ghost inventory. This ensures a small replenishment order is triggered to satisfy the current demand regime (~34/period) while accounting for the lost units. L is set to 3 to reflect the longest confirmed lead time observed.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 30, the order from Period 24 (126 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed as lost, joining P2, P6, and P15; total lost 'In-transit' inventory is 450 units. Demand is stable at ~34 units/period (P24-P29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a low mean of approximately 34 units per period (based on the last 7 periods, P24-P30). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 500 units is highly unreliable; history shows that orders from P2 (118), P6 (170), P15 (36), and P24 (126) are long overdue (6+ periods past promised lead time) and likely lost. The only reliable 'pipeline' consists of the 22 units ordered in P25 and 28 units ordered in P30. However, even the P25 order is now 6 periods overdue, suggesting a systematic failure in delivery. Because the OR backend relies on pipeline inventory to reduce order quantities, and 450 units are likely phantom inventory, I must use 'explicit' methods to force replenishment. Since lead time varies between 1 and 3 periods (last confirmed arrival was P12), I will set L to 2. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*34 = 102. sigma_hat is set based on a standard deviation of 5 around the mean, scaled by sqrt(1+L), leading to ~8.7. This aggressive setting targets a base stock of ~110, which will trigger an order to attempt to cover the stockout, as the OR backend will subtract the (misleading) in-transit total from its calculation.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 31, 450 units of in-transit inventory (from orders P2, P6, P15, P24) are confirmed as lost due to being significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3. Demand remains stable in a low regime averaging 34 units/period since Period 24.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by severe supply chain unreliability and a stabilized low-demand regime. Analysis of 'In-transit' shows 500 units, but 450 of these (from P2, P6, P15, and P24) are confirmed lost as they are many periods past the maximum observed lead time of 3. The P24 order (126 units) is now 8 periods overdue and definitively lost. Consequently, the reliable pipeline consists only of orders from P25 (22 units) and P30 (28 units), totaling 50 units. Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 34 units/period over the last 8 periods (P24-P31: 31, 28, 34, 41, 37, 33, 27, 33). To ensure serviceability given the stock-out status, mu_hat is set using recent_N=8 to reflect this current regime. L is set to a calculated average to account for the historical volatility between 1 and 3 periods, while sigma_hat is set via recent_N=8 to capture recent variance. The OR backend needs to place orders to cover the current demand regime while recognizing that the bulk of 'In-transit' inventory will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 24 (126 units) is officially confirmed lost (8 periods overdue), joining P2, P6, and P15; total reliable pipeline is 50 units (P25, P30).

The 'In-transit' count of 500 units includes 450 units from P2, P6, P15, and P24 that are significantly overdue (8+ periods) and confirmed as lost based on the 3-period maximum observed lead time. The only potentially viable pipeline units are from P25 (22 units) and P30 (28 units). Demand has stabilized in a low regime since Period 24, with a mean of ~32 units over the last 9 periods (P24-P32). Given lead time volatility (1-3 periods), I set L to 3 and use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new stable low-demand environment. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high probability that only 50 units of the reported 500 'In-transit' units will ever arrive, prompting the OR engine to order enough to cover the service level requirement without over-ordering based on ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 33, the reliable pipeline is only 50 units (P25, P30); 450 units in 'In-transit' (P2, P6, P15, P24) are confirmed lost. Demand regime (P24-P32) is stable at ~32 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, we face a critical inventory shortage. Demand has stabilized at a low floor: the last 10 periods average 30.2 units/period (P24-P33). However, the system's 'In-transit' view of 500 units is highly misleading. History confirms that orders from P2 (118), P6 (170), P15 (36), and P24 (126) are significantly overdue (max observed lead time is 3) and are definitively lost, totaling 450 units. The only reliable pipeline inventory consists of the P25 (22 units) and P30 (28 units) orders, totaling 50 units. Since on-hand is 0 and we haven't seen an arrival in 21 periods, we must place a new order to meet the current demand regime. I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the OR backend's (L+1) calculation covers enough demand. mu_hat is set to roughly 125 (representing (L+1) * ~31 units/period), and sigma_hat is set to 20 to account for recent demand volatility (std \u2248 10 * sqrt(4)). This will trigger an order that accounts for the fact that 450 units of the pipeline are effectively non-existent.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system shows 500 units in-transit. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights, 450 of these units are confirmed lost (from P2, P6, P15, and P24). The remaining 50 units (ordered in P25 and P30) are the only potentially reliable pipeline inventory. Demand has stabilized into a low regime starting around P24; the average demand from P24 to P34 is approximately 29.5 units/period. For Period 35, I am forecasting based on this stable low-demand period (N=11). Since the OR backend uses a shared base-stock calculation for (1+L) periods, I set mu_hat to explicitly cover 3 periods of demand (L=2 promised + 1 review period) at the 29.5 rate to ensure adequate stock without over-ordering relative to the high holding cost. I maintain L at 'calculate' to reflect the volatile history (1-3 periods).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, the on-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit inventory of 500 units is comprised of confirmed lost shipments: Period 2 (118), Period 6 (170), Period 15 (36), Period 24 (126), and Period 25 (22). All these orders are significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods (the most recent, P25, is now 11 periods overdue). Period 30 (28 units) is also 6 periods overdue. I officially consider the reliable pipeline inventory to be 0. Demand has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 24, with an average of approximately 31.5 units per period. Since all previous stock is lost and on-hand is zero, the goal is to trigger an order that covers the volatile lead time (max 3) plus review period. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent shipping failures and use recent_N (N=12) for demand to capture the current stable floor (~31 units/period).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 36, all 500 units of 'In-transit' inventory (orders from P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, and P30) are confirmed lost, as they are all at least 6 periods overdue (double the max observed lead time). Demand remains stable in a low regime, averaging 31.5 units/period since Period 24.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' count of 500 units is entirely composed of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P30), as the most recent of these is now 6 periods overdue (double the max observed lead time of 3). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has remained in a stable low regime since Period 24, with an average of approximately 31 units per period (last 5 periods: 33, 28, 10, 32, 44, 10; average ~26). To trigger a new order from the OR backend while bypassing the 500 'In-transit' units that the backend incorrectly views as valid pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' level that exceeds 500 + (base stock safety margin). Specifically, 3 periods of coverage (L=2 + 1) at 31 units/period is ~93 units. Adding the 500 lost units requires an explicit mu_hat of approximately 600 to ensure the backend places an order. I will use 'calculate' for L to acknowledge the historical 1-3 period variance, and set sigma_hat based on the recent stable period (N=13, from P24 onwards) to manage volatility.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-volume regime since Period 24, with an average demand of approximately 31 units per period (P24-P37). Currently, the 'In-transit' quantity of 600 units is highly misleading: 500 units from orders at P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, and P30 are at least 8 periods overdue and are confirmed as lost. Only the order from P37 (100 units) is potentially reliable, though its arrival is not yet confirmed. Given the extreme reliability issues with the supply chain and the consistent demand near 31, I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=14 (P24-P37) to capture this stable low floor. For lead time, I will use an explicit value of 3, the maximum observed successful lead time, to allow the OR backend to build sufficient safety stock against further delivery delays, while acknowledging that the pipeline inventory used in the backend calculation must be effectively discounted by the lost 500 units.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 38, total lost 'In-transit' inventory has increased to 500 units (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P30) all of which are \u22658 periods overdue. Only the P37 order is considered live. Demand is settled in a low regime averaging ~31 units/period since Period 24.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 31 units per period since Period 24. Currently, the system shows 600 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms that 500 of these units (from orders P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, and P30) are lost as they are significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. Only the 100 units ordered in Period 37 are considered 'live' pipeline inventory. To ensure the OR backend places a necessary replenishment order, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the stable low-demand window (last 15 periods, N=15) and using 'explicit' L=3 to reflect the maximum realistic lead time. By understating L in the backend, we force the base stock calculation to effectively ignore the ghost 'In-transit' units that exceed the likely lead-time window.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-volume regime, averaging approximately 18.6 units/period over the last 3 periods (P37-P39) and ~25.5 units/period since Period 33. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 600 units is highly unreliable; history shows 500 units (from P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P30) are significantly overdue (6+ periods) and must be treated as permanently lost. Only the order from Period 37 (100 units) is considered live and is currently within its expected delivery window (L=3). To recover from the stockout while acknowledging the lost shipments, I will set mu_hat based on the recent lower demand floor (last 7 periods, N=7, to capture the ~25 units/period trend) and use an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the upper bound of observed successful deliveries. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient for the 4-period window (L+1) without over-ordering for a demand regime that has clearly downshifted.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 40, 500 units of in-transit inventory (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P30) are confirmed lost. Only P37 (100 units) is live. Demand regime since P33 has averaged ~25.5 units/period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment continues to suffer from extreme logistical instability and a significant downward shift in demand. All 'In-transit' inventory from Period 30 and earlier (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P30), totaling 500 units, is officially confirmed lost as they are at least 10 periods overdue (promised lead time is 2, historical max was 3). The order from Period 37 (100 units) is currently 3 periods overdue, making it borderline reliable, but it represents the only potentially 'live' pipeline inventory besides new orders. Demand has collapsed further, averaging approximately 18.2 units/period over the last 8 periods (P33-P40) and only 14.3 units/period over the last 3. I will set the demand forecast using a recent window of N=8 to capture this lower regime (\u03bc \u2248 18.2). Lead time remains volatile but historically averages around 2.4 when it actually arrives; I will use L=2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering, as explicit values would inflate the base stock calculation while the inventory is at high risk of loss.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Average demand decreased from ~34 to ~18.2 units/period (-46%). Total lost in-transit inventory remains at 500 units (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P30).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 33, from an average of ~34 to ~21 units/period (average P33-P41). Period 41 saw a spike to 51, which may be transient but warrants caution. The in-transit inventory of 600 units is highly misleading: 500 units (from P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P30) are confirmed lost as they are significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. Only the P37 order of 100 units is potentially 'live', though it is currently 5 periods overdue (P41 conclude confirms it hasn't arrived), suggesting it might also be lost. Given on-hand is 0, I will set L to 'calculate' (which returns the historical avg lead time of ~2.4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 (P33-P41) to capture the current lower demand floor while reflecting the recent spike. Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit quantity (600) from the base stock, and the base stock for this low demand will be much lower than 600, the system will not place new orders unless I use the 'explicit' method to override the pipeline logic or wait for the system to reconcile. However, since I cannot modify the backend's pipeline subtraction directly, I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat to force a high enough base stock to trigger an order, accounting for the 500 lost units effectively acting as a permanent deficit.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 600 includes 500 units from older orders (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P30) which are all 12+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. Only the order from P37 (100 units) is potentially live, though it is now 6 periods overdue relative to the promised lead time of 2 (max observed was 3), suggesting it too may be lost. Demand has stabilized in a very low regime; since Period 33, demand has averaged ~25.5 units/period, but more recently (P37-P42) it has averaged ~24.5 units/period with high volatility (range 8-51). Lead time is treated as 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the maximum observed successful lead time, though reliability is extremely poor. We set mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture this low demand floor (~27 units * (1+3) = 110) and use explicit sigma_hat to account for the high variance seen in recent spikes (e.g., P41 demand of 51). The OR backend will see 600 units in transit, but since 500 are known lost, we must set parameters such that it orders enough to cover demand despite this ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 43, 600 units in 'In-transit' are likely lost; previous 500 units (P2-P30) are 13+ periods overdue, and the P37 order (100 units) is 6 periods overdue (double max observed). Demand remains in a low, volatile regime averaging ~25 units/period since Period 33.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low, volatile regime since Period 33, averaging approximately 25 units per period. The inventory situation is critical: the In-transit figure of 600 units is entirely composed of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P30, and now P37, which is 6 periods overdue\u2014double the max observed lead time). With zero reliable on-hand and zero reliable pipeline, a new order is necessary to attempt to capture remaining demand. I am setting L=3 to reflect the maximum observed lead time, given the unreliability of the supply chain. mu_hat is set based on the recent regime (P33-P43 average), and sigma_hat is set explicitly to account for the high variance observed in this low-demand state (e.g., jumps from 8 to 51). By treating the 600 units as lost, the OR engine will trigger a new order to cover the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 44, the 100-unit order from Period 37 is 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost, bringing the total lost in-transit inventory to 600 units. Reliable pipeline is zero.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by severe supply chain disruption and a significant downward shift in demand. The promised lead time of 2 periods is unreliable, with actual lead times observed at 1 or 3 periods historically, and more recently, widespread order losses. All 600 units currently 'In-transit' (from orders P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P30, and P37) are confirmed lost, as their delay exceeds double the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. Consequently, the reliable pipeline is zero. On the demand side, a new regime was established around Period 33, averaging approximately 24.5 units per period over the last 12 periods (P33-P44). To restore service while accounting for lead time volatility and lost shipments, I am setting L explicitly to 3 (the upper bound of observed successful deliveries). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 periods (recent_N=12) to capture this lower, volatile demand floor. The backend's base stock calculation will now trigger an order to cover the next 4 periods (L+1) from a zero inventory position.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 600 units in-transit (orders from P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P30, and P37). Based on the history, the maximum successful lead time observed was 3 periods. All 600 units are now at least 8 periods overdue (P37 was ordered in Period 37, it is now Period 46), making them effectively lost. Real inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 reliable pipeline. Demand has been highly volatile in a low regime since Period 33, ranging from 8 to 53. Over the last 5 periods (P41-P45), demand averaged 38 units. Over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), it averaged 28 units. Given the high probability of shipment failure (0 arrivals since Period 12), the OR parameters must compensate for the 'lost' pipeline. Setting L=3 (max observed) and using a recent 10-period window for demand (N=10) to capture current low-level volatility. This setup will prompt the OR backend to place a new order to rebuild the stock level, ignoring the 600 units of 'phantom' pipeline.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 46, all 600 units in-transit (P2 through P37) are confirmed as lost due to being at least 8+ periods overdue; reliable pipeline is zero. Demand regime since Period 33 is volatile with a mean of ~27 units/period.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low, volatile regime since Period 33, averaging approximately 27 units per period. The last five periods (P42-P46) show slightly higher volatility (mean ~32). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=14 to capture the behavior since P33. For lead time, while promised is 2, historical observations from successful deliveries (P4, P7, P8, P9, P12) showed a range of 1-3 periods, with 3 being frequent. I will use L=3 to ensure the inventory position covers a realistic worst-case scenario. Regarding the 'In-transit' quantity of 600 units, all individual orders (from P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P30, and P37) are at least 10 periods overdue, whereas the maximum observed lead time was 3. Consequently, the reliable pipeline inventory is zero. Since the OR backend subtracts the full 600 units from the target base stock, it will not place any orders unless I provide an explicit mu_hat that overrides the perceived pipeline or the base stock calculation exceeds 600 (unlikely for this SKU). Given the game is ending in 4 periods (P50), and the lead time is ~3, an order placed now is the last one likely to arrive. To force an order that covers the remaining demand despite the ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current deficit.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues in a volatile low regime. Since Period 33, demand has averaged approx 27 units per period. In-transit inventory currently shows 720 units. However, based on the historical logs and carry-over insights, 600 of these units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P30, and P37) are confirmed lost as they are all at least 10 periods overdue (drastically exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3). The only live order in the pipeline is from Period 47 (120 units). Given the target to maximize profit and account for the high potential of lost shipments, I will setting the lead time (L) parameter to 3 to reflect the historical maximum and setting mu_hat based on the recent 14-period window (P33-P47) where demand averaged ~26 units/period to ensure the OR engine targets an appropriate base stock for the current regime. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to capture the significant volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 48, 600 units of 'In-transit' inventory (all orders prior to P47) are confirmed as permanently lost. Reliable pipeline consists only of the P47 order (120 units). Demand regime since P33 remains volatile but stable around a mean of 27 units/period.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 33 remains volatile with a mean of approximately 27 units/period (last 16 periods average ~26.7). The in-transit inventory of 720 units is almost entirely composed of lost shipments: 600 units from orders prior to Period 47 (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P30, P37) are confirmed lost due to being severely overdue (minimum 11 periods for P37, much longer for others). The only reliable pipeline inventory is the 120 units ordered in Period 47, which is currently at lead_time=2 and should arrive in the upcoming periods. With on-hand at 0 and reliable pipeline at 120, and given the game is at Period 49/50, these 120 units (covering ~4.4 periods of demand) are sufficient to cover the final two periods of the simulation. No further orders are required, as the existing reliable pipeline already exceeds the remaining expected demand, and any new order would likely arrive after the game ends or simply contribute to holding costs.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to oscillate in a low-volume, high-volatility regime. Over the last 17 periods (P33-P49), the mean demand is approximately 28 units/period. The current 'In-transit' of 720 units is almost entirely composed of lost shipments: 600 units from P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P30, and P37 are significantly overdue (6+ periods since the last order, far exceeding the max observed lead time of 3). The only potentially viable order is the 120 units from P47, making the reliable pipeline 120. In-transit data is highly misleading, so I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=17) to capture the current stable-but-volatile low-demand regime. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average historical lead time of successful arrivals (~2.4), while recognizing that the risk of total order loss is high. The backend uses these to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand; given the service level (q=0.5 since profit=holding), the set parameters aim to maintain availability without excess inventory, as long as orders actually arrive.
