Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a balanced profit-to-holding-cost ratio (1:1). Historical demand over the first 5 periods shows an average of 88.2 units per period (109, 68, 99, 80, 105). The promised lead time (L) is 2. To ensure we cover demand during the review period (1) plus the lead time (2), we need to forecast for (1+L) = 3 periods. Calculating mu_hat using the mean of the 5 samples: 3 * 88.2 = 264.6. Calculating sigma_hat: sqrt(3) * std_dev(109, 68, 99, 80, 105) \u2248 1.732 * 17.61 \u2248 30.5. Since we have no on-hand inventory or in-transit orders, we must initialize the pipeline. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the available history for demand and the default promised lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory, ordered 122 units (promising a lead time of 2 periods), and faced a demand of 146 units. Since on-hand was 0, zero sales were recorded, and ending inventory remained 0. The promised lead time is 2, meaning the order placed in Period 1 (122 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 4 start observation. Current pipeline (in-transit) is 122. History shows demand for 6 periods (including the provided sample and Period 1): [109, 68, 99, 80, 105, 146]. The mean of these 6 samples is ~101.17. With a lead time L=2, the total demand to cover is for (L+1) = 3 periods. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the includes-Period-1 demand data. Standard deviation for these 6 samples is ~26.4. The OR backend will use these to calculate base_stock using the critical ratio (Profit 1.0 / (Profit 1.0 + Holding 1.0) = 0.5), which results in a z-score of 0. L is set to default (2).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (122 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (after this decision). Historically, we have 5 demand samples (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) with an average of 92.2 and a standard deviation of 17.1. Currently, on-hand is 0 and pipeline inventory is 268 (122 from P1 + 146 from P2). Since the system is in its early stages and no deliveries have concluded yet, I will use 'default' for lead time and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the most relevant baseline. The profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a critical ratio q = 0.5, where the OR backend will aim for the median demand to minimize total cost.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (122 units), Period 2 (146 units), and Period 3 (39 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the Period 4 start observation. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0 for chips(Regular). This suggests either a lead time delay or a lost shipment. Since it is only one period past the expected arrival of the first order, I will maintain the promised lead time of 2 for now but monitor closely. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced 3 periods of stockouts (0 units sold vs demand). The average demand over the first 5 historical samples provided in the prompt was 92.2, while the demand during the first 3 active game periods has been 146, 81, and 108 (average 111.6). I will use a recent_N of 5 to balance the initial data with the higher recent observations to ensure mu_hat covers the (L+1) window effectively.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 146, 81, 108, 72, 105 (Average: 102.4, Std: 28.5). Note that the demand data provided in the prompt's 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) slightly differs from the 'GAME HISTORY' section; I will prioritize the GAME HISTORY for decision making as it reflects actual inventory impacts. Lead Time Analysis: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3). Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times are volatile (range 1-3). Current inventory: On-hand=89, In-transit=151 (from P2, P4, P5). Total Pipeline=240. Given the high volatility in lead times and the fact that we just experienced a stock-out in the first 3 periods, I will set L to the promised 'default' of 2 for the OR engine but use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the latest mean. Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, implying a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105 (average 92.2). However, looking at the 'Period conclude' logs, the realized demand was 146, 81, 108, 72, 69 (average 95.2). The current on-hand inventory is 20, and 219 units are in transit. Regarding lead time: the Period 4 conclude shows an order from P1 arriving in 3 periods (drifted from 2) and an order from P3 arriving in 1 period (shorter than 2). This high variance in lead time suggests 'calculate' is best for L. For demand (mu_hat), the last 5 samples are stable, so I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the mean. For sigma_hat, the variance is moderate, so I will also use recent_N of 5. The backend will set the base stock level to cover current demand and the inventory gap, while the cap prevents over-ordering during lead-time fluctuations.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 7. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 361 in-transit. Historic demand for the 6 concluded periods is: 146, 81, 108, 72, 69, 74 (Mean \u2248 91.7). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times show variability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (P4). Period 2 (ordered P2) is currently overdue as it has been 4 periods (P2 to P6) without appearing in a 'conclude' message, suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. Because demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the initial peak (average of last 3 periods is 71.7), I will use recent_N=3 for demand parameters to avoid over-ordering while account for the lead time uncertainty. I'll use L=calculate to let the system average the observed (1 and 3) lead times, resulting in L=2.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a profit and holding cost of $1.0 each, suggesting a target service level of 50%. Historical demand for 7 periods (146, 81, 108, 72, 69, 74, 98) averages 92.6 units. Lead times have been volatile: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period, and Period 4 arrived in 3 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but the actual average is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have 356 units in transit (orders from P2, P5, P6). Specifically, the P2 order (146 units) is now 6 periods old, well beyond the promised 2 and the observed max of 3, suggesting it may be lost. To protect against this uncertainty and the 0 on-hand state, I will set L to 3 (observed max) and use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture recent volatility. This will increase the base stock calculation to account for longer lead times and current stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand across the last 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 91.75 units (146, 81, 108, 72, 69, 74, 98, 86). Lead time observation: promised is 2, but actual observed values are 3 periods (P1 order arrived P4, P4 order arrived P7, P5 order arrived P8) and one anomaly of 1 period (P3 order arrived P4). The order from Period 2 (146 units) has still not arrived after 7 periods and is likely lost. The total in-transit is 288 units, which matches P2(146) + P6(142). If P2 is lost, our effective pipeline is only 142 units. I will set lead time (L) to 3 based on the consistent recent arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current demand distribution across the (L+1) horizon. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock target and place an order to replenish inventory, considering the current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consistently observed as 3 periods (based on P1, P4, and P5 deliveries). Order placed in Period 2 (146 units) is likely lost as it has been 7 periods with no 'conclude' message.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) consistently show a lead time of 3 periods, with the exception of one fluke (P3->P4). The order from Period 2 (146 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is confirmed lost; it should be discounted from the pipeline. Current on-hand is 0. Demand across the first 9 periods averages 93.2 units, with a standard deviation of 24.3. Given the Lead Time (L) is effectively 3, the OR backend needs to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. I will set L to 3 explicitly. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of all 9 samples (approx 93.2 * 4 = 372.8). For sigma_hat, I will use the standard deviation of all samples (24.3 * sqrt(4) = 48.6). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the actual 3-period delay and the lost inventory gap.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. Historical analysis confirms a lead-time shift: while the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time observed across Period 4, 7, and 8 confirms a working lead time of 3 periods. The order from Period 2 (146 units) is now 9 periods old with no 'conclude' message, confirming it is lost; consequently, the pipeline inventory of 372 reflects only the orders from P6 (142), P9 (79), P10 (5), and potentially P11, minus the missing shipment. Demand has stabilized after an initial high (P1-P3). Mean demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is 92.6 units. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the observed delivery pattern and using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-initial-spike demand regime while accounting for the (1+L) planning horizon.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Confirmed Period 2 order (146 units) is lost (9 periods since order). Demand mean for periods 6-10 is ~93 units, lower than the initial average of ~112.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently zero with 372 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, and P8), except for a single anomaly in P4. The order from Period 2 (146 units) is confirmed lost after 10 periods. The current in-transit pipeline (ordered in P6, P9, and P10) should start arriving in Period 12 or 13. Demand has been relatively stable; excluding for the lost-sales periods where 'demand' might be slightly inflated or varied, the last 6 periods (P6-P11) have an average demand of ~96 units. I will set the lead time (L) to 3 to reflect reality. Mu_hat will be set using the average demand of the last 6 periods scaled for (1+L), which is 96 * 4 = 384. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the actual lead time and prevents stockouts caused by the promised (but incorrect) lead time of 2.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (1 unit). The observed lead time remains unstable but leans towards 3 periods (P9 took 3, P10 took 2, P4/5 took 3). I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock covers a longer planning horizon. Demand analysis: the recent mean (P7-P12) is approximately 97.5. I'll use a recent window (N=6) to capture this current trend, which is lower than the initial startup phase but consistent. In-transit inventory (300 units) from P6 and recent periods is significant; however, P6 (142 units) is now 7 periods old and highly suspect for loss, similar to the P2 order. By setting L=3 and using recent demand, the OR backend's capped policy should order enough to maintain coverage while accounting for the high pipeline, though I suspect the P6 order will eventually be flagged as lost in future carry-overs if it doesn't arrive soon.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the on-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of the game history confirms a reliable lead time shift from the promised 2 periods to 3 periods (observed for orders from P1, P4, P5, and P9). The order from Period 2 (146 units) is confirmed lost. My previous assessment of the demand mean for periods 6-10 was ~93, and recent periods 12-13 show demand of 83 and 84, confirming a stabilization around 90-95 units. The current in-transit inventory is 389 units, which includes the order from P6 (142 units) that is now very late (8 periods) and likely lost. To ensure the OR backend accounts for the actual lead time and the likely loss of the P6 shipment, I am setting L to 3 explicitly. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 (covering periods 6-13) to capture the current lower demand regime (~92.4 avg), which helps avoid excessive holding costs in this high-cost environment ($1/unit). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Shipment from Period 6 (142 units) is likely lost (8 periods since order with no arrival). Lead time remains stable at 3 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we face zero on-hand inventory and an in-transit balance of 389 units. Based on historical data, shipments from Period 2 (146 units) and Period 6 (142 units) are definitively lost as they are 13 and 9 periods overdue, respectively. The effective in-transit pipeline is 101 units (P12: 12 units, P13: 89 units). The actual lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, P8, P12). Recent demand exhibits a significant spike in Period 14 (163 units) following a period of relative stability (~90 units). Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the backend targets a 50% service level; however, because the OR engine does not account for lost shipments, it will overstate the pipeline inventory. By setting L explicitly to 3 and calculating mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (P10-P14 avg \u2248 108.6, so 108.6 * (1+3) = 434.4), I ensure the target inventory level accounts for the recent demand increase and the longer lead time. I use explicit sigma to capture the high volatility seen in the last period (standard deviation of last 5 periods \u2248 31.8, scaled by sqrt(1+L) = 63.6).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 14 (163 units, +80% vs previous 5-period mean). Pipeline reconcile: confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (146 units) and Period 6 (142 units). Current active pipeline is 101 units.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, the on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports In-transit as 423 units. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, the orders from Period 2 (146 units) and Period 6 (142 units) are confirmed as lost, totaling 288 units. Subtracting these from the reported in-transit (423 - 288) leaves a 'real' pipeline of 135 units (comprising Period 13: 89 units and Period 15: 46 units). Lead time remains consistently at 3 periods (observed in most recent successful arrivals). Demand spiked in Period 14 (163) but returned to a lower level in Period 15 (69). Given the high loss rate of shipments and the frequent stockouts (ending inventory 0), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the actual lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the recent mean demand (approx 105 units) across the (1+L)=4 period window. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility, ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock to buffer against the high variability and unreliable supply chain.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the on-hand inventory is 74 units. The 'In-transit' count of 334 units is misleading due to lost shipments. Based on history, orders from Period 2 (146 units) and Period 6 (142 units) are definitively lost as they are 15 and 11 periods past their order dates respectively. Subtracting these (146 + 142 = 288) from the 334 in-transit leaves an active pipeline of 46 units (the Period 15 order). Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in most recent deliveries from P12 and P13). Demand has shown significant volatility lately (P14: 163, P15: 69, P16: 15). The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P7-P16) is approx 93.7 units. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the OR backend targets a 50% service level (the median of the demand distribution). Using L=3 (explicit) and mu_hat based on the last 10 samples (recent_N=10) will set the base stock to cover demand for 4 periods (L+1). This accounts for the lost shipments by informing the OR engine of a consistent 3-period lead time and current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Active pipeline reconciled: 288 units (P2 and P6) confirmed lost. Effective in-transit is 46 units.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we have an on-hand inventory of 50 units. The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 334 units. However, based on our carry-over insights, orders from Period 2 (146 units) and Period 6 (142 units) totaling 288 units are confirmed lost, as they are significantly past the observed lead time of 3 periods. This leaves an effective pipeline of 46 units (ordered Period 15), which are expected to arrive in Period 18 based on the stable 3-period lead time. Demand has been highly volatile recently (163, 69, 15, 24), but the long-term context suggests a mean of approx 90-100 units per period. I will set the lead time L to 3 (based on consistent observation) and use an explicit mu_hat reflecting (1+3) periods of demand at a mean of ~100 units to ensure the OR backend aims for enough stock to cover the pipeline gap caused by losses. sigma_hat is set to default to handle current volatility.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we have 21 units on hand and a reported in-transit of 350 units. However, previous insights confirm that orders from Period 2 (146 units) and Period 6 (142 units) are lost, totaling 288 units. The effective in-transit pipeline consists of Period 15 (46 units) and Period 18 (16 units), totaling 62 units. The observed lead time is consistently 3 periods, one period longer than the promised 2. Demand has significantly cooled in the last 3 periods (15, 24, 29) compared to the mid-game average. Analysis of the last 7 periods (P12-P18) shows a mean of approximately 58 units, though this is heavily skewed by a single spike in P14. Given the current low demand trend, I will use recent_N=7 to capture this deceleration while maintaining safety against volatility. I will set the lead time to 3 to reflect actual carrier performance, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the next 4 periods (L+1) using current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Mean demand for Periods 16-18 dropped significantly to 22.6 units (previously ~90). Lead time remains confirmed at 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a significantly lower regime since Period 16, averaging ~22.75 units over the last 4 periods (15, 24, 29, 23). This is a sharp drop from the previous average of ~90 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this low-demand state and avoid excessive inventory costs. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 3 periods (observed in most deliveries), while the promised time is 2. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 350 units according to the system, but history shows 288 units are lost (146 from Period 2 and 142 from Period 6). The OR backend's order calculation will subtract the pipeline (350) from the base stock. By setting mu_hat to the recent low average and L to 3 (explicitly), I am signaling a requirement for a much lower base stock level. Because the system's 'In-transit' count is inflated by lost orders, the OR engine might undershoot. I will use 'explicit' for L=3 to match reality and 'recent_N=4' for mu_hat to follow the new demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift persistent: Periods 16-19 average demand is 22.75 units (vs ~90 previous). Total lost shipments in pipeline is confirmed at 288 units (P2 and P6).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly downwards starting from Period 16. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 27.8 units, compared to the earlier average of ~90. Lead time remains stable at approximately 3 periods based on historical arrivals (P1, P4, P5, P9, P10, P12, P13). The 'In-transit' count of 350 includes 288 units from orders placed in P2 (146 units) and P6 (142 units) which are confirmed lost (20 and 15 periods elapsed respectively). The effective pipeline inventory is actually 62 units (350 total - 288 lost). On-hand inventory is 0. Using recent_N=5 for demand better reflects the current low-demand environment, while setting L explicitly to 3 account for the observed reliable lead time. This combination prevents the OR backend from over-ordering based on the high historical demand mean and ensures we don't hold excess inventory during this low-sales phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand regime shift remains sustained; mean demand for P16-P20 is 27.8 units (-70% vs start). Total confirmed lost shipments are 288 units (P2: 146, P6: 142). Effective pipeline is currently 62 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is approximately 28.5 units/period, a sharp decline from the previous average of ~90 units. The current inventory status shows 0 on-hand and an in-transit quantity of 350 units. However, I have identified that 288 units from Periods 2 and 6 are lost (146 + 142). This leaves an effective pipeline of 62 units (46 units ordered in P15 + 16 units ordered in P18). Lead time is consistently observed at 3 periods (with occasional variance). To prevent over-ordering during this low-demand regime and to account for the actual lead-time behavior, I am setting L to 3 and using the last 6 periods of historical demand to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a base stock that aligns with the current lower demand while the backend OR logic adjusts for the effective pipeline.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a much lower regime. For Periods 16-22, the average demand is 28 units, a significant drop from the early-game average of ~90 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total 'In-transit' quantity is 350 units, but 288 of these (146 from Period 2 and 142 from Period 6) are confirmed lost shipments. This leaves an effective pipeline of 62 units (from Period 15, 18, and potentially more recent unlisted orders). The actual lead time has consistently been 3 periods. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delivery lag. I am setting mu_hat using the recent 7 periods (P16-P22) where the mean is ~28 units, resulting in (1+L)*28 = 112. Sigma_hat is calculated using 'recent_N' over the same window to capture the reduced volatility of this lower-demand regime. This provides a target base stock that aligns with the new demand reality while discounting the ghost inventory in the pipeline.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time is consistently 3 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P1, P4, P5, P9, P10, P12, P13). Period 2 and Period 6 orders (146 and 142 units) are confirmed lost as they have exceeded the lead time by over 15 periods. The In-transit total of 350 units includes these 288 lost units, making the effective pipeline only 62 units (from orders in P15 and P18). Demand is in a sustained low-regime state starting at Period 16; the average demand from Period 16 to Period 23 is 29.1 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and effective pipeline at 62, the inventory is nearly exhausted. Setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for observations. I'll use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (Periods 16-23).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand for Periods 16-23 is 29.1 units (~70% reduction from start). Effective pipeline is 62 units; 288 units in total 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P2 and P6).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally starting at Period 16. For the last 9 periods (P16-P24), demand has averaged 29.8 units, a significant decrease from the early period average of ~90. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this lower volume for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Regarding the supply chain, the promised lead time is 2, but the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods based on majority of successful deliveries (P1, P4, P5, P9, P12, P13). The In-transit inventory is listed as 350 units; however, 288 of these units are from Period 2 (146) and Period 6 (142), which are now over 18 periods old and confirmed lost. The real pipeline inventory is 350 - 288 = 62 units (consisting of orders from P15 and P18). Lead time L is set to explicit value 3 to reflect the consistent reality, ensuring the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the extra period of risk.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift observed since Period 16 remains sustained, with an average demand of approximately 32 units over the last 10 periods (P16-P25). The last period (P25) showed a slight increase to 62, but the overall trend is much lower than the early game average. The primary challenge remains the pipeline inaccuracy. Total In-transit is reported as 350 units. However, based on history, orders from P2 (146 units) and P6 (142 units) are definitely lost (24 and 20 periods overdue, respectively). The current effective pipeline consists of P15 (46 units) and P18 (16 units), totaling 62 units. Lead time is stable at 3 periods. To prevent over-ordering due to the high reported 'In-transit' figure and the low current demand, I will set L to 3 and use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand environment (approx 128 units for review+lead window).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 26, the demand regime (P16-P25) average is 32.9 units. Total reported 'In-transit' of 350 includes 288 units from lost shipments (P2: 146, P6: 142). Effective pipeline is only 62 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27, the demand regime shift remains the primary driver of inventory policy. Since Period 16, demand has dropped from an initial mean of ~112 to an average of approximately 35.5 units (P16-P26: 15, 24, 29, 23, 48, 32, 25, 35, 37, 62, 59). In the last two periods (P25-P26), demand has shown a slight uptick (62, 59), so I am using N=11 (Periods 16-26) to capture this lower regime while remaining responsive to the recent minor increase. Lead time is set to an explicit value of 3 based on consistent historical arrivals (P4, P7, P8, P12, P15, P16). The 'In-transit' count of 350 is highly misleading: it includes 288 units from long-lost shipments (Period 2: 146 units and Period 6: 142 units). Additionally, orders from P15 (46 units) and P18 (16 units) are now significantly overdue (12 periods and 9 periods respectively), suggesting they are also lost. Effectively, the active pipeline is 0 units, and on-hand inventory is 0. My parameters (L=3, mu_hat based on recent_N=11) will signal the OR engine to place a new order to cover the (L+1)=4 period requirements (approx 4 * 35.5 = 142 units) to restart the flow of goods and reach the target base stock, while accounting for the \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc0c1 empty pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Shipments from Period 15 (46 units) and Period 18 (16 units) are now confirmed lost (12 and 9 periods overdue). Combined with P2 and P6, total lost units in reported 'In-transit' is 350. Effective pipeline is 0.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the system reports 350 units in 'In-transit'. However, based on tracking historical 'conclude' messages, all 350 units are confirmed lost: P2 (146 units), P6 (142 units), P15 (46 units), and P18 (16 units). None of these arrived within 3-4x the promised lead time of 2. Effective pipeline inventory is therefore 0. Since on-hand inventory is also 0, the OR backend must place a new order to meet current demand. The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16; the average demand for the last 12 periods (P16-P27) is approximately 33.5 units, which is much lower than the initial ~112 units. I will use N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume accurately. I set L to an explicit value of 3, as this has been the most consistent actual lead time observed. This configuration ensures the OR backend recognizes the lack of effective inventory and orders based on the current lower demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 16. The average demand for the most recent 13 periods (P16-P28) is approximately 34.6 units per period. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 350 units, but based on history, all 350 units are confirmed lost: P2 (146), P6 (142), P15 (46), and P18 (16). This means the effective pipeline is 0, and current on-hand inventory is 0. To restore service for the current demand level, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 13-period regime. I will use an explicit lead time of 3 periods, as established by the delivery history (P1, P4, P5, P9, P10, P12, P13). By accounting for the lost shipments (setting mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand while the backend sees 350 units in transit), I must ensure the order logic triggers despite the phantom pipeline. However, the OR backend logic 'order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)' will see the 350 units as real and potentially block new orders. To circumvent this, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline (350) + desired safety stock. Target base stock = (1+3) * 34.6 + z * sigma. With mean ~35, a base stock for 4 periods is ~140. Since 140 < 350, the backend will order 0. The only way to force an order is to set mu_hat explicitly high enough to overcome the 350-unit error while reflecting the real demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Total reported 'In-transit' of 350 units is entirely composed of lost shipments (P2: 146, P6: 142, P15: 46, P18: 16). Effective pipeline is 0. Demand for the current regime (P16-P28) averages 34.6 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. The average demand for the most recent 14 periods (P16-P29) is 36.1 units, compared to the initial ~100. Lead time has been consistently observed at 3 periods for successful deliveries. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 350 units is entirely comprised of lost shipments from Period 2 (146), Period 6 (142), Period 15 (46), and Period 18 (16). With on-hand inventory at 0 and an effective pipeline of 0, a new order must be placed immediately to meet the current demand regime. I will use 'explicit' for L to account for the observed 3-period lead time, and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=14 to capture the lower demand regime while filtering out the noise from the earlier higher-demand periods. This will help the backend compute a base stock that covers (3+1) periods of the current ~36 unit demand without being inflated by lost inventory or historical high-demand data.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 30, the demand regime (P16-P29) average is 36.1 units. Total reported 'In-transit' of 350 units is confirmed to be composed entirely of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18). Effective pipeline is 0 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31, the environment is characterized by a sustained lower demand regime and a significant quantity of lost shipments. Demand from Period 16 to Period 30 has stabilized at a much lower level (mean ~36 units) compared to the start of the simulation. This represents a 15-period consistent regime. The reported 'In-transit' of 350 units is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments: P2 (146), P6 (142), P15 (46), and P18 (16). This means the effective pipeline inventory is 0 units, but because the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock calculation, it will never order unless the target base stock exceeds 350. Since the current demand regime only suggests a base stock around 140-160 units (L=3, \u03bc\u224836), I must use 'explicit' method for mu_hat to force an order. I will set mu_hat to 350 + (1+L)*36 = 494. This offsets the 350 phantom units and targets a base stock that covers the lead time and review period for the current demand regime. Lead time is set to 3 periods based on consistent historical observations of concluded deliveries.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 31, the demand regime (P16-P30) average is 35.7 units. Total reported 'In-transit' of 350 units remains confirmed as lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18), resulting in an effective pipeline of 0.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is significantly lower than the start, averaging approximately 36 units per period. The reported 'In-transit' of 494 units includes 350 units confirmed lost from orders in Periods 2, 6, 15, and 18. This leaves an effective pipeline of 144 units (ordered in Period 31). The actual lead time is consistently 3 periods. I will set L to 3. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=16 (Periods 16-31) to capture this lower demand regime. Since q = 0.5 (Profit=1, Holding=1), the base stock will target the median of this regime's demand. Given on-hand is 0 and the effective pipeline is 144, the backend will determine if additional units are needed to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 32, the demand regime (P16-P31) average is 35.3 units. Total reported 'In-transit' of 494 units includes 350 units confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18), making the effective pipeline 144 units (from P31).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-98.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, the order placed in Period 31 (144 units) arrived with a lead time of 1 period, bringing on-hand inventory to 121. The total reported 'In-transit' of 350 units remains confirmed as lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, and P18), meaning the effective pipeline is currently 0. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 16; the mean demand for the 17-period regime (P16-P32) is approximately 34.6 units per period. Since profit equals holding cost ($1), the target service level is 50%, which is satisfied by setting the base stock to the mean demand over the review and lead time. Given the recent lead time of 1 and the established regime, I will use recent_N (N=17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume accurately. I will set L to 1 to reflect the most recent arrival speed, ensuring we don't over-order while maintaining sufficient stock for the next two periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed lead time of 1 period for most recent shipment (P31). Cumulative lost shipments in 'In-transit' total 350 units (P2, P6, P15, P18). Current demand regime (P16-P32) mean is 34.6 units.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime significantly shifted around Period 16, dropping from an average of ~80-100 units to a sustained lower level. Over the last 18 periods (P16-P33), the average demand is 36.1 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 350 units is confirmed to be composed entirely of lost shipments from periods 2, 6, 15, and 18, which have not arrived despite substantial lead time passing (9-30+ periods). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0 units. While the historical lead time was 3 periods, the most recent delivery (P31) arrived in only 1 period. To remain responsive to the lower demand while accounting for potential lead-time variability and the zero-effective pipeline, I am setting L=3 (to be conservative despite the recent fast arrival) and calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 18-period regime (N=18). This ensures the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the current demand level without being misled by the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time of 1 period for the most recent order (P31). The demand regime for P16-P33 is stable with a mean of 36.1 units. Effective pipeline remains 0 as the 350 units 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable with a mean of approximately 35.7 units (P16-P34). The current on-hand inventory is 43 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 350 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P2: 146, P6: 142, P15: 46, P18: 16). Consequently, the effective pipeline is 0 units. While the promised lead time is 2, the most recent successful delivery (P31, received in P32) arrived with a lead time of 1 period. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs given the current inventory, I will set L to 1 (based on the most recent observation) and use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) with N=19 to cover the entire stable regime since Period 16. This will allow the OR backend to target a base stock of roughly (1+1)*36 = 72 units. Subtracting the 43 on-hand units results in a suggested order of approximately 29 units, which is sustainable.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 16, with a more recent mean (P16-P35) of 36.6 units per period. The standard deviation in this regime is approximately 15.1. Lead time was most recently observed as 1 period (P31 order), although historically it has been 3. I will use L=1 to react to the most recent supply behavior. The total 'In-transit' of 350 units is confirmed lost (orders from P2, P6, P15, and P18), meaning the effective pipeline is 0. With 18 units on hand and a mean demand of ~36.6, a base stock targeting (L+1) periods (approx 73 units) is needed. Setting mu_hat using the last 20 periods (the stable regime) and sigma_hat similarly to ensure the OR backend covers current volatility without over-ordering due to the lost 'In-transit' units.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand regime for P16-P35 is stable with a mean of 36.6 units. All 350 units currently 'In-transit' (P2, P6, P15, P18) are confirmed lost; effective pipeline is 0.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 16-36 remains stable with a mean of approximately 36.9 units. The system reports 350 units 'In-transit', but these are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18) and must be mentally excluded from the pipeline as the OR backend cannot distinguish between active and lost shipments. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The most recent order (P31) arrived with a lead time of 1 period, suggesting a shift from the previous 3-period lead time. To ensure we order enough to cover the current demand regime while bypassing the 'lost inventory' in the backend's calculation, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)', and the backend sees 0 on-hand + 350 in-transit, I must set the base_stock high enough to overcome this 350-unit offset. Target base_stock (for L=2) = (1+2)*37 + 1.64*15*sqrt(3) \u2248 154 units. To trigger any order when the backend thinks we have 350 units, I must set mu_hat to approximately 350 + 154 = 504. Setting L=2 conservatively to account for variability, even though recent lead time was 1.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 16, with a mean observed demand of approximately 36 units. Recent periods have seen erratic lead times; however, the most recent arrival (P31) had a lead time of 1 period. Total 'In-transit' is reported as 504 units, but significant reconciling is required: 350 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18). The remaining 154 units (ordered in P37) are active in-transit. With 0 on-hand inventory and an effective pipeline of 154 units, the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover demand during the review and lead time. I will continue to use the current demand regime (last 22 periods) for forecasting mean and volatility to ensure we don't over-order based on early high-demand history, while using an explicit lead time of 2 periods to be conservative despite the recent 1-period arrival.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 38, total reported 'In-transit' of 504 units includes 350 units confirmed lost (P2: 146, P6: 142, P15: 46, P18: 16). The effective pipeline is 154 units (from P37). The demand regime remains stable with a mean of ~36 units (P16-P37).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, the system is at 0 on-hand inventory. The total 'In-transit' of 504 units includes 350 units confirmed lost (Periods 2, 6, 15, and 18). The effective pipeline is therefore 154 units (ordered in Period 37). Lead time has recently fluctuated; while the historical average was 3, the most recent arrival (P31) had a lead time of 1 period. To be conservative given the 0 on-hand state and the uncertain arrival of the P37 order, I am maintaining L=3 for parameter calculation. Demand has stabilized in a lower regime starting around Period 16; the mean demand for the period P16-P38 (recent 23 samples) is approximately 36 units. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=23 provides an estimate for demand over the lead time plus review period (1+L=4). Using recent_N for sigma_hat captures current volatility. The OR backend will order if base_stock (derived from these parameters) minus the effective pipeline (154) is positive.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40, the product is out of stock (On-hand: 0). The total 'In-transit' of 504 units includes 350 units confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18) and a 154-unit order placed in Period 37. Although the promised lead time is 2, recent history shows actual lead times (W = X - Z) ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with the most recent delivery (P31) having a lead time of 1. The order from P37 is now in its 3rd period of transit. Given the inconsistency, I will set L to 3 to ensure enough safety stock to cover a potentially longer arrival. The demand regime starting at P16 remains stable; the mean demand for P16-P39 is 36.3 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 14.2. I am using recent_N (N=24, covering P16-P39) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current low-demand environment (approx -70% vs initial levels). The effective pipeline is 154 units (P37), meaning the OR backend will calculate an order based on (base_stock - 154).

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Effective pipeline is 154 units (ordered P37); all other 350 units 'In-transit' (P2, P6, P15, P18) are confirmed lost and must be ignored for inventory planning. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system shows 504 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 350 of these units are confirmed lost (from orders in Periods 2, 6, 15, and 18). The remaining 154 units were ordered in Period 37. With an observed actual lead time ranging from 1 to 3 periods (previously confirmed at 3), these 154 units are now overdue (4 periods since order). Since the 'conclude' message for Period 40 does not show an arrival, on-hand inventory remains at 0. The demand regime starting from Period 16 has stabilized at a much lower mean (approx. 36 units) compared to the start of the game. I will continue to assume a Lead Time of 3 for safety, and use the recent regime (last 25 periods, P16-P40) to forecast demand \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the low-demand regime while recognizing the pipeline is empty (as the 154 units are late/lost and the 350 units are definitely lost). I will use 'explicit' for L to maintain the 3-period buffer and 'recent_N' for demand parameters.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Shipment from Period 37 (154 units) is now 4 periods overdue and potentially lost. Total probable lost units in 'In-transit' has increased from 350 to 504. Effective pipeline is 0 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 504 units in-transit, but historical analysis strongly suggests these are all lost. Specifically, 350 units from Periods 2, 6, 15, and 18 are long-overdue (pre-Period 20). The order from Period 37 (154 units) is now 4 periods overdue; given that the most recent successful delivery (Period 31) had a lead time of 1 period and prior reliable lead times were 3 periods, this shipment is also highly likely to be lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline is treated as 0 and on-hand inventory is 0. The demand regime starting at Period 16 remains stable, with an average demand of approximately 35.3 units (P16-P41). To restore inventory and account for the high probability of lost shipments, I am placing an order based on the current mean (approx 35) and a lead time of 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) to ensure the backend base-stock calculation covers 4 periods of demand (L+1). L is set to 3 to reflect the reliable historical average despite some volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total reported 'In-transit' of 504 units is confirmed to be composed of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, and now P37, which is 4 periods overdue). Effective pipeline is 0 units. Demand regime (P16-P41) remains stable with a mean of 35.3 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43, the current inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 504 units is entirely composed of lost shipments (P2: 146, P6: 142, P15: 46, P18: 16, and P37: 154). Period 37 is now 6 periods overdue relative to the promised lead time of 2 and 3 periods past the recently observed maximum lead time, confirming it as lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline is 0 units. Demand is stable in the current regime (P16-P42) with a mean of approximately 35.5 units. To ensure inventory replenishment despite frequent carrier failure, I am maintaining L at 3 (the most frequent successful lead time) and using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat covering the low-demand regime since Period 16 (N=27). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with these values will trigger an order to cover the (L+1) horizon while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 43, the shipment from Period 37 (154 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods since order). Total units 'In-transit' (504) are all lost shipments; effective pipeline is 0.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44, the on-hand inventory is 0 and the total reported 'In-transit' is 504 units. Based on historical 'conclude' messages and carry-over insights, it is confirmed that the orders from Period 2 (146), Period 6 (142), Period 15 (46), Period 18 (16), and now Period 37 (154) are lost. The shipment from Period 37 is now 7 periods overdue (ordered P37, currently P44, promised lead time 2, observed lead time range 1-3). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. To restore service level, a new order is required. The demand regime has been stable since Period 16; for the last 10 periods (P34-P43), the mean demand is 39.6 units with a std dev of approximately 16.5. I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent successful lead time) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the risk of longer delivery times despite recent variance. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*mean of the last 10 samples (4 * 39.6 = 158.4), and sigma_hat is set to sqrt(1+L)*std dev of the last 10 samples (2 * 16.5 = 33).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Shipment from Period 37 (154 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods overdue). Total lost units in 'In-transit' is 504. Effective pipeline is 0. Demand for the last 10 periods (P34-P43) averages 39.6 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45, on-hand inventory is 0 and the total reported 'In-transit' is 504 units. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights, all 504 units (P2: 146, P6: 142, P15: 46, P18: 16, and P37: 154) are confirmed or highly likely lost, as P37 is now 8 periods overdue (promised 2, observed 1-3). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0 units. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized into a lower regime. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P35-P44) is approximately 33.3 units, while the mean for the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is 28.2 units, showing a slight recent dip. To ensure availability while accounting for the need to trigger a fresh order (since internal logic will subtract the lost 504 units from base_stock unless parameters compenste), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current regime average of ~33 units. Lead time is set to an explicit value of 3 to reflect the most common successful delivery time, providing a conservative buffer given recent losses. This configuration will force the backend to place a new order to meet the (L+1) demand requirement despite the phantom 'In-transit' volume.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Shipment from Period 37 (154 units) is now 8 periods overdue and definitively lost. Total confirmed lost shipments in 'In-transit' is 504 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P37). Effective pipeline inventory is 0.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 16 has stabilized at a lower level compared to the start of the game. For the recent 10-period window (P36-P45), the mean demand is approximately 34.6 units. Inventory planning is severely impacted by unreliable logistics: out of 504 units currently 'In-transit', all 504 units (from P2, P6, P15, P18, and P37) are confirmed or highly likely to be lost based on them being at least 8 periods overdue. Consequently, the effective pipeline is 0 units. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time is highly variable (1-3 periods). I will set L to 3 to be conservative in the lead-time window, and use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 35 units/period) while accounting for recent volatility. Setting an explicit value for L and using recent windows for demand allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock effectively given the zeroed-out pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: All 504 units currently listed as 'In-transit' (from orders in P2, P6, P15, P18, and P37) are confirmed lost; the effective pipeline is 0. Demand regime P36-P45 mean is 34.6 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 16, with a more recent mean (P34-P46) of approximately 38 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 504 units is entirely composed of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, and P37), meaning the effective pipeline is 0. With 0 on-hand inventory and the game nearing its end (Period 47 of 50), it is critical to reset the pipeline state to trigger an order that covers remaining demand. Lead times have been inconsistent (1-3 periods). By setting L to 'explicit' at 3 (the most conservative observed lead time) and using 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=11 (covering the current stable period from P36 onwards), I aim to secure enough inventory for the final periods while acknowledging that the OR backend's pipeline calculation is currently inflated by lost orders. The explicit L=3 forces the backend to look for (L+1) periods of demand coverage immediately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation reflects a sustained low-demand regime (Period 16 onwards) with an average demand of approximately 35 units per period. The reported 'In-transit' of 504 units is entirely composed of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, and P37), meaning the effective pipeline is 0 and on-hand inventory is 0. Since the game is at Period 48 and the confirmed lead time has recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, an order placed now (P48) will arrive between P49 and P51. Given the cumulative lost orders and the game end at Period 50, I will set parameters to trigger an order that covers the remaining two periods of demand (P49 and P50). Using recent_N=32 (P16-P47) captures the stable low-demand mean of ~35. This ensures the OR backend attempts to reach a base stock level sufficient for the end-of-game demand without over-ordering, while recognizing the pipeline is actually empty.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Total reported 'In-transit' (504 units) remains entirely composed of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P37). Effective pipeline inventory is confirmed at 0 units. Demand regime (P16-P47) mean is stable at 34.6 units.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49 of 50. The current status shows on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 504 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P2: 146, P6: 142, P15: 46, P18: 16, P37: 154). Consequently, the effective pipeline is 0 units. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized at a significantly lower regime with a mean of approximately 35.3 units (calculated from P16-P48). Although the promised lead time is 2, arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with many shipments being lost entirely. Since this is the penultimate period (Period 49), any order placed now will arrive at the earliest in Period 50 (if lead time is 1) or later (after the game ends). Given the high probability of shipment loss seen in the history and the fact that we have only one period remaining to sell any stock that might arrive, I will set parameters to trigger an order to cover the final period's demand, while acknowledging that the effective pipeline is empty. I will use 'recent_N' with N=33 to capture the lower demand regime since Period 16 and use 'explicit' for L=1 to attempt to get stock in time for the final period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a lower level (~35 units) compared to the start of the simulation. Period 50 is the final period of the game; any orders placed now will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or generate profit, as the minimum lead time observed is 1 period (and more typically 3). On-hand inventory is 0, and the entire 'In-transit' quantity of 504 units (from P2, P6, P15, P18, P37) is confirmed lost based on the duration they have remained un-concluded (spanning 11 to 47 periods). Although no order will impact the final score, I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand environment and the established lead time of 3 periods to maintain consistency in the model's final state.
