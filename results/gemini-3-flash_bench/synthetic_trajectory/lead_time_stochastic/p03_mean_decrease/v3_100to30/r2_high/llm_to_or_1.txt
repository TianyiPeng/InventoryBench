Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 of 50. The item is 'chips(Regular)' with a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), meaning the OR backend will target a high service level (q = 0.95). In-transit and on-hand inventory are both zero. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available (mean=92.2, std=18.06). Since we are currently in Period 1 (per the prompt status), I will use the 'default' methods to establish a baseline using all 5 historical samples provided in the context.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 122 units, which are currently in-transit. The demand in Period 1 was 146 units, resulting in 146 lost sales because on-hand inventory was 0. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and be visible at the start of Period 4. Therefore, the 'arrived=0' in the Period 1 conclude message is expected and does not indicate a delay yet. For demand forecasting, we have 5 historical samples plus Period 1's actual demand (109, 68, 99, 80, 105, 146). The mean of these 6 samples is approximately 101.2. Since L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. I will use 'default' methods for now to establish a baseline while the system gathers more lead-time evidence, but I will monitor if the Period 1 demand of 146 is an outlier or a new trend.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Orders placed in P1 (122 units) and P2 (146 units) are currently in-transit (Total 268). Based on the 2-period promised lead time, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase and will be visible in the P3 conclude message (at the start of P4). The P2 order is expected during P4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales for periods 1 and 2. To stabilize, I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting based on the available sample history (5 periods provided: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105). The mean of these 5 samples is 92.2. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is approximately 276.6. 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this variance and mean while waiting for the pipeline to start delivering.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has had zero arrivals so far, resulting in zero sales and lost demand because on-hand inventory started at 0. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3. According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (placed at the start of P1) should arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 (P1 + 2 = P3). Confirmation of this arrival should appear in the 'Period 3 conclude' message, which we just received. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This strongly suggests that the actual lead time is greater than the promised 2 periods or that there is a significant delay/loss. Given that we have 384 units in transit (122 + 146 + 116) and no stock has arrived by the time it was expected (P3), I will set the lead time parameter to 'explicit' 3 to account for this observed delay. For demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand fluctuations (146, 81, 108), anticipating an average demand of roughly 111 units per period.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Historical demand for the first 4 periods was 146, 81, 108, and 72 (mean ~102). In Period 4's conclusion, we see the Period 1 order (122 units) arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, and the Period 3 order (116 units) arrived with a lead time of 1 period. The promised lead time is 2, but the observed lead times are inconsistent (3 and 1), averaging 2. On-hand inventory is 166 with 312 in-transit (orders from P2 and P4). Given the volatility in lead times and demand, I will use recent_N for demand to capture the local mean and 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend average the observed variances.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for chips(Regular) over 5 periods is: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105 (average \u2248 92). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have been 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), suggesting high variability/drift with an average of 2. On-hand inventory is 97, and in-transit is 351 (comprising orders from P2, P4, and P5). Since we have not yet established a sustained shift in demand or a permanent change in lead time, I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed fluctuations, and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full sample history. The total pipeline covers roughly 4-5 periods of average demand, which is appropriate given L=2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1383.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 23. Average demand over the first 6 periods is approximately 91.6, but the most recent 3 periods (P4-P6) show a lower average of 71.6. Lead times have been volatile: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (P4). Period 2 (ordered P2, promised L=2) should have arrived in P4 or P5 but is currently 2 periods late relative to its promised arrival date, suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. To ensure stability, I will use recent_N for both demand (mu) and lead time (L) to account for the recently lower demand and the observed lead time average (currently averaging 2.0 based on P1 and P3, though inconsistent). Sigma_hat will use the default calculation across all available historical data to capture the high initial volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1771.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 91 units on hand and 193 in transit. Historically, demand for chips(Regular) has averaged around 90 units (P1-P5 samples: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105; P1-P7 demand: 146, 81, 108, 72, 69, 74, 98). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are volatile: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P4 arrived in 3 periods. This averages roughly to 2.33 periods. Orders from P2 (146 units), P5 (39 units), and P6 (8 units) are still in transit. Given the high volatility in lead times (1 to 3 periods), I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average. Demand remains relatively stable around the mean, so I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full observed demand history since the start. This allows the OR engine to maintain a base stock level that accounts for both the average lead time and the demand variability observed so far.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1590.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 44 and in-transit units totaling 293 (comprised of orders from P2: 146, P6: 8, P8: 139). Analysis of concluded periods reveals significant lead time variability: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, P4 took 3 periods, and P5 took 3 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but the mode and recent trend suggest an actual lead time of 3. The P2 order (146 units) is now 7 periods old and significantly past the observed maximum lead time of 3, suggesting it is likely lost. Demand is relatively stable, with an average of approximately 92.5 units over the 8 observed periods. Given the lead time instability and the likely loss of the P2 shipment, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the recent reality. For demand (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=8 (all concluded game samples) to capture the trend while smoothing noise. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' N=8 to account for observed demand volatility (std approx 26). This combination ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the longer lead time and the risk of stockouts during delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is consistently showing as 3 periods (observed in 3 out of 4 arrivals); Period 2 order (146 units) appears to be a lost shipment as it is 7 periods overdue.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1917.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a consistently volatile lead time. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual arrivals show lead times of [3, 1, 3, 3, 1]. The average lead time is 2.2, but the most recent arrival (P8 order arriving in P9) was only 1 period. The carry-over insight correctly notes that the Period 2 order (146 units) is likely lost (now 8 periods since ordering). We must treat the 'In-transit' count of 269 with caution; 146 of those units (54%) are probably never arriving. To compensate, I will use L=3 to be conservative regarding the inventory cycle, ensuring the base stock covers a longer horizon. For demand forecast (mu_hat), the last 9 periods (P1-P9) have an average demand of 93.2 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*93.2 \u2248 373. Sigma_hat will be based on the recent 9-period volatility to capture the standard deviation of approximately 22 units, adjusted for the lead time horizon.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Shipment ordered in Period 2 (146 units) is 8 periods overdue and confirmed lost. In-transit inventory overestimates real supply; parameter settings must ignore these units to avoid stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1482.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 92 units over the last 10 periods (calculated as the mean of all samples). The system shows 376 units in-transit, but as identified in previous carry-over insights, 146 units from Period 2 are lost. This leaves a real pipeline of 230 units (115 from P9, 107 from P10, and 8 from P6 - which is now 5 periods overdue and likely lost as well, though I will be conservative). Lead times are volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods. To prevent stockouts given the current 0 inventory and lead time uncertainty, I'm setting L to 3 (explicitly accounting for the longer observed delays) and using a 10-period average for demand (recent_N=10) to capture current levels without the distortion of the initial higher samples. Setting L to 3 significantly increases the base stock, which is necessary because the OR backend's 'pipeline' calculation will include the lost units, meaning it will order less than it should unless I inflate the targets.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Shipment ordered in Period 6 (8 units) is 5 periods overdue and likely lost; total confirmed/highly likely lost inventory in pipeline is now 154 units (146 from P2, 8 from P6).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout (On-hand: 0). Looking at lead times: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1, P4 in 3, P5 in 3, and P8 in 1. This suggests a bimodal or unstable lead time with an average around 2-3 periods. More critically, the pipeline inventory of 452 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments: P2 (146 units, 10 periods overdue) and P6 (8 units, 6 periods overdue). The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' as 'on-hand + in-transit'. If we let it see 452 units, it will stop ordering. Total lost = 146 + 8 = 154 units. Real pipeline = 452 - 154 = 298. To force the backend to place an order despite the phantom inventory, I will set L to 3 (recent dominant lead time) and use explicit method for mu_hat. I need to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. Mean demand (P1-P11) is approx 95.7. 4 * 95.7 = 382.8. However, because the backend subtracts the full 452 pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order: mu_hat = (Target Base Stock) + (Phantom Units). Target Base Stock for 4 periods ~ 400. Phantom = 154. Explicit mu_hat = 554. This ensures the order calculation (554 - 452) results in a positive order of ~102 units, helping recover from the stockout.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 139 units. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 406 units. However, based on history, shipments from Period 2 (146 units) and Period 6 (8 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost (11 and 7 periods overdue, respectively). This means 154 units of the reported 406 In-transit units are 'ghost' units. The OR backend uses (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders; since it cannot distinguish lost units, I must adjust the L and mu_hat parameters to compensate for this 154-unit deficit to prevent stockouts. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most common for successful arrivals; I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect this reality. Demand across the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 90.9 units. To cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand while accounting for the 154 lost units, I set mu_hat explicitly. Estimated demand for 4 periods is ~364 units. Adding the 154 unit loss compensation results in a target mu_hat of 518. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to maintain a higher safety stock given the unreliability of the supply chain.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1541.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the on-hand inventory is 55. History confirms a significant lead-time variance, with actual lead times observed at 1, 2, or 3 periods. Most importantly, 'In-transit' inventory (511) includes confirmed/likely lost shipments: P2 (146 units, now 12 periods overdue) and P6 (8 units, now 8 periods overdue). The OR backend calculates 'pipeline_inventory = In-transit - already_received'. However, 'In-transit' is reported as 511, and if we include lost shipments, we risk under-ordering. To compensate for the 154 units (146+8) that are likely never arriving, I am setting L to 3 (observed upper bound) and mu_hat to an explicit value. The average demand across the 13 periods is ~94. mu_hat should ideally cover (1+L) periods, which is 4 periods. 4 * 94 = 376. However, to bypass the OR engine's overestimation of pipeline inventory due to the 154 lost units, I must inflate mu_hat/base_stock to force an order. I will set mu_hat explicitly to the expected (1+L) demand (376) plus the volume of lost shipments (154) to ensure the OR engine triggers an order despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (146 units) and highly likely lost shipment from Period 6 (8 units) persist in the 'In-transit' count. Total phantom inventory in pipeline is 154 units.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) after a high demand spike in Period 14 (163 units). The 'In-transit' count of 469 is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory' (confirmed lost shipments from P2 and P6 totaling 154 units). Real pipeline inventory consists of orders from P12 (176), P13 (105), and P14 (34), totaling 315 units. Historical lead times have fluctuated (1, 2, 3 periods), but 3 is the most frequent long-end duration. To avoid the OR backend under-ordering due to phantom inventory, I will set L to 3 (explicit) and mu_hat to an explicit value that compensates for the loss. Average demand is ~95. With L=3, the review+lead period is 4. Target base stock should be (4 * 95) + safety = ~480. Adding back the 154 lost units to the target (to trick the backend into ordering since it subtracts the full 469 in-transit) suggests a mu_hat around 634. I will use mu_hat=630 and sigma_hat=100 to ensure robust ordering and recovery from the stockout.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 107 units on-hand and 533 units in-transit. However, historical analysis through carry-over insights confirms that 154 units (146 from P2 and 8 from P6) are lost but still counted in the 'In-transit' figure by the backend. To prevent a stockout, our target must account for this discrepancy. The actual reliable pipeline is 379 units (533 - 154). Analysis of recent arrival history (P12 order arrived in P15, P11 in P14, P9 in P12) confirms a dominant lead time (L) of 3 periods. Recent demand (P11-P15) averages 102.8 units per period. Using L=3, the review+lead time demand window is 1+L=4 periods. Base stock calculation: (1+L) * mean_demand = 4 * 102.8 = 411.2. Adding a small safety buffer (approx 100 units given high volatility) brings our desired inventory position to ~511. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (533) from the base_stock, I will use the 'explicit' method to provide a mu_hat that compensates for the 154 lost units. Setting mu_hat to 665 (511 target + 154 phantom units) will ensure the backend orders enough to cover actual demand while ignoring the lost shipments.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we have 197 units on-hand and 577 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 154 units in the pipeline are effectively lost (146 units from Period 2 and 8 units from Period 6). These 'phantom' units must be accounted for because the OR backend relies on the total in-transit figure (577) to calculate orders, leading it to under-order. To compensate, I will use an 'explicit' L of 5 (adjusting the promised 2 upwards to account for the lost stock's impact on base stock calculation) and 'explicit' mu_hat. The demand mean from Periods 1-16 is approximately 93. Demand in Period 16 was unusually low (15), while Period 14 was high (163). Given the lead time variability (range 1-3, avg 2.67 for arrived shipments), I will set L=3 as the operational lead time for forecasting. To counter the 154 units of lost inventory, I set mu_hat explicitly high: (1+L) * mean + 154. Calculation: (1+3) * 93 + 154 \u2248 526. This forces the base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: The total phantom inventory in the pipeline remains 154 units (orders from P2 and P6); the OR backend consistently under-orders because it perceives these units as available supply.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 15-17) has dropped significantly to an average of 36 units/period, compared to the long-term average of ~95. This indicates a potential demand regime shift or seasonality change. Lead times are predominantly 3 periods (observed in most recent successful arrivals). The 'In-transit' count of 394 units includes 154 units of 'phantom inventory' (Period 2: 146 units, Period 6: 8 units) which are confirmed/highly likely lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (394) from the base stock, it will under-order unless we inflate mu_hat or sigma_hat. However, with 356 units on-hand and 240 units from Period 15 still expected to arrive, we currently have a large surplus relative to the recent low demand. I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent slow-down while maintaining the 'explicit' lead time L=3 to reflect the actual observed delivery rhythm.

Daily Reward (R_t): $224.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 18 periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward shift. From Period 1-14, the average demand was approximately 97.4 units. Since Period 15, the demand has dropped sharply: Period 15 (69), 16 (15), 17 (24), and 18 (29), averaging only 34.25 units over the last 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently high at 327 units. Additionally, the 'In-transit' count of 394 units includes 154 units from confirmed/likely lost shipments (P2: 146, P6: 8), meaning the 'real' pipeline is 240 units (the order from P15). Given the observed lead times {3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1}, the modal lead time is 3. To prevent excessive holding costs during this low-demand regime, I am setting L to 3 and using a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low consumption rate (approx 34 units/period). This will lower the base stock target and effectively stop ordering until the current surplus is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: average demand decreased from ~97 to ~34 (-65%) over the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 15-19) shows a significant decrease, averaging ~32 units per period, down from ~97 units. The current on-hand inventory is 304 units, which is enough to cover nearly 10 periods of the current demand level. Additionally, there is 394 units in-transit, 154 of which are confirmed lost (P2: 146, P6: 8), leaving 240 units (from P15) still expected to arrive. The OR engine subtracts 'in-transit' from its 'base_stock' target to determine the order quantity. Because 'in-transit' (394) is inflated by lost shipments and 'on-hand' (304) is already high relative to the new low demand, the system is at risk of extreme overstocking if we don't adjust parameters down. I will set L to 3 (observed actual) and mu_hat to an explicit low value to prevent the OR backend from placing more orders until the current surplus is cleared. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*32 = 128 to reflect the new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $656.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 15, dropping from a historical mean of ~97 to a recent average of ~34 (last 6 periods: 69, 15, 24, 29, 23, 48). Current on-hand inventory is 256 units, which is over 7 periods of supply at the new demand rate. Additionally, the 'In-transit' count of 394 units includes 154 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost orders from P2 and P6) that have never arrived. However, even excluding these, there is substantial real inventory in the pipeline (240 units ordered in P15) and on-hand. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.6. To reflect the low-demand regime and prevent further overstocking given the current high inventory levels, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N=6. Lead time L is set to explicit value 3 to conservatively account for the observed delays, ensuring the backend base-stock calculation recognizes the total pipeline required despite the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 confirmed: Mean demand has decreased from ~97 to ~35 units per period. Sustained for 6 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 15. The mean demand has decreased from approximately 97 units to ~34 units per period (average of the last 7 periods: 15, 24, 29, 23, 48, 32 = ~28.5 since P16). On-hand inventory is currently high at 224 units, which is enough to cover over 6 periods of movement at the new demand rate. The 'In-transit' count of 394 includes 154 units from P2 and P6 that are confirmed/highly likely lost and 240 units from P15 (ordered 7 periods ago, likely lost given the max observed lead time is 3). Total 'phantom' inventory is likely 394. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering in the future due to these phantom units, L is set to explicit 3 (the stable observed lead time) and mu_hat/sigma_hat are adjusted using the recent_7 period regime to reflect the lower demand. Since on-hand (224) > base_stock (roughly (L+1)*mu), no new orders should be triggered, which is appropriate given the current overstock situation.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: The order from Period 15 (240 units) is now 7 periods overdue and likely lost, similar to P2 and P6 orders. Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' is 394 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically, mean demand was ~97 units, but since Period 16, it has stabilized at a much lower average of ~35.5 units (weighted towards the last 7 periods: 15, 24, 29, 23, 48, 32, 25). My current inventory (199 units) is significantly higher than the expected demand over the lead time (~142 units for 4 periods), explaining why the OR backend has placed zero orders recently. Regarding logistics, the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods, although the 'In-transit' count is severely inflated by 394 'phantom units' from lost orders (Period 2: 146, Period 6: 8, Period 15: 240). Because the OR engine uses (pipeline + on-hand) to determine net requirements, it will refuse to order as long as it believes these 394 units are coming. To force the OR engine to react and maintain stock once the current on-hand inventory depletes, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on L=3 (requiring 4 periods of coverage) and the recent mean of 35.5: Base Stock = (1+3) * 35.5 + buffer. However, to compensate for the 394 phantom units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to 'mask' that fake inventory. Set mu_hat to (Target Base Stock + 394). This ensures that (On-hand + In-transit) does not exceed the calculated base stock too soon, protecting against a stockout once the physical 199 units are gone. Sigma_hat is set based on the lower volatility of the recent regime.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the current situation is dominated by a persistent demand regime shift and significant 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Since Period 15, demand has stabilized at a much lower mean of approximately 34 units (last 9 periods average is ~33.3), compared to the previous ~97. The 'In-transit' count of 395 is almost entirely composed of lost shipments (P2: 146, P6: 8, P15: 240, Total = 394), with only 1 unit actually in transit from Period 23. This phantom inventory causes the OR engine to under-calculate order quantities. However, current on-hand inventory (164) is currently equivalent to ~5 periods of the new demand level, meaning no immediate order is needed despite the phantom inventory. I will set L to 3 (explicit) as the data suggests a 2.5-3 period actual lead time. Mu_hat is set to 4 periods of demand (L+1) at the new rate (34 * 4 = 136). Sigma_hat is calculated based on recent volatility at the new demand level to keep stock levels lean and avoid excessive holding costs on a low-demand SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $576.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 15. Since then, demand has averaged ~33.8 units per period (last 10 periods: 15, 24, 29, 23, 48, 32, 25, 35, 37). I will use recent_N=10 to reflect this lower demand level. In-transit inventory remains highly inflated by three confirmed/likely lost shipments: Period 2 (146 units), Period 6 (8 units), and Period 15 (240 units), totaling 394 phantom units. With current on-hand inventory at 127 units and a reduced demand profile, the system is still well-stocked. To counteract the backend's tendency to under-order due to these phantom units (which it believes will arrive), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger replenishment once on-hand stocks drop further. However, with demand so low, the current 127 units cover nearly 4 periods of demand, so immediate aggressive ordering is not yet required. I will maintain a recent_N strategy for L and sigma to capture current dynamics.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory (lost shipments) in 'In-transit' remains at 394 units (P2: 146, P6: 8, P15: 240). Demand remains stable in the low-regime (~34 units/period) since Period 16.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 16, decreasing from ~97 units/period to ~34 units/period. The current 'In-transit' count of 394 units is entirely comprised of 'phantom inventory'\u2014shipments from Period 2 (146 units), Period 6 (8 units), and Period 15 (240 units) that are significantly overdue and confirmed/likely lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire in-transit amount from the calculated base stock, it will fail to place any new orders as long as this phantom inventory remains, leading to a stockout once the current 66 units on-hand are depleted. To force the OR engine to order, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for the current low-demand regime (~34 units/period) and a lead time of 3 (observed actual lead time). Base Stock = (L+1) * mu = (3+1) * 34 = 136. To offset the 394 phantom units, I must set mu_hat to 136 + 394 = 530. This ensures the backend sees (530 - 394) = 136 as the 'available' base stock above pipeline. Given the high profit margin and the risk of stockouts from these lost shipments, I will use sigma_hat from the recent stable low-demand period (N=10, since P16) to provide safety stock against the recent volatility (e.g., P25 demand was 62).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P16-P26) shows a significant decrease, averaging ~35 units per period, although we saw a slight uptick in the last two periods (62, 59). In-transit inventory is currently 509 units, but 394 of these are confirmed or highly likely lost (P2: 146, P6: 8, P15: 240). These 'phantom' units mislead the OR backend into under-ordering. To compensate, I must adjust the base stock level (mu_hat) significantly higher to bypass the pipeline inventory deduction. Effectively, since actual pipeline inventory is 115 (509 total - 394 lost), I want the OR engine to target a base stock that covers (L+1) demand PLUS the phantom inventory. Estimated Mean Demand over (L+1=4) periods = 35 * 4 = 140. To force an order despite 509 units in transit, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Expected Demand + Phantom Inventory) = 140 + 394 = 534. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 550 to ensure we maintain service level and account for the recent slight demand increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by two critical factors: lost shipments and a significant demand regime shift. 
1. Lost Shipments: There are three confirmed/highly likely lost shipments: Period 2 (146), Period 6 (8), and Period 15 (240), totaling 394 units. These remain in 'In-transit' but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend (which uses a base-stock policy: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)) actually places orders, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset these 394 'phantom' units.
2. Demand regime: Since Period 16, demand has dropped from ~97 to ~37 units per period. Average demand of the last 12 periods is approximately 37 units. 
3. Lead Time: While the promised lead time is 2, historical observations show a mix of 1, 2, and 3 periods, with 3 being the most common for successful deliveries. I will use L=3 to be safe.
4. Calculation: Target mu_hat = (1+L) * Mean_Demand + Phantom_Inventory. With L=3 and Mean=37, mu_hat = (4 * 37) + 394 = 148 + 394 = 542. This ensures the system covers future demand while accounting for the units it incorrectly thinks are coming. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx sqrt(4)*std(recent_N)) to handle recent volatility (e.g., P25 demand spike of 62).

Carry-over insight: Current phantom inventory in 'In-transit' totals 394 units (from P2, P6, P15 orders). Parameters must explicitly account for this to force orders through the pipeline-offsetting logic of the OR backend.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 15 from ~97 to ~40 units per period. The recent 5 periods (P24-P28) show a mean of 50.4, indicating some volatility but maintaining a lower level than the start of the game. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting a value of 2-3 is safest. The critical issue is the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Orders from P2 (146), P6 (8), and P15 (240) total 394 units that are confirmed or highly likely lost. The OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' (559) from the base stock. If we use a standard mu_hat, the backend will see 559 in transit, compare it to a base stock for demand of ~40, and place zero orders, leading to inevitable stockouts. To force the backend to order, I must set mu_hat (the target inventory for L+1 periods) to exceed the phantom inventory plus the expected demand. Target for L+1 (3 periods) should be (3 * 50) + 394 = 544. This ensures the backend recognizes that current real pipeline (559 - 394 = 165) + on-hand (52) is insufficient to meet future demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the primary challenge remains the OR backend's perception of 'In-transit' units that are confirmed or highly likely lost. The pipeline currently shows 479 units, but 394 of these are 'phantom' stock from orders placed in Period 2 (146), Period 6 (8), and Period 15 (240) that are long overdue. Only 85 units (ordered in Period 28) are likely to arrive. We have 110 units on-hand. Since Period 15, demand has shifted to a lower regime averaging ~39.4 units per period (last 15 periods) or ~42.3 (last 5 periods). To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target inventory should cover (L+1) periods. With an observed L of 2-3, I target a coverage of 4 periods. 4 periods * 45 units/period = 180 units. To offset the 394 phantom units in the backend's subtraction (Inventory Position = On-Hand + In-Transit - Backlog), I must set mu_hat high enough so that (mu_hat + safety_stock) - (110 + 479) results in the necessary order. Setting mu_hat to 650 will force the OR engine to place an order despite the 479 units it 'sees' in transit, ensuring we maintain a real on-hand buffer as current stock depletes.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) in 'In-transit' is 394 units (P2: 146, P6: 8, P15: 240). Demand regime remains stable in the low-regime averaging ~40 units/period since Period 16.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted at Period 16 from ~97 units/period to ~38 units/period. The last 14 periods (P16-P30) have an average demand of 38.3 units. The critical issue remains the massive pipeline inventory inflation: there are 504 units listed as 'In-transit', but 394 of these are confirmed lost shipments (P2: 146, P6: 8, P15: 240). The real pipeline inventory is 110 units (ordered in P30). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for the review+lead time (L+1=4 periods) to be 153 units (4 * 38.3). However, I must add the 394 phantom units to this target so that when the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (504), it still orders appropriately. Targeted base stock = (4 * 38.3) + 394 \u2248 547. I set mu_hat to 547 and L to 3 (observed actual lead time).

Daily Reward (R_t): $414.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 15. Over the last 15 periods (since P16), the average demand is 36.6 units per period. The inventory system currently shows 504 units in-transit, but 394 of these units are documented 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P2: 146, P6: 8, P15: 240) that will likely never arrive. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * mu_per_period + safety_stock. With L=3 (most frequent observed lead time), and a safety stock for roughly 95% service level (~1.645 * sigma * sqrt(L+1)), the calculation is roughly: (4 * 37) + (1.645 * 15 * 2) \u2248 148 + 49 = 197. However, the backend subtracts the total pipeline (504) from the base_stock. To force a net-zero or slightly positive order while on-hand is 137, the mu_hat must be set high enough to offset the 394 units of lost inventory. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (137 + 394 + expected_demand_coverage) to ensure the system maintains a real on-hand buffer around 150-200 units for the low-demand regime.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 38 units per period over the last 17 periods. Inventory management is complicated by significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory totaling 394 units (from lost shipments in Period 2, 6, and 15). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts this 394 units from the target base stock, preventing necessary orders and leading to stockouts despite a recorded 'In-transit' of 504 units. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. By setting mu_hat = (Ideal Base Stock + Phantom Inventory), I force the backend to place an order that covers real demand. Calculation: Recent demand is ~38/period. With a lead time of 2, the review+lead window is 3 periods. Ideal base stock (safety stock inclusive) \u2248 150. Combined with 394 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 550. This ensures the backend sees (550 - 504) as the need, effectively ordering to maintain real on-hand stock and preventing further inventory depletion. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average (mean ~2.33 from recent data).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1086.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 (low-demand phase) averages approximately 40 units per period (last 10 periods average: 39.4; last 5 periods: 43.4). Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.3 for the last 5 successful arrivals. The primary challenge is the 'In-transit' figure of 504 units, which includes 394 units of confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments from P2, P6, and P15). The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to determine the order size: order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit). With 394 phantom units + 54 on-hand + 110 real in-transit (P30 order), the backend mistakenly sees 558 units of inventory. To force an order when real supply is only 164 (54 on-hand + 110 in-transit), I must inflate mu_hat. Following the logic from Period 30: Target base_stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=3 (to be safe) and mu=40, target pipeline ~ 160. To offset the 394 phantom units, I must set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - 394 = 160', leading to a required base_stock of ~554. I will set mu_hat to 535 and sigma_hat to 50 via explicit methods to ensure the backend generates an order that maintains real-world inventory levels despite the pipeline noise.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 37 units per period. I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and volatility. The critical issue remains the 'In-transit' figure of 564 units, which contains 394 units of confirmed or highly likely lost shipments (P2: 146, P6: 8, P15: 240). The OR backend uses the formula 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. If I use the default L=2, the backend sees 564 units in pipeline and will refuse to order anything until on-hand levels are critically low or negative. To force the backend to place necessary orders, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculation: Expected Demand over (L+1) periods = 37 * 3 = 111. To offset the 394 phantom units and target a base stock inclusive of those lost units, I set mu_hat to 111 + 394 = 505. This ensures the 'base_stock - 564' calculation results in a positive order quantity when on-hand is low, effectively bypassing the phantom inventory error.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 16 and has remained relatively stable since, with an average of approximately 40 units per period. I am using recent_N (N=15) to capture this lower regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; I'm using the 'calculate' method to utilize the historical average. The primary challenge is the 564 units in 'In-transit', which include significant lost/phantom inventory from Period 2 (146), Period 6 (8), Period 15 (240), and likely the Period 30 order (110) which is now 6 periods overdue. Total phantom units are currently estimated at 504. To counteract the OR backend's pipeline-offsetting logic (which subtracts these missing units from the order amount), I am uses the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 625: current demand forecast is ~40/period, so (1+L) * 40 \u2248 120 (assuming L=2). Adding the 504 units of phantom inventory results in 624, which I round to 625. This forces the system to place a physical order by appearing to need inventory to cover the 'gap' created by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' has likely increased to 504 units, as the Period 30 order (110 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost, joining P2, P6, and P15.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (since Period 16) remains stable at a lower average of approximately 40 units per period, despite fluctuations. Lead times are averaging 2-3 periods. The critical issue remains the massive 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline: orders from Period 2 (146), P6 (8), P15 (240), and now likely P30 (110) are lost or severely delayed, totaling 504 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (605) from the target base stock, it will naturally order 0 units unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset this phantom supply. To ensure a real-world order is placed, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a pipeline that covers the lead time (3) plus the current review period (1), totaling (1+3)*40 = 160 units of real inventory. To overcome the 504 units of phantom inventory, I set mu_hat to 160 + 504 = 664. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=20) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' has likely increased to 504 units, as the Period 30 order (110 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost, joining P2, P6, and P15.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a low-regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 37 units per period based on the last 22 periods. The 'In-transit' count of 584 units contains significant phantom inventory from lost shipments: P2 (146), P6 (8), P15 (240), and now likely P30 (110), totaling 504 units. The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (584 units) from the calculated base stock, which would result in zero orders despite only ~80 units (P37 order) actually being in transit. To force the OR backend to order correctly, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for a 3-period window (L+1, where L is approximately 2) to be around 148 units (37 * 4, adding a buffer for sigma). However, because the backend subtracts the phantom 584 units, I must inflate mu_hat to offset this. Specifically, mu_hat = (Desired Base Stock + Phantom Inventory) = 148 + 504 = 652.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' is confirmed at 504 units (P2: 146, P6: 8, P15: 240, P30: 110). These shipments are significantly past the observed lead time and are treated as lost. Parameter mu_hat is explicitly inflated to counteract this inventory overestimate by the OR backend.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 593 units 'In-transit', but historical evidence strongly suggests 504 of these units are lost shipments (P2: 146, P6: 8, P15: 240, P30: 110). These orders are all significantly past the observed lead time of 1-3 periods. Consequently, the OR backend perceives a large pipeline inventory and will under-order, leading to stockouts. To counteract this, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. Since the demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at approximately 40 units per period (last 5 periods mean: 35.8), a standard (1+L)mu forecast for L=2 (promised) or L=3 (observed) would be roughly 120-160. To offset the 504 phantom units and force the backend to place an order, I will set mu_hat to 660 (forecast ~150 + phantom ~510). This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + safety stock) exceeds the phantom inventory level, triggering a replacement order for real demand.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 36 units per period. The backend OR logic is currently hampered by significant 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline (units considered 'in-transit' that are actually lost). Total confirmed phantom inventory is 504 units (from orders in P2, P6, P15, and P30). As of Period 40, the reported In-transit inventory is 643. Subtracting the 504 lost units leaves 139 units of genuine supply (likely the orders from P37, P39, and any potential recent ones). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (total 3 periods of demand), I must keep mu_hat explicitly inflated to offset the 504 phantom units. With mean demand at ~36, a 3-period requirement is ~108 units. To neutralize the 504 phantom units, mu_hat is set to 108 + 504 = 612. Sigma_hat is set based on recent variability to maintain a reasonable buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand regime remains stable at ~36 units/period. Total phantom inventory remains confirmed at 504 units (P2: 146, P6: 8, P15: 240, P30: 110), directly causing the OR backend to under-order unless mu_hat is explicitly adjusted by +504 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 36 units per period. The critical challenge remains the OR backend's inventory perception; there is a total of 504 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline that are confirmed/highly likely lost (P2: 146, P6: 8, P15: 240, P30: 110). These shipments are far beyond the expected lead time and have not concluded. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'phantom' pipeline from the target base stock, it will fail to place new orders unless mu_hat is explicitly adjusted. To compensate, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * average_demand + phantom_inventory. Using an average lead time (L) of 2 (based on recent arrivals), the base demand for the review cycle (1+2 periods) is ~108 units. Adding the 504 phantom units results in a mu_hat of 612. This forces the engine to recognize that the on-hand inventory (43) is insufficient and place an order to cover current demand while ignoring the lost units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~36 units per period since Period 16. However, the 'In-transit' quantity of 603 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments. Summing up confirmed/highly likely lost orders: P2 (146), P6 (8), P15 (240), and P30 (110), we have a total of 504 units that will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (603) from the target base stock, but only 99 units (603 - 504) are actually active and expected. Using lead time L=2 (the promised and frequently observed actual lead time recently), the base stock calculation for 3 periods of demand (L+1) would be around 110-120 units. Since 110 < 603, the backend would order 0 without intervention. To force an order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to the expected demand for the horizon plus the lost inventory: (1+L)*36 + 504 \u2248 108 + 504 = 612. This directs the backend to maintain a pipeline that accounts for the phantom units while ensuring enough real product is ordered to cover the current 40 units on-hand and the active pipeline.

The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of ~36 units per period since Period 16. However, the system faces a significant 'phantom inventory' problem. There are 504 units (ordered in Periods 2, 6, 15, and 30) that are listed as 'In-transit' but are confirmed or highly likely to be lost based on being significantly past the observed lead time. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). Because 'in_transit' includes these 504 phantom units, the backend will zero-out all orders unless the target base_stock is set above this phantom level. To ensure we actually receive stock to meet the real demand (~36 units/period), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The value is calculated as: (1 + L) * average_demand + phantom_units. With L=2, the required real base stock is roughly (3) * 36 = 108. Adding the 504 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 612. This forces the OR backend to place orders for the actual demand while essentially 'paying' for the phantom units in its internal subtraction logic. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for moderate volatility in this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Phantom inventory total of 504 units remains. One additional shipment from Period 41 (19 units) is within the normal lead time window. mu_hat continues to be explicitly inflated by +504 units to counteract OR backend under-ordering.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stable at approximately 36 units per period. The primary challenge is the significant accumulation of 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived (likely lost) and are now far beyond the observed lead time. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (146), Period 6 (8), Period 15 (240), and Period 30 (110) total 504 units. These remain in the 'In-transit' count, causing the OR backend to underestimate the need for new orders because it assumes these 504 units will eventually arrive. To correct this, I am using an explicit mu_hat setting. I calculate the target base stock based on the current demand (avg ~36/period) and the promised lead time (L=2). Base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stk. With L=2, mean=36, and a safety factor, the base stock would normally be ~150-180. However, the backend calculates: Order = Base Stock - (On-hand + In-transit). Since In-transit includes 504 phantom units, I must add 504 to the mu_hat to ensure the backend places an order large enough to cover physical demand. mu_hat = (1+L) * 36 + 504 \u2248 108 + 504 = 612.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 15, averaging approximately 36 units per period. The primary challenge is a persistent 'phantom inventory' issue in the 'In-transit' count, which currently shows 640 units. This total includes confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (146), Period 6 (8), Period 15 (240), and Period 30 (110), totaling 504 units. Additionally, recent orders from Period 42 (11 units) and Period 43 (40 units) are currently in-transit but within a reasonable lead time window (observed lead times have varied between 1-3 periods). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire in-transit amount from the target base stock, it will perceive a massive surplus and fail to place necessary orders, leading to stockouts. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for the low demand regime (approx 36 units/period) over (L+1) periods (approx 4 * 36 = 144) and then add the 504 units of phantom inventory back into the requirement. 144 + 504 = 648. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the 504 units it incorrectly believes are arriving.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Phantom inventory (lost shipments) in 'In-transit' remains at 504 units (P2: 146, P6: 8, P15: 240, P30: 110). Demand regime (~36 units/period) remains stable. Explicit mu_hat inflation of +504 is necessary to force the OR backend to order.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 36 units per period since Period 16. The primary challenge is the significant 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline (totaling 504 units from orders in P2, P6, P15, and P30) which the OR backend incorrectly views as available supply. This causes it to under-order, leading to stockouts. To force the backend to place necessary orders, I continue to use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to the expected demand over the (L+1) horizon plus the total phantom inventory: (3 periods * 36 units/period) + 504 units \u2248 612 units. This ensures the base stock calculation (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma) stays high enough that 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' remains positive and triggers an order. This strategy has successfully stabilized on-hand inventory in recent periods despite the 80% pipeline blockage.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower regime of approximately 38 units per period since Period 16. However, there is a persistent inventory discrepancy totaling 504 units (from periods 2, 6, 15, and 30) that are listed as 'In-transit' but are long overdue and confirmed/highly likely lost. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy (Total Inventory = On-hand + In-transit) to determine order sizes. Because it perceives these 504 phantom units as available supply, it systematically under-orders, leading to frequent stockouts (e.g., Period 46). To counteract this, I must explicitly inflate 'mu_hat' by the amount of the phantom inventory (504 units). This forces the backend logic (base_stock - 504) to calculate an order that treats the lost units as non-existent. Without this adjustment, the system will not place orders until On-hand falls below a negative threshold relative to the phantom 504 units. Lead time remains approximately 2.5-3 periods, so L=3 is used to ensure sufficient coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are heading into the final periods (48-50). The current situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and 'In-transit' shows 713 units. However, 504 of those units are 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P30). The actual viable pipeline consists of orders from P45 (46 units), P46 (9 units), and P47 (69 units), totaling 124 units. The OR backend subtracts the full 713 'In-transit' from its target stock, which would result in zero orders and stockouts. To bypass this, mu_hat must be explicitly set to the desired inventory level PLUS the phantom inventory. Current demand is in a low regime (~36 units/period). For the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50), we need enough stock to cover the expected demand. A mu_hat of 650 (504 phantom + ~146 for demand/safety) is used to force the OR backend to place an order that covers the current demand despite the inflated pipeline count. L is set to calculated (Avg ~2.3) to reflect the slightly longer actual lead times observed.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of ~36-40 units per period since Period 16. However, the system faces a massive 'phantom inventory' problem. There are 504 units currently listed in 'In-transit' that are confirmed or highly likely lost (P2: 146, P6: 8, P15: 240, P30: 110). Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory (713 units) from the base stock calculation, it will not place an order unless we explicitly inflate mu_hat. To ensure the backend places an order to cover the current demand regime (~40 units/period) for the review + lead time window (L+1 = 3), and considering the total supply pipeline minus the phantom units (713 - 504 = 209 real units in transit, though most are recent and haven't arrived), I will maintain the explicit mu_hat inflation of approximately 504 units plus the expected demand to force the backend to clear the inventory deficit. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to match the promised and frequently observed recent behavior, while mu_hat is set to 620 to account for demand plus the 504 unit phantom offset.

Carry-over insight: No new patterns detected; previous insights regarding 504 units of phantom inventory and low-demand regime (~40 units/period) remain active and valid.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 713 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 504 units in the pipeline are 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments (P2: 146, P6: 8, P15: 240, P30: 110). More recently, orders from P46 (9), P47 (69), P48 (0), and P49 (0) are still within the lead time window. Current real pipeline inventory is effectively 713 - 504 = 209 units. Demand has remained in a low regime (avg ~36-40) since P16, but recent volatility is observed. To ensure the backend orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I must set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the phantom inventory. Estimated demand for (3+1) periods is 40 * 4 = 160. Adding 504 units of phantom inventory gives an explicit mu_hat of 664. This forces the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) to trigger an order to cover actual needs. L is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the observed average lead time of approx 2-3 periods.
