  "rationale": "As this is Period 1, there is no historical arrival data to calculate actual lead time, so I will rely on the promised lead time of 2 periods. The demand history provided (61, 107, 84, 144, 69) shows an average demand of approximately 93 units per period with significant variance. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and the lead time is 2, the pipeline needs to cover the demand for the current period (P1) plus the lead time periods (P2, P3). Total periods to cover are L+1 = 3. Given the average demand of 93, the expected total demand over 3 periods is 279. To account for demand variability (maximum observed 144) and maximize the reward while balancing high holding costs ($1/unit/period), I will order enough to cover the average demand plus a safety margin. Ordering 300 units provides coverage for approximately 100 units/period, which aligns with the historical average and mitigates stockout risk while considering that any excess inventory is costly.",

To calculate the order for Period 2, I need to cover demand until the next order arrives. An order placed now (P2) with a 2-period lead time arrives in P4. Thus, I need to cover demand for P2, P3, and P4. Estimated demand: ~100 units/period (average of historical data is 88, but with peaks near 144). Total demand to cover (P2-P4) \u2248 300 units.

Period 1 demand was 59 and Period 2 was 75, roughly in line with the lower end of the sample range. c) Lead Time & Pipeline: The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (300 units) are expected to arrive during P3 resolution (visible in P4). Orders from P2 (50 units) are expected in P4 (visible in P5). Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory, meaning demand in P1 and P2 was lost (lost sales). d) Inventory Assessment: I have 350 units in transit. Given a lead time of 2, my inventory position must cover demand for P3, P4, and P5 (L+1 + observation delay). Estimated demand for 3 periods is ~280-300 units (93 * 3). e) Final Order Logic: My current pipeline (350) already covers the next three periods of expected demand (approx 300). However, because I have 0 on-hand and have already lost units in P1 and P2, I need to ensure I don't stock out further once these arrive.
