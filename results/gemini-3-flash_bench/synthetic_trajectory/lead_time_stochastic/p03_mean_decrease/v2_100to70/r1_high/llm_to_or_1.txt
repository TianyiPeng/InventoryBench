Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. I am observing the demand history for the first 5 periods (61, 107, 84, 144, 69). The mean demand across these 5 samples is 93.0, and the standard deviation is approximately 32.8. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since I have no actual arrival data yet to suggest the lead time differs from the promise, I will use the default lead time (L=2). To capture the initial demand profile, I will use all 5 available historical samples (recent_N=5) to set the \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 parameters. The backend will calculate the base stock using L=2 (Review + Lead Time = 3 periods of coverage). mu_hat calculation: (1+L)*mean = 3 * 93 = 279. sigma_hat calculation: sqrt(1+L)*std = 1.732 * 32.8 \u2248 56.8. Using recent_N for both ensures we are reactive to the provided starting dataset.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 149 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and becomes visible in the Period 3 conclude message (readable at Period 4). Therefore, seeing arrived=0 in the Period 1 conclude message is expected. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 149 units in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 59 (close to the sample mean). Since we have only 5 samples and a very short history, the default statistical methods (which use all available samples) are appropriate to establish a baseline. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using the target service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95. I will use the default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to let the engine use the provided history of [61, 107, 84, 144, 69].

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 2 periods. We ordered 149 units in Period 1 and 142 units in Period 2 (Total in-transit: 291). Following the lead time definition (Scenario A), the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase, meaning it will appear in the 'Period 3 conclude' message (visible at the start of Period 4). Therefore, seeing 'arrived=0' in the Period 1 and Period 2 conclude messages is expected and does not yet indicate a delay or lost shipment. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (61, 107, 84, 144, 69) shows significant variance. Given we are at the very start of the simulation with only 5 historical samples provided and 2 game-play periods observed, I will use all available samples to estimate demand. I'll set L to default (2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent statistics provided in the prompt, aiming to cover the (L+1)=3 periods of demand required by the OR backend.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (149 units), Period 2 (142 units), and Period 3 (64 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests either a lead time delay (L > 2) or a lost shipment. Given that no units have arrived yet and on-hand inventory is 0, we have experienced significant stockouts (sold=0 for Periods 1-3). The average demand over the first 3 periods is approx 88 units. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the increasing trend (59, 75, 131). For lead time, I will set it to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the delay of the first order which should have arrived by now.

Daily Reward (R_t): $927.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the following: On-hand inventory is 156 units. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times observed are 3 periods (Period 1 order) and 1 period (Period 3 order), averaging 2.0. However, the order from Period 2 (142 units) is still missing (it has been 3 periods since it was placed). Current in-transit quantity is 265 (likely Period 2 + Period 4 orders). Demand samples are 61, 107, 84, 144, 69 (mean ~93). I will use the 'calculate' method for L to account for the variance in delivery, and 'recent_N' for demand to stay responsive to the latest fluctuations. Setting N=5 for demand and sigma as it covers all available data points and reflects the current variance.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we have 47 units on hand and 265 in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 61, 107, 84, 144, 69 (mean \u2248 93). While promised lead time is 2, observed arrivals show high variability (P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, P2 is currently 'missing' or delayed). The total cycle time (review + lead) is (1+L). With L promised at 2, we need to cover 3 periods of demand (approx 279 units). Total pipeline (47 on-hand + 265 in-transit = 312) currently exceeds the expected demand for the lead time, but we must account for the high variance in both demand and lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current regime, and 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed variability in lead times.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 405 units in transit. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility (P1-P6: 59, 75, 131, 57, 109, 127), with a mean of approximately 93 units per period. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (L=3), while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (L=1). Period 2 (ordered P2) is currently overdue as it has been 4 periods since ordering without arrival confirmation. Because of this lead-time variability and the risk of lost or delayed shipments (Period 2), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the longest observed lead time and hedge against the current delay. Demand shows no clear regime shift yet, so I will use the mean of all 6 periods for mu_hat (93 * (1+3) = 372) and the standard deviation (approx 31.8) for sigma_hat (31.8 * sqrt(4) = 63.6).

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile: observed L=3 (P1) and L=1 (P3). Order from P2 is overdue (at least 4 periods elapsed).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are highly volatile: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3. Crucially, the order from Period 2 (142 units) is now 6 periods overdue since the decision and 5 periods since the order conclude, strongly suggesting it is lost. Total demand for the last 7 periods is 504 (avg 72), but the most recent 3 periods (P5-P7) show an average of 94. To account for lead time volatility while being conservative against the lost shipment from P2, I will set L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time). I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand (averaging 90.4) and a recent_N of 3 for volatility to capture the higher recent variance. L=3 implies the backend thinks it needs to cover (3+1)=4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Shipment from Period 2 (142 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods since order). Lead time remains volatile but averages 2.33 for successful deliveries.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2151.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of lead times shows high volatility: observed actual lead times are 3, 1, 3, and 1. The average lead time for successful deliveries is 2.0. However, the order from Period 2 (142 units) is officially confirmed lost (7 periods since ordering), and the order from Period 6 (140 units) is now at lead time 3 with no arrival yet. This suggests a pattern where shipments are either very early (L=1), on time (L=2 - none observed yet), late (L=3), or lost. On-hand inventory is low (34), and we have 367 units in-transit (P6=140, P8=85, P9=... wait, in-transit is 367 which includes P6=140, P7=lost/late, P8=85, plus recent orders). Actually, P7 arrived. In-transit 367 consists of P6 (140), P8 (85), and a projected order. No, P2 is lost. So In-Transit 367 = P6(140) + P8(85) + P9(?) - wait, the user prompt says in-transit is 367 *at the start* of Period 9. Since P7 arrived in P8, the in-transit units are P6 (140) and P8 (85) = 225. There might be a discrepancy in the system's in-transit count or I am miscalculating, but I will focus on parameters. Demand mean (P1-P8) is ~91. Standard deviation is ~34. Given the lead time volatility (avg ~2.0) and the risk of lost orders, I will use an explicit L of 2 to match the promised/average, but I will use a slightly higher N for demand to capture recent volatility. I'll set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (mean ~91) and sigma_hat with N=8 to account for the full range of demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 6 (140 units) is now overdue (3 periods elapsed). Continuous pattern of 'binary' lead times observed: either L=1 or L=3, or Lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1701.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the order from Period 6 (140 units) is now 4 periods overdue, strongly suggesting it is lost like the Period 2 order. Lead times are extremely volatile: they are either 1 period (observed for P3, P7, P8) or 3 periods (observed for P1, P4), or the order is lost. The average 'successful' lead time is (3+1+3+1+1)/5 = 1.8 periods, but the frequent losses (P2, P6) mean the pipeline is unreliable. On-hand inventory is low (28), and the only remaining in-transit order is from Period 10 (which hasn't happened yet in the logic, but the prompt says 282 in-transit, likely reflecting the backend's view of undelivered orders including lost ones). Demand appears stable, averaging ~93 units over the last 9 periods. To protect against the high risk of lost shipments and the 3-period lead time spikes, I will set L to 3 (the upper bound of successful delivery) and use the last 9 periods to estimate demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat).

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 6 (140 units) is confirmed lost (4 periods elapsed since order). Pipeline unreliability is significant: ~22% loss rate (2 out of 9 orders).

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state is critical (0 on-hand) due to a shipment loss in Period 6 and failed arrivals in Period 10. We have observed a binary lead time pattern (L=1 or L=3) and a high loss rate (~20%). Current historical demand mean is ~91 units. Since we are at 0 on-hand and relying on a pipeline of 425 units (from P10 and likely P11 order), we must set parameters that account for the 2-3 period lead time and the high variance. L=2 is the promise, but we've seen L=3 frequently. I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the average real-world lead time (estimated ~2.3 in insights). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the demand average of the last 10 periods (approx 91 units/period), which for L+1 (approx 3.3) suggests a base stock target around 300. The OR backend will subtract the 425 in-transit units, potentially resulting in a small or zero order this period if it perceives the pipeline as full, though the pipeline contains potential losses. By keeping mu_hat and sigma_hat focused on recent history, we avoid overreacting to the stockout while acknowledging the supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability: Lead times are inconsistent (1 or 3 periods) with a ~20% complete loss rate (P2 and P6 lost). Current pipeline of 425 units is high, but reliability is low.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme instability. We have an on-hand inventory of 0 and have experienced stockouts in the last 2 periods. Historical lead times for successful deliveries are either 1 period or 3 periods, while shipments from Period 2 and Period 6 (totaling 282 units) are confirmed lost. The promised lead time is 2, but the actual average for delivered orders is roughly 2.33. Period 12 starts with 0 on-hand and 425 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 10 and 11). Given the high loss rate (~20%) and the 'binary' lead time distribution (1 or 3), I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high-end delay and prevents further stockouts. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging ~93 units over the last 11 periods. I'll use explicit forecasting to target a demand buffer that accounts for the (L+1) horizon with high reliability, especially since we are currently at zero inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain reliability remains the primary constraint: ~18% loss rate (2 lost out of 11 orders placed); lead times are bifurcated at 1 or 3 periods (Average ~2.33).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the primary challenge remains supply chain volatility and reliability. We have seen lead times of 1, 2, and 3 periods, along with two confirmed lost shipments (P2 and P6). The most recent order (P10) arrived in 2 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 51, and we have 333 units in transit (ordered in P12/P13, though P12's 51 units are the only specific recent volume noted in history). Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~94 units over the last 10 periods (P3-P12). Given the ~18% loss rate and the variability (L=1 to 3), I am setting L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum observed successful lead time plus the review period (L+1=4 periods). This provides a buffer against both delayed arrivals and the risk of future lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time distribution now includes L=1, L=2, and L=3. Reliability remains a concern with an ~18% loss rate. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages ~94 units/period.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has averaged 93.6 units over the last 10 periods (P4-P13), showing no significant regime shift from the early mean. The primary challenge is lead-time volatility and shipment loss. Historical lead times for successful arrivals are 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, resulting in an average of 1.83. However, with an ~18% loss rate (P2 and P6 lost), relying on the 'promised' lead time of 2 is risky. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the upper bound of successful deliveries and provide a buffer against the observed unreliability. Mu_hat will use the recent 10-period average of ~94 units per period across (1+L=4) periods. Sigma_hat is calculated for N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0). The pipeline is quite large (473 units), comprised of orders from P12 (51), P13 (96), P14 (44), and whatever we order now. Looking at history, lead times are volatile: P10 arrived in 2 periods (P12), but P12 and P13 have not arrived yet. P12 is now at L=3 (overdue), and P13 is at L=2. Given the ~18% loss rate recorded in insights, we must assume some pipeline may be lost. Demand is relatively stable. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to account for the variety of observed durations (1, 2, and 3 periods). For demand (mu_hat), a recent_N of 10 periods (P5-P14) gives a mean of approximately 100 units/period, which reflects the current regime better than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the overall volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability continues: P12 order is now 3 periods old and hasn't arrived, while P10 took 2 periods. Pipeline reliability remains the primary operational risk.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a confirmed loss rate of ~15% (P2 and P6 lost out of 13 orders older than lead time) and volatile lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we are experiencing stockouts (Period 15 demand was 89, but we only sold 51). The pipeline is significant (422 units), but includes potentially delayed or lost shipments. The order from Period 13 is now 3 periods old and has not arrived, making it high-risk. Recent demand has stabilized around a mean of 97 units over the last 10 periods. To account for the unreliability and frequent stockouts, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the maximum observed lead time durations plus the review period. Mu_hat will use the last 10 periods (recent_N=10) to capture current demand levels without being skewed by very early data. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 15 tracking: P13 order (96 units) is now 3 periods old and overdue based on Promised L=2. P14 (44 units) is 2 periods old. Stockouts have occurred in 3 of the last 5 periods due to supply delays.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 50 units and a pipeline of 369 units. The supply chain is highly unstable, characterized by a ~15-20% loss rate (P2 and P6 lost) and lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.33). Recent history shows stockouts in 4 of the last 7 periods due to these delivery delays. The order from P13 (96 units) arrived in P16 (L=3), and we are still waiting on P14 (44 units, now 3 periods old), P15 (0 ordered), and P16 (43 units). To account for the unreliability, I am setting L to 3. Specifically, mu_hat is set to cover 4 periods (L=3 + 1 review period) using the mean of the last 10 periods (avg ~91) to capture recent demand levels, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 364. Sigma_hat is calculated for 4 periods using recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: P13 order arrived at L=3. P14 (ordered P14) is now overdue (3 periods elapsed). Supply chain remains volatile with L frequently reaching 3 periods and a historical loss rate of ~15%.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that demand is relatively stable but supply chain performance is erratic. The last few periods have shown actual lead times of L=3 (for Period 13 and 14 orders) and L=1 (for the Period 16 order). The promised lead time is 2, but the historical average of successful arrivals is approximately 2.1-2.3 based on recent data. We also account for a significant loss rate (~15-18%) where orders from P2 and P6 never arrived. To protect against this lead time variance and potential stockouts (which occurred frequently between P10 and P15), the L parameter is set to 3. This forces the base stock calculation to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1). mu_hat is calculated using the last 10 periods (avg ~91 units/period), resulting in 91 * 4 = 364. sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time distribution remains unstable with arrivals split between L=1 and L=3. Total loss rate is holding at ~15% (2/13 total orders concluded). Recent 10-period demand average is approximately 91 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1425.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we experienced another stockout (ending on-hand: 0). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a bifurcated lead time (1 or 3 periods) and an approximate 15% loss rate. Currently, there are 364 units in transit (ordered in P10-P18), which is substantial compared to the 10-period demand average of ~91 units. However, given that shipment reliability is poor and the promised lead time of 2 is frequently exceeded (L=3 is common), I am setting L to 3 to ensure the OR backend's target base stock reflects a longer lead time window. mu_hat is set using the last 15 periods to capture the stable demand regime (~92 units/period) while accounting for the current stockout pressure and high inventory pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain remains unstable: observed lead times for successful deliveries continue to vary between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.4). Cumulative order loss rate remains ~15%.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be the primary challenge, with on-hand inventory at 0 and a current stockout. Analysis of the game history shows that successful lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, with an average around 2.4. Crucially, the order from Period 18 is now overdue (2 periods elapsed without arrival) and the pipeline includes 441 units (Periods 18 and 19 orders). Given the high loss rate identified in carry-over insights (~15%), I must assume some pipeline reliability risk. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays and protect against the high stockout frequency seen recently. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a mean of 86.6 units with moderate volatility. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime, allowing the OR backend to calculate base stock for a (L+1) horizon of 4 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be the primary friction point. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 for the third consecutive period (following stockouts in Periods 18, 19, and 20) despite having 441 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times are bifurcated between L=1 and L=3, with a significant loss rate (approx 15%). Specifically, the orders from Period 17 (29 units) and Period 18 (53 units) are now 3 and 2 periods old respectively. Given the 'regular' nature of the product and consistent demand, I am setting L to 3 to account for the frequent delays and the observed 3-period arrivals (e.g., P13 and P14). I'll use the last 10 periods of demand (avg ~84) to calculate mu_hat, but since we are currently stocked out and the pipeline is huge (441 units), the OR backend's capped policy will likely prevent over-ordering while we wait for the logjam of in-transit units to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Persistent supply chain unreliability confirmed: lead times frequently hit 3 periods vs promised 2. A large pipeline of 441 units exists, but the system is currently experiencing a 3-period stockout due to delivery delays.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted. As of Period 22, we are in a 4-period stockout (Periods 18-21 conclude with 0 sales) despite an 'In-transit' pipeline of 441 units. This pipeline comprises orders from Period 17 (29 units, 5 periods old), Period 18 (53 units, 4 periods old), Period 19 (77 units, 3 periods old), and likely subsequent periods not yet detailed in the 'conclude' history but included in the 441 total. Historically, we've seen L=3 as a common upper bound for successful deliveries, and orders older than 4-5 periods (P2, P6) were lost. The current pipeline of 441 units is extremely high (nearly 5x current mean demand), but none are arriving. If we set L=3 (explicitly), the OR backend will calculate a base stock. However, because the current pipeline (441) already exceeds any reasonable base stock (approx. (1+3)*90 = 360), the OR backend will order 0. To mitigate the risk of the current pipeline being significantly 'lost' or further delayed, I will use 'explicit' L=3 to reflect the reality of delivery times, while keeping the demand forecast (mu_hat) stable around the 10-period mean (~90/period).

Carry-over insight: Persistent delivery failure: As of P22, the system has 441 units in transit but has had 0 arrivals for 4 consecutive periods (P18-P21). Current stockout duration: 4 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of severe crisis. As of Period 23, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and has experienced a 5-period stockout (Periods 18-22). Although there are 441 units 'in-transit', there have been no arrivals for 5 consecutive periods. The pipeline consists of orders from P17 (29 units), P18 (53 units), P19 (77 units), P20 (140 units), and P21 (142 units) - identifying that the 'in-transit' total likely includes very old, potentially lost orders from earlier periods not explicitly cleared. Given that lead times have frequently hit 3 periods and are now extending past 5, I am setting L to 4 as an explicit estimate to account for this slowdown. For demand, the average over the last 10 periods is ~83 units; I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture this stable but currently unfulfillable demand. I am keeping \u03c3\u0302 at the default level to allow the OR logic to calculate based on historical volatility. The OR engine will place a 'cap' on the order based on the pipeline, but given the high probability that most of the 441 units are lost (similar to P2 and P6), the pipeline inventory subtraction may prevent necessary ordering. However, I must work within the OR logic which subtracts pipeline; therefore, increasing L is the primary lever to raise the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse: 0 arrivals for 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22). Cumulative stockout has reached 5 periods. Pipeline of 441 units is likely contaminated with lost shipments, as historical loss rate was ~15% but recent performance suggests a higher failure rate or a lead-time shift exceeding 5 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has effectively collapsed, with zero arrivals for six consecutive periods (P18-P23) despite a massive in-transit pipeline of 506 units. Historically, deliveries take between 1 to 3 periods, or are lost entirely (~15% rate). The current 5-6 period gap suggests that the orders from P17 (29), P18 (53), P19 (77), and P23 (65) are still in the pipeline, but previous orders (from P2-P6 range) are confirmed lost or severely delayed. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we are in a prolonged stockout, I will set lead time L explicitly to 3, reflecting the Upper Bound of observed arrival times. I will use the recent_N method (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (~88 units/period). Even though the pipeline is large, the OR engine's 'cap' and the risk of further lost shipments justify maintaining parameters that prioritize high service levels once deliveries resume.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: zero arrivals for 6 consecutive periods (P18-P23). All orders placed between P17 and P22 are significantly overdue or lost. Demand remains stable near 88 units/period, but stockouts are persistent due to delivery failure.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has effectively collapsed, with zero arrivals for seven consecutive periods (P18-P24). Orders placed from Period 17 onwards (seven orders totaling 506 units) are significantly overdue or lost. The base stock policy relies on pipeline inventory to reduce current ordering; however, since the existing pipeline is likely comprised of lost shipments, the OR engine will incorrectly conclude no new orders are needed. To force a reorder despite the 'ghost' pipeline, I am setting an explicit L=7 to reflect the current delay and a very high mu_hat. This targets a base stock that exceeds the 506 units currently in-transit, triggering the OR engine to place a fresh order to break the stockout. Demand remains stable with a recent 10-period mean of approximately 83 units.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: zero arrivals for 7 consecutive periods (P18-P24). The entire pipeline of 506 units is currently non-responsive, suggesting either a massive lead-time shift to L > 7 or a 100% loss rate for the last 7 orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1235.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, a critical breakthrough occurred: the shipment from Period 23 arrived with a lead time of 2 periods (arrived=65). This breaks a 7-period streak of zero arrivals (P18-P24). However, all orders placed between Period 17 and Period 22 (totaling 212 units) are now 4-9 periods old and have still not arrived, confirming they are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. The current on-hand inventory is 0 after selling the 65 units that arrived last period. The 'In-transit' figure of 635 is misleading because it includes these likely lost orders. Mean demand remains stable (approximately 85-90 units). Given the supply chain's extreme unreliability and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), I must order aggressively to rebuild stock. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals seen earlier, and using recent_N (N=10) for demand to capture the current stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain activity resumed in Period 25 (P23 order arrived at L=2). However, orders from P17-P22 (212 units) remain missing for 4-9 periods and are finalized as lost. Pipeline reliability is extremely poor, but the channel is not completely closed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, we observe that the supply chain partially recovered in Period 25 with a lead time of L=2 for the Period 23 order. However, a significant gap of 7 periods (P17-P22) remains with no arrivals, leading to a massive loss of inventory and stockouts. Historical analysis confirms orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20 are now between 6 to 9 periods old; given the typical maximum observed L is 3, these 212 units are almost certainly lost. The current In-transit balance of 635 includes these dead units. To correct for this, I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for the actual demand (approx 90-100/period) while essentially ignoring the 'phantom' pipeline that the OR backend assumes is real. Since the backend order logic is min(base_stock - pipeline, cap), and it sees a pipeline of 635, it will not order unless mu_hat is set extremely high. The recent demand mean (last 10 samples) is 86.3. With a target service level and the need to overcome the phantom pipeline, I will set mu_hat to a high explicit value to force an order, while setting L=3 to reflect the high-end of successful delivery times.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure confirmed: Orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, and 20 (212 units) are now 6+ periods old and classified as lost. Pipeline inventory of 635 units is ~33% comprised of lost shipments. Demand remains stable at approx 86 units/period (last 10 periods).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. Since Period 17, a total of 10 orders were placed. Of these, 4 (Periods 17, 18, 19, 20) are confirmed lost (6+ periods elapsed), and only 1 (Period 23) has arrived. The status of orders from Periods 25 and 27 is unknown but critical. Though in-transit inventory is 873, the 'effective' pipeline is likely near zero due to the ~15-20% cumulative and recent ~60-80% failure rates. Stockouts have persisted for nearly 10 periods. I will set L to 3 (the upper bound of successful historical arrivals) and mu_hat to an explicit value covering 4 periods (L+1) of the recent 10-period average demand (~86 units/period). I use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the OR engine's inclusion of lost shipments in the pipeline calculation, effectively over-ordering to compensate for the high loss probability and clear out the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure confirmed: Orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, and 20 (212 units total) are confirmed lost after 7+ periods. The current 873 units in-transit includes these 212 dead units, plus heavily delayed shipments from P21-P22 which are likely also lost.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is currently experiencing severe failure. Out of the 873 units listed as 'In-transit', a significant portion is confirmed lost or extremely overdue. Specifically, orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, and 20 (totaling 212 units) are now 8+ periods old and are considered lost. Furthermore, orders from P21-P22 (also recorded as in-transit) have not arrived after 6+ periods and are likely lost. The only recent successful delivery was the P23 order arriving at L=2 in Period 25. Since P25, no further arrivals have occurred. Demand remains stable, with the most recent 10-period average at approximately 80.5 units. To account for the 212 units confirmed lost that are still clogging the 'pipeline_inventory' calculation in the OR backend (In-transit = 873), I will set an 'explicit' L to 3 (observed upper bound for successful deliveries) and an 'explicit' mu_hat. Because the backend calculates order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap), and pipeline (873) is artificially inflated by lost units, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the 'cap' (order = cap) to ensure a steady stream of new orders despite the ghost inventory. The cap formula is approximately mean/(1+L) + 1.645*std/sqrt(1+L). Using the recent mean of ~81 and L=3, the cap should be around 50-60 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to force the system to ignore the 'lost' pipeline units and place the maximum allowed capped order to fight the ongoing stockout.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20 (212 units total) are confirmed lost (8+ periods elapsed). P21-P22 shipments are also likely lost. Effective pipeline is significantly lower than the reported 873 units. Lead time for successful deliveries remains 2-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1022.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the system shows 175 units on-hand after a large arrival of 238 units (ordered P27). However, the supply chain remains highly unreliable. Orders from P17, P18, P19, P20, P21, P22, and P25 (totaling 406 units) are significantly overdue and likely lost. The current 'In-transit' of 1039 units is heavily inflated by these dead units (+ possibly P23 and P28 volatility). Subtracting the 406 confirmed/highly likely lost units and the 404 units just ordered in P29 leaves an 'effective' pipeline that is much smaller. Demand over the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 79 units/period, but significant stockouts have obscured actual demand levels. Given the high loss rate (~35% of all historical orders) and lead time variability (L=1 to 3, but often L=Infinity), I will use 'explicit' methods to ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock to compensate for the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. I set L=3 as a conservative lead time estimate and mu_hat to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1) at approximately 90 units/period (360) to maintain a buffer, while sigma_hat is set explicitly to reflect the high volatility of both arrival and demand.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 30, at least 406 units in the pipeline (from P17-P22 and P25) are effectively lost, having exceeded 5+ periods since ordering. Recent successful arrivals (P23, P27) show a functional lead time of 2 periods, but the overall loss rate for the SKU has escalated to ~35%. Current in-transit figures are not representative of future arrivals.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced extreme instability with a significant portion of the pipeline being lost. Specifically, orders from P17-P22 and P25 (totaling 406 units) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue (+5-8 periods since ordering). Although P27 arrived on time (L=2), the overall reliability is approximately 65%. On-hand inventory is 84 units, and the reported in-transit is 1039, but the 'effective' pipeline is much lower (approx 633 units after removing confirmed losses). Demand is relatively stable, averaging ~86 units over the last 10 periods. I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent delays observed in successful deliveries (L=1 to L=3). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 860 for L+1=4). For sigma_hat, I will use an explicit value of 150 to reflect the high uncertainty in supply arrivals, which effectively increases the required safety stock to prevent stockouts during delivery lapses.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain loss rate updated: ~39% of units ordered (406 units total) since P17 are confirmed lost. Recent successful deliveries (P23, P27) show a functional lead time of 2 periods, but periodic total failures persist.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) remains highly unreliable. While the promised lead time is 2 periods, successful deliveries fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, and there is a massive loss rate (estimated at ~39% recently). Currently, we are in a stockout (on-hand: 0) despite a reported 'in-transit' pipeline of 1039 units. Analysis of the history shows that orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, 20 (212 units), 21, 22 (130 units), and 25 (194 units) are almost certainly lost as they have exceeded 6+ periods since placement. This means approximately 536 units of the 1039 in-transit units are 'phantom' inventory. Demand remains relatively stable, averaging ~86 units over the last 10 periods. To compensate for the loss rate and lead time volatility, I am setting \u03bc\u0302 explicitly to cover the expected demand for the lead time (avg 2.4) + 1 review period, adjusted for the high probability of shipment failure. I'm using an explicit L of 3 to reflect the late arrivals and setting \u03c3\u0302 using the most recent 10-period volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed massive pipeline loss: Orders from P17-P22 and P25 (total 536 units) are lost. Effective in-transit is closer to 503 units (from P29 and P32). Total SKU loss rate since P17 is approximately 50%.

The supply chain for chips(Regular) remains highly unreliable and prone to massive delays or losses. On-hand inventory is 0. The nominal 'In-transit' of 1039 units is heavily inflated by lost orders. Specifically, orders from P17-P22 (212 units) and P25 (194 units) are definitively lost as they (and more recent orders) have been bypassed or significantly exceeded the 2-3 period functional lead time. A more realistic 'effective' pipeline includes the P29 order (404 units) which is now in its 4th period of transit and remains the primary hope for replenishment. Demand is stable, averaging ~86 units/period. The OR backend needs to place a replenishment order but its logic counts the entire 1039 units and thus will order 0 unless the parameters are adjusted. By increasing L to 3 (the upper bound of successful delivery) and sigma_hat significantly, we signal the risk of stockout due to volatility. However, since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to force a safety stock calculation that recognizes the massive portion of the pipeline that is non-existent.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination: 406 units (P17-P22, P25) are confirmed lost. Effective pipeline is 404 units (ordered P29) plus any order placed today. Lead time for successful deliveries remains 2-3 periods despite promised 2.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised with a long-term loss rate exceeding 40%. The 'In-transit' figure of 1062 units is deeply misleading as it includes at least 536 units from P17-P25 that are confirmed lost. The remaining pipeline consists of P29 (404 units), P33 (23 units), and today's order. Since P29 was ordered 5 periods ago and hasn't arrived (while recent successful leads were 2 periods), there is a high probability that P29 is also lost or significantly delayed. Despite a nominal pipeline of 1062, current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced a 2-period stockout. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the extreme supply volatility and the necessary inventory buffer to combat the high loss rate. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the high end of successful delivery times, though the primary issue is reliability, not just lead time duration.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Reliability Update: Orders from P17-P22 and P25 (536 units) are 100% lost. Order from P29 (404 units) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting a high probability of loss or extreme delay. Effective pipeline is likely <10% of reported 'In-transit' value.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is currently highly dysfunctional. Analysis of the 1062 units 'In-transit' reveals that at least 940 units are likely lost or permanently delayed: P17-P20 (212 units), P21-P22 (130 units), P25 (194 units), and P29 (404 units, now 5 periods overdue with no arrival). Successful deliveries recently (P23, P27) show a functional lead time of 2 periods, but the loss rate since Period 17 is nearly 75%. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire 'pipeline_inventory' (1062 units) from the base stock, it will not place any new orders unless I artificially inflate the parameters. I am setting mu_hat using an 'explicit' value calculated to override the 1062 'ghost' units in transit. Given a mean demand of approximately 88 units/period and an estimated functional lead time L=3 (to be safe), I need a base stock higher than 1062 to trigger an order. I am setting mu_hat to 1200 and sigma_hat to 200 to force the backend to place a restorative order, while setting L to 3 to reflect the actual delay observed in non-lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination reached critical levels in P35: ~88% of 'In-transit' units (940 out of 1062) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue (5+ periods). Effective pipeline is currently near zero.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of near-total collapse. Since Period 17, the SKU has experienced a loss rate of approximately 88% of units ordered. Specifically, orders from P17-P22, P25, and now likely P29 (404 units, now 6 periods overdue) are lost. This renders the reported 'In-transit' figure of 1527 units highly misleading; the 'effective' pipeline is likely only the order placed in P35 (465 units) and anything ordered now. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have been in a stockout for the last 4 periods. While demand has slightly softened recently (avg ~60-70), the massive risk is supply failure rather than holding cost. To prevent further stockouts and compensate for the ~88% loss rate, I am setting L to 4 (explicit) to reflect the extreme delays/losses and using an explicit mu_hat that reflects a target inventory for 5 periods of demand (L+1) at approx 90 units/period, essentially forcing the OR engine to place a large order to bypass the 'dead' pipeline units. Sigma is set high to account for the extreme supply variance.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination reached critical levels: ~88% of 'In-transit' units are lost or >6 periods overdue. Supply channel effectively delivers <15% of units ordered since P17. Demand remains stable ~85-90 units/period despite current stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is in a state of severe unreliability. Analysis of the 1,527 units 'In-transit' shows a massive contamination of lost shipments: Orders from P17-P22 (212 units), P25 (194 units), and P29 (404 units) have all exceeded a 7-period threshold without arrival, totaling 810 dead units. Furthermore, the P33 order (23 units) is now 4 periods old. The only potentially viable inventory is the 465 units ordered in P35. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire (mostly phantom) pipeline from the base stock, it will not place new orders despite the 6-period stockout. To force the system to bypass the 'In-transit' block and account for the high loss rate (~75% recently), I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that represents the required inventory to cover the lead time plus a significant buffer for losses, effectively tricking the capped policy into ordering. Demand remains stable at approx 80-90 units/period (average of last 10 non-zero demand periods is ~74, but including stockout periods lowers this artificially). I will set L to 'explicit' 3 to align with the maximum successful historical lead time, and set mu_hat to cover current demand plus the backlog of the persistent stockout.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline loss reached ~85% for orders placed between P17 and P33. Effective 'In-transit' is significantly lower than reported due to at least 810 units being confirmed lost (exceeding 7 periods). Average lead time for successful deliveries when they occur is 2.33 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $915.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, a large shipment of 465 units (ordered P35) arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, bringing on-hand inventory to 396 units. Historical data shows extreme supply chain instability: a massive block of orders from P17-P32 (excluding P23 and P27) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue, totaling over 800 units. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1062 is misleading as it includes these dead units. Only the 23 units ordered in P33 and 0 units ordered since are potentially viable. Demand remains relatively stable, averaging ~86 units over the last 10 periods. With 396 units on hand and 2-period lead time for successful deliveries, we are covered for the next ~4 periods. Given the high loss rate (~85% recently), I will set L to 3 to provide extra buffer in the base stock calculation, use the last 10 samples for demand (N=10) to capture the current mean, and maintain default sigma to account for the high variance caused by frequent stockouts and supply gaps.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain remains highly unreliable with a ~85% loss rate for orders placed between P17 and P33. While the P35 order arrived successfully in 2 periods, the 'In-transit' tally is heavily inflated by at least 810 units that are confirmed lost. Effective lead time for successful deliveries is 2-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1004.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is extremely unreliable, characterized by a ~85% loss rate for orders placed between Period 17 and Period 33. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1062 is misleadingly high because at least 810 units (P17-P22, P25, P29) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue (5-21 periods elapsed). Period 35's order did arrive in 2 periods, providing some current stock (326 units on-hand), but the overall channel remains volatile. Demand has stabilized at a lower level recently, averaging ~67 units over the last 10 periods (P29-P38). Given the high on-hand inventory relative to recent demand and the extreme risk of order loss/lead-time volatility, I will set L to 3 (the maximum successful lead time) to ensure the OR backend accounts for potential delays. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (~67-70 units) and sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect current volatility. This conservative approach balances the current stock surplus against the high probability that any new order placed might never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain loss rate remains extremely high (~85% for the mid-game period); 'In-transit' counts are heavily inflated by dead inventory. Effective lead time for successful deliveries is 2-3 periods. Recent demand (P29-P38) has shifted lower to an average of ~67 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $854.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, on-hand inventory is 267 units. Reviewing the pipeline of 1062 units, historical data confirms major contamination: orders from P17-P22 (212 units), P25 (194 units), P29 (404 units), and P33 (23 units) totaling 833 units are lost or excessively overdue (7+ periods, 15+ periods, 11 periods, and 7 periods respectively). Only the order from P35 has arrived recently (P37, L=2). Since arriving inventory from P35, demand has been stable but slightly lower, averaging ~66 units/period over the last 10 periods (P30-P39). With on-hand inventory at 267 and demand at ~66, we have approximately 4 periods of safety stock. Given the high loss rate (estimated at >80% for the mid-game period), the backend's pipeline-based ordering must be handled carefully. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect the slightly lower demand regime and use calculate for L to leverage the actual lead times of successful deliveries (averaging ~2.3) rather than the promised 2. This balance protects against the unreliable pipeline while not over-ordering into a high-holding-cost scenario as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~66 units/period (avg P30-P39). Pipeline remains severely compromised: 833 out of 1062 'In-transit' units are confirmed lost or >7 periods overdue. Effective lead time for successful arrivals is 2.3 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely compromised with a historical order loss rate exceeding 80% for the middle game (Periods 17-33). Currently, the 'In-transit' figure of 1062 units is heavily inflated by 833 units that are confirmed lost or significantly overdue, leaving an 'effective' pipeline of only 229 units (from recent orders). In Period 41, we have 179 units on-hand. Current demand has stabilized in a lower regime, averaging approximately 66 units/period over the last 10 periods. With L=2 promised and an actual lead time of ~2.3 periods for successful deliveries, we need to maintain a base stock covering ~3 periods of demand (~198-250 units). The current on-hand inventory (179) plus the small remaining 'true' pipeline is sufficient for the immediate period, but given the extreme volatility and high loss risk, I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current lower demand regime and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the actual delays observed in successful arrivals. No order is likely to be triggered by the OR backend due to the inflated (though mostly lost) in-transit count, which serves as a necessary buffer against holding costs until the next successful delivery clarifies the pipeline status.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a lower stable regime, averaging 66 units/period (P30-P40). Total pipeline contamination is quantified: 833 units out of 1062 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (orders from P17-P33).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a lower average of approximately 66 units/period (based on P30-P41). The primary operational challenge is extreme supply chain unreliability and 'ghost' pipeline inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 1062 is highly misleading: 833 units are confirmed lost (orders from P17-P33), leaving only the P35 order (which already arrived) and any subsequent orders. However, the system currently shows 104 units on-hand, which covers nearly 1.5 periods of demand. Given the ~85% loss rate observed since P17, the OR backend's default logic (which considers the 1062 units as valid pipeline) would prevent any new orders. To bypass this and ensure we maintain stock against the high probability of future delivery failures, I am using 'explicit' L and mu_hat. I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and mu_hat to 400 (roughly 6 periods of demand) to force the OR engine to recognize we need more inventory, effectively discounting the dead pipeline units. This buffer is necessary to survive the 85% shipment loss rate.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 43. I have 38 units on hand. The 'In-transit' balance of 1062 is highly misleading, as historical data (see carry-over insights) confirms that 833 units are lost and the P29 order (404 units) is significantly overdue and almost certainly lost. This means the effective pipeline is zero. A new demand regime has stabilized since Period 30, averaging approximately 66 units per period. Although the promised lead time is 2, successful arrivals (P23, P25, P27, P35) frequently occur at L=2, but the risk of complete shipment loss is extremely high (estimated >50% since Period 17). To recover from the current depleting on-hand stock and account for the high loss rate, I must place a new order. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=13 to capture the post-P30 regime) and 'explicit' for L to account for the standard lead time of the functional shipments, while the OR backend's safety stock will help buffer the high variance and loss risk.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 42, the effective pipeline is confirmed to be zero; 100% of the 1062 'In-transit' units are lost or >7 periods overdue (P17-P33). Successful shipments since the collapse follow a lead time of 2 periods but with a very high failure rate.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) as of Period 43. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime, averaging 68.6 units/period over the last 10 periods (P34-P43). The pipeline of 1062 units is entirely comprised of orders from Period 35 or earlier (specifically P17-P35); documented evidence confirms that all these units (including the large P29 and P35 batches mentioned in previous insights as 'lost' or 'arrived') are either already accounted for or lost. Effectively, the pipeline is zero. A major order is required to restore service level. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime (average ~69) while setting L to 'calculate' to best approximate the actual lead time (which averages ~2.3 for successful deliveries). This will trigger a replenishment order to cover the next 3 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 44, the effective pipeline is confirmed zero: 100% of the 1062 'In-transit' units are confirmed lost or already arrived/consumed. Recent demand regime (last 10 periods) has stabilized at 68.6 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 45 out of 50. Analysis of the supply chain shows that the 1062 units 'In-transit' are confirmed lost or non-responsive, as they originate from orders placed between P17 and P35 that have far exceeded any plausible lead time. The most recent successful arrival occurred in Period 37 (ordered P35), and no arrivals have occurred since. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime, averaging approximately 68.6 units over the last 10 periods (P35-P44). With on-hand inventory at 0 and the effective pipeline also at 0, an order is required to meet demand for the remaining 5 periods. I am setting L to explicit 3 to account for the historical tendency of successful deliveries to take 1-3 periods, providing a buffer against recent volatility. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current stable demand regime of ~69 units/period. The OR backend will calculate the order size based on these parameters, ignoring the 'phantom' 1062 units in-transit because the base_stock will exceed the (incorrectly) perceived pipeline only if the parameters reflect the true current need.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has been extremely unreliable, with a total loss rate exceeding 80% for orders placed between Period 17 and Period 34. Currently, the environment shows 'In-transit: 1062 units', but historical monitoring confirms that 100% of these units are either from lost shipments (P17-P33) or have already failed to arrive within any reasonable lead-time window. Effectively, pipeline inventory is zero. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the mean of the last 15 samples is ~69.6 units. Despite the high In-transit figure, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). To trigger an order from the OR backend despite the inflated pipeline, I will set 'mu_hat' explicitly to represent the inventory needed for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50), adjusted for the stockout. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline from base_stock, and the pipeline is 'stuck' at 1062, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome this ghost inventory. However, the game is ending in Period 50. Ordering now (Period 46) means an arrival in Period 48 or 49 (given L=2 or 3). I will use explicit values to bypass the backend's standard calculations which would be misled by the 'In-transit' data.

Carry-over insight: Final confirmation: Effective pipeline is 0 units despite the reported 1062 units; all in-transit stock corresponds to lost orders from P17-P35.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 of 50. The reported 'In-transit' of 1400 units is entirely compromised by confirmed historical losses from Periods 17-35 (at least 1062 units). The recent order in Period 46 (338 units) is the only active shipment, but given the 2-period promised lead time, it will not arrive until Period 48. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 68 units/period (last 10 periods). With only 4 periods remaining in the game (47, 48, 49, 50), any order placed now (Period 47) would arrive in Period 49 at the earliest, assuming a best-case lead time of 2. We must ensure we cover the remaining demand for periods 49 and 50 while being mindful of the high supply-chain loss rate (~85% historically during the mid-game, though recent performance is sparse). I will set L to the promised 2 periods (as recent successful deliveries like P35 arrived at L=2), mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand based on the recent regime (68 * 3 \u2248 204), and increase sigma_hat to account for high supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Effective pipeline contains only the order from Period 46 (338 units); all previous 'In-transit' units (1062) are confirmed lost. Recent demand regime is stable at ~68 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the system reports 1400 units in-transit. However, based on the history and Carry-over Insights (specifically from Period 47), 1062 of these units are confirmed lost/non-existent orders from Periods 17-35. The only viable order in the pipeline is the one placed in Period 46 (338 units). Since the promised lead time is 2, this order should arrive during Period 48's arrival phase (visible in Period 49's conclude). Current on-hand is 0. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 68 units/period (mean of last 10 periods). Since we are at Period 48 of 50, and the lead time is 2, any order placed now (P48) will arrive in Period 50. An order placed in Period 49 would arrive too late to be sold within the 50-period horizon. Therefore, I must ensure current pipeline coverage for Periods 48, 49, and 50. The 338 units coming from P46 should cover the demand for P48 and P49, but to avoid a stockout in P50 (the final period), I will place an order now. I'll use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the 68 units/period demand regime, and 'explicit' for L=2 despite historical volatility, as recent successful deliveries (P35, P27, P23) have consistently defaulted to L=2 or L=3. I'm choosing L=2 to provide sufficient base stock for the final horizons.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final decision period (P49) of the game. Historical records indicate that the 'In-transit' count of 1400 units includes 1062 units that are confirmed lost (orders from P17-P35) and a recent order of 338 units from P46. In P49, we are looking for arrivals from P46 (L=3 scenario) or later. Since this is the penultimate step before the game ends at P50, and our on-hand inventory is currently 0, we must ensure enough stock arrives to satisfy demand for the final period. The 'In-transit' figure is significantly inflated; the effective pipeline is only 338 units. Demand has stabilized around 68-70 units per period recently. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to use historical delivery data, acknowledging that the system must handle the 'missing' units which effectively don't exist.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Final stage reached. Effective pipeline is only 338 units (P46 order); the remaining 1062 'In-transit' units are confirmed lost shipments from P17-P35. Demand has stabilized at ~69 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision phase of the game. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported pipeline is 1,400 units, but based on extensive historical tracking (Periods 17-49), only 338 units (ordered in P46) are considered 'live'. The other 1,062 units are lost shipments from the P17-P35 window. With a promised lead time of 2 periods and an observed successful lead time of 2-3 periods, the P46 order (338 units) should arrive during Period 48 or 49 (resolution phase). However, it hasn't appeared in the P49 conclusion, suggesting it matches the L=3 pattern and should arrive in the Period 50 resolution (after this decision). Since this is the final period, any order placed now will not arrive in time to satisfy Period 50 demand (as arrivals happen after the decision but before demand resolution of the *same* period only if L=0; here L>=1). Therefore, ordering more is futile and only risks holding costs if the game were to continue. I will set parameters to minimize any unnecessary 'ghost' orders while acknowledging the stable demand regime of ~69 units/period.
