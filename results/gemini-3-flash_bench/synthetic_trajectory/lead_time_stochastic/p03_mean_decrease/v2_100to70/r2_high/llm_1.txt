The average demand is approximately 93 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 33. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In a (L+1) planning horizon, I need to cover Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 demand. Total expected demand for 3 periods is ~279 units. Since I start with 0 On-hand and 0 In-transit, I must place an order immediately to begin filling the pipeline. Given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the cost of stockouts is much higher than the cost of holding inventory. Therefore, I will order enough to cover the expected demand for the lead-time plus current period plus a safety stock margin (~1 standard deviation) to account for volatility observed in the history.",

Demand history (61, 107, 84, 144, 69) and the Period 1 demand of 66 suggest a mean demand of approximately 88 units per period. Since I need to cover demand for Period 2 and Period 3 (before the Period 1 order arrives) plus maintaining a safety stock for Period 4, I must account for the fact that I am currently stocked out. Total pipeline needed = Expected demand during (L+1) periods = 88 * 3 = 264 units. I already have 312 units in transit (intended to arrive in P3). However, I have 0 on-hand for P2, so I will naturally stock out this period. To ensure I have enough for P4 and beyond while the next order (placed now in P2) arrives in P4, I will place a moderate order to buffer against demand variance, targeting an inventory position that covers roughly 3-4 periods of demand. Current Inventory Position (OH + IT) = 312. Projected demand until next arrival (P2, P3, P4) \u2248 264. I will order 120 units to maintain a healthy pipeline and recover from the initial stockout.",

Target inventory for (L+1) = 3 periods of demand is 300 units; for a conservative (L+2) = 4 periods is 400 units. e) Final Order Logic: Current inventory position (393) is sufficient to cover the next 3-4 periods.

The primary challenge is a high rate of shipment loss; previous periods indicate that approximately 20-30% of orders never arrive (e.g., P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Lead times for successful arrivals vary between 1 and 3 periods. Looking at the current 'In-transit' of 1000 units, we must discount older orders that are definitively lost. Based on the history, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 620 units) are considered lost. This leaves a 'real' pipeline of 380 units (from periods 24, 25, 26, 27). We need to cover demand for the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 4 periods). Estimated demand per period is ~95 units, so target pipeline + on-hand should be ~380 units. Current On-hand (65) + Reliable Pipeline (380) = 445 units. Although we are technically over the target, the high loss rate (~25%) suggests we should maintain a steady stream of orders to replace anticipated losses (replacing roughly 25 units per period lost). I will order 100 units to maintain stock levels against potential future losses and satisfy current demand cycles.",
