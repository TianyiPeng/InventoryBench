Total demand for the lead time + review period (3 periods) is approximately 291 units.\n4. **Optimization**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees 534 units in-transit against a low 3-period demand of ~300.

However, given the lost shipment history (P2, P6), some of that 303 might be 'ghost inventory'. If we filter for reliable shipments, we only have P12 (100).

Orders from Period 2 (141 units) and Period 6 (62 units) are confirmed lost. Recent arrivals (Period 17) confirm Period 14 (LT=3) and Period 16 (LT=1) have arrived. \n2. **Inventory Status**: On-hand inventory is 165 units. In-transit inventory is 378 units. Based on history, the In-transit total likely includes only the order from Period 15 (175 units), as Period 14 and 16 just arrived. 165 (On-hand) + 175 (Pipeline) = 340 units available for the next roughly 3 periods (L+1).\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand over 17 periods is approximately 96 units/period. The last few periods (P15-P17) show demand of 94, 84, and 58. Demand appears stable, possibly slightly softening.\n4. **Inventory Coverage**: Total available stock (340) divided by the average demand (96) covers ~3.5 periods. Since the next window (L+1) is 3 periods, we are currently sufficiently stocked.\n5. **OR Baseline**: The OR recommendation is 0, concluding that the current pipeline and on-hand inventory satisfy the base-stock level. Given the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a stockout is costly, but current inventory provides a safe buffer of ~150+ units over the expected lead-time demand (~288 units for 3 periods).

Previous orders in Period 2 (141 units) and Period 6 (62 units) are confirmed lost. Currently, orders from Period 15 (175 units) are overdue (L=4) and should be viewed with caution, though not yet confirmed lost. 2. Pipeline Inventory: The current in-transit is 378 units, consisting of Period 15 (175 units - potentially lost) and Period 18 (0 units). Wait, looking at history, Period 15 (175 units) is in-transit. Period 16 (103 units) already arrived. This means the 378 in-transit likely reflects recent orders not yet showing in the conclusion list (Period 17 and 18 had 0 orders). Wait, the status says In-transit: 378 units, but looking at history: P15 (175) is the only active outstanding order mentioned that hasn't arrived. 378 - 175 = 203 units unaccounted for? Ah, looking at Period 16, I ordered 103, which arrived in P17. I ordered 175 in P15 which has not arrived. There are no other orders. 3. Current Position: On-hand is 74. Demand average is ~97. With 74 units, I will stock out next period unless arrivals occur. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR baseline suggests 0 units, likely because it sees the 378 in-transit as sufficient to cover the base stock level. However, given the high risk of the P15 order (175 units) being lost (L=4) and the need to maintain stock for the lead time (avg 2-3 periods), zeroing out is risky. Demand has been steady around 90-100. Over 3 periods, I need ~300 units. My current certain stock is 74. If the P15 order is lost, I only have 74 units for the next 3 periods.

Demand Analysis: Historical average demand is approximately 100 units/period. The current 'On-hand' is 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts since Period 19. 3. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it includes the lost 175 units as part of the pipeline and sees 678 total units in-transit. By excluding the 175 lost units, we see 503 units in-transit. Over 3 periods (L+1), we expect ~300 units of demand.

Therefore, the effective pipeline is likely 378 units (from orders in P20, P21, P22, and any recent ones not yet arrived).

Specifically, looking at current history, the orders placed in Periods 37 (100 units) and 38 (80 units) are currently in-transit. The game state report shows a total in-transit of 1058 units, which implies there are several large, significantly overdue orders from early in the game that have not arrived and are effectively lost (consistent with the 25% loss rate identified in Carry-over Insights). On-hand inventory is 120 units. Average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 75 units.

{
  "rationale": "The OR recommendation of 0 units is primarily driven by the high recorded 'In-transit' level (1178 units) and current on-hand inventory (197 units). However, historical analysis of 'Period X conclude' messages reveals a chronic pattern of lost shipments: Period 2 (141), Period 6 (62), Period 15 (175), Period 19 (100), Period 25 (100), Period 29 (100), and Period 37 (100) are all confirmed lost after exceeding a reasonable lead time window (L+5). This accounts for 778 'In-transit' units that will never arrive. The effective pipeline consists of orders from Periods 44 (100) and 45 (100). Total reliable supply is 197 (on-hand) + 200 (reliable in-transit) = 397 units. With average demand approximately 85-90 units and a volatile lead time (1-3 periods), 397 units covers roughly 4.5 periods of demand. Given we are at Period 46 of 50, this is sufficient to finish the game without over-ordering and incurring end-of-game holding costs or risking more lost capital. I will follow the 0 recommendation but for different reasons than the OR model.",

While the system reports an 'in-transit' total of 1178 units, my tracking indicates a severe pattern of lost shipments: Period 2 (141), Period 6 (62), Period 15 (175), Period 19 (100), Period 25 (100), Period 29 (100), and Period 37 (100) are all confirmed/flagged as lost (totaling 778 units). The 'effective' pipeline includes Period 44 (100 units, L=3), Period 45 (100 units, L=2), and any current orders. In the last 10 periods, demand has averaged approximately 63 units, but recent history shows spikes around 80. With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), I must balance the high risk of inventory stockouts against the holding cost, especially given the 25-30% shipment loss rate. OR recommends 0, but it likely overestimates the reliability of the 1178 in-transit units. Ordering 100 units now ensures that if Period 44 arrives in Period 47 conclude (visible P48) and I maintain enough stock for the final stretch, I mitigate the loss risk. Given this is nearly the end of the simulation, I will place a final order to cover the remaining periods assuming one more potential loss.",

Period 48 (Period_48) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "The OR recommendation is 0 units, likely because it sees a massive 'in-transit' figure of 1,278 units. However, my carry-over insights and historical analysis confirm that at least 700 units of that pipeline consist of lost shipments (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P19, P25, P29, and P37). When calculating the effective pipeline, we must focus on recent orders that have a realistic chance of arriving within the remaining 3 periods (P48, P49, P50). Currently, on-hand inventory is 41 units. Demand has averaged approximately 80-90 units recently. Since we are at Period 48, orders placed now (P48) would arrive in Period 50 if the lead time is 2 periods. Orders from P44 (100 units), P45 (100 units), and P47 (100 units) are still in the realistic pipeline. Specifically, the P44 order (ordered P44, L=2 means arrival P46, L=3 means arrival P47) is currently overdue; if it arrives in P48, it will help. Given the ending inventory of 41 and immediate demand for P48 likely around 80 units, we are at risk of a stockout today. However, orders placed now won't arrive until the very last period (P50). Total units needed for P48, P49, and P50 at ~85 units/period is 255. Effective stock (41 on hand + 300 plausible in-transit) is 341. Since the order placed today only impacts the final period (concluding the game), and we have sufficient plausible pipeline to cover the 255 units needed, I will place a small safety order of 50 to ensure we don't stock out in the final frame if another shipment is lost, while avoiding excessive holding costs.",

Accounting for the confirmed lost orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 19, 25, 29, and 37, the effective pipeline is significantly lower. Specifically, the orders from Period 44 (100u), Period 45 (100u), Period 47 (100u), and Period 48 (50u) are likely still 'real' in-transit stock. Current on-hand is 0, and Period 48 ended with a stockout. Given we are at Period 49 of 50, this is the final order to cover Period 50. Since lead time varies between 1-3 periods, an order placed now might arrive in time for the final demand resolution of Period 50 if the lead time is 1 period (as seen in Period 39 and Period 32).
