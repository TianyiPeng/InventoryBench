Since the execution sequence places the order arrival in Period N+L and the demand resolution happens after that, I must cover demand for the current period (P1) plus the lead time periods (P2, P3). Total demand to cover = (L + 1) * Avg Demand = 3 * 175 = 525 units.

This suggests a slightly higher demand regime than the pre-game samples. Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order placed in P1 (525 units) is expected to arrive during P3 resolution and will be visible in P4 start. Order placed in P2 (100 units) is expected to arrive during P4. Pipeline Assessment: Current on-hand is 0. Demand for P1 and P2 was lost due to 0 inventory (sold=0). In-transit is 625. Inventory Target: Need to cover demand for Period 3 (current), Period 4, and Period 5 (L+1 approach). Forecasted demand is ~200/period. Total needed = 600 units. Current in-transit = 625. Order Logic: Since 625 units are already in transit to cover the next 3 periods, and the P1 order (525) is expected to land this period (ready for P3 demand), the pipeline is currently healthy relative to expected demand.

Lead times have been highly variable: 1, 2, or 3 periods. Based on the 2-period promised lead time and observed 1-3 range, the P11 order (320 units) is expected to arrive in Period 14 (this period), replenishing stock. To cover a target cycle of 3 periods (L+1) at a mean of 160/period (480 total), we assess our effective pipeline. Excluding lost orders, we have 670 in transit. However, with 0 on-hand and recent stockouts, we need to ensure we don't fall behind again if lead times hit the 3-period mark. Total needed to cover P14-P17 is ~640 units. Current reliable pipeline is 670. I will place a maintenance order of 150 to keep the flow steady for the P16/P17 window, accounting for the possibility that the P11 order arrives now and covers immediate demand.",

The current 5-period average (P38-P42) is approximately 58 units/period. The supplier is highly unreliable, with 7 confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P29, P37). The 'In-transit' figure of 1250 units is misleading; subtracting the 1050 units from verified lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P29, P37), the true pipeline consists only of the Period 42 order (200 units). To satisfy expected demand while accounting for potential lead time (historically 1-3 periods) and the high risk of loss, I will place an order to bolster the pipeline. Considering we are in Period 43 of 50, and the actual lead time varies, I aim to have enough stock to cover the remaining periods if this or the previous order arrives.

With 0 on-hand inventory and lead times generally being 2-3 periods, these 350 units are expected to arrive between P44 and P46.

Given the $1.0 holding cost per unit and only one period of demand resolution left where I can actually make a decision (since any order placed now with a lead time of 1-3 periods would arrive either at the end of the simulation or after it finishes), ordering more units would only decrease total profit by increasing holding costs.
