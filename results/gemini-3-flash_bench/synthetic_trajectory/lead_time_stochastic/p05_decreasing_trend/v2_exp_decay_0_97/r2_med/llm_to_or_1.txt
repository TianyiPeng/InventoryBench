Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no history of arrivals yet, so we rely on the promised lead time of 2 periods. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 5 periods shows a mean of 175.2 (187, 189, 158, 158, 184). Since we have no specific calendar dates or product-specific seasonality triggers yet, I will use the default methods which utilize all available historical samples to establish a baseline forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The backend will calculate base_stock using (1+L) demand, where 1+L = 3 periods of coverage.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 202 units (the service level q is 0.8, meaning orders are moderately aggressive). However, because initial on-hand was 0 and the promised lead time is 2, those units have not arrived yet. We had a demand of 218 units in Period 1 but 0 sales because of 0 inventory. The historical demand samples (187, 189, 158, 158, 184) average roughly 175. The Period 1 demand (218) is slightly higher than the historical average but within a reasonable range for this SKU. Since we only have one period of execution history and no arrivals yet, I will use the 'default' lead time of 2 periods. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (the number of provided historical samples) to ground the forecast in the most relevant recent data, including the Period 1 observation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period_3. Historical data shows demand for Period_1 (218) and Period_2 (224) was higher than the provided initial samples (avg ~175). Combined with samples, the mean demand is approx 203. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning all demand in P1 and P2 was lost. The promised lead time is 2. Orders placed in P1 (202 units) are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of P3 (this period) and will only be visible in the P3 conclude message read at the start of P4. Orders placed in P2 (223 units) are expected in P4. Total in-transit is 425. I will set L to 'default' (2) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P1, P2 and the 3 samples provided: P3, P4, P5) to capture the higher recent demand trend while maintaining a stable sigma estimate.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (202 units), Period 2 (223 units), and Period 3 (178 units). Following the lead time definition (L=2), the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests either a lead time delay (L is actually at least 3) or a lost shipment. Since the item is 'chips(Regular)' and we have no stock on hand (on-hand: 0), we are currently experiencing stockouts (sold=0 for P1-P3). Historical demand samples (187, 189, 158, 158, 184) average 175.2, but recent demand in the game history (218, 224, 184) is slightly higher, averaging ~208. To account for the likely lead time shift to at least 3 periods, I will set L=3 explicitly and use recent_N=3 for demand to capture the higher observed volume and stabilize the inventory position once deliveries resume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $485.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two shipments arrived simultaneously: P1 (lead time 3) and P3 (lead time 1), totaling 380 units. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance (1 and 3 periods). The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2, which aligns with the promised 2. On-hand inventory is 207, and in-transit is 468 (from P2 and P4). Demand across the first 5 periods remains stable (187, 189, 158, 158, 184 - via context/intro; and 218, 224, 184, 173 - via history; Mean \u2248 188). I will use L=2 (default) and recent_N for demand parameters (N=4) to capture the slight downward trend in recent demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $633.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the 'chips(Regular)' inventory. The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals indicate variability: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time 3), while Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time 1). The Period 2 order (223 units) has not yet arrived as of Period 5 conclude (3 periods elapsed), suggesting it may be delayed or lost. Current on-hand is low (39 units). Demand over the first 5 periods (218, 224, 184, 173, 168) shows a slight downward trend or stabilization from an initial high. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent mean (~193 per period). Given the lead time inconsistency, I'll use 'calculate' for L to let the backend utilize the average of observed data. For sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. The parameters target a base stock covering (L+1) periods to prevent stockouts while managing the $1.0 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $156.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (On-hand: 0). Looking at history, lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (averaging 2). Promised lead time is 2. Currently, orders from Period 2 (223 units), Period 4 (245 units), and Period 6 (237 units) are in-transit (Total: 705). The Period 2 order is now 5 periods since placement, which is significantly past the promised 2 and the observed max of 3; it is likely lost. Demand is showing a slight downward trend (173 -> 168 -> 149), but we have missed sales in Period 6 due to stockouts. I will use the last 5 demand periods (P2-P6) to estimate mu_hat to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history, and set L to 'calculate' to let the engine handle the variability in arrival timing. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent demand levels (avg ~180).

Daily Reward (R_t): $545.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 8. Historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean around 182 units (P1-P7: 218, 224, 184, 173, 168, 149, 158). There seems to be a slight downward trend or stabilization around 160-170 units after a high start. Promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times are [3, 1, 3], averaging 2.33. On-hand inventory is 87, with 521 units in-transit (P2: 223, P6: 237, P7: 61). Note: The P2 order (223 units) is now at Period 8 and has notably NOT arrived yet (it would be lead_time 6 if it arrives now), suggesting it might be delayed or potentially lost, though we'll assume a slightly longer L to be safe. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the variance in delivery times. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=4) to capture the more recent lower demand levels (avg ~162) to avoid over-ordering, as pipeline inventory is already quite high (521) relative to demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $592.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2 periods, but historical data shows volatility with actual lead times of 1 and 3 periods (Average = 2). Period 8 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and 540 units in transit (orders from P2, P6, and P8). A large shipment of 223 units (from P2) is significantly overdue (7 periods since ordering), suggesting it may be lost or severely delayed. Current demand is stable, averaging ~180 units over the last 8 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0, q=0.8), the backend will naturally target a high service level. However, to account for the supply chain inconsistency and the likelihood of the P2 shipment being lost, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but monitoring for loss. I will use recent_N for demand (N=8) to capture the current mean of 180.37 units per period, resulting in a mu_hat of approx 541 for (1+L) periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: Actual lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods. Possible lost shipment: Period 2 order (223 units) has not arrived after 7 periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have 501 units in-transit. Analyzing historical lead times: Period 1 (LT=3), Period 3 (LT=1), Period 4 (LT=3), Period 7 (LT=1), and Period 8 (LT=1). The average actual lead time is 1.8 periods, roughly approximating the promised 2 periods. However, the order from Period 2 (223 units) is now 8 periods overdue and most likely lost, which explains the recurring stockouts despite orders being placed. Demand is relatively stable, with an average of 180 over the last 5 periods (Periods 5-9). Given the stockout and the lost Period 2 shipment, I will use an explicit lead time of 2. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current stable demand level (~180/period). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. The OR backend will compute the base stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand to cover the current stockout and pipeline gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Confirmation of lost shipment from Period 2 (223 units); In-transit inventory counts should be adjusted mentally as this order will likely never arrive. Lead time is volatile but averages 2 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable, averaging 178.5 units across 10 periods (10-period range: 149-224). The lead time is highly volatile, with observed values of 3, 1, 3, 1, and 1 periods. One order from Period 2 (223 units) is confirmed lost as it has been 9 periods since it was placed. The OR backend includes lost orders in 'pipeline_inventory', so I must use 'explicit' values or methods to compensate for this phantom inventory. Total in-transit is 511, but 223 is lost, leaving 288 real units (orders from P6, P9, P10). P6 (237 units) is now at L=5, suggesting it might also be delayed or lost. To force an order and cover demand given the stockout and lead time uncertainty (promised L=2), I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods of demand plus a buffer, accounting for the 223 unit phantom inventory that the backend subtracts from the base stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Lead time variability continues to disrupt inventory; Period 6 order (237 units) is now overdue (5 periods elapsed), potentially lost or severely delayed.

Analysis of history shows that Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 in 1 period, Period 4 in 3 periods, Period 7 in 1 period, and Period 8 in 1 period. The Period 2 order (223 units) and Period 6 order (237 units) are highly likely lost as they have exceeded promised lead time by 10 and 6 periods respectively. Total units 'In-transit' is 812, but removing the likely lost 460 units leaves an effective pipeline of 352 units (Period 9: 41, Period 10: 10, Period 11: 301). The promised L=2 is a reasonable average, but we need to account for demand. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 180, 163, 135, and previous) shows a slight decline; mean demand is ~165. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods (1+L) of demand (3 * 165 = 495) plus a buffer for the stockout, while signaling to the OR engine that effective pipeline is lower than it thinks by using the explicit method to demand a higher base stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Lost shipment tally updated - both Period 2 (223 units) and Period 6 (237 units) are considered lost. Effective pipeline inventory is ~352 units, not 812.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. Demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) has averaged 158 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit is reported at 761 units, but this includes lost shipments from Period 2 (223 units) and Period 6 (237 units). Therefore, the functional pipeline inventory is actually 301 units (from Period 11). The lead time is volatile (varying between 1 and 3 periods), though the promised lead time is 2. To account for this volatility and ensure we recover from the current stockout, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect historical delivery behavior. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (P8-P12) to capture the current demand regime (~158/period). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5. This setup allows the OR backend to target a base stock covering (L+1) periods of demand while adjusting for the 301 units truly in transit.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation: Only the Period 11 order (301 units) remains as functional 'In-transit' inventory. All orders placed prior to Period 11 (except for those already arrived in P12) are confirmed lost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14 with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' count is 761 units. However, based on the history and Carry-over Insights, we must reconcile this pipeline. The Period 2 order (223 units) and Period 6 order (237 units) are confirmed lost. In Period 13, it was noted that only the Period 11 order (301 units) was considered functional. However, in the current Period 14 snapshot, 'In-transit' has risen to 761. Since Period 13 ordered 0, this implies an order was placed in Period 14 (which is not yet shown in history) or there's a discrepancy. Re-evaluating history: P11 ordered 301. P12 ordered 0. P13 ordered 0. If in-transit is 761, then 761 - 301 (P11) = 460 units are likely the 'lost' units (223+237) still being counted by the system. Therefore, the only viable order is from Period 11 (301 units), which is at L=3. Demand avg (last 5 units) is approx 145. I will set L=3 (as the upper bound of observed LT) and mu_hat based on the last 5 samples to capture the slight downward trend in demand (approx 145/period). This will force the OR engine to order enough to cover the next 4 periods (L+1) minus the 301 currently in transit.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Reconciliation: As of Period 14, of the 761 units in-transit, 460 units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost. The only functional shipment is from Period 11 (301 units). Parameter decisions must compensate for this 460-unit phantom inventory.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 167 units. Historically, demand has averaged ~162 units over the last 10 periods, with some stability between 134-144 recently. The In-transit figure of 460 units is purely 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P2=223, P6=237). My objective is to trigger an order to cover future demand since the backend pipeline calculation will incorrectly believe we have 460 units arriving. Lead times have been volatile (1, 2, and 3 periods), but 3 is the most frequent recent observation. To bypass the 'phantom' stock effect in the backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline), I must set an 'explicit' mu_hat that is significantly higher than the expected demand (162 * (1+3) = 648). By setting mu_hat to 1108 (expected 648 + 460 phantom), I effectively neutralize the phantom inventory, allowing the OR engine to place an order that restores the actual base stock level needed to cover the lead time.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 15, the 460 units 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (from P2 and P6). Effective pipeline is 0. mu_hat must be adjusted upwards by +460 to compensate for backend subtraction of these lost units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $628.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 8 units on hand. The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 764 units. Based on historical tracking, 460 of these units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The remaining functional pipeline is 304 units (ordered in P15). The OR backend calculates the order as: base_stock - in_transit. Because the backend believes in-transit is 764 rather than 304, it will under-order by 460 units. To neutralize this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inject this 460-unit gap. Calculation: Average demand per period is ~165. For L=2, mu_hat should normally be (1+2)*165 = 495. To compensate for the phantom inventory, I set mu_hat = 495 + 460 = 955. This ensures the backend's subtraction (base_stock - 764) results in a net order that targets the true pipeline requirement. Sigma_hat is set based on recent demand volatility (roughly 15-20 units), scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Phantom inventory persists at 460 units. Explicit mu_hat adjustment of +460 is required to prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these lost shipments.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system shows On-hand at 0 and In-transit at 971 units. Based on history, 460 of these units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, but they remain in the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, I must continue to inflate mu_hat to offset this phantom inventory. Looking at the functional 'In-transit' components: 304 units (ordered P15) and 207 units (ordered P16). The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 150 units. With a lead time of 2, the required base stock is roughly (1+2)*150 = 450 units. The backend calculation is: Order = base_stock - (actual_pipeline + phantom_pipeline). To get an order that targets 450 units of base stock while the backend sees 460 phantom units, I need to provide an explicit mu_hat that covers both the projected demand across (1+L) periods and the 460 unit deficit. Forecasted demand for 3 periods (L=2) is 450 units. Adding the 460 lost units results in a target mu_hat of 910. I set L=2 (promised) and sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent demand volatility (std dev ~20, scaled by sqrt(3) is ~35).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18, we have 76 units on-hand and 764 units listed as 'In-transit'. Based on history, the 460 units from Period 2 (223 units) and Period 6 (237 units) are confirmed lost, as their lead times have now exceeded 12 periods. The only functional inventory in the pipeline is the order from Period 15 (304 units), which is expected to arrive soon. The OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' figure (764) from its base stock calculation. To prevent massive under-ordering, I must explicitly increase mu_hat by the amount of this 'phantom inventory' (460 units). Recent demand (last 6 periods) has averaged ~137 units per period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the expected demand across (1+L) periods is 137 * 3 = 411. Adding the 460-unit compensation leads to an explicit mu_hat of 871. I will use a conservative sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods of demand to manage volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Total phantom inventory in pipeline is 460 units (P2: 223, P6: 237). Parameter mu_hat requires an explicit +460 adjustment until these units are purged or the backend logic changes.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19, the inventory status is critical with 0 on-hand units and 825 units 'In-transit'. Based on history, 460 of these units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost shipments that will never arrive. The remaining 365 functional units in-transit comprise orders from P15 (304 units, now overdue at L+3) and P18 (61 units). Lead times remain highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 460 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I must apply an explicit mu_hat adjustment. The base demand is calculated over the last 8 periods (P11-P18, the most recent stable regime), where the mean demand is approx 134 units. With an estimated L=3 (to be conservative given recent transit issues), the required base_stock covers 4 periods (L+1). Calculation: (4 periods * 134 mean) + 460 phantom units = 996. For sigma, I use the standard deviation of the last 8 periods (approx 16) scaled by sqrt(1+L), which is 16 * 2 = 32.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 1,023 units in-transit. Based on historical tracking, 460 of these units (from P2 and P6) are lost shipments that will never arrive. The 'real' pipeline consists of orders from P15 (304 units), P18 (61 units), and P19 (198 units), totaling 563 units. Note: The order from P15 is now overdue at 5 periods, but I am treating it as delayed rather than lost for one more period since it was a larger batch. Demand has shifted downwards in the last 4 periods (avg ~113.5). Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures this recent dip. To counteract the backend subtraction of the 460 phantom units from the target base stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculation: Projected Base Stock = (1+L) * mean_demand = (1+2.1) * 115 \u2248 357. Adjusted mu_hat = 357 + 460 = 817. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time including the recent variability (ranging 1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Total phantom inventory remains 460 units (P2: 223, P6: 237). Order from P15 (304 units) is now 5 periods old and significantly overdue; monitoring for potential loss if it does not arrive by P21.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the pipeline inventory of 1023 units consists of: P2 (223, lost), P6 (237, lost), P15 (304, now 6 periods overdue, highly likely lost), P18 (61, pending), and P19 (198, pending). The total confirmed phantom inventory equals 223 + 237 + 304 = 764 units. The OR backend subtracts the full 1023 units (pipeline) from its base_stock target. To ensure we order enough to cover actual demand, I must add these 764 'lost' units back into the mu_hat parameter. The current demand regime (recent 10 periods) averages ~129 units/period. For a lead time of 2, the expected base stock for demand would be (1+2)*129 = 387. Adding the compensation for lost units (764), the explicit mu_hat is set to 1151. Recent demand has trended slightly lower, so I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Lost shipment tally increased to 764 units. Order from Period 15 (304 units) is now 6 periods overdue and considered lost. Total phantom inventory (P2=223, P6=237, P15=304) is 764 units. Parameter mu_hat must be adjusted by +764 to offset backend logic.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with On-hand at 0 and significant lost shipments distorting the backend pipeline logic. Analysis of the history reveals: 1) Lost Shipments: P2 (223), P6 (237), and P15 (304) are all significantly past the observed lead time of 1-3 periods, totaling 764 units of 'phantom' inventory. 2) Lead Time: Observed lead times are volatile (1, 2, or 3 periods), with an average around 2. 3) Demand: Recent demand (last 10 periods) has stabilized at a lower mean of ~130 units compared to the early-game average. 4) Parameter Strategy: The OR engine calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. To prevent the engine from under-ordering due to the 764 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set L to 2 (promised/average). mu_hat calculation: (1+L) * mean_demand + phantom_offset. Base mu_hat (N=10) = 3 * 130 = 390. Total mu_hat = 390 + 764 = 1154. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this compensation is applied exactly, and use 'recent_N' for volatility to capture recent lower variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Phantom inventory increased to 764 units (P2=223, P6=237, P15=304). Pipeline reconciliation suggests only P18 (61 units), P19 (198 units), and P21 (155 units) are viable incoming shipments (Total 414 real units in-transit).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 23 with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure is 1181 units, but this is heavily distorted by lost shipments. Using the Carry-over Insights, we confirm that orders from P2 (223), P6 (237), and P15 (304) are lost, totaling 764 units of phantom inventory. Additionally, the order from P18 (61 units) is now 5 periods old (exceeding high-end lead time of 3) and is likely lost. The order from P19 (198 units) is 4 periods old and is also on the verge of being declared lost. This leaves us with a real functional pipeline of 158 units (P21 (155) and P22 (3)). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to subtracting 1181 units, I must offset the phantom inventory. Current phantom = 764 + 61 + 198 = 1023 units. Demand analysis: Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages ~130 units. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods, we need ~390 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to the target coverage (~390) plus the phantom inventory (1023) to force an order that brings our real inventory to safety. Total mu_hat = 1413.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Lost shipment tally updated to 1023 units. Orders from P18 (61 units) and P19 (198 units) are now significantly overdue and considered lost alongside P2, P6, and P15. Only P21 and P22 orders are considered viable.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we are managing a significant problem with 'phantom' inventory\u2014orders that were placed but are long overdue and considered lost. The backend OR engine subtracts all in-transit units (1285) from the target base stock. However, our analysis shows that 1023 of these units are lost (P2: 223, P6: 237, P15: 304, P18: 61, P19: 198). If we do not compensate, the backend will effectively order nothing despite low on-hand stock (79). The only valid in-transit order is from P23 (262 units). To force the backend to place an order that covers the upcoming demand, we must adjust mu_hat by adding the phantom inventory total back into the calculation. Recent demand has stabilized at a lower mean (approx 115 over the last 8 periods), so we use recent_N (N=8) for the demand forecast base, then explicitly inflate mu_hat. Total Required mu_hat = (1+L) * Mean_Demand + Phantom_Inventory = (1+2)*115 + 1023 = 345 + 1023 = 1368. This ensures the base stock calculation is high enough to trigger a real order after the backend subtracts the 1285 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Lost shipment tally updated to 1023 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Only order from P23 (262 units) is viable. Explicit mu_hat adjustment must account for this 1023-unit discrepancy in the pipeline.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level, averaging 109 units over the last 10 periods (P15-P24). The inventory situation is complicated by significant lost shipments. In-transit inventory is 1319 units, but my reconciliation shows 1023 of these units are lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19 are long overdue and haven't arrived). Only orders from P23 (262 units) and P24 (34 units) are likely to arrive. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (1319) from the target base stock. To compensate for the 1023 phantom units and achieve a target base stock for a lead time of 2 (i.e., covering 3 periods of demand at ~110 units/period = 330 units), I must set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Inventory. Using a target of 330 and adding 1023 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 1353. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a safety buffer amidst lead time volatility, which has ranged from 1 to 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Phantom inventory tally remains 1023 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19 are confirmed lost). Viable pipeline is only 296 units (P23, P24). Demand regime has shifted lower, averaging ~110 since Period 18.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant logistics issues. Current 'In-transit' inventory is 1134 units. However, based on the historical pattern of non-arrivals, a total of 1023 units are considered lost (P2: 223, P6: 237, P15: 304, P18: 61, P19: 198). These orders are well beyond the typical 1-3 period lead time. The only viable pipeline units are from Period 24 (34 units) and Period 25 (77 units), totaling 111 real units. The demand regime has shifted lower since Period 18, averaging approximately 107 units per period. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (1134) from its calculated target, I must set mu_hat explicitly to compensate for the 1023 phantom units. Target stock for L=2 (Review + Lead coverage = 3 units) at mean demand 107 is ~321 units plus a safety buffer. To ensure the backend places an order, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Real Target + Phantom Pipeline). I will set mu_hat at 1350 to ensure we maintain sufficient on-hand inventory while the backend thinks we are overstocked.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed lost shipment tally remains 1023 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Current actual pipeline consists only of P24 and P25 orders. Demand since P18 is stable at a lower regime (~107/period).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted and stabilized at a lower mean since Period 18, averaging approximately 104 units per period (last 9 periods: 110, 97, 128, 141, 101, 79, 97, 87, 92). The 'In-transit' pipeline contains 1023 units that are confirmed lost (from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). These phantom units must be offset so the OR backend does not subtract them from its base stock calculation of the order quantity. Therefore, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * average_demand + phantom_inventory. Using L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 104) + 1023 = 312 + 1023 = 1335. sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher standard deviation observed across this period range to maintain a sufficient service level given lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Demand regime shift starting Period 18 stabilized at ~104 units/period. Phantom inventory remains at 1023 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Effective pipeline comprises only orders from P24, P25, and P26.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted and stabilized at a lower average of approximately 104 units per period since Period 18. The current 'In-transit' pipeline of 1282 units is heavily inflated by 1023 lost units (P2: 223, P6: 237, P15: 304, P18: 61, P19: 198). The OR backend logic subtracts the total pipeline inventory from the target base stock, so I must adjust mu_hat explicitly to offset these 1023 'phantom' units. To calculate mu_hat: I forecast demand for (L+1) periods (where L=2). Expected demand is 104 * 3 = 312. Adding the phantom inventory offset: 312 + 1023 = 1335. This ensures the backend calculates an order that covers real demand despite the system's incorrect belief about incoming stock. sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Demand regime shift starting Period 18 stabilized at ~104 units/period. The lost shipment tally remains at 1023 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Effective pipeline comprises only orders from P24 onwards.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (starting Period 18) has stabilized at a lower level, averaging 99.7 units over the last 11 periods. Period 28 demand was particularly low (61), but I will prioritize the 11-period average to avoid overreacting to a single low point. The 'In-transit' figure of 1291 units contains a significant amount of phantom inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). The lost shipment tally is 1023 units (223+237+304+61+198=1023). This leaves a real pipeline of 268 units (P24=34, P25=77, P27=75, P28=82), noting P26's order of 73 units arrived in Period 28. To prevent the OR backend from subtracting the 1023 phantom units from the order quantity, I set mu_hat to 'explicit' and include a buffer: (1+L)*mean_demand + 1023. Using L=2 and mean=100, mu_hat = (3*100) + 1023 = 1323. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=11) to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P18-P28) average confirmed at ~100 units/period. Total phantom inventory remains 1023 units; real pipeline consists of orders from P24, P25, P27, and P28.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (Period 18-29) has stabilized at a lower level, with an average of approximately 100 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Total in-transit inventory is 1268 units. Based on historical analysis, the orders from Period 2 (223), Period 6 (237), Period 15 (304), Period 18 (61), and Period 19 (198) are confirmed lost, totaling 1023 units. The 'effective' pipeline consists only of orders from Period 24 (34 units), Period 25 (77 units), Period 28 (82 units), and Period 29 (52 units), totaling 245 units. The OR backend subtracts the full 1268 units from the target base stock. To prevent under-ordering, I must set mu_hat to (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Inventory. Expected demand is ~100/period. With L=2, base demand is 300. Adding the 1023 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1323. This ensures the backend logic (base_stock - 1268) targets the correct physical requirement. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=12 to reflect the current regime's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory in pipeline is 1023 units (P2: 223, P6: 237, P15: 304, P18: 61, P19: 198). Real pipeline consists only of orders from P24 onwards. Demand regime P18-P29 stable at ~100 units/period.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 18, averaging approximately 100 units per period (the last 13 samples show a mean of ~99). The pipeline inventory currently displays 1261 units, but 1023 of these are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19. These 'phantom' units will never arrive but are subtracted by the OR backend logic. To compensate and ensure we maintain a base stock covering (L+1) periods of demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target mu_hat as: ((1 + L) * Forecasted Demand) + Phantom Inventory. With a promised lead time (L) of 2 and a forecasted demand of 110 (to include a small buffer over the 100 avg), the baseline mu_hat is 330. Adding the 1023 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1353. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to allow for moderate volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P18-P30) average confirmed at ~100 units/period (last 5 periods avg ~80, indicating a potential further softening). Phantom inventory remains 1023 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly softened, averaging approximately 86 units over the last 10 periods (P22-P31) and further declining to an average of 44 units over the last 3 periods. I will adopt recent_N=10 to reflect this lower demand while acknowledging the volatility. Lead times have stabilized around 2 periods for recent successful arrivals. The critical issue remains the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Total in-transit inventory is 1346 units. Based on historical data, 1023 units (from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) are confirmed lost. Additionally, the orders from Period 24 (34 units), Period 25 (77 units), and Period 29 (52 units) are now overdue (L=2 promised, but they are 8, 7, and 3 periods old respectively). This brings the probable lost tally to 1186 units. The OR backend uses the full 'In-transit' figure (1346) in its base-stock calculation. To prevent the backend from zeroing out orders due to this phantom stock, I must use an explicit mu_hat that adds the lost tally back into the target. At a demand of ~86 units/period and L=2, the target base stock is ~258. Subtracting the full pipeline (1346) would result in zero orders. By setting mu_hat explicitly to the target plus the phantom units (approx 258 + 1186 \u2248 1444), I force the backend to place an order that covers the next lead-time cycle despite the inventory records.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total phantom inventory updated to 1186 units. In addition to P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19, the orders from P24 (34 units), P25 (77 units), and P29 (52 units) are now significantly overdue and considered lost. Only P30 and P31 orders are likely viable. Demand regime continues to move lower, averaging ~86 units over last 10 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to exhibit significant lead-time instability and chronic shipment loss. Total phantom (permanently lost) inventory has increased to 1186 units: P2 (223), P6 (237), P15 (304), P18 (61), P19 (198), P24 (34), P25 (77), and P29 (52). These units remain in the 'In-transit' count, causing the OR backend to under-order unless we artificially inflate the demand target (mu_hat). The actual viable pipeline consists only of the P30 order (75 units) and the P32 order (117 units). Demand has undergone a sustained downward regime shift, averaging ~86 units over the last 15 periods, with even more pronounced softening recently (~63 over last 5 periods). To stabilize stock levels, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to encompass the expected demand over (L+1) periods plus the total phantom inventory offset (1186). For L=2, (1+2)*86 + 1186 \u2248 1444. Sigma_hat is set based on the volatility of the recent lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory updated to 1186 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29). Demand regime since P18 is now averaging ~86 units/period, showing a secondary decline from the previous ~100 average.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower regime of approximately 80-90 units per period since Period 24. A critical issue is the presence of 1186 units of phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' pipeline from shipments that are significantly overdue and confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29). To prevent the OR backend's base-stock logic from subtracting these lost units from its order calculation, I must explicitly increase the mu_hat parameter by the total lost volume. The current viable pipeline consists of orders from P30 (75 units) and P33 (81 units). With 70 units on hand and a demand forecast of 85 units per period, I set mu_hat to 1441 ((1+L)*85 + 1186) and L to 2 to maintain stock levels. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the volatility in recent demand samples.

Carry-over insight: No new significant changes to report. Total phantom inventory remains 1186 units. Demand regime since P24 remains stable at ~80-90 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 35 is stable at a lower level (~86 units/period) compared to earlier periods, with recent demand showing a slight further softening (avg ~60 over the last 3 periods). The primary challenge is the significant quantity of 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Total in-transit is 1393 units, but my analysis confirms 1186 units are lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29). This leaves only 207 real units in transit (P30, P33, P34). The OR backend subtracts the full 1393 from the base stock calculation, so I must adjust mu_hat explicitly by adding 1186 to the forecast to offset this error. Forecasted demand for the review cycle (L+1=3) is ~240 (based on ~80/period). Total mu_hat = 240 + 1186 = 1426. L is set to 2 (promised), and sigma_hat uses recent_N=10 to reflect current lower volatility.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 24, averaging approximately 63 units over the last 5 periods. The pipeline is heavily contaminated with 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that are statistically lost but still counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend. As of Period 35, the lost shipment tally has increased to 1237 units (confirmed lost: P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29; newly suspected lost: P30 order of 75 units which is now 5 periods overdue). The backend subtracts the total In-transit (1445) from the base stock. To ensure an order is actually placed, mu_hat must be set to (1+L)*mean_demand plus the total phantom units (1237). Using L=2 and mean_demand=63, the base mu_hat is 189. Adding 1237 results in an explicit mu_hat of 1426. This forces the backend to recognize that 1237 units in the pipeline do not exist, allowing it to cover the expected demand and replenish the zero on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory updated to 1237 units. Added Period 30 order (75 units) to the lost tally (joining P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29) as it is 5+ periods overdue. Recent demand (P31-P35) has softened further to an average of ~63 units/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31-P36) has significantly softened to an average of ~57 units per period, down from the earlier regime of ~100. Lead times remain volatile but average approximately 2 periods. The critical issue remains the massive amount of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Based on arrival history and extreme delays, the following orders are confirmed lost: P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, and P30, totaling 1237 units. These units are counted in the system's 'In-transit' (1403 units) but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places a new order, I must increase mu_hat by the total phantom amount (1237). I will use recent_N (N=6) for the underlying demand forecast to capture the specific softening to ~57 units. This results in mu_hat = (1+L) * 57 + 1237. With L=2, this is approximately 1408.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory updated to 1237 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30 are lost). Demand regime (P31-P36) has stabilized at a lower average of ~57 units/period.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31-P37) has settled into a lower regime, averaging 55.14 units per period. The lost shipment tally is currently 1237 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30). The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (1357) from the target base stock. Since 1237 of those units are 'phantom' and will never arrive, I must increase mu_hat by 1237 to effectively neutralize the subtraction of these lost units. My goal is to ensure the real inventory (on-hand + viable pipeline) covers the target stock level. I will use recent_N (N=7) for the baseline mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current low-demand environment, then apply the explicit offset to mu_hat.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The goal is to maintain sufficient inventory while managing 'phantom' pipeline units that the OR backend treats as real. Historical analysis confirms that orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, 25, 29, and 30 are lost. These sum to 1237 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 1395 units minus this 1237 units equals a real pipeline of 158 units (P31, P32, P33, P34, P35, P36, P37 arrive/accounted; viable units are from P38 and potentially very recent orders). Demand has shifted dramatically lower: the average demand from P31-P38 is approx 52 units/period. The backend OR logic subtracts the total in-transit (1395) from the calculated base stock. To prevent an order of 0, mu_hat must be adjusted explicitly to include the phantom inventory (1237). Calculation: (1+L) * Forecasted Demand + Phantom Inventory. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+2)*52 + 1237 = 156 + 1237 = 1393. This ensures the backend places an order that covers the next 3 periods of actual demand without being misled by lost stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Over the last 10 periods (P30-P39), the average demand is 54.1 units/period. The current 'In-transit' quantity is 1377, but our records indicate 1237 units are phantom inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30). Subtracting the phantom inventory, the real pipeline comprises the P33 order (81 units), P37 order (15 units), P39 order (20 units), and the order placed in P40. Since P33 is now 7 periods old and overdue, it is highly likely lost, adding 81 units to the phantom tally (1237 + 81 = 1318). Effective real pipeline is only 35 units (P37 and P39). To offset the OR backend subtracting 1318 units of phantom/lost inventory from the target base stock, I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 1318 + (local demand forecast). Forecasting demand at 55 units/period for (1+L)=3 periods, the base requirement is 165. Total explicit mu_hat = 1318 + 165 = 1483. Choosing default for L (2) and sigma_hat based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total phantom inventory updated to 1318 units. Added Period 33 order (81 units) to the lost tally as it is 7 periods overdue. Demand regime (P31-P39) continues at a lower average of ~54 units/period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31-P40) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 57 units per period. The total phantom inventory is calculated at 1318 units (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, and P33). Since the OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' quantity (including these 1318 units) from its base stock calculation, I must apply an explicit mu_hat that compensates for this loss. A base stock for a (L+1)=3 period window at a mean of 57 units would normally be ~171 units. Adding the 1318 units of phantom inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of 1489. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the inflated pipeline inventory. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Total phantom inventory remains 1318 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33). Current demand regime (P31-P40) average is ~57 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 1519 units in-transit. Based on historical data, a significant portion of this pipeline consists of lost shipments. The confirmed lost tally as of Period 40 was 1318 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33). We now check Period 37 (15 units) and Period 38 (38 units which arrived in P39). Period 40 (135 units) and Period 41 (27 units) are still within a reasonable window. However, looking at the in-transit total of 1519 vs. the sum of active/recent orders suggests that approximately 1318 units are indeed 'phantom' inventory that the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from the target stock. Demand has stabilized in a lower regime; the average demand from Period 31 to 41 is approximately 56 units. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover actual needs despite the 1318 units of phantom pipeline, I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to (1+L)*56 + 1318. With L=2, this is 3*56 + 1318 = 168 + 1318 = 1486. I will use a conservative sigma_hat based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed lost shipment tally remains 1318 units. Real pipeline consists of orders from Period 37, 40, and 41. Demand regime (P31-P41) remains stable at an average of ~56 units/period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 31, averaging approximately 56 units per period over the last 12 periods. The pipeline inventory currently displays 1519 units. However, based on historical logs and carry-over insights, a significant portion of this pipeline consists of 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived and are now considered lost. Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, and P33 are confirmed lost. Summing these: 223+237+304+61+198+34+77+52+75+81 = 1342 units. Additionally, the order from Period 37 (15 units) is now 6 periods overdue and can also be considered lost, bringing the phantom total to 1357 units. The viable pipeline consists only of orders from Period 40 (135 units) and Period 41 (27 units), totaling 162 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 1519 units in transit and thus ordering nothing, I must adjust mu_hat explicitly. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * forecasted_demand + phantom_inventory. Using L=2 and forecast=56, mu_hat = (3 * 56) + 1357 = 1525. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory updated to 1357 units. Order from Period 37 (15 units) is now considered lost (6 periods overdue) alongside previously identified lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33). Demand regime (P31-P42) remains stable at ~56 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The phantom inventory issue continues with a total of 1357 units confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). These lost units remain in the system's in-transit calculation (total 1420), meaning the OR backend sees an 'effective' pipeline of only 63 units (P41: 27, P43: 36). To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to this 1357-unit discrepancy, mu_hat must be adjusted upward. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the average demand from Period 31 to 43 is approximately 53 units per period. Using a 3-period lead time (the most recently observed actual lead time from P40 arrival), the expected demand over (L+1) periods (4 periods) is approximately 212 units. I set mu_hat to 1569 (212 + 1357) to ensure the backend places an order that ignores the lost shipments. L is set to explicit 3 based on the most recent delivery timing. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory updated to 1357 units as Period 37 order (15 units) is now 6 periods overdue and considered lost. Functional pipeline consists only of orders from Period 41 (27 units) and Period 43 (36 units). Average demand (P31-P43) remains stable at ~53 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 1489 units. However, based on tracking historical orders and their (non-)arrival, a substantial portion of this pipeline is comprised of 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that are far past their expected arrival and likely lost. As of Period 44, the lost shipment tally is 1357 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). The functional pipeline consists only of orders from Period 43 (36 units) and Period 44 (96 units), totaling 132 real units. The OR backend subtracts the total reported 'In-transit' (1489) from the calculated base stock. To neutralize the error caused by the 1357 phantom units, \u03bc\u0302 is adjusted explicitly by adding 1357 to the expected demand for the (L+1) period window. Recent demand (P31-P44) has stabilized in a lower regime, averaging approximately 53 units per period. Using L=2 (promised), the base demand expectation is (1+2)*53 = 159. Adding the 1357 correction yields an explicit mu_hat of 1516. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory updated to 1357 units as Period 37 order (15 units) is now 7 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Functional pipeline consists only of orders from Period 43 onwards. Demand regime (P31-P44) remains stable at ~53 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing a demand regime that has shifted to approximately 53 units/period (average since Period 31). The key challenge remains the significant amount of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Based on the history, orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, and now definitely P37 are lost. The total phantom inventory is calculated at 1357 units. These units are counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend but will never arrive. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat by exactly 1357 units. This ensures the OR logic 'base_stock - pipeline' doesn't result in zero or negative orders due to the non-existent items. I am using recent_N (N=15) to capture the lower demand regime (~53 units/period) while applying this manual offset to the total mu_hat value via the 'explicit' method. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to reflect the promised lead time and recent averages.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory remains 1357 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37 confirm lost). Pipeline reconciliation: only orders from P44 (96 units) and P45 (10 units) are viable. Demand regime (P31-P45) is stable at ~53 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime starting from Period 31, averaging approximately 53 units/period (P31-P46 average is ~52.8). The 'In-transit' inventory of 1497 units is highly inflated by lost shipments. My reconciliation from Carry-Over Insights shows 1357 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). Subtracting these from the total 1497 leaves a real pipeline of 140 units, consisting of orders from P44 (96 units), P45 (10 units), and P46 (34 units). To ensure the OR backend (which relies on 'total' in-transit) doesn't under-order, I use 'mu_hat' with an 'explicit' value. Calculation: Target Stock for (L+1) periods = 3 * 53 = 159. The backend will subtract the full 1497 in-transit from the base stock. Therefore, I set mu_hat = 159 + 1357 = 1516. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (1-3 periods). For sigma_hat, I use a 'recent_N' of 15 to capture the volatility of the current lower demand regime.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the system shows an In-transit inventory of 1527 units. However, based on longitudinal tracking, 1357 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). The viable pipeline consists only of orders from Period 44 (96 units), Period 45 (10 units), Period 46 (34 units), and Period 47 (30 units). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P31-P47) is stable at a lower regime of ~53 units/period. The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Since the backend sees 1527 units (which includes 1357 phantom units) it will order 0 unless mu_hat is adjusted. To neutralize this, mu_hat must be set to (forecasted demand for lead time context) + 1357. Forecast for L=2 is (1+2)*53 = 159. Total explicit mu_hat = 159 + 1357 = 1516.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory remains 1357 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37 confirm lost). Pipeline reconciliation: only orders from P44 onwards are viable. Demand regime (P31-P47) is stable at ~53 units/period.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are at the end of the simulation. On-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' quantity is 1545 units, but as tracked in carry-over insights, 1357 units are confirmed lost (shipments from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, and P37). The viable pipeline consists of orders from P44 (96 units), P45 (10 units), P46 (34 units), P47 (30 units), and P48 (18 units), totaling 188 functional units. Recent demand (P31-P48) has stabilized at a lower regime, averaging 53 units per period. The OR backend subtracts the full 1545 units 'In-transit' from its target stock calculation. To compensate for the 1357 phantom units being subtracted, mu_hat must be set to (1+L)*demand + 1357. Using L=2 (promised) and demand=53, the base requirement is 3*53 = 159. Adding 1357 results in an explicit mu_hat of 1516. However, since the simulation ends in Period 50 and the lead time is at least 1 period, orders placed now will likely not arrive in time to satisfy any more demand. Nevertheless, the goal is to set the parameters correctly for the immediate lead time window. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom inventory and maintain a standard sigma_hat based on the recent stable demand period (N=18 periods since P31).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 31, averaging approximately 53 units per period. Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting we should rely on a recent average. The primary challenge is the significant quantity of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline: orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, 25, 29, 30, 33, and 37 are confirmed lost but still occupy the 'In-transit' tally within the backend. This phantom inventory totals 1357 units. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock to determine the order quantity, we must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target. Specifically, the base stock for a lead time of 2 should be (2+1)*53 = 159. To offset the 1357 unit phantom inventory subtraction, the explicit mu_hat is set to 159 + 1357 = 1516. For sigma_hat, we use the recent variation (std dev of ~20) over the coverage period, resulting in sqrt(3)*20 approx 35.
