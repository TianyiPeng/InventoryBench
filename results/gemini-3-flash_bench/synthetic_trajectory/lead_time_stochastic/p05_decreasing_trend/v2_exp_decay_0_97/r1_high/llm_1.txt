The mean demand is approximately 175 units per period. c) Lead Time: The promised lead time is 2 periods.

To cover the next 3-4 periods (L+1) while accounting for the recent high demand of 107, an order is necessary to rebuild safety stock.

Since 250 units are currently reliable in-transit and likely to arrive in the next 1-2 periods, the immediate pipeline is sufficient.
