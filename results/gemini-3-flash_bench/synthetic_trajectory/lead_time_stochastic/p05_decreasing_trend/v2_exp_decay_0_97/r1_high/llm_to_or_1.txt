Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no history yet, but we have 5 historical demand samples (187, 189, 158, 158, 184) giving a mean of 175.2 and a standard deviation of 15.6. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The OR backend uses base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Since we need to cover the current period's demand (happening after decision) plus the lead time, the total coverage window is L+1=3 periods. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 2), mu_hat (3 * average demand), and sigma_hat (sqrt(3) * std). The stock level should aim for around 525 units to ensure high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 202 units, but since the promised lead time is 2 periods, we expect those units to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we missed 225 units of demand in Period 1. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the available 5 samples (P1-P5 from setup: 187, 189, 158, 158, 184) averages approximately 175.2. However, the first actual period of play (Period 1) recorded a demand of 225, which is higher than the historical samples. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to incorporate the historical base but will monitor if this higher demand persists. Since no deliveries have concluded yet, L is set to default (promised = 2). The OR backend will calculate base stock for L+1 (3 periods) of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), we have observed demand for 5 periods (187, 189, 158, 158, 184), with an average of approximately 175.2 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 202 units, and in Period 2, we ordered 229 units. According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase. As of the start of Period 3, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 431 units in-transit. Since we have not yet reached the conclusion of Period 3, we don't have confirmation of the actual lead time yet, but we expect the first shipment to land this period. I will use 'default' for L (2 periods) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture the most recent stable demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (202 units) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible in 'Period 3 conclude'. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. Per the 'Critical Timing Example', this indicates a delay or that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. With 0 on-hand inventory and 614 units in-transit (P1, P2, P3 orders), we have missed demand for 3 consecutive periods. For Period 4, demand is expected to remain consistent with the initial samples (mean ~175). I will use L=3 to account for the observed delay and set mu_hat/sigma_hat based on all available samples (N=5) to stabilize the base stock calculation, ensuring the OR backend targets a pipeline that covers the extended lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3195.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first set of arrivals. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times observed in the Period 4 conclude message were 3 periods (Order 1) and 1 period (Order 3). Order 2 (placed Period 2) is currently overdue if we expect L=2, as it should have arrived in Period 4. This indicates lead time variability. On-hand inventory is 206 with 421 in-transit. Historical demand over 5 periods is [187, 189, 158, 158, 184] (mean ~175.2). To balance the stock-out risk from lead time variability against holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach. I'll set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed lead times (3 and 1), and use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the current mean while accounting for recent fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3794.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show high variability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (L=3), while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (L=1). The Period 2 order (229 units) is currently missing (L=4 if it arrives next period). Currently, on-hand inventory is critically low (6 units) with 609 units in-transit (Orders from P2, P4, and P5). Average demand over the first 5 periods is approximately 185.6. Given the inconsistent lead times and the missing P2 order, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but monitoring for potential loss or further delay. For demand, the last 5 samples (P1-P5) are relatively stable (159 to 225), so I will use a 5-period average (recent_N=5) to capture the current mean of ~186. Sigma is set to default to handle the observed variance. The OR backend will compute the base stock to cover (L+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability detected: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, P2 order is currently delayed (missing after 4 periods).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 with 0 on-hand inventory and 613 units in-transit. History shows significant lead time instability: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1, and P2 (ordered 229 units) is missing after 5 periods. P4 (192), P5 (188), and P6 (4) orders are also outstanding. The absence of P2 suggests it might be lost or extremely delayed, causing the stock-out in P6. Demand is relatively stable, averaging 180 units/period (P1-P6). To recover, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed upper bound of delivery times. I'll use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the latest demand trend (approx 180 * (1+3) = 720). Sigma_hat is set to default to recognize the underlying demand volatility across the full sample set.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: P1=3 periods, P3=1 period. P2 (229 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods elapsed), potentially lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3148.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown relative stability with a mean of approximately 176.5 units per period over 7 periods. My primary concern is significant lead time instability and a potential lost shipment. The Period 2 order (229 units) has been outstanding for 6 periods (promised 2), making it highly likely to be lost. Excluding this potentially lost order, the current pipeline is 337 units (P5=188, P6=4, P7=145). The observed successful lead times are 3, 1, and 3 periods, averaging 2.33. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to guard against the risk of longer transit times and lost units. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering periods 3-7) to capture the current demand level. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand over (L+1)=4 periods, adjusting for the 25 units on-hand and the remaining reliable in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Order from Period 2 (229 units) confirmed as lost shipment (6 periods elapsed vs 2 promised). Average actual lead time for successful deliveries is 2.33 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3002.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the 'chips(Regular)' inventory shows that order P1 (L=3), P3 (L=1), P4 (L=3), P5 (L=3), and P7 (L=1) have arrived. Order P2 is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Order P6 (4 units) and P8 (159 units) are currently in-transit. The observed lead times are {3, 1, 3, 3, 1}, resulting in an average of 2.2 periods. To account for this variability and the risk of lost orders, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. Demand has been relatively stable around a mean of 178.6 over the last 8 periods. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand profile while the system recovers from the P2 stockout and P6 delay. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 392) includes the likely lost P2 (229 units) and P6 (4 units) which is now overdue. The OR backend will subtract this pipeline, so by setting L=3, I am raising the target base stock to compensate for the missing units.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability remains high: modes are 1 and 3 periods, average 2.2. Order P6 is now overdue (3 periods elapsed). Continuous risk of lost shipments identified after P2 confirmation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2691.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a highly unstable supply chain. Lead times for successful deliveries vary between 1 and 3 periods: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1, P8=1. The average lead time for non-lost orders is 2.0 periods, but the order from P2 is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed) and P6 is significantly overdue (4 periods elapsed, promised 2). This risk of lost shipments requires a buffer. Demand remains relatively stable with the last 5 periods (P5-P9) averaging 167.8 units. To mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by missing shipments (like P6), I will use an explicit L of 3 to reflect the maximum observed lead time and ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level (~168/period), and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to account for recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Order P6 (placed Period 6) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, mirroring the P2 loss pattern. Lead times for successful arrivals are bimodal at 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2603.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the inventory stands at 57 units on-hand with 539 in-transit. Analysis of past arrivals confirms high lead time variability and order loss. Specifically, orders from P2 (657 units originally ordered/in-transit across periods) and P6 are confirmed or highly likely lost (P2 is 9 periods overdue, P6 is 5 periods overdue). Successful arrivals have followed a bimodal lead time of either 1 or 3 periods (Average: 2.0). The total in-transit quantity of 539 includes the likely lost P6 order (4 units); adjusting for this, effective pipeline inventory is around 535 units (P9 and P10 orders). Demand has stabilized recently, averaging 153.4 over the last 5 periods (P6-P10). Given the risk of shipment loss and the bimodal lead time, I am setting L to 3 to ensure the base stock formula covers the upper bound of the reliable delivery window. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current demand regime, which is slightly lower and less volatile than the initial five samples.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (4 units) confirmed as lost shipment (5 periods elapsed vs 2 promised). Overall shipment reliability is approximately 80% (2 losses out of 10 orders placed). Delivery lead times remain strictly bimodal at 1 or 3 periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the on-hand inventory is 0 after stockout in Period 11 (sold 57/163 demand). Current in-transit inventory is 605 units (consisting of orders from P9, P10, and P11). Looking at history, lead times are bimodal (1 or 3 periods) with a 20% loss rate (P2 and P6 lost). Order P9 (placed Period 9) is now at 3 periods and should arrive this period (L=3), while P10 and P11 are still within the expected window. Demand remains stable, averaging ~172 units across all recorded periods (1-11). To account for the risk of shipment loss and the bimodal lead time, I am setting L=3 to ensure the target base stock covers the maximum expected lead time. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the full demand distribution since no clear regime shift is observed.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received orders from P9 (LT=3) and P10 (LT=2), confirming that lead times continue to fluctuate between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with a historical bimodal tendency (1 and 3) now showing some reliability at the promised 2 periods. The lost shipment history (P2 and P6) remains a concern for pipeline integrity. Demand has stabilized recently, with the last 5 periods (P8-P12) showing a mean of 151 units, significantly lower than the initial periods. We have 174 units on hand. The in-transit pipeline of 453 units includes P11 (66) and P12 (154), plus potentially older or newer shipments. Given the risk of lost orders and the L+1 coverage requirement, I will set L to 2 (promised), but use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the current lower demand regime (avg 151) and its associated volatility. This prevents over-ordering based on early-game high demand while maintaining a buffer for lead-time variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 8: mean decreased from ~180 to ~151 (-16%). Lead time variability persists across 1, 2, and 3 periods, but reliability has improved since the P6 loss.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing chips(Regular) following a confirmed demand regime shift that occurred at Period 8. The mean demand has decreased from ~180 to approximately 151 units per period. Lead times remain unstable, observed as 1, 2, or 3 periods (bimodal behavior), and the system has experienced two lost shipments (P2 and P6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 56 units with 453 units in-transit (reflecting orders from P11 and P12). Because of the delivery variability and the risk of lost orders, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time experienced rather than the promised 2 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 8-13) to capture the lower demand regime and its associated volatility. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the reduced demand while maintaining a buffer against lead time inconsistency.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2318.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 8, stabilizing at a lower mean. Over the last 7 periods (P8-P14), the mean demand is approximately 145.7 units. The current on-hand inventory is 0, while 472 units are in-transit (Orders from P12, P14, and potentially P15). Specifically, the order from P12 (154 units) is now at lead time 3 and should arrive in the current period (P15 resolution), though this is only confirmed in P16's message. Lead times remain variable (1-3 periods). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time of ~2.2 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the lower demand regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2926.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 8-15) shows a stabilized regime with a mean of approximately 148.6 units, compared to the initial ~180. The inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 436 units, consisting of orders from P13 (0 units), P14 (85 units), and P15 (118 units), although there seems to be a mismatch in the system's 'In-transit' figure compared to the history log (The log suggests P13+P14+P15 = 203, but the status shows 436; I will trust the status view). Lead times are unstable (1, 2, or 3 periods). Successful lead times are: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1, P8=1, P9=3, P10=2, P11=3, P12=3. Average lead time is 2.3 periods. I will use L=recent_3 to adapt to the recent trend of longer (3-period) arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_8 to capture the current lower demand regime that started around Period 8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 613 units in-transit. The game history shows that the order from Period 14 (85 units) is now 3 periods overdue compared to the lead time of 2. Historical data indicates a bimodal lead time of 1 or 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1, P9:3, P10:2, P11:3, P12:3). However, we also have a history of lost shipments (P2 and P6). Given that Period 16 concluded with 0 on-hand and 0 sales against a demand of 122, we are in a stockout. The pipeline contains Period 14 (85), Period 15 (118), Period 16 (177), and the pending order from today. The demand regime has shifted since Period 8 to a lower average (approx. 145 units per period). Because of the stockout and the high variability in lead times (avg ~2.3 among successful ones), I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 (covering the stable regime starting at Period 8) to capture the lower demand mean. sigma_hat will also use recent_N for consistency in variance estimation during this regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Stockout occurred in Period 16 (0 sold, 122 demand). Shipment from P14 (85 units) is reaching the 3-period mark; if it does not arrive next period, it may be the third lost shipment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2318.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we successfully received two shipments: 85 units (ordered P14, L=3) and 177 units (ordered P16, L=1). This has restored the on-hand inventory to 133 units after the stockout in P16. The demand remains stable within the lower regime identified at P8, with the last 5 periods (P13-P17) averaging 135.8 units/period. Lead time continues to be highly variable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average \u2248 2). Since reliability has slightly stabilized after the P6 loss, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual historical average (approx 2.2). For demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current lower-demand regime (post-P8) while providing sufficient samples for a stable mean and standard deviation estimate. This approach balances the need for protection against lead-time variability with the current identified sales trend.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability remains the primary operational risk (1-3 periods). Recent arrivals (P14 and P16) confirm the supply chain is delivering, though the bimodal nature persists. Demand regime remains steady at ~140 units/period since Period 8.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1. The demand regime has stabilized around 140 units/period since Period 8. Lead times remain bimodal (1-3 periods), with a significant risk of lost shipments (P2 and P6 lost previously). Currently, we have 33 units on-hand and 453 units in-transit (orders from P15, P17, P18). The order from P15 (118 units) is now at the 4-period mark and has not arrived; given historical trends where orders arriving at L=3 or not at all (P2, P6), there is a high probability P15 is lost. To compensate for this potential supply gap and the bimodal lead time (averaging ~2.2 for successful deliveries), I am setting L to 3 periods explicitly. This ensures the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=11) to capture the stable demand regime since Period 8 (~142 units/period). sigma_hat is also calculated using N=11 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: P15 order (118 units) is 4 periods overdue; given historical evidence from P2 and P6, it is highly likely a lost shipment. Lead time for successful deliveries remains bimodal at 1 or 3 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Delivery reliability is a major concern: two shipments (P2 and P6) were confirmed lost, and the shipment from P15 (118 units) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting it is also lost. Successful deliveries exhibit a bimodal lead time of 1 or 3 periods (average ~2.3). Starting with Period 8, a demand regime shift occurred where mean demand decreased to approximately 140 units per period. Since Period 8, we have 12 samples (P8-P19) with a mean of 141.4. To account for the current stockout and the high risk of lead time variability/lost shipments, I will set L to 3 (explicitly choosing the upper bound of the bimodal distribution) and mu_hat based on the last 12 samples (N=12) to capture the stabilized lower demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=12) to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: P15 order (118 units) confirmed as the third lost shipment (5 periods elapsed vs 2 promised). Lead-time bimodal pattern (1 or 3 periods) persists for successful arrivals. Demand regime post-Period 8 remains stable at ~141 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is facing a severe stockout situation. On-hand inventory is 0, following two periods of failed sales (P19-P20) and a confirmed lost shipment from P15 (118 units). This is the third lost shipment in 20 periods (P2, P6, P15), suggesting a ~15% loss rate. Total in-transit inventory is 624 units (orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20), but none arrived in the P20 conclude message. Recent demand remains stable in the current regime (Post-P8) at approximately 143 units/period (mean of last 13 samples). Lead times for successful deliveries continue to be bimodal (1 or 3 periods). Given the stockout and the high volatility in lead times, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delayed bimodal peak and ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum reliable horizon. Demand (mu_hat) is set using recent_N (N=13) to capture the current stable regime while ignoring the initial high-demand phase. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=13) to capture the actual volatility of this regime.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with an on-hand balance of 0 for the last three periods, resulting in missed sales. This is due to a combination of demand exceeding supply and the loss of the Period 15 order (118 units), which is now 7 periods old and confirmed lost. There are 624 units in-transit, including orders from P17 (28), P18 (74), P19 (143), P20 (28), and a large corrective order from P21 (presumably the remainder of the 624). Lead times for successful deliveries continue to be bimodal (1 or 3 periods). The demand regime has remained stable at approximately 140 units/period since Period 8. To recover from the stockout and account for the high lead time variability (mode of 3), I will set L to 3 and use a 14-period window (P8-P21) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current stable demand regime. This will raise the base stock level significantly to pull more inventory through the pipeline, while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 15 (118 units) as the third lost shipment (7 periods elapsed). Demand regime stable at ~140 units/period since Period 8 (avg P8-P21 = 139).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory and 624 units in-transit. Since Period 19, no inventory has arrived. Comparing the current period (23) to the 'In-transit' history: orders from P18 (74 units), P19 (143 units), P20 (28 units), and P22 (0 units) are within the normal 1-3 period lead-time window. However, the order from P15 (118 units) is confirmed lost, and the lack of arrivals from P18-20 is concerning. The demand regime has stabilized since Period 8 at approximately 139-141 units/period (average P8-P22 is 138.8). Given the bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) and the high stockout risk, I am selecting L=3 to ensure the base stock covers the maximum likely delivery delay. I will use a recent_N of 15 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (Period 8 to 22), and default for sigma_hat to account for historical volatility in the service level calculation.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand has stabilized at approximately 140 units per period since Period 8, but the supply chain is highly unreliable. We have confirmed three lost shipments (P2, P6, P15) and a bimodal lead time pattern (1 or 3 periods). Order P18 (74 units), P19 (143 units), and P20 (28 units) are highly relevant. P18 is now 5 periods since ordering and P19 is 4 periods; historical patterns suggest these may be lost or significantly delayed, similar to P15. Currently, 612 units are in-transit, but given the 80% reliability rate and the age of P18/P19, the effective pipeline is likely much lower. Since the stockout is ongoing (sold only 28 units out of 97 demand in P23), I will set L to 3 (the upper bound of successful arrivals) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum likely lead time. mu_hat is set to 560 (140 * (3+1)) using the stable demand mean from the last 15 periods (approx Period 8 onwards). sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=15) to capture the variance of this stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged stockout status: Demand has exceeded supply for 5 consecutive periods (P19-P23). Orders P18 and P19 are now 5 and 4 periods overdue respectively, increasing the probability of them being lost shipments, following the patterns of P2, P6, and P15.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The primary issue is a high failure rate in the supply chain. Orders from Period 18 (7 periods ago) and Period 19 (6 periods ago) have not arrived and are now statistically confirmed as lost, following the precedent set by P2, P6, and P15. Currently, 612 units are 'In-transit', but at least 217 of these (P18: 74, P19: 143) are likely lost. The demand regime remains stable at approximately 140 units/period (average P8-P24 is 134, but P1-P8 was higher). To compensate for the low reliability and the depleted inventory, I am setting L=3 (the upper bound of successful delivery times) to ensure the OR backend's service level calculation is sufficiently aggressive. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=17) to capture the stable demand regime since Period 8. sigma_hat uses recent_N to reflect current volatility. These parameters aim to trigger a significant re-order to overcome lost inventory and bridge the stockout.

Carry-over insight: P18 (74 units) and P19 (143 units) confirmed as lost shipments (7 and 6 periods elapsed respectively). Supply chain reliability remains low with a significant risk of total loss for approximately 25-30% of orders. Successful lead times continue to be bimodal (1 or 3 periods).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing extreme instability. We are currently in a prolonged stockout period (P19-P25) due to five confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Successive orders have been lost, leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory. In-transit inventory stands at 596, but much of this is likely comprised of older, potentially lost orders (specifically P17, P20 previously arrived, but P16-P22 sequence has gaps). Successful arrivals follow a bimodal lead time of 1 or 3 periods (average ~2.3 for deliveries). Demand has shifted lower since Period 8, stabilizing around 130-140 units, with the most recent 10-period mean approximately 119 units. Given the high stockout risk and 25-30% order loss rate, I am setting L=3 to account for the upper end of the bimodal arrival and using recent_N for demand to capture the stabilized lower regime. This will signal the backend to increase the base stock level to compensate for the delayed/lost arrivals and protect against further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged stockout confirmed through P25. Supply chain reliability remains low at ~70% with 5 confirmed losses (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Demand since P16 has trended lower, averaging ~114 units over the last 10 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with 5 confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) and a 0 inventory on-hand balance. Total 'In-transit' is 596 units, but given the attrition rate (~30%), a significant portion of the pipeline might be lost. Demand has entered a lower regime, averaging 106 units over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), and approximately 114 over the last 10 periods. The bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) persists for survivors. I will set L to 3 to improve the safety buffer against the longer delivery mode and use a recent N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the lower demand trend. Sigma_hat is set significantly higher using the 'explicit' method to account for the massive variance induced by frequent lost shipments, which acts as a 'service level' multiplier to ensure the OR backend orders enough to overcome the ~30% loss rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: avg P17-P26 is ~114 vs P8-P16 of ~141. Supply chain reliability remains low at ~70% (5 losses: P2, P6, P15, P18, P19).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted downward; the average demand from Period 17 to Period 27 is approximately 107.5 units, compared to the earlier average of ~140. However, the supply chain remains highly unreliable with a ~30% loss rate (confirmed losses: P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). We are currently in a stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The total in-transit quantity is 689, but this includes potentially lost or delayed orders. Since Period 20, orders have been sporadic. To recover from the stockout and account for the high probability of shipment loss, I will set mu_hat using the recent 11 periods (P17-P27) to capture the lower demand regime (~108 units/period), but I will use a slightly more conservative sigma_hat to buffer against lead-time variability. I'll maintain L at calculated to reflect the bimodal 1-3 period actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: avg P17-P27 is ~108 units (down from ~140 in P8-P16). Supply chain reliability remains a major risk with a ~30% historical loss rate.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted downwards significantly, averaging ~108 units since Period 17 (compared to ~140 earlier). Supply chain reliability remains a critical failure point, with a ~30% historical loss rate (5 confirmed losses: P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Currently, the inventory status is critical: On-hand is 0, and the system has been in intermittent stockout for several periods. The In-transit quantity of 689 reflects several older orders that have likely been lost but are still counted by the OR backend. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, and to account for the actual bimodal lead time (averaging ~2.3 periods for successful deliveries), I am adjusting L to 3 and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly based on the recent lower demand regime (last 12 periods, avg ~105, std ~25). By using explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat, I ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock level that ignores historical 'lost' units and targets current demand realities.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: avg P17-P28 is ~105 units (down from ~140 in P8-P16). Supply chain reliability remains a major risk with a ~30% historical loss rate; pipeline inventory is currently inflated by likely lost orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1207.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has significantly decreased and stabilized at a lower level. Comparing the most recent 13 periods (P17-P29) against the preceding period, the mean demand has dropped from ~140 to ~101. The last 4 periods show even lower demand (averaging ~73), but N=13 is a safer window for standard deviation calculations. Supply chain reliability remains a critical concern: 5 orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) have been confirmed lost, creating a historical loss rate of approximately 31%. The current In-Transit inventory (596 units) is heavily inflated by these documented losses and potentially the P17 and P20 orders if they fail to arrive soon. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 'ghost' pipeline inventory, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of the bimodal arrival pattern) and using an explicit mu_hat based on the recent lower demand trend (~101 units/period * 4 periods = 404). This ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate while providing a buffer against the high shipment loss probability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: average demand for P17-P29 is ~101 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P25-P29) averaging ~77. Pipeline inventory of 596 is significantly compromised by confirmed and highly probable lost shipments.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly decreased. Over the last 14 periods (P17-P30), the average demand is ~103 units, with a further drop to ~88 units over the last 5 periods. I will use N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower regime while maintaining some stability. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a ~30% loss rate (confirmed losses for P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). The current 'In-transit' of 596 units is misleading as it includes these 5 confirmed lost shipments (totaling 708 units if P2 is still counted, though technically P2, P6, P15, P18, P19 sums to 229+4+118+74+143 = 568 units). There are no valid orders currently in transit that are expected to arrive. Effective inventory is 0. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the bimodal 1-3 period actual delivery time for successful orders. The OR backend will order to reach the base stock based on the new lower demand mean (~103) and observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease stabilized: avg P17-P30 is ~103 units. Total confirmed lost shipments: 5 (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant supply chain instability. In-transit inventory (596 units) is heavily distorted by confirmed and highly probable lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, and P20/P21/P22/P24 which had 0 orders, but there are old orders still technically 'in-transit'). Reliability is approximately 70%, with a bimodal lead time of 1-3 periods for successful deliveries. Demand has settled into a lower regime, with the P17-P31 average around 102 units/period. The current stockout (on-hand 0) and the high likelihood that current pipeline inventory is non-existent (mostly lost orders) necessitates an immediate replenishment order. I am setting L to 3 to account for the upper end of the bimodal lead-time distribution. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=15) to capture the current lower demand regime (approx 102/period). Due to high supply uncertainty and recent stockouts, I've chosen an explicit sigma_hat set slightly higher than the recent standard deviation to provide a buffer against demand volatility and lead-time inconsistency.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed: P17-P31 average demand is 101.6 units (approx 102), significantly lower than earlier periods. Pipeline integrity remains the primary risk; observed in-transit units include 5 confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. The average demand from Period 17 to Period 32 is approximately 101.6 units per period. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with five confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). These lost orders account for 509 units (229+4+118+74+143). Subtracting these from the current in-transit inventory of 596 units leaves a real pipeline of approximately 87 units (including the 28 units ordered in P17 and 0 units ordered in subsequent periods). We are currently in a persistent stockout because the OR backend perceives high pipeline inventory that doesn't physically exist. To force the system to order and restore on-hand stock, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand for the lead time (L=2) plus current period demand (total 3 periods), while keeping L at 'calculate' to reflect the bimodal reality and using a recent_N sigma to capture current volatility. Setting mu_hat to 305 (approx 102 units * 3) effectively signals the desired base stock level to overcome the ghost inventory.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 17 and has further softened recently. The average demand from Period 17 to Period 33 is approximately 100 units, while the very last 5 periods (P29-P33) average around 83 units. Supply chain reliability remains the primary concern with a ~30% loss rate (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19 confirmed lost). The in-transit inventory of 596 units is misleadingly high because it includes these 5 lost shipments (totaling 229 + 4 + 118 + 74 + 143 = 568 units). Therefore, the 'true' pipeline inventory is only 28 units (596 - 568). With zero on-hand inventory and a bimodal lead time (1-3 periods), I maintain \u03bc\u0302 based on the post-shift average (N=17) to provide a stable forecast, while using recent_N for \u03c3\u0302 to capture current volatility. No order was placed in P33, so I must ensure the OR engine recognizes the need to restock based on the corrected pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: average demand for P17-P33 is ~100 units, with p29-p33 softening further to ~83 units. True pipeline inventory is 28 units after accounting for 568 units across 5 confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward regime shift. From Periods 8-16, demand averaged ~141 units, but from Period 17-34, the average dropped to ~100 units. More recently (P29-P34), demand has softened further to an average of ~77 units. The supply chain has a critical reliability issue with a documented ~30% loss rate: orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19 (totaling 568 units) are confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 596 units is misleadingly high because it includes these 568 lost units; the true pipeline is only 28 units (from a recent order, although no orders were placed in P28-P34 according to history). To avoid excessive holding costs in a low-demand regime while accounting for the bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) and high loss risk, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 10-period demand average (~93) and set L to 3 to cover the longer end of the delivery window and buffer against potential losses.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, the supply chain has a significant loss rate (~30%) with 5 confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) totaling 568 units. These units still appear in 'In-transit' (596 total), but are virtually certain to be lost given they are 10-33 periods overdue. The current 'effective' in-transit inventory is 28 units (P17: 28 units), which is already 18 periods overdue and likely lost as well. Demand has shifted downwards significantly; while the P17-P35 average is ~93 units, the most recent 7 periods (P29-P35) have averaged ~75.5 units. To break the stockout and reset the pipeline, I will use an explicit L of 3 (the upper bound of successful lead times) to ensure the base stock covers the maximum expected delivery window. mu_hat is set explicitly to 300 to cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand at a conservative rate of ~75 units/period. sigma_hat is set explicitly to 50 to allow for moderate demand volatility while the OR engine manages the high critical ratio (19/20).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease stabilized: avg P29-P35 is ~75.5 units, down from ~100 in early P30s. Effective pipeline is likely zero as all 596 units in-transit are at least 10 periods overdue (P17-P23 orders).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level, averaging approximately 76 units over the last 10 periods (P27-P36). Currently, the system shows an in-transit inventory of 596 units; however, historical analysis and Carry-over Insights (Period 36) confirm that these units belong to orders from Period 23 or earlier (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, and P20), all of which are significantly overdue and must be treated as lost shipments. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0, and on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in a prolonged stockout. To recover, I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10-period window (N=10) to capture the current lower demand level (~76/period) while ignoring the 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Although the promised lead time (L) is 2, successful deliveries show a bimodal distribution of 1 or 3 periods. I will use the default lead time for the backend calculation but ensure the demand parameters reflect the need to restock based on recent trends.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 36, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. All 596 units listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed or highly probable lost shipments (orders from P23 or earlier). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~76 units/period (avg P27-P36).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by two critical factors: a significant demand regime shift and a high rate of shipment loss. Since Period 27, demand has stabilized at a lower mean. Comparing the most recent segment (P27-P37) to previous periods, the average demand is approximately 76 units per period. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' balance of 596 units consists entirely of orders placed on or before Period 23 (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, and P17). Given that the maximum observed successful lead time is 3 periods, and these shipments are between 14 to 35 periods overdue, they are confirmed lost. The effective pipeline inventory is 0. To restart supply and account for the 30% historical loss rate and 1-3 period lead time variability, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of successful arrivals) and mu_hat to an explicit value that covers demand for (L+1) periods based on the recent regime (76 * 4 = 304). Sigma_hat is set to cover the observed volatility in this lower regime to avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory remains 0 as of Period 38; all 596 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P17). Demand regime stabilized at ~76 units/period (avg P27-P37).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level than the start of the simulation. Since Period 27, the average demand is approximately 76 units per period (avg P27-P38). The inventory system is currently compromised because the 'In-transit' figure of 596 units consists entirely of lost shipments (Orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, and P17). These orders are all more than 10 periods overdue and will not arrive. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. To restart replenishment and clear the stockout, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I set L=3 to account for the upper end of the bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) and the high loss risk. mu_hat is set to 304 (4 periods * 76 units/period) to cover the lead time plus the review period. sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for recent demand volatility and supply uncertainty. These settings will force the OR backend to place a new order despite the inflated 'In-transit' count, as the 'cap' mechanism and the gap between base_stock and effective pipeline should trigger a shipment.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40, the supply chain is non-functional for this SKU. There have been no new orders placed since Period 27 and no arrivals since Period 29. All 596 units currently labeled as 'In-transit' are confirmed or highly probable lost shipments from orders placed between Periods 2 and 23. The demand has shifted significantly lower, with Period 39 recording the lowest demand yet (10 units). Given the on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is effectively 0 (the OR backend still sees 596 units), no order will be triggered unless mu_hat is set high enough to overcome the false pipeline or an explicit order is forced. Since the SKU is 'Regular' chips and we are in the final 10 periods without a reliable supply chain, I will set parameters to reflect the recent demand regime (avg P29-P39 ~69 units) while using 'explicit' L to signal the backend that the effective pipeline is empty. However, since the system has completely stopped ordering and arriving, I am maintaining the lower demand forecast (N=11 for the period since the last arrival) to avoid excessive holding costs if the supply chain suddenly 'unclogs' with stale inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime continues to decline: average demand for P33-P39 is ~55 units, with a sharp drop to 10 units in Period 39. Supply chain remains inactive with no arrivals for 10 consecutive periods and zero reliable units in transit.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is in a state of prolonged stockout and declining demand. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) is approximately 58 units, but the last 5 periods (P36-P40) have dropped to an average of ~56 units, with Period 39 showing a sharp outlier of 10. The 'In-transit' quantity of 596 units consists entirely of orders from Period 28 and earlier (P17, P18, P19, P28 etc.), which have all exceeded the 10-period mark and are correctly identified in carry-over insights as lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. To restore service while accounting for the lower demand regime and 70% supply chain reliability, I will set L to 3 (the upper bound of successful bimodal lead times) to ensure the base stock covers the longer delivery window. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8, covering P33-P40) to capture the trend toward ~50-60 units/period. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=8) to reflect the volatility of this more recent, lower volume demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction continues: Average demand for P31-P40 is ~58 units, a significant decrease from the ~76 observed in the P27-P37 window. Supply chain integrity remains zero for 13 consecutive periods (no arrivals since P29).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely compromised with no order arrivals since Period 29. The current 'In-transit' count of 596 units consists entirely of orders placed in or before Period 23 (at least 18 periods ago), which are effectively lost shipments. Consequently, effective pipeline inventory and on-hand inventory are both zero. Demand has shown a significant downward trend; the average demand from Period 31 to 41 is approximately 63 units, but recent volatility is high (ranging from 10 to 107). To restart operations while acknowledging the high risk of shipment loss (historical loss rate ~30%) and lead time variability (1-3 periods), I will set lead time (L) based on the calculated historical average of successful deliveries (approx. 2.3 periods). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the lower demand regime (~63 units/period) across the lead time and review period (1+L). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: No arrivals for 13 consecutive periods. Effective pipeline inventory remains 0; all 596 in-transit units are confirmed lost shipments. Demand regime for P31-P41 has softened to ~63 units/period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains entirely non-functional with no arrivals since Period 29 (14 consecutive periods). The 'In-transit' balance of 596 units consists entirely of orders placed in or before Period 27 which are long overdue and confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P17). Effectively, on-hand and pipeline inventory are zero. Demand has shown a significant downward trend and high volatility; the average across the last 10 periods (P33-P42) is approximately 61.4 units. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the maximum observed lead time, given the unreliability. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current lower demand regime (~61 units/period), setting the inventory target based on (1+L) periods. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility. These parameters will trigger a 'cap' order in the OR backend to attempt to restart the flow while acknowledging the high risk of loss.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: No arrivals for 14 periods (P30-P43). Total effective inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 0; the 596 units in-transit are confirmed lost. Demand regime for last 10 periods (P33-P42) has stabilized at ~61 units/period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has effectively collapsed, with no arrivals since Period 29 (14 periods of silence). Analysis of the 'In-transit' balance (596 units) against the game history confirms that these units consist entirely of orders placed on or before Period 28, which are now significantly past any bimodal lead-time window (1-3 periods). Specifically, the pipeline contains orders that are at least 15 periods old. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has also shifted into a lower, more volatile regime. The last 10 periods (P34-P43) show an average demand of approximately 58 units, but with high variance (range 10 to 107). To restart the inventory flow and account for the high loss rate (~30-50% recently) and bimodal lead times, I am setting L to 3 (the upper end of successful deliveries) and using the recent 10-period demand average (~60 units) to set mu_hat. Given the stockout state and high lead-time risk, mu_hat is set to cover (1+L) periods, totaling 240 units. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 60 to allow the OR engine to buffer against the recent demand volatility (107 peak).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: 14 consecutive periods without arrivals (P30-P43). Total effective pipeline is 0; the 596 in-transit units are confirmed lost shipments. Demand regime for P34-P43 has stabilized at ~58 units/period with high variance.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has effectively collapsed, with no arrivals since Period 29 (16 consecutive periods). All 596 units currently 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from orders placed between Period 17 and Period 23. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has significantly decreased and shows high volatility in the most recent periods; the average demand for the last 15 periods (P30-P44) is approximately 63 units, but the last 5 periods (P40-P44) averaged only 46.6 units with a very low of 8. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the last 10 periods (N=10) to reflect this lower, volatile regime (~58 units/period). Lead time (L) is set to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the persistent bimodal delay (1-3 periods) seen in earlier successful deliveries, effectively extending the look-ahead window. Since the 'In-transit' inventory is entirely composed of lost orders, the OR backend's capped policy (which subtracts pipeline inventory) would prevent any new orders. To bypass this and attempt to restock, mu_hat must be set high enough to overcome the 596 phantom units; however, the 'cap' logic in the OR backend may still restrict ordering. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to signal a required inventory level that accounts for the fact that current pipeline is zero.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: 16 consecutive periods without arrivals (P30-P44). Effective pipeline is 0; all 596 in-transit units are confirmed lost. Most recent demand regime (P40-P44) has softened further to an average of ~47 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has experienced widespread failure with no arrivals for 16 consecutive periods (since Period 29). On-hand inventory is 0. While the system reports 932 units in-transit, 596 of these (from orders P23 and earlier) are confirmed lost. The recent order of 336 units in Period 45 is the only potentially viable pipeline inventory, but given the 70%+ historical loss rate and 16-period drought, its arrival is highly uncertain. Demand has contracted significantly, averaging ~47 units over the last 5 periods (P41-P45) and ~58 units over the last 10 (P36-P45). I will set L to 15 to reflect the extreme delay/unreliability observed, mu_hat to an explicit value based on the current 47-unit demand regime for (L+1) periods, and sigma_hat to a high explicit value to account for the extreme demand volatility (ranging from 8 to 107 in the last 10 periods). This positioning attempts to capture any possible arrival while acknowledging the broken supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse: 16 consecutive periods without arrivals (P30-P45). Last successful arrival was P29 (ordered P27). Effective pipeline is highly questionable; 596 units are confirmed lost, 336 are recently ordered. Demand regime (P41-P45) avg is ~47 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has shown significant instability, with no successful arrivals between Period 30 and Period 46. An order of 336 units was placed in Period 45, and 84 units in Period 46. Given the bimodal lead time history (1 or 3 periods) and the general unreliability of the pipeline, I must treat the 596 units from earlier periods (P1-P23) as permanently lost. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1016 units consists of 596 confirmed/likely lost units and 420 recently ordered units (P45, P46). The demand regime has shifted downwards significantly, averaging approximately 47 units over the last 5 periods (P42-P46). For Period 47, mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture this softened demand. L is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the historical variability (1-3 periods). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to reflect the current lower demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain activity resumed with orders in P45 and P46. Total historical lost shipments remain at 596 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P17). Effective pipeline now includes 420 active units (336 from P45, 84 from P46). Demand regime for P41-P46 has stabilized at a lower mean of ~47 units.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The supply chain has been severely compromised with 596 units of in-transit inventory confirmed as lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P17). However, supply chain activity resumed in Period 45. We are currently tracking two active orders: P45 (336 units) and P46 (84 units), totaling 420 reliable units in transit. Given the historical bimodal lead time of 1 or 3 periods, we expect the P45 order to arrive in the Period 48 resolution phase (visible at the start of Period 49). Demand has significantly contracted in the last 10 periods; the P43-P47 window shows an average demand of approximately 21.4 units, with very low values in the most recent 3 periods (16, 7). To avoid excessive holding costs at the end of the game (ending at Period 50), and since current reliable pipeline (420) already covers approximately 20 periods of recent average demand, no further orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect the most recent demand regime and maintain the pipeline without triggering new orders.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost shipments: 596 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Reliable pipeline inventory currently consists only of orders from Period 45 onwards. Demand regime has dropped significantly below 50 units/period since Period 43.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has been severely disrupted with no arrivals since Period 29. Of the 1,016 units in-transit, 596 units (from orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost. The remaining 420 units (ordered in P45 and P46) are currently within the 3nd and 4th period of lead time respectively. Given the bimodal lead time history (1 or 3 periods) and previous losses, these units should have arrived by now if the lead time was 1-3 periods. Since they haven't arrived in P48's conclusion, they are either delayed (L=4+) or potentially lost. I will treat the effective pipeline as the 420 units from P45-P46 but realize the risk is high. Demand has shifted drastically to a much lower regime. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P39-P48) is 38.6 units, but the last 5 periods (P44-P48) show a mean of 23.2 units with high volatility. Since we are at Period 49 of 50, and current in-transit (420 units) far exceeds any possible demand for the final 2 periods (approx 50-80 units), I will set L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to a very conservative estimate reflecting the recent low-demand regime to prevent further ordering, as the existing pipeline (if it arrives) is already excessive.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain remains stagnant: 19 consecutive periods without arrivals (last arrival P29). Recent orders P45 (336 units) and P46 (84 units) are now 4 and 3 periods old respectively without arriving, suggesting either a permanent shift to a longer lead time or further systemic losses. Demand regime (P44-P48) has dropped to ~23 units/period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by severe supply chain instability and a significant downward shift in demand. There have been no successful arrivals since Period 29 (20 periods ago). Based on historical patterns, 596 units in the 'In-transit' bucket (from orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are effectively lost. The only potentially viable pipeline inventory consists of orders from P45 (336 units) and P46 (84 units). However, these are now 5 and 4 periods old respectively, exceeding the promised lead time of 2 and even the maximum historical successful lead time of 3, suggesting they too may be lost or delayed by a systemic failure. Demand has collapsed remarkably, averaging ~27 units/period over the last 5 periods (P45-P49), compared to ~60 earlier. Given we are at Period 50, I will set parameters to stabilize coverage for this new low-demand regime while recognizing the high lead-time uncertainty. I use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the most recent local contraction.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: No arrivals for 20 consecutive periods (P30-P49). Demand regime has hit a new low, averaging ~27 units/period over the last 5 periods (P45-P49). Recent orders (P45, P46) are now overdue (5 and 4 periods respectively), increasing the probability that the supply chain is non-functional.
