Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for Period 1-5 shows an average of 175.2 units (187, 189, 158, 158, 184). Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the 'default' lead time (promised L=2) and demand statistics (mu and sigma) based on the provided history. The system will calculate (1+L) * average demand, ensuring we order enough to cover the lead time plus the current period's demand. Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, leading to a target service level of 0.5, which the OR engine will handle via z-score calculations.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 202 units, but since the promised lead time is 2 periods, they are currently 'in-transit' and will not arrive until the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Consequently, we had 0 inventory to meet the Period 1 demand of 218, resulting in 218 units of lost sales. Historical demand samples (187, 189, 158, 158, 184) show a mean of 175.2 and a standard deviation of 15.1. However, Period 1 demand was 218, which is significantly higher (nearly 3 standard deviations above the mean). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to weigh recent observations and ensure the OR backend accounts for the promised lead time (L=2). Since L=2, the target inventory must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I'll stick to 'default' for L and sigma_hat for now until more actual arrival/variance data is observed.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (202 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase, meaning it will appear in the 'Period 3 conclude' message visible at the start of Period 4. Until then, on-hand remains 0 and sales are lost. Current historical demand (including the seed samples) shows a mean demand of 195.8 units/period (Seed: 187, 189, 158, 158, 184; Period 1: 218; Period 2: 224). The most recent two periods (P1, P2) show a slight upward shift compared to the seed. Given the 2-period lead time, we need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent uptick while balancing with history, and 'default' for L and sigma_hat as there is no evidence yet to deviate from promised lead time or overall volatility.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 were expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution, which would be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0', and on-hand inventory remains 0. This suggests either the actual lead time is longer than 2 periods or the shipment from Period 1 is lost or significantly delayed. No units have been sold yet due to zero on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 566 units (202 from P1, 224 from P2, 140 from P3). I will maintain the lead time at the promised 'default' (2) for now but monitor the P1 shipment closely in the next period. If it doesn't arrive by P4 conclude, I will adjust L to 'explicit' or 'recent_N'. For demand forecasting, the average demand of the first 3 periods is approx 208.7. Using 'default' for mu_hat will calculate (1+L)*mean_demand, which is (1+2)*208.7 = 626.1, which aligns with covering the lead time and review period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two shipments arrived: the P1 order (202 units) after 3 periods and the P3 order (140 units) after 1 period. The P2 order (224 units) remains in transit. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance (1 and 3 periods), averaging 2. Demand over the last 5 periods has been [218, 224, 184, 173, 184], with a mean of 196.6. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the jitter around the promised 2 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this early demand mean (approx 197/period) and its standard deviation (approx 22). This ensures the base stock calculation (1+L) * mean adequately covers the risk during the lead-time window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $167.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, current on-hand inventory is 1 unit. Looking at history, we've had two arrivals conclude: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (actual L=3) and Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (actual L=1). The promised lead time is 2, and the average observed lead time is 2. The pipeline (In-transit) is 459 units, representing orders from Period 2 (224 units) and Period 5 (235 units). Demand samples [187, 189, 158, 158, 184] (avg ~175.2) show relative stability. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time to allow the backend to use the mean of observed arrivals (Avg=2). For demand forecasting, I'll use the mean of all 5 available samples, and since the regime is stable, N=5 is appropriate. The OR backend will target a base stock covering (L+1) periods, and given the profit-to-holding ratio is 1:1, it will target a 50% service level (q=0.5), which is appropriate for a product where storage costs equal margins.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status shows 0 inventory on-hand and an extreme under-supply situation with substantial lost sales. Previous demand samples range from 149 to 224, with an average of approximately 186 units. The promised lead time is 2, but observed arrivals show high variability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period. Currently, 696 units are in transit (orders from P2, P5, and P6). P2's order is now technically 'overdue' if L=2, as it was placed in Period 2 and haven't seen a 'conclude' message for it in Period 4, 5, or 6. However, given the lead time volatility, it's likely still in transit. With Profit and Holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5. I am setting L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed fluctuations. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=6 to capture the full observed demand history which suggests a stable mean around 180-190 despite recent stockouts suppressing 'sold' counts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility detected: Observed L=3 (P1) and L=1 (P3) against promised L=2. Demand is stable around 180-190 units (P1-P6 avg=186).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: On-hand inventory is 0 after multiple periods of stockouts (P6-P7). Historical demand (P1-P7) shows a mean of approximately 182 units. Total in-transit inventory is 744, comprised of orders from P2 (224), P5 (235), P6 (237), and P7 (48). Based on 'Period 4 conclude', lead times varied significantly (L=3 for P1, L=1 for P3). The orders from P2 (ordered 6 periods ago) and P5 (ordered 3 periods ago) are significantly delayed, suggesting possible lost shipments or extreme lead-time volatility. Since profit = $1 and holding cost = $1, the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the base stock should target the median demand. To recover from the current stockout while accounting for the uncertainty of the 744 in-transit units (which the OR backend will subtract from the base stock), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the worst-case observed lead time and using a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the slight downward trend in recent periods (avg ~166 over P3-P7).

Carry-over insight: In-transit reconciliation needed: Orders from P2 (224 units) and P5 (235 units) are significantly past-due as of P8, suggesting potential lost shipments or lead-time instability.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9, the on-hand inventory is 115. We have 461 units in transit, consisting of orders from P2 (224 units) and P6 (237 units). History check: P1 and P5 arrived with L=3; P3 and P7 arrived with L=1. This suggests an alternating or volatile lead time (promised L=2). The order from P2 is now 7 periods old and significantly past the observed max lead time of 3; it is highly likely lost. The order from P6 (ordered P6, currently start of P9) is at L=3 and should arrive during this period's arrival phase. Demand is relatively stable (8-period avg: 180 units; recent 3-period avg: 158 units). I will use L=2 (promised) as the calculation basis but set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the slight downward trend in demand (averaging ~163). Sigma_hat is set to the recent 5-period standard deviation to account for current volatility.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (224 units) confirmed likely lost (7 periods elapsed, max observed L=3). Supply chain exhibiting high variability in lead times (alternating between 1 and 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time is extremely volatile, alternating between L=1 and L=3. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations are 3 (P1, P5), 1 (P3, P7), and one lost shipment (P2 - 224 units). Currently, in-transit includes orders from P6 (237 units) and P9 (no new order placed in P9, so only P6 is in pipeline). Wait, looking at in-transit: it is 461 units. This implies P6 (237) and P2 (224) are both still counted as in-transit by the system, even though P2 is likely lost. Demand is relatively stable: the mean of the last 9 periods is approximately 180 (Total demand 1622 / 9 = 180.2). To protect against the 'lost' inventory and the L=3 scenario, I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer lead time. mu_hat will use the recent stable demand (last 6 periods average ~166, but \uc804\uccb4 average is ~180). Given recent demand is around 170-180, I'll use recent_N=6 to capture the current stable regime.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory reconciliation: Item P2 (224 units) remains in the system's pipeline inventory count but is 8 periods old, effectively lost. This creates an inventory deficit that the OR controller must overcome by targeting a higher base stock.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11, the system is in a stockout (on-hand: 0). The 'in-transit' count of 646 units is misleading because it includes two likely lost shipments: P2 (224 units, 9 periods old) and P6 (237 units, 5 periods old). The maximum observed lead time is 3 periods (P1 and P5). Since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy that subtracts pipeline inventory from the target, the presence of these 'ghost' units prevents necessary ordering. Based on the 10-period history, demand is stable with a mean of 178.6. To compensate for the lost 461 units (224+237) and ensure the solver places an order to cover the current stockout and future demand (L+1 = 3 periods), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the target base stock. Target Base Stock = (Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units = (179 * 3) + 461 = 998. This forces the solver to recognize the gap and order despite the phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: P2 (224 units) and P6 (237 units) are confirmed lost shipments (9 and 5 periods elapsed respectively, max observed L=3). These 461 units must be compensated for in the mu_hat parameter to overcome the OR backend's pipeline subtraction.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 931 units in-transit. However, historical analysis proves that orders from P2 (224 units) and P6 (237 units) are lost shipments (8+ periods elapsed compared to maximum observed L=3). Additionally, P10 (185 units) and P11 (285) are still in-transit but have not arrived yet. Actual on-hand inventory is 0. The OR backend calculates order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory. Since 'pipeline_inventory' includes the 461 lost units (P2, P6), the OR engine will under-order unless we artificially inflate the demand target. Demand remains relatively stable, averaging ~176 units over 11 periods. I will set L=recent_N (N=5) to capture the 1-3 period lead time variability. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat: Calculation = (1+L) * Mean + Lost_Units. With average L ~ 2, (1+2)*176 + 461 = 528 + 461 = 989. This ensures the base stock is high enough that even after the backend subtracts the 'phantom' pipeline inventory, we still place a substantial order to resolve the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability is confirmed to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline inventory: 461 (P2: 224, P6: 237). Parameter compensation is required until these units are naturally aged out or the deficit is filled.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the primary challenge is overcoming a significant inventory deficit caused by lost shipments. History confirms that orders from P2 (224 units) and P6 (237 units) are lost (11 and 7 periods elapsed respectively, well beyond the observed max L=3), yet they remain in the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation. This results in 461 phantom units that prevent the backend from ordering enough stock. To compensate, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter. Current demand is stable at an average of 184 units (3-period avg: 147; 6-period avg: 160; 12-period avg: 175). Using a target demand of 180 units per period and adding the 461-unit deficit over the (L+1) horizon of 3 periods, the required mu_hat is (180 * 3) + 461 = 1001. I will set L=explicit to 2 (promised) to stabilize the base stock formula, as recent arrivals show L=2 (P10) and lead time variability (1-3) averages close to 2.

Carry-over insight: P2 (224) and P6 (237) total 461 units confirmed lost. Managed via explicit mu_hat inflation of ~150 units per period over the 3-period horizon (L+1) until these units age out of the pipeline or are offset by current arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, On-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 960 units in-transit, but this includes P2 (224) and P6 (237), which are confirmed lost (461 units total). The remaining valid pipeline consists of P11 (285), P12 (58), and P13 (156) total 499 units. Since the OR backend calculates 'base_stock - pipeline', it will incorrectly count those 461 lost units as incoming stock. To compensate, I must inflate 'mu_hat'. Demand has trended lower recently (avg ~140-150 last 4 periods). Based on L=2 (promised), the horizon is L+1=3 periods. Baseline demand for 3 periods (~450 units) + the 461 lost units = 911 units. I will set mu_hat to 911 via 'explicit' to force an order that bridges the actual inventory gap. I'll take a recent 5-period window for sigma to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion persists: 461 units (P2, P6) are lost but still in pipeline count. Explicit mu_hat inflation of ~461 units is required to neutralize this until these orders age out or are manually offset.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-17.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we face a significant inventory distortion. The OR backend calculates orders using the formula: base_stock - pipeline_inventory. Currently, 'In-transit' is 675 units. This includes 224 units (Period 2) and 237 units (Period 6) that are clearly lost (13 and 9 periods elapsed, respectively, whereas max lead time is 3). These 461 ghost units reduce current orders unit-for-unit. To normalize, I continue to use 'explicit' mu_hat inflation. The underlying demand mean (Period 7-14) is approximately 144 units. For the (L+1) horizon where L=2, the base mu_hat would be 432 (144 * 3). Adding the 461 lost units to this target results in an explicit mu_hat of 893. This forces the back-end to place an order despite the phantom pipeline. Lead time is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the high variance observed (ranging from 1 to 3). Sigma_hat uses the last 10 periods to capture recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion confirmed: 461 units (P2: 224, P6: 237) are lost but remain in 'In-transit' count. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~144 units over the last 8 periods compared to the early game (~186).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face a substantial inventory distortion. The 'In-transit' count of 684 units includes 461 units (P2: 224, P6: 237) that are more than 10 periods old and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire in-transit pipeline (684) from the base stock to decide the order, it 'sees' plenty of stock and will order nothing, despite 461 units never arriving. To fix this, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock target by approximately 461 units. Demand has shifted from a mean of ~186 (P1-P6) to ~144 (P8-P15). Using a target mean of 144 units over L+1 (3) periods gives 432 units. Adding the 461 units lost results in a mu_hat of 893. I am setting L to 2 (promised) as the actual lead times alternate between 1 and 3, averaging 2. Sigma_hat is set to 30 based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime transition: mean has dropped from ~186 (P1-P6) to ~144 (P8-P15). Total lost inventory currently trapped in pipeline count: 461 units (P2, P6).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 687 units. However, this count is significantly distorted by legacy orders (P2: 224, P6: 237) totaling 461 units that are long overdue (15 and 11 periods respectively) and confirmed lost. The actual viable pipeline consists of orders from P15 (67 units) and P16 (159 units), totaling 226 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this ghost inventory (base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate mu_hat. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime: P8-P16 average is 148 units (compared to early-game 186). The target base stock for L=2 (horizon of 3 periods) should be ~148 * 3 = 444 units. However, because the backend subtracts 687 (pipeline) and 90 (on-hand), I must explicitly set mu_hat high enough to trigger the capped order logic or offset the 461 lost units. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat set to the recent demand mean (~148) * (L+1) plus the 461 lost units (totaling 905) to neutralize the pipeline error. Sigma is kept at historical levels to maintain a buffer.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory remains distorted by 461 lost units (P2, P6). Demand regime is stable at ~148 units/period (P8-P16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 148 units/period (avg P8-P17) compared to the early-game average of 186. The lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, so I will continue using L=3 to ensure safety during longer cycles. A critical issue remains: 461 units (from orders in P2 and P6) are lost but still count towards the OR backend's pipeline inventory. Because the backend subtracts pipeline inventory (In-transit: 656) from the calculated base stock to determine the order quantity, these 461 'ghost' units will cause it to under-order. To neutralize this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory = (L+1) * Demand_Mean = (3+1) * 148 = 592 units. To prevent the backend from subtracting the 461 lost units from this target, I must inflate mu_hat by approximately 461 units. Total mu_hat \u2248 592 + 461 = 1053 units. This allows the backend to place an order that covers real demand despite the distorted pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: No new significant pattern detected; continuing to manage the 461-unit pipeline distortion (P2, P6 lost) and stable lower-demand regime (~148 units).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 935 units, which includes 461 units from orders P2 (224) and P6 (237) that are confirmed lost (17 and 13 periods elapsed, respectively). To compensate for this 461-unit ghost inventory being subtracted by the OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate mu_hat. The current demand regime has stabilized at a lower level; the average demand from P11 to P18 is approximately 140 units. With an expected lead time L=2 (promised), the horizon is (L+1)=3 periods. BASE mu_hat calculation: (1+L) * 140 = 420. COMPENSATION: We need to add back the 461 lost units to neutralize the backend's subtraction. TOTAL mu_hat = 420 + 461 = 881. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1 to 3 periods). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the volatility of the lower-demand regime.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has trended downward, averaging ~113 units over the last 4 periods (P16-P19). The system's 'In-transit' count of 935 units is heavily distorted by 461 lost units (P2: 224, P6: 237). Furthermore, the orders from P17 (128 units) and P18 (279 units) have not arrived; with a maximum observed lead time of 3, the P17 order is now reaching its expected arrival limit (P20 arrival resolve). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 461-unit 'ghost' pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock that covers 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~115 * 3 = 345) plus the 461 lost units to neutralize the pipeline subtraction, totaling 806 units. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the high variability (1 to 3 periods), and sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion remains 461 units (P2, P6). Demand regime has shifted lower again, averaging ~113 units (P16-P19) vs previous ~148.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' count of 935 units. However, this count includes 461 units from lost shipments (P2: 224, P6: 237) and likely the P15 order (67 units) which is now 6 periods old. Subtracting these 528 lost/critically delayed units leaves a functional pipeline of 407 units (P17: 128, P18: 279). Current demand has entered a lower regime, averaging ~113 units over P16-P20. The OR backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. If pipeline_inventory is inflated by 528 lost units, it under-orders. To fix this, I must set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the 528-unit deficit. Using L=2, (L+1)=3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~339 (3 * 113). Total mu_hat needed = 339 + 528 = 867. This forces the OR backend to acknowledge the missing stock. I'll use explicit L=2 to match promised lead time, as actual lead times alternate between 1 and 3.

Carry-over insight: P2, P6, and now P15 (67 units) shipments are confirmed lost/undeliverable (total 528 units). Demand regime remains low, averaging ~113 units/period since P16.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 935 units 'In-transit', but a significant portion of this represents lost shipments. Specifically, P2 (224), P6 (237), and P15 (67) are confirmed lost (totaling 528 units), as they are well beyond the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. Additionally, the orders from P17 (128) and P18 (279) have not arrived despite being at P22 (lag of 5 and 4 periods respectively); given the lead time volatility, these are also increasingly likely to be lost or severely delayed. This creates a massive artificial inflation of pipeline inventory that prevents the OR engine from ordering. The current demand regime (P16-P21) averages ~121 units/period. To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat high enough to cover the (L+1) demand window AND neutralize the 528 units of confirmed lost inventory (P2+P6+P15). Since On-hand is 0, the engine calculates: order = min(base_stock - In_transit, cap). To offset ~528 'phantom' units, mu_hat must be increased by that amount. Base demand (121 * 3) = 363. Target mu_hat = 363 + 528 = 891. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher uncertainty/volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory (undeliverable) is 528 units (P2: 224, P6: 237, P15: 67). P17 (128 units) and P18 (279 units) are now 5 and 4 periods old respectively, exceeding the max historical lead time of 3, suggesting they are also likely lost.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing extreme reliability issues. Promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, and a significant portion of orders is now categorized as 'lost'. As of Period 23, the 'In-transit' quantity is 935 units, but a large portion of this is phantom inventory that will never arrive. Specifically, shipments from P2 (224), P6 (237), P15 (67), P17 (128), and P18 (279) are all beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods (they are 21, 17, 8, 6, and 5 periods old, respectively). Total lost inventory is 935 units. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' value from the target base stock, the system will effectively order 0 unless I compensate. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 117 units (last 7 periods). To ensure an order is actually placed to meet upcoming demand, I must use 'explicit' methods. I set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat to 1286, which represents (1+L) * mean_demand (3 * 117 = 351) PLUS the 935 lost units to neutralize the pipeline subtraction. This forces the system to target 351 real units on hand + pipeline.

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion has reached 935 units: P2(224), P6(237), P15(67), P17(128), and P18(279) are all confirmed/highly likely lost. Demand regime for P16-P22 avg is ~117. mu_hat must be inflated by the sum of lost units to trigger new orders.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently plagued by extreme supply instability and an accumulation of 'zombie' units in the pipeline inventory. Specifically, orders from P2 (224), P6 (237), P15 (67), P17 (128), and P18 (279) are far beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods and are definitively lost. These total 935 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (1286 units) from the base stock target, it mistakenly believes the warehouse is over-supplied and will not place new orders despite zero on-hand inventory. To force an order, I must set mu_hat (target inventory) to 'explicit' and include the sum of both the actual required stock (Lead period + current period demand) and the phantom units. Recent demand (P19-P23) has softened to ~109 units/period. For a lead time L=2, the required real base stock is approximately (2+1)*115 = 345 units. Adding the 935 'lost' units to this required level yields a mu_hat target of 1280. I set L to 2 (promised) to maintain standard calculations for CAP, although actual lead times oscillate between 1 and 3.

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion has increased to 935 units: P2(224), P6(237), P15(67), P17(128), and P18(279) are lost. These units must be added to mu_hat indefinitely or until they are purged from the system inventory count. Demand regime (P19-P23) has further declined to ~109 units/period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing extreme pipeline distortion. Current 'In-transit' is 1286 units, but analysis of history confirms a significant portion is lost: P2(224), P6(237), P15(67), P17(128), and P18(279) are all beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods, totaling 935 lost units. These remain in the OR backend's pipeline count, preventing new orders. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to cover the (L+1) period demand plus the 935 lost units. Recent demand (P19-P24) has shifted lower, averaging approximately 107 units/period. Therefore, target base stock = (3 periods \xd7 107 units) + 935 lost units = 321 + 935 = 1256. With In-transit at 1286 and On-hand at 0, the current pipeline almost equals this target. However, since the last order was P23 (351 units) and it hasn't arrived yet (within its 3-period window), I will set mu_hat to 1350 to ensure the system places an order if the P23 shipment also fails or to rebuild a safety buffer given the high delivery failure rate.

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion at P25 is 935 units (Confirmed Lost: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Demand regime has settled to ~107 units/period (P19-P24).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has an 'In-transit' count of 999 units. However, based on the historical pattern and lead times (max L=3), several orders are confirmed lost: P2(224), P6(237), P15(67), P17(128), and P18(279). These total 935 'phantom' units that the OR backend subtracts from the inventory target, preventing necessary orders. Demand has recently stabilized at a lower regime; the mean for the last 7 periods (P19-P25) is approximately 104 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order and maintains stock despite the 935-unit pipeline distortion, I must set mu_hat (the (L+1) horizon demand) to include the expected demand PLUS the lost units. Expected demand over L+1 (3 periods) is ~312 units. Adding the 935 lost units brings the required target to ~1247. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 1247 and sigma_hat at 50 to maintain a high enough base stock to overcome the pipeline error. L is set to 'calculate' as the backend's lead-time calculation remains representative of available successful shipments.

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion at P26 remains 935 units (Confirmed Lost: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Current demand regime (P19-P25) average is ~104 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-80.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we are managing a severe pipeline inventory distortion. The system shows 999 units 'In-transit', but a significant portion of this represents lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (224), P6 (237), P15 (67), P17 (128), and P18 (279) have not arrived despite significantly exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. Total confirmed lost units = 935. The OR engine subtracts this full 'In-transit' figure from the target base stock, preventing new orders unless we inflate mu_hat to compensate. The current demand regime (P19-P26) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 103 units per period (Avg: 97, 128, 141, 101, 79, 97, 87, 92 = 103). Using L=2 (promised), the base demand for mu_hat (1+L) should be ~309. To neutralize the 935 units of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, the explicit mu_hat is set to 309 + 935 = 1244. This ensures the backend produces an order to meet real demand while accounting for the lost units that will never arrive. Sigma_hat is calculated based on recent volatility to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion at P27 remains 935 units (Confirmed Lost: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Demand regime (P19-P26) average is ~103 units/period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level, averaging approximately 101 units per period over the last 9 periods (P19-P27). However, the system's pipeline inventory remains heavily distorted by a total of 935 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2: 224, P6: 237, P15: 67, P17: 128, P18: 279). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire 'In-transit' quantity from the target base stock, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that incorporates both the true demand forecast and a compensation factor for the 'ghost' inventory. For Period 28, the target base stock calculation for a lead time of 2 is (L+1)*Demand = 3 * 101 = 303 units. To counteract the 935 'In-transit' units that the backend will subtract, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 935' results in a positive order if the on-hand (71) is low. Specifically, to reach a target inventory of roughly 300, I set mu_hat to 300 (demand) + 935 (offset) = 1235. This ensures the backend doesn't perceive a huge surplus due to lost orders. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility to ensure a narrow safety stock given the stable but lower demand.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant inventory discrepancy due to lost shipments. The 'In-transit' count is 1164 units, but historically confirmed or highly likely lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18) account for 935 of these units. Additionally, the order from P23 (351 units) arrived at P25, but the order from P25 (64 units) is now at its promised lead time (L=2) and has not arrived yet. The demand regime has transitioned significantly: the average demand from P19-P28 is approximately 98.4 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the inflated pipeline, I must set mu_hat to cover the expected demand plus the lost units (935 + (3 * 98.4) = 1230). I will use explicit mu_hat of 1230. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the high variability (1 to 3 periods), and sigma_hat remains default to handle the standard deviation across the full sample set.

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion at P29 is 935 units (Confirmed Lost: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Current demand regime (P19-P28) average has fallen further to ~98 units/period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has settled at a lower mean, averaging approximately 98 units per period over the last 10 periods (P20-P29). The system's 'In-transit' count is currently 1147 units, but 935 of these are confirmed or highly likely lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18), as they are significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this phantom pipeline inventory, I must inflate mu_hat. The backend calculates base_stock as (1+L)*demand; with L=2, it looks at 3 periods of demand. The 935 lost units represent the deficit I need to overcome. Therefore, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (Expected Demand * (1+L)) + Lost Units = (98 * 3) + 935 = 294 + 935 = 1229. This targets a base stock that accounts for both the recurring demand and the structural deficit in the system's inventory tracking, while sigma_hat is kept at a default level for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion reaches 935 units at Period 30: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18 are lost. Current demand regime (P20-P29) average is ~98 units/period.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at a significantly lower level, with an average of approximately 98 units per period over the last 10 periods (P20-P29). The system's 'In-transit' inventory remains heavily distorted by several confirmed lost shipments: P2 (224), P6 (237), P15 (67), P17 (128), and P18 (279), totaling 935 units. These units are still counted towards the pipeline inventory in the OR backend but will never arrive. To ensure the backend places orders to meet actual demand, I must adjust mu_hat to offset this 935-unit deficit. The target base stock for a (L+1)=3 period horizon should be roughly 3 * 98 = 294 units. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline)', and pipeline includes 935 phantom units, I set mu_hat explicitly to (Target Base Stock + Phantom Units) = 294 + 935 = 1229 units. L is set to calculate (historical average) to reflect lead time variability, and sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=10 to reflect the current lower volatility. This approach forces the backend to ignore the dead inventory and order according to the current demand trend.

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion at P31 remains 935 units (Lost: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Current demand regime (P21-P30) average is ~93 units/period.

The pipeline inventory remains severely distorted by 935 units of historical lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18) that still count against the base stock. I will use a 'recent_N' of 3 to capture the most recent downward trend in demand, but I must also inflate 'mu_hat' explicitly to neutralize the 935 'phantom' units in the pipeline. Without this inflation, the OR backend (base_stock - pipeline) would result in zero orders until the pipeline clears. By setting mu_hat = (actual_forecast * (1+L)) + 935, I ensure the OR backend generates orders that match current actual demand needs. Actual lead time is stable at 2 periods recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline confirmed: 10-period avg is ~93, but last 2 periods dropped to ~40 units. Pipeline distortion remains 935 units (Lost: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is in a significant decline, with the last two periods averaging ~54 units (P31:34, P32:73), and a broader 10-period average of ~77 units (P23-P32). The pipeline inventory is heavily distorted by 935 units confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 1128), but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast_Demand + Lost_Inventory. Using L=2 (promised), the calculation is (1+2)*77 + 935 = 231 + 935 = 1166. This explicit setting bypasses the pipeline subtraction since base_stock = mu_hat + safety_stock; by setting mu_hat high enough to cover the 'ghost' units, we force the backend to place an order that covers real expected demand. Lead time is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the high variability (1-3 periods) observed in concluded shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline confirmed: 10-period avg ~77 units (P23-P32). Pipeline distortion remains 935 units (Lost: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level, with recent periods (P23-P33) showing a mean demand of approximately 77 units per period. However, the system's 'In-transit' count is heavily distorted by 935 units from confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). These units have not arrived despite the passage of 15+ periods, far exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity from the calculated base stock, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to neutralize this 935-unit phantom inventory. I calculate the target base stock based on the current demand (~77 units) and L=2: Base Stock = (L+1) * 77 = 231. To ensure the backend places an order, mu_hat must be set to (Target Base Stock + In-transit Distortion) = 231 + 935 = 1166. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average of successful deliveries (approx 2.2 periods) and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is significantly lower than in the early game, with the last 5 periods (P30-P34) averaging 57 units/period. The pipeline inventory is currently 1166 units, but it is heavily distorted by lost shipments. Specifically, P2(224), P6(237), P15(67), P17(128), and P18(279) are confirmed lost, totaling 935 units. These 'ghost' units stay in the backend's 'In-transit' count, preventing it from ordering enough to meet actual demand. Period 33 (38 units) and Period 29 (56 units) orders are still pending and within reasonable lead time (1-3 periods). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 935 lost units in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (1+L) * Forecast + Lost Units. Assuming L=2 (promised), Forecast=60, and Lost=935, the target base stock is (3 * 60) + 935 = 1115. However, since In-transit (1166) > 1115, the OR backend would place an order of 0 because (Target - In-transit) is negative. I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed the current pipeline and on-hand inventory to trigger a replenishment order of roughly 120-150 units to cover for the stockout. Setting mu_hat to 1350 will target approximately 1350 - 1166 = 184 units.

Carry-over insight: P34: In-transit distortion remains 935 units (Lost: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Current demand regime (P30-P34) average is 57 units/period, down from ~93.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant inventory distortion. The 'In-transit' count of 1350 units is largely composed of confirmed or highly likely lost shipments: P2(224), P6(237), P15(67), P17(128), and P18(279), totaling 935 phantom units. These units will never arrive but the OR backend subtracts them from its ordering logic. To counter this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. The current demand regime (P31-P35) has stabilized at a lower average of approx 56 units per period. For Period 36, I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period horizon (L+1=3) as 3 * 56 = 168 units. To force the backend to place an order despite the 935 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat such that (mu_hat - 935) \u2248 168. Thus, mu_hat = 1103. This ensures the OR engine sees a net requirements level that triggers a fresh replenishment. L is set to 'calculate' to use the observed lead time average (approx 2), and sigma_hat is set via 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current volatility of the lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: P36: Continued management of 935-unit pipeline distortion (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18 lost). Demand regime since P31 is lower, averaging ~56 units/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower state, averaging ~54 units/period over the last 6 periods (P31-P36). The primary operational challenge remains a massive 'In-transit' inventory distortion of 935 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18), which the OR backend incorrectly views as usable pipeline inventory. To trigger new orders and prevent stockouts, mu_hat must be set to neutralize this ghost inventory. Total pipeline count is 1350; the actual valid pipeline is 415 units (P23, P25, P27-P31, P33, P35). Since the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from base stock, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*demand + lost_units. With L=2 and demand=54, mu_hat = (3 * 54) + 935 = 1097. This ensures the backend targets a base stock that covers real demand while ignoring the 935 lost units.

Carry-over insight: P37: Continued management of 935-unit pipeline distortion (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18 lost). Demand regime is stable at ~54 units/period since P31.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant pipeline distortion of 935 units due to confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (1166 units total), preventing the OR backend from placing new orders because the perceived pipeline inventory (1166 + 139 on-hand) far exceeds the base stock for the current demand regime. The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level, averaging approximately 54 units per period since Period 31 (P31-P37: 34, 73, 75, 58, 68, 32, 45). To ensure the OR engine triggers necessary replenishment while accounting for the phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock as ((L+1) * mean_demand) + pipeline_distortion. With L=2 and mean_demand=54, the required base stock is (3 * 54) + 935 = 1097. I set mu_hat to 1097 to force the engine to maintain this level. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to reflect the moderate volatility in recent demand samples.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant inventory distortion due to 935 units classified as 'In-transit' that are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). These units are being subtracted from the inventory target by the OR backend, creating an artificial deficit. Since Period 31, demand has shifted to a lower regime, averaging 48.7 units per period (P31-P38). To maintain adequate stock despite the 935-unit pipeline ghost, I must set mu_hat to cover both the real projected demand for the (L+1) horizon and the lost units. With an estimated L=2, the horizon is 3 periods. Real demand forecast: 3 * 50 = 150 units. Total mu_hat = 150 (demand) + 935 (offset) = 1085. I use sigma_hat 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the volatility of the current low-demand regime. Lead time 'calculate' is used as recent arrivals (P35) arrived on time (L=2).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has a significant 'In-transit' distortion of 935 units consisting of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). These units remain in the pipeline count, preventing the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the system is over-provisioned. To counter this, I must set mu_hat to a value that covers (1+L) periods of actual demand PLUS the total lost inventory count. Current demand has stabilized in a lower regime; the average demand from Period 31 to 39 is approximately 53 units/period. With a promised lead time of 2 (setting L=2), the look-ahead window is (L+1) = 3 periods. Total expected demand across this window is ~159 units. Adding the 935 units of lost inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of 1094. Setting sigma_hat explicitly to 50 provides a buffer for demand volatility in this lower regime. This setup ensures that (base_stock - pipeline) > 0, triggering the necessary replenishment to maintain service levels despite the phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean since Period 31, with the last 10 periods (P31-P40) averaging 56.6 units. I will use recent_N=10 to capture this trend. The 'In-transit' count of 1166 units is heavily distorted by 935 units from confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18) and a missing P33 order (38 units), totaling 973 'phantom' units. The OR backend subtracts this 1166 from the base stock. To compensate and ensure any order is placed, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + Lost units. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = 3 * 56.6 + 973 \u2248 1143. This high mu_hat value targets a base stock that offsets the pipeline distortion, allowing the system to maintain service despite the inventory accounting error.

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion confirmed at 973 units: P2(224), P6(237), P15(67), P17(128), P18(279), and P33(38) are lost/undeliverable. Current demand regime (P31-P40) average is 56.6 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant inventory distortion. There are 973 units (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 33) currently counted as 'In-transit' but are confirmed or highly likely lost. This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR backend's base-stock logic from placing new orders because it subtracts the pipeline from the target. To counteract this, mu_hat must be inflated. The current demand regime (P31-P41) averages 56.1 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2 (L+1=3), the base demand expectation is ~168 units. Adding the 973 lost units to this requirement gives an explicit mu_hat of 1141. On-hand inventory is 0. Sigma_hat is set using the last 11 periods (P31-P41) to capture the lower volatility of the current regime. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual historical lead time variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion confirmed at 973 units as of P42: Lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P33 remain in the pipeline count. Demand regime remains stable at ~56 units/period (P31-P41).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant in-transit inventory distortion. A total of 973 units are confirmed/highly likely lost but remain in the pipeline count (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and now P33 which is 9 periods old). With On-hand inventory at 0 and In-transit at 1166, the 'effective' pipeline is only 193 units (1166 - 973). The OR backend's logic [order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory] will result in zero orders unless mu_hat is inflated to offset these ghost units. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the average demand from Period 31 to 42 (the last 12 periods) is approximately 53.5 units. To trigger a replenishment that covers the next (L+1) = 3 periods of demand while neutralizing the 973-unit pipeline penalty, mu_hat is set to (3 * 53.5) + 973 \u2248 1133.5. We use sigma_hat 'recent_N' with N=12 to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion confirmed at 973 units: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and now P33 (38 units) are lost/undeliverable. Current demand regime (P31-P42) average is 53.5 units/period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant disruption. The 'In-transit' count is currently 1166 units, which is highly inflated due to lost shipments. Based on historical data, confirmed lost orders include P2(224), P6(237), P15(67), P17(128), P18(279), and P33(38), totaling 973 units that are visible to the OR engine but will never arrive. To maintain service levels and trigger replenishment, I must inflate mu_hat to offset this phantom inventory. Additionally, demand has stepped down again; the average demand from Period 31 to 43 is approximately 53.3 units. The target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3) should be approximately 3 periods of demand plus the lost unit offset. Calculation: (3 * 53.3) + 973 = 1132.9. I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to set a value that accounts for this required buffer, effectively neutralizing the 973 phantom units and ensuring enough on-hand inventory for the actual demand regime.

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion at P43 remains 973 units (Lost: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P33). Demand regime for P31-P43 is stable at ~53 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the system faces a massive pipeline distortion of 973 units from confirmed/likely lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P33). These units are counted in 'In-transit' (1166 total) but will never arrive, causing a persistent hidden inventory deficit. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the average demand from P31-P44 is approximately 53.6 units/period. The current in-transit inventory (1166) significantly exceeds any reasonable target base stock, preventing the OR backend from ordering. To force a reorder and break the stockout, I must explicitly set mu_hat high enough to neutralize the 973 lost units plus cover expected demand over the (L+1) horizon. With L=2, the horizon is 3 periods. Target = (Lost Units) + (Avg Demand * 3) = 973 + (53.6 * 3) = 1133.8. Rounding up to 1150 provides a small safety buffer for recent demand volatility (e.g., P44 demand was 67). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed lead-time variability (history shows L ranges from 1 to 3). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=14, matching the current demand regime) to capture the volatility of this lower-demand period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is at Period 46 of 50. Inventory status: On-hand is 0, while In-transit is 1166 units. Based on historical outcomes, 973 units in the pipeline are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P33) because they are far beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. This leaves a functional pipeline of 193 units (1166 - 973), with the last order placed in Period 35 having already arrived in Period 37. No orders were placed from Period 36 to 45. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the average demand from P31 to P45 is approximately 51.5 units/period. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (1166) from the base stock. To trigger an order that covers the next three periods (L+1) of demand (~52 units * 3 = 156 units) while neutralizing the 973 lost units being subtracted, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1129 (156 + 973). This ensures the inventory deficit caused by lost shipments is bridged before the game ends.

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion confirmed at 973 units as of P46: Lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P33 effectively remain in the pipeline count. Sustained low-demand regime since P31 is verified at ~52 units/period.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a massive pipeline inventory distortion: 973 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P33) are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count. Current on-hand inventory is 0. To trigger new orders, the base stock (mu_hat) must exceed this phantom pipeline. Since Period 31, demand has stabilized in a lower regime, averaging 52.3 units/period (P31-P46). Given L=2, the required 'true' base stock is (L+1) * 52.3 \u2248 157 units. To overcome the 973-unit distortion and achieve this target, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1130 (973 + 157). I maintain L at the default (2) and set sigma_hat to 40 (approx 20 per period) to provide a safety buffer for the current higher demand volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs if multiple orders unexpectedly arrive.

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion at P47 remains 973 units (Lost: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P33). Demand regime is stable at ~52 units/period since P31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter Period 48 of 50, on-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports an In-transit pipeline of 1166 units. However, based on the historical pattern and 'conclude' messages, 973 of these units are confirmed lost/undeliverable (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P33). This leaves a functional pipeline of only 193 units (from recent orders not yet concluded). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 31, averaging approximately 52 units per period (P31-P47 mean = 51.5). With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), any orders placed now (L=2) would arrive in Period 50. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the risk of generating excess ending inventory in the final period, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly account for the lost units trapped in the pipeline (973) plus a safety forecast for the remaining horizon. Base Stock (BS) = Pipeline + Order. To force an order that covers remaining demand (~52 * 3 = 156) despite the phantom pipeline of 973, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1130 (973 + 156 + safety margin). I choose an explicit value of 1150 for mu_hat to trigger a sufficient terminal order while keeping L at the promised 2.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is significantly distorted by a pipeline of 973 units that are confirmed lost or undeliverable but remain in the 'In-transit' count (P2: 224, P6: 237, P15: 67, P17: 128, P18: 279, P33: 38). These units effectively block the OR backend from placing new orders because it subtracts this phantom inventory from the base stock. Meanwhile, on-hand inventory has been zero since Period 41, resulting in lost sales. Since L=2, a base stock needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). I will use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target inventory levels. The current demand regime (P40-P48) averages ~51 units/period. To trigger an order despite the 973 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to (Target Base Stock + Phantom Units). I target a base stock of 250 units (roughly 5 periods of demand to recover from the stockout) plus the 973 phantom units, totaling 1223 units. This will force the backend to place an order of approximately 57 units (1223 - 1166).

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion at P49 is 973 units (Confirmed Lost: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P33). Current demand regime (last 10 periods) average is ~48 units/period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. The primary challenge is a massive 'In-transit' inventory distortion of 973 units caused by confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P33). These units remain in the backend's pipeline count, preventing the base-stock logic from ordering despite zero on-hand inventory. The current demand regime (P40-P49) is stable at a lower mean of approximately 48 units/period. Period 49 shows an order of 57 units was placed. To trigger necessary replenishment for the upcoming periods and effectively bypass the 973-unit phantom inventory, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that covers the expected demand over (L+1) periods PLUS the volume of the lost shipments. Assuming L=2, the horizon is 3 periods. Target base stock = (3 * 48) + 973 = 1117 units. Considering the high variability and the need to restore service level, I will set 'mu_hat' to 1117 units using the 'explicit' method. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual performance which fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods. 'sigma_hat' is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent demand volatility accurately.
