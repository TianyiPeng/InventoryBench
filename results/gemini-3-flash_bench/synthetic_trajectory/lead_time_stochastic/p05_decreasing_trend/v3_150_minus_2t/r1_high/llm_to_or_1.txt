Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' and the initial on-hand inventory is 0. Data for the first 5 periods indicates a mean demand of approximately 136.4 units (samples: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161). The promised lead time is 2 periods. To ensure we cover demand during the current period and the procurement lead time (total L+1 = 3 periods), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'explicit' method based on the available historical samples. Calculating mean = 136.4 and standard deviation \u2248 17.5. Therefore, mu_hat = (1+2) * 136.4 = 409.2, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+2) * 17.5 \u2248 30.3. This approach proactively sets a base stock level to satisfy demand while accounting for the lead time delay.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The data shows a starting on-hand inventory of 0 units in Period 1 and a demand of 149 units. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, the order of 166 units placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and will be visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales for Period 1. The in-transit inventory is 166 units. Given we only have 5 periods of demand samples (130, 147, 128, 116, 161) with a mean of 136.4, the Period 1 demand of 149 is within a reasonable range of the historical samples. Since we are at the very beginning of the simulation (Period 2), I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR engine to establish a baseline using all available historical data (which currently represents our best forecast) until more period-specific observations are concluded to detect any shifts in lead time or demand patterns.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (166 units) and P2 (166 units) are currently in-transit (Total: 332). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive during Period 1+2=3 (Arrival Resolution Phase) and will be visible in the P3 conclude message. Therefore, seeing 0 arrivals in P1 and P2 conclude is expected and does not indicate a delay yet. Current on-hand is 0, and we have missed demand in P1 (149) and P2 (123) because inventory hasn't arrived. I will use the default lead time (L=2). For demand estimation (mu_hat and sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (the total available historical samples provided in the prompt: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161) to capture the average demand of ~136.4 units per period. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~409 units).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. No arrivals have occurred yet, which is consistent with the promised lead time of 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (166 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase, making it visible at the start of Period 4. However, the history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 1, 2, and 3. Wait, looking at the 'Period 3 conclude' message, it shows 'arrived=0'. If the order from P1 (lead time 2) was to arrive, it would arrive during Period 3 and be recorded in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. Since it shows 0, the shipment is either delayed or the lead time is longer than 2. However, I must be careful: an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives in P3 (1+2=3). If it hasn't arrived by the end of P3, it is late. Demand remains stable around a mean of 136 (samples: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161, and the history shows 149, 123, 141). Current on-hand is 0, making arrivals critical. I will stick to 'default' for lead time while noting the potential delay, and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent average (~136).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival history for the first few orders of chips(Regular). The promised lead time is 2 periods. However, Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (actual L=3), and Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (actual L=1). This suggests significant lead time variability. On-hand inventory is currently 137. Total demand over the first 5 periods is: 149, 123, 141, 157, and 161 (mean \u2248 146.2, std \u2248 14.8). To determine OR parameters for Period 6, I calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the average lead time (approx 2) and the available demand history. Since the lead time is volatile, I will use 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to use the average observed lead time (which is currently (3+1)/2 = 2). I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the full history of this stable but somewhat high-variance demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2603.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, the item chips(Regular) has 0 on-hand inventory and 344 units in-transit. Demand has been relatively stable with a mean of ~142 units over 5 periods. A lead time analysis shows variability: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time 3), and Period 3's order also arrived in Period 4 (lead_time 1). The promised lead time is 2. Currently, the order from Period 2 (166 units) is overdue (placed P2, should have arrived P4 or P5 if L=2 or 3). The total in-transit (344) includes P2 (166), P4 (7), and P5 (171). Because P2 is overdue, there is a risk of a lost shipment or significant congestion. I will use 'calculate' for L to average the observed lead times (3 and 1, avg=2). For demand (mu_hat), since it is stable, I'll use all 5 samples (recent_N=5) to capture the current mean (~141.6 * (1+2) = 425). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history: Period 1 order arrived in P4 (lead time 3), Period 3 order arrived in P4 (lead time 1). The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is 2. Orders from Period 2 (166 units), Period 5 (171 units), and Period 6 (163 units) are currently in-transit (total 500 units, though the system reports 507 due to small rounding or remnants). On-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout in P5 and P6. Demand has been relatively stable: P1=149, P2=123, P3=141, P4=157, P5=138, P6=114. The average demand over these 6 periods is approximately 137. Since we are in a stockout situation with significant in-transit inventory, I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical average lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' (all historical samples) as there is no evidence of a sustained regime shift yet, and the sample size is still small (6 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual observations show volatility: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period, and Period 4 arrived in 3 periods. The average observed lead time is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. Period 2's order of 166 units is now 5 periods past its order date (promised L=2) and has not arrived, suggesting it is a lost shipment. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 593, but this includes the likely lost 166 units from Period 2. To account for this, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the higher actual average lead time. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 7 periods (149, 123, 141, 157, 138, 114, 165) averages 141. By using 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend will use all 7 samples to estimate the required base stock levels, while the adjusted L will increase the coverage window to protect against the observed delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile with an observed average of 2.33 periods (vs promised 2). Period 2 order (166 units) is likely a lost shipment as it is 5 periods overdue.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2656.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observed arrivals from Period 5 (L=3) and Period 7 (L=1). The Period 2 order (166 units) is now 6 periods past its placement date and 4 periods past its promised delivery, reinforcing the 'lost shipment' hypothesis. Current on-hand is 118 with 350 in-transit. The in-transit includes orders from P6 (163) and P8 (21), plus the likely lost P2 (166) order. Since the OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory from its base stock calculation, the presence of the 166-unit 'ghost' order (P2) will cause the system to under-order by 166 units. Demand is stable around a mean of 137. Standard lead time is 2, so the target window covers (2+1)=3 periods. To counteract the lost shipment while the backend still counts it in pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly high: Target = average demand (137) * (L+1) + lost units (166) = 137 * 3 + 166 = 577. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile lead time (avg ~2.33). Sigma uses recent history to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (166 units) confirmed lost (7 periods since order, no arrival). This continues to distort pipeline inventory calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2061.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are managing chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 2 periods. Historical data shows significant lead time volatility and a confirmed lost shipment (Period 2 order of 166 units). The observed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, and 1, resulting in an average lead time of 2.0. However, the consistent loss of the P2 shipment (now 8 periods past its order date) artificially inflates the 'In-transit' count (494 units). The OR backend calculates orders as base_stock minus pipeline_inventory; because it thinks those 166 units are coming, it will under-order significantly if not corrected. Since I cannot directly modify 'In-transit', I must use an 'explicit' L to increase the base stock and 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure sufficient coverage. Mean demand over the last 9 periods is 138 units. With a perceived lead time of 2, the coverage should be (1+2)=3 periods. To offset the 166-unit phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to 138 * 3 + 166 \u2248 580. I will maintain L = 2 for standard calculations. Sigma_hat is set to the standard deviation of historical demand (approximately 18) scaled by sqrt(1+L), which is 18 * 1.73 \u2248 31.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable across the 10 periods observed, with a mean of ~137.6 and standard deviation of ~17.8. Currently, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and 602 units in-transit. However, 166 units from Period 2 are definitively lost (9 periods ago, promised lead time 2). The OR backend includes these 166 phantom units in 'pipeline_inventory', which causes it to under-order. To compensate, I must increase the base stock (mu_hat) significantly to bridge the gap. Measured lead times are volatile {3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}, averaging 2.0. I will use 'calculate' for L. For mu_hat, I will set an explicit value: (1+L)*mean + lost_units = (1+2)*138 + 166 = 580. This forces the base stock high enough to account for the lost stock while maintaining a service level for the upcoming 3 periods (L+1).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and high demand variability. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows an average of approx 138 units per period (Avg of P1-P11: 138.3). The Period 2 order (166 units) is officially confirmed lost (10 periods since order), yet it remains in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation, causing it to under-order. To compensate for this 'ghost' inventory of 166 units and the stockout, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory = (L+1) * Mean + Buffer. With actual L averaging 2 and high variance, I use a look-ahead of 3 periods (L=2) and want the system to target approx 550 units total pipeline. Since the backend thinks we have 635 in transit (which includes the lost 166), it sees 'real' in-transit as 469. To force an order that covers the 166 missing units and restores service levels, I've set mu_hat to 625. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed delays (averaging ~2.2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Pipeline inventory is inflated by 166 units from a lost Period 2 order. OR parameters must be adjusted upward to force ordering that ignores this ghost inventory.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with an average demand of approximately 139 units per period across 12 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2 periods). Crucially, the order for 166 units placed in Period 2 is confirmed lost (now 11 periods since order), yet it remains in the 'In-transit' calculation (Pipeline inventory = 407, but active orders are 166 (lost) + 163 (P6, likely lost) + 33 (P11) + 45 (P12) = 407). Actually, P6 (163 units) is also 7 periods old and should have arrived by now, suggesting it too is likely lost. The backend OR engine sees a pipeline of 407 units and will under-order significantly if we use default parameters. To correct for this 'ghost' inventory of 329 units (166 from P2 + 163 from P6), I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. calculation: Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mean_demand = (2+1) * 140 = 420. However, the OR engine subtracts pipeline (407) from base_stock. To ensure the order covers demand despite the 329 units of lost stock, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 750 (420 + 330 approximation) to force a replenishment order that overcomes the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Period 6 order (163 units) is now 7 periods overdue and confirmed lost, matching the pattern of the Period 2 loss. Total ghost inventory in pipeline is now 329 units (166 + 163).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of ~137. However, the system faces significant supply chain issues: two orders are confirmed lost (Period 2: 166 units and Period 6: 163 units), totaling 329 units of 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline (in-transit). The OR engine subtracts this ghost inventory from its order calculation, leading to consistent stockouts. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time (L) of 2 (plus 1 period for current demand) and a mean demand of 137. Base stock = (L+1) * 137 + (Safety Stock). With z* \u2248 1.83 (for 95% service level) and sigma \u2248 15, safety stock is ~47. Target Base Stock \u2248 411 + 47 = 458. To force the OR engine to place a correct order, I set mu_hat (explicitly) to 'Target Base Stock + Ghost Inventory'. 458 + 329 = 787. This ensures the engine places an order despite the pipeline bias. Sigma is set slightly higher to account for lead-time variability (L=1 to 3).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean of approximately 138 units over the last 14 periods. The primary challenge is managing 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline due to lost shipments. We have two confirmed lost orders: Period 2 (166 units) and Period 6 (163 units), totaling 329 units. These units appear in the 'In-transit' count (806 units) but will never arrive, causing the OR backend to under-order. To compensate, I must increase the base stock (mu_hat) to 'trink' the backend into ordering enough to cover actual lead time demand. Using the promised lead time L=2, the base stock should cover 3 periods (L+1). Target base stock \u2248 (3 * 138) + safety stock. With an average demand of 138 and standard deviation of 17, a 95% service level requires a base stock of approximately 414 + 1.645 * 17 * sqrt(3) \u2248 462. Since the backend subtracts the pipeline (806) from mu_hat, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the desired base stock plus the ghost inventory (462 + 329 = 791) to ensure a replenishment order is triggered. I will use a calculated L based on observation (avg ~2.2) and explicit mu_hat/sigma_hat to bypass the ghost inventory issue.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed total of 329 units of ghost inventory (P2: 166, P6: 163). Parameters must be manually adjusted upward by this amount to prevent stockouts.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 796 in-transit units. However, multiple shipments are confirmed lost: Period 2 (166 units, 14 periods overdue) and Period 6 (163 units, 10 periods overdue). This results in 329 'ghost' units in the pipeline inventory. The OR backend subtracts this full 796 from the base stock target, leading to severe under-ordering and current stockouts. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~138 units per period (based on historical average). For a target base stock covering (L+1) periods (3 periods), the required level is ~414 units. To force the backend to place an order despite the 329 ghost units, I must offset this bias by adding 329 to the target. Calculation: 138 * 3 + 329 = 743. I will set mu_hat to 743 to ensure the backend sees enough 'needed' inventory to overcome the pipeline inflation. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time (approx 2.4 periods).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 136 units (historical samples 1-5 mean: 136.4, recent period 1-16 mean: 133.2). Lead times are varying between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.4 across observed arrivals. The primary operational challenge is the presence of 329 units of 'ghost inventory' from Period 2 (166 units) and Period 6 (163 units), which are confirmed lost but still included in the backend's 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 565; actual In-transit: 565 - 329 = 236). Since the OR backend uses 'order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)', this ghost inventory prevents necessary orders from being placed. To counteract this, I will use an explicit mu_hat set to (1+L) * mean_demand + 329. Using L=3 (most frequent actual lead time), mu_hat = (4 * 136) + 329 = 873. This forces the base stock level high enough to offset the 329 'dead' units in the pipeline calculation. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a recent 10-period mean of approximately 130.5 units. The primary issue is the persistence of 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Orders from Period 2 (166 units) and Period 6 (163 units) are long overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 329 units. These units still show up in the 'In-transit' count (609 units), which triggers the OR backend's inventory-matching logic to reduce orders prematurely. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the lead plus review period (1+L) * mean_demand PLUS the lost units. With an average lead time observed at 3 periods and a mean demand of ~130, the standard base stock should be (1+3)*130 = 520. Adding the 329 'ghost' units, the adjusted target is approximately 849. I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to force this correction. For L, I will use recent_N=5 since the last several arrivals (P12, P14, P15, P16, P17) have consistently shown a lead time of 3 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 329 units of 'ghost inventory' from lost orders in Period 2 (166 units) and Period 6 (163 units). These units are officially 'In-transit' but will never arrive. To compensate, I must adjust the base stock (mu_hat) upward so the OR backend (which subtracts the full pipeline inventory) still orders enough to meet demand. Historical demand is stable with an average of approximately 135 units per period. The observed lead time is consistently 3 periods lately. Therefore, I need a 'target' inventory level that covers L+1 periods (4 periods) plus a safety stock, then add back the 329 lost units. Calculation: (135 units/period * 4 periods) = 540. Adding safety stock and the ghost inventory correction (540 + ~85 safety + 329) leads to a total mu_hat value around 954. This overrides the pipeline distortion and ensures replenishment orders are generated despite the inflated 'In-transit' count of 698.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reached Period 20 with 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 921 units. However, there is confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost orders in Period 2 (166 units) and Period 6 (163 units), totaling 329 units. These units will never arrive but the OR backend still counts them in the pipeline, which artificially suppresses new orders. Historical demand is stable, with the last 15 periods (since Period 5) averaging 129.5 units. To compensate for the 329 units of ghost inventory and ensure a service level q=0.95 (given $19 profit and $1 holding cost), mu_hat must be increased by approximately this ghost amount. Expected demand for lead time + review period (L+1=3) is ~389 units. Adding the 329 ghost units, the mu_hat should be around 718. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 720 and sigma_hat to 40 (based on a standard deviation of ~18-20 per period scaled by sqrt(3)) to force the engine to maintain a higher base stock that ignores the lost shipments.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has an in-transit inventory of 921 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 329 units are confirmed lost (Period 2: 166 units, Period 6: 163 units). These 329 units remain in the 'In-transit' figure indefinitely, creating 'ghost inventory' that leads the OR backend's pipeline logic to under-order. To compensate, I must adjust mu_hat upward by approximately the amount of this ghost inventory. Looking at recent demand, it is stable (~120-130 units/period). Under a promised lead time (L) of 2, the base stock targets (1+L) periods of demand. Mean demand is ~134. Thus, mu_hat should normally be ~402. Adding the 329 lost units to the base stock target yields a mu_hat of ~731. I will use 740 to ensure sufficient safety stock given we are currently at zero on-hand inventory and expecting arrears. Observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3, averaging 2.5; I will set L=3 to be conservative regarding safety stock calculations while using mu_hat to bridge the pipeline gap.

These units will never arrive but are still counted by the OR backend, preventing it from placing necessary replacement orders. Additionally, recent orders from Period 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 35+245+89+223 = 592 units) are still in transit and within the variable lead time window (which has averaged 2.5-3.0 periods lately). To normalize the ordering logic, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the standard formula: mean demand (~132) * (L+1) + safety stock (~2 * sqrt(L+1) * std_dev). Mean demand is approx 132 per period with a std dev of ~18. For L=3 (observed), base stock should be ~132*4 + 2*18*2 \u2248 528 + 72 = 600 units. To compensate for the 329 units of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to a value that forces the OR engine's 'base_stock' to be approximately 600 + 329 = 929. This ensures that even after the backend subtracts the full 921 in-transit units, it still perceives a need for a small buffer or maintains the current intended position.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has an on-hand inventory of 0 and an 'In-transit' pipeline of 974 units. However, previous insights confirm that orders from Period 2 (166 units) and Period 6 (163 units) are lost, totaling 329 units of 'ghost inventory' that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock calculation. To prevent stockouts, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that compensates for this 329-unit deficit. The promised lead time is 2, so the OR backend calculates base stock for (1+L=3) periods. Demand is stable around 130 per period. The standard mu_hat for L=2 would be ~390 (3 * 130). To bypass the pipeline inflation, I set mu_hat to 390 (standard) + 329 (ghost compensation) = 719. I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent demand volatility (Period 13-22).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 921 units in-transit. Based on Carry-Over Insights, there is a total of 329 units of 'ghost inventory' (Order P2: 166 units and Order P6: 163 units) that were lost and never arrived, even though they remain in the pipeline count. To compensate, I must increase the mu_hat parameter by this exact amount (329) to trick the OR backend into ordering sufficient stock, effectively ignoring the units that will never arrive. Demand has shown a slight downward trend over the last 10 periods (avg ~115) compared to the overall history. Using recent_N (N=10) for demand estimation captures this shift. Lead time remains volatile, but recent history (P22) showed a 1-period arrival; I will use 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the historical average (approx 2.4) which is safer than the promised 2.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has decreased significantly from an initial average of ~136 units/period to roughly 85 units/period in the last 3 samples. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there is a massive stockout situation due to missing shipments from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (792 units total), which are now long overdue. The Carry-over Insights identify 329 units from P2 and P6 as confirmed lost, and the lack of arrivals for P15, P17, P18, and P19 suggests these are likely lost as well, as deliveries usually occur within 3 periods but these are at 5+ periods delay. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (921 units) from its target stock; because 921 is far higher than any realistic base stock for the current demand, the system will not order unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset these ghost units. To force an order and resolve the stockout, I am setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat to an explicit value of 1400 (to cover ~3 periods of demand at a 130 rate plus the 921 units of ghost inventory), and sigma_hat to an explicit 100 to maintain high service levels while navigating the lead-time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Massive shipment loss confirmed. In addition to P2 and P6 (329 units), shipments from periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (792 units) have not arrived after 6+ periods and are effectively lost. Total ghost inventory in pipeline is now 1121 units (P2: 166, P6: 163, P15: 35, P17: 245, P18: 89, P19: 223 minus any small arrivals). Demand has shifted lower to approx 85-90 units/period since P23.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing widespread shipment losses, with 1,121 units in the pipeline confirmed as lost (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19). These units will never arrive but are still counted by the OR engine as 'in-transit', preventing new orders. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the required base stock for a 3-period window (L=2 + 1 decision period) using the recent demand mean (~98 units/period since Period 17). This gives a true base stock of approximately 294. To force the OR engine to order despite the 1,121 ghost units, I must set mu_hat = True Base Stock + Ghost Inventory = 294 + 1121 = 1415. This allows the backend to overcome the pipeline inflation and place a replenishment order to meet real demand, which has slightly rebounded following a dip.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed massive pipeline distortion: 1,121 units are lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) and will not arrive. Current demand regime (P17-P25) averages ~98 units per period.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a massive stockout crisis due to 1,121 units of lost inventory (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19). For Period 27, on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is dominated by these lost 'ghost' units. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base_stock to calculate an order; if the pipeline is significantly inflated by lost shipments, the backend will never place a new order, resulting in permanent stockouts. To force an order, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that covers current demand PLUS the total ghost inventory. Demand since Period 17 (most recent regime shift) averages ~110.3 units across 10 samples (including Period 26's 134). Using a lead time of 2, the base stock formula requires a value for (1+L)*demand + ghost inventory. Calculation: (1+2)*110 + 1121 = 1451. Setting mu_hat to 1451 ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock high enough to trigger new shipments despite the 1,121 lost units currently in the 'In-transit' count. Lead time remains 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P22) still occur within 1-3 periods, suggesting the supply chain is functional but unreliable.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Persistent ghost inventory confirmed at 1,121 units. Total in-transit (1483) minus ghost (1121) leaves 362 units of potentially valid inventory from Period 25. Demand has rebounded slightly to ~110 units/period (avg P17-P26).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the situation remains critical with zero on-hand inventory and a heavily distorted pipeline. My carry-over insights confirm that 1,121 units in the 1,509 'In-transit' count are lost shipments (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19). These are 'ghost inventory' that the OR backend incorrectly uses to reduce orders. To compensate, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Demand is currently in a regime averaging approximately 110 units (Periods 17-27 excluding the brief P23-24 dip). With a lead time (L) of 2, the actual pipeline needs to cover 3 periods (~330 units). However, because the backend subtracts the 1,509 in-transit units from the base_stock, I must set mu_hat to approximately (Desired Base Stock + Ghost Inventory). Desired Base Stock (z* included) for 3 periods of demand at ~110 units with moderate volatility is roughly 380-400 units. Adding the 1,121 ghost units results in a target mu_hat of ~1,500. This should trigger an order that reflects actual demand needs while bypassing the accounting error caused by lost shipments.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a massive pipeline distortion due to lost shipments. Based on history and Carry-Over Insights, orders from periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19 have effectively vanished, totaling 1,121 units of 'ghost inventory' that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock calculation. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this inflated inventory, mu_hat must be set to cover the projected demand plus the ghost inventory (Base Stock needed + Ghost Stock). Current demand (P17-P28) fluctuates but averages ~110 units/period (mean of last 12 periods is 105, but recently higher). Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+L)*avg_demand + Ghost = (3 * 110) + 1121 = 1451. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(3) * std_dev(~20) \u2248 35. This explicit adjustment overrides the backend's pipeline deduction of the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Persistent ghost inventory remains at 1,121 units. Total in-transit (1553) suggests only 432 units are potentially valid (from P25, P27, P28). Demand has softened further in P28 (69 units), but we maintain a 110/period average for safety due to the 0 on-hand stock status.

Daily Reward (R_t): $494.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a severe crisis with lost shipments creating 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline, which causes the OR backend to severely under-order. As of Period 30, the confirmed ghost inventory (lost shipments that will never arrive) is 1,121 units (from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19). The current In-transit total is 1,527, meaning only 406 units (from P25 and P28) are likely legitimate. Since On-hand is 0 and we are consistently stocking out, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to negate the impact of the ghost inventory. I'm targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the 1,121 units of lost inventory. Using a mean demand of 105 (average of P17-P29 is ~102, slightly buffered for safety) and a lead time of 3 (the most frequent actual observed lead time), the base stock calculation is: (1+3) * 105 = 420 units. To offset the 1,121 ghost units, mu_hat must be set to 420 + 1,121 = 1,541. This forces the OR backend to see a requirement that accounts for the fact that the 'pipeline' it depends on is largely empty air. This strategy aims to bridge the stockout gap and restore inventory flow despite the unreliable logistics.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Ghost inventory remains at 1,121 units. Recent demand (P28: 69, P29: 63) is significantly lower than previous averages (~110), suggesting a possible downward shift or stockout-driven demand suppression. Maintaining a buffer due to 0 on-hand inventory.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a persistent stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The critical issue is 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline: shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 1,121 units) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, but they still populate the backend's 'in-transit' calculation. To force the OR engine to place orders despite this inflated pipeline, we must set mu_hat (the Target Stock Level/Base Stock) high enough to exceed the ghost inventory. Demand has shown a slight downward trend recently (P28: 69, P29: 63, P30: 108), but given the stockouts, actual demand might be suppressed. I will set mu_hat to 1,511 to account for the 1,121 lost units plus a safety stock based on an average demand of ~100 over a 3-period lead-cycle (1+L=3). This ensures the OR backend sees 'effective' inventory as significantly below target. Lead time (L) is set to the calculated average (approx 2.3) to reflect realistic delays. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to provide a robust buffer against recent demand volatility and stockout recovery spikes.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a massive inventory reconciliation issue. There are 1,121 units of 'ghost inventory' in-transit that are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts the entire pipeline inventory (1,643 units) from the calculated base stock. If we use the standard calculation, the backend assumes we have 1,643 units coming, whereas only 522 units (1,643 - 1,121) are actually valid (from P25, P30, P31). Demand has stabilized around 90-100 units/period (mean of last 10 samples is roughly 94). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 'ghost' pipeline, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that covers the desired base stock PLUS the lost units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock for L=2 is roughly (2+1)*94 + buffer \u2248 350-400. To offset the 1,121 ghost units, mu_hat must be set to ~1,500. This ensures the (base_stock - pipeline) calculation results in a positive order to replenish the current 0 on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total ghost inventory remains 1,121 units. Valid pipeline inventory is 522 units (P25, P30, P31). Effective on-hand is 0. Recent demand (P22-P31) fluctuates between 63-134, averaging ~94.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 1,576 units. However, based on extensive history, 1,121 units of this pipeline are 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19) that are far beyond the expected lead time and will not arrive. This leaves an 'effective' pipeline of only 455 units (the Period 25 order of 562 units is also highly suspect as it is now 8 periods overdue, but I will treat it as potentially valid for one more period to avoid extreme over-ordering, though its absence is the primary cause of the current stockout). Recent demand (P22-P32) averages 94.5 units per period. Using a lead time of 2.33 (observed average), the desired base stock would be ~314 units. Since the 'ghost-adjusted' pipeline (1576 - 1121 = 455) already exceeds this, the OR engine will not place an order. To force an order and secure inventory against the ongoing stockout, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to offset the ghost inventory. I set mu_hat to 1,500 to overwhelm the 1,121 ghost units and the 455 valid/pending units, ensuring a replenishment order is triggered. Sigma_hat is set to 150 (explicit) to reflect high volatility and maintain a high service level.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a massive pipeline inventory distortion. Of the 1,747 units in-transit, 1,121 units are objectively lost (orders from periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19 are 14-32 periods old). Additionally, the order from Period 25 (562 units) is now 9 periods overdue, suggesting it is also lost. This brings total 'ghost inventory' to 1,683 units. Valid in-transit inventory is likely only 64 units (Recent orders P30-P33 minus minor arrivals). With 0 on-hand inventory and consistent demand (averaging ~94 units in the last 10 periods), we must bypass the OR engine's 'ghost' pipeline checks. To do this, I set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat to an explicit value that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) plus the entire ghost inventory volume. Mean demand (3 periods) \u2248 282. Ghost inventory \u2248 1683. Target mu_hat = 1965. This forcing mechanism ensures the OR engine places an order despite the high visible in-transit count.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Ghost inventory increased to 1,683 units as the Period 25 order (562 units) is now 9 periods overdue and presumed lost. Valid pipeline is minimal (~64 units). mu_hat must be set to ~1965 to force ordering.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the system shows 0 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 2,030 units. However, based on the historical logs and Carry-over Insights, a massive portion of this pipeline is comprised of 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments: Period 2 (166), Period 6 (163), Period 15 (35), Period 17 (245), Period 18 (89), Period 19 (223), and now Period 25 (562). Total ghost inventory is 1,483 units. Valid pipeline inventory consists only of Period 30 (93), Period 33 (171), and Period 34 (283), totaling 547 units. The OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount (2,030) from the target base stock. To trigger an order that covers future demand and compensates for these 1,483 lost units, I must inflate mu_hat. Recent demand (P22-P34) averages ~97 units. With a lead time of 2, (1+L)*mean = 3 * 97 = 291. To offset the 1,483 ghost units, I set mu_hat (explicitly) to 291 + 1,483 = 1,774. This forces the OR backend to recognize that 2,030 - 1,483 = 547 is the actual valid pipeline, and it will order accordingly to reach the desired service level.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory is confirmed at 1,483 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P25). Valid pipeline inventory is approximately 547 units. mu_hat must be inflated by at least 1,483 units to bypass the backend's pipeline subtraction.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face severe pipeline distortion due to lost shipments. Ghost inventory (undelivered units still counted in pipeline inventory by the OR backend) is confirmed at 1,483 units, consisting of orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 25. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P26-P35) has stabilized at an average of approximately 99 units per period. To trigger an order, mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds the total pipeline inventory (2030 units) plus a safety buffer, as the OR backend's formula is 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Valid pipeline (non-lost units) includes orders from P30 (93 units), P33 (171 units), and P34 (283 units), totaling 547 units. To ensure the backend places an order sufficient for ~3 periods of demand (approx 300 units) while accounting for the 1,483 ghost units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 2,050. This forces the backend to recognize that existing stock and valid in-transit units are insufficient for current demand regimes.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, the shipment from Period 34 (283 units) arrived, which finally replenished on-hand inventory to 197 units. The total 'In-transit' is 1837 units. However, based on serial losses identified in carry-over insights, 1,483 units are confirmed ghost inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P25). The actual valid pipeline inventory is 354 units (calculated as total In-transit 1837 - ghost 1483). Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units over the last 15 periods (P22-P36 avg = 98.4). To ensure the OR backend places an order and doesn't get misled by the 1483 units of ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat (which represents the base stock level) to account for the actual valid pipeline needed plus the ghost buffer. Base stock = (1+L)*demand + safety stock. With L=2, base stock for demand would be ~300. Adding the 1,483 ghost units requires mu_hat to be ~1783. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 1800 to ensure a small order is triggered if valid pipeline vs demand necessitates it, and 'recent_N' with N=15 for sigma to capture volatility in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Delivery of P34 order (283 units) confirmed. Ghost inventory remains constant at 1,483 units. Valid pipeline inventory is 354 units (P33, P36 orders).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) totaling 1,483 units (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 25). The OR backend automatically subtracts the total in-transit quantity (1,747 units) from the calculated base stock. However, 1,483 of those units will never arrive. To ensure a productive order is placed, mu_hat must be set to a value that accounts for 1) expected demand for (L+1) periods, and 2) the 1,483 ghost units that need to be bypassed. Recent demand (P28-P37) averages approximately 88 units/period. For a lead time of 2, (1+L) * demand \u2248 264 units. Adding the 1,483 ghost units results in a target mu_hat of ~1,747. Since we currently have 213 units on hand, and we want to maintain a healthy stock level without over-ordering into high holding costs, I am setting mu_hat to 1,900 using the explicit method. This ensures the (base_stock - pipeline) calculation remains positive and targets an effective inventory level while recognizing that only the P33 order (171 units) is actually expected in the valid pipeline.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P36-P38) has slowed significantly (86, 74, 40), averaging approx 67 units/period. The on-hand inventory is healthy at 173 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1,747 continues to be heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P25), which I have previously calculated to be 1,483 units. Valid pipeline inventory actually only consists of P30 (93 units, overdue), P33 (171 units, overdue), and any residual balance, though P30 and P33 are now significantly past the promised 2-period lead time. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 1,747 units and suppressing all orders, mu_hat is set to 1,948 (Calculated as: 1,483 lost units + [1+2 periods] * 155 units/period safety forecast). This ensures that if the true pipeline (valid units) falls below the desired stock level, the system will place an order despite the 1,483 'ghost' units.

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns. Ghost inventory remains constant at 1,483 units. Valid pipeline (P30, P33) is now 5+ periods overdue.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1287.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is significantly compromised by historical 'ghost inventory' - orders that appear in the pipeline but will never arrive. Based on historical data, the periods with lost shipments are P2(166), P6(163), P15(35), P17(245), P18(89), P19(223), and P25(562), totaling 1,483 units. Currently, the system reports 1,846 units in-transit. Subtracting the ghost inventory (1,846 - 1,483) leaves 363 units of valid pipeline inventory (likely from P30, P33, and P39). Demand in the most recent regime (P36-P39) has lowered significantly, averaging approximately 68 units per period (86, 74, 40, 73). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 1,846 'units' in-transit, mu_hat must be set to cover the desired base stock plus the ghost inventory. A target base stock for a 3-period window (L=2 + 1) at 70 units/period is 210. Adding the 1,483 lost units results in a required mu_hat of approximately 1,693. I will set a slightly higher explicit mu_hat of 1,750 to account for demand volatility and ensure we maintain the current 100 units on-hand without triggering the backend's pipeline-based order suppression.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the current on-hand inventory is 136 units. However, the system reports an in-transit inventory of 1,747 units, which is heavily distorted by permanent shipment losses. According to the carry-over insights and historical record, shipments from Period 2 (166), Period 6 (163), Period 15 (35), Period 17 (245), Period 18 (89), Period 19 (223), and Period 25 (562) are 15+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. This creates a 'ghost inventory' of 1,483 units. Subtracting these from the reported in-transit (1,747) leaves 264 units of valid pipeline inventory (likely from recent orders like P33 or others). Demand has shifted lower recently, averaging approximately 75 units per period over the last 5 periods (P36-P40: 86, 74, 40, 73, 63). To avoid stockouts caused by the OR backend subtracting ghost inventory from the base stock, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the ghost inventory (1,483) and the required base stock for the current demand regime. With L=2 and mean demand ~75, the base stock should be ~225. Therefore, mu_hat = 1483 + 225 = 1708. This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for valid pipeline only.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant inventory management challenges due to 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (orders that are officially in-transit but effectively lost). Based on the carry-over insights, there are 1,483 units currently recorded in the pipeline that will never arrive (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 25). These 1,483 units must be countered by inflating the 'mu_hat' parameter so the backend's (base_stock - pipeline) calculation produces a positive order. Current on-hand is 78 units. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has stabilized lower at an average of 61.6 units per period. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the ghost inventory plus a safe buffer for the next 3 periods (L=2, so L+1 coverage). Calculation: (90 units/period * 3 periods) + 1483 ghost units = 1753. Since 'in-transit' is 1747, a mu_hat of ~1780 should trigger a small replenishment if necessary while accounting for the lost shipments. We observe recent lead times of 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand has settled into a lower regime, averaging ~61.6 units/period over the last 5 periods (P37-P41). Ghost inventory remains constant at 1,483 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime, averaging 61.6 units per period over the last five periods (P37-P41). Lead times have been relatively short recently (1-2 periods), but the persistent issue is 'ghost inventory'. A total of 1,483 units (from orders in P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P25) are long overdue and confirmed lost. These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (1,785), making the backend think we have 1,785 - 15 = 1,770 units coming, when in reality only about 302 units (1,785 - 1,483) are potentially valid (including the P42 order of 38 units). To force the OR backend to place an order despite this ghost pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 2,100. This value is calculated as: (Target Base Stock for a 3-period window) + Ghost Inventory. At ~70 units/period (safety buffer over recent 61.6 mean) for 3 periods (L+1), we need ~210 units. Adding the 1,483 lost units gives ~1,693; I am using 2,100 to ensure the order covers demand and overcomes the inventory cap logic, which is also suppressed by the pipeline count. L is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals have been 1-2 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face massive pipeline distortion due to long-standing 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) totaling 1,483 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P25). Additionally, the orders from P30 (93 units) and P33 (171 units) are now 14 and 11 periods respectively past their order dates; given the historical pattern of losses, these are also likely lost, bringing the suspected ghost total to 1,747 units. The current in-transit visibility is 2,157 units, but most are non-arriving. Demand has settled into a lower regime, averaging 61.6 units/period over P37-P42. To force the OR backend to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' and include the ghost inventory offset. We calculate the required mu_hat as: (expected demand over L+1 periods) + (ghost inventory). Using L=2 and mean demand ~62, the base requirement is 186 units. Adding 1,747 units of ghost inventory gives a target mu_hat of ~1,933. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation results in a positive order despite the inflated 'Pipeline' value.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Suspected ghost inventory updated to 1,747 units as P30 and P33 orders are significantly overdue and confirmed non-arrivals. Current valid pipeline inventory is approx 410 units (P42, P43).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face severe reliability issues with 'ghost' inventory\u2014orders that are in-transit but have never arrived. Based on historical data, shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P30, and P33 are now extreme outliers (5 to 42 periods overdue) and are confirmed lost. The total ghost inventory is 1,747 units (166+163+35+245+89+223+562+93+171). Currently, the 'in-transit' total is 2,157, meaning only 410 units are potentially valid (P42, P43). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has settled into a lower regime, averaging 66.8 units over the last 10 periods (P35-P44). To trigger an order despite the 1,747 ghost units being subtracted from the inventory position in the backend, mu_hat must be set to cover the desired base stock PLUS the ghost inventory. To maintain a service level for ~67 units/period demand with a 2-period lead time, a base stock of approximately 250-300 is needed. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 2,050 (1,747 + ~300) to bypass the pipeline distortion and attempt to secure stock for the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed ghost inventory increased to 1,747 units (adding P30 and P33 to the previous list). Valid pipeline inventory is estimated at ~410 units (from P42 and P43). Recent demand regime (P35-P44) average is 66.8 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 355 units following the arrival of P42 and P43 orders. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1,747 units, but based on historical analysis, all 1,747 units are confirmed lost 'ghost inventory' (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P30, and P33). Consequently, the actual pipeline inventory is 0. Recent demand from P37-P45 shows a definitive lower-regime average of 62.9 units (approx 63). To ensure the OR backend places an order, mu_hat must be set to a value that compensates for the 1,747 ghost units being subtracted from the calculated base stock. Base stock for L=2 (3 periods of coverage) at demand=63 is roughly 189. Offsetting the 1,747 lost units requires mu_hat to be approximately 1,936. I will use 'explicit' to force this target and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $605.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 1,747 units in-transit, but based on historical analysis and confirmed arrival patterns, all of these units are 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (specifically from periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 25, 30, and 33). These orders are significantly past the observed lead time of 1-3 periods and will not arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'in-transit' volume from the base stock to calculate orders, it will never place a new order unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset this distortion. On-hand inventory is 307 units, which at the current low-demand regime (averaging ~61 units over the last 10 periods), will last approximately 5 periods. To ensure a new order is triggered before on-hand is depleted\u2014and to bypass the 1,747 units of ghost inventory\u2014I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The target base stock should be (L+1)*Demand + 1747. With L=2 and Demand=61, this equals approx 183 + 1747 = 1930. I will set mu_hat to 2000 to provide a small buffer and ensure the backend generates a replenishment order soon as on-hand drops.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1,747 units. Based on historical data and carry_over_insights, these units correspond to orders from periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 25, 30, and 33. All of these orders are at least 14 periods overdue and are confirmed lost (ghost inventory). The OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' volume from the base stock to determine the order quantity. To bypass this and ensure we maintain stock, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than this ghost inventory plus the expected demand for the lead time. Current demand is in a lower regime; the average demand for the last 10 periods (P38-P47) is approximately 60. units. On-hand inventory is 228 units. To prevent the OR engine from ordering 0, we set mu_hat explicitly to (Ghost Inventory + Safety Buffer - OnHand) + Expected Lead Time Demand. We estimate mu_hat around 1747 (ghost) + 200 (target stock) - 228 (on-hand) + 180 (3 periods of demand) = ~1900. Using 'explicit' ensures the backend doesn't rely on distorted historical pipeline figures.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a significant 'ghost inventory' of 1,747 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P30, P33) which are confirmed lost or significantly overdue, distorting the pipeline. Any order calculation must account for this by inflating mu_hat to ensure the backend's subtraction of in-transit units still results in a positive order if needed. However, current on-hand inventory is 199 units, and actual demand has dropped significantly. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P39-P48) is approximately 60.3 units/period. Over the last 5 periods (P44-P48), it is 58 units/period. With 199 units on hand and only 2 periods remaining in the simulation (P49 and P50), the current stock is sufficient to cover expected demand (~120 units total) without further ordering. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to a level that ensures no new order is placed, as additional inventory would only incur holding costs in the final period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1621.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 108 units. The in-transit inventory is listed as 1747 units, but based on historical analysis, all 1747 units are 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P30, and P33). Since the backend subtracts this 1747 units from the target base stock to determine the order quantity, we must inflate mu_hat significantly to ensure the system places an order if needed. Recent demand (P45-P49) has averaged 60.4 units, representing a lower regime compared to earlier periods. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the system looks to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 181 units). To counteract the 1747 'ghost' units and 108 on-hand units, the target base stock must exceed 1855 (1747 + 108) to trigger any order. However, since 108 units currently covers ~1.8 periods of recent demand and L=2, a small order is desired to bridge the gap until the next arrival. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 2050 to ensure the backend recognizes a need for replenishment despite the pipeline distortion, and set sigma_hat to a value reflecting recent volatility.
