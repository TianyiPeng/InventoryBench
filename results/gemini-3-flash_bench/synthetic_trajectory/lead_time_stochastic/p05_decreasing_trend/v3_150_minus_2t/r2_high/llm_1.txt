The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be available for sale/observation in Period 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods averaged ~136 units (130, 147, 128, 116, 161). To maximize profit and avoid stockouts during the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods), I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. Without starting inventory or in-transit units, I must order enough to cover the initial demand spike and build a safety buffer. Total expected demand for P1-P3 is approx 410 units. I will order 450 units to account for the variance seen in P5 (161) and ensure availability.",

Currently, on-hand inventory is critically low at 26 units, while the in-transit pipeline is extremely large at 700 units. These in-transit units represent orders from Periods 24 (150 units), 25 (100 units), and various recent periods where no orders were placed but residuals might exist. However, scanning history, the 700 units in-transit must come from the cluster of orders placed in Periods 20-25. Specifically, P24 (150) and P25 (100) are likely to arrive imminently. Despite the large pipeline, the immediate on-hand inventory (26) is insufficient to cover the upcoming Period 29 demand (~100). Because arrivals occur AFTER the decision phase but BEFORE demand resolution, an arrival from the P24/P25 orders is required now to avoid stockouts. Given the high pipeline vs. consumption (700 in-transit vs. ~100 demand), I will not place a new order. The existing 700 units in-transit are more than enough to cover the remaining periods if they arrive; adding more would only increase holding costs significantly once the bottleneck clears.",

Currently, orders from Period 24 (150 units) and Period 25 (100 units) are also significantly overdue (6 and 5 periods respectively), while the typical maximum lead time is 3 periods; these must be considered lost. The remaining active pipeline consists of orders from Periods 20, 21, 22, and 23 total 600 units, but these were largely already delivered in a bulk arrival in Period 23 (450 units total). Reviewing the 'In-transit' figure of 700 units, and subtracting the likely lost Period 24/25 orders (250 units), we have 450 units theoretically in transit from later periods (Periods 26+). However, no orders were placed in Periods 26-30. This suggests the 700 'In-transit' units are heavily comprised of the delayed/lost orders (Period 24, 25) and no fresh stock is imminent.

The supply chain continues to demonstrate binary reliability: orders either arrive within 1-3 periods or are lost permanently. Specifically, 700 units from Periods 17-19 and 24-25 are confirmed lost (>15 periods overdue). Viable in-transit inventory consists of: P41 (100 units, placed 3 periods ago), P42 (100 units, placed 2 periods ago), and P43 (50 units, placed 1 period ago), totaling 250 units. Combined with on-hand inventory (40 units), the total effective pipeline is 290 units. At a demand of ~90/period, this covers roughly 3.2 periods. Given the lead time volatility (up to 3 periods), I need to place an order to maintain a safety buffer and prevent stockouts in Period 46/47. Ordering 100 units brings the total system inventory to 390 units, covering ~4.3 periods of demand, which is appropriate for a 3-period lead-time environment with significant loss risk.",

Currently, orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25 (totaling 700 units) are confirmed lost. The recent arrivals confirm a lead time of 3 periods (P40 arrived in P43, P41 arrived in P44). Based on this, the P42 order (100 units) is expected to arrive in Period 45 resolution, the P43 order (50 units) in Period 46, and the P44 order (100 units) in Period 47. My current on-hand inventory is 56. I expect an arrival of 100 units (from P42) during Period 45 resolution, which together with on-hand (156) should cover Period 45 demand (~85). The pipeline (viable in-transit) consists of P42 (100), P43 (50), and P44 (100), totaling 250 units. With Period 45 ending on-hand expected to be around 71 units, and 150 more units in the viable pipeline for Periods 46 and 47, the total stock available to cover demand until the end of the game (Period 50) is approximately 306 units. At 85 units per period, I need 510 units for the remaining 6 periods. I will order 100 units to maintain a safety buffer while accounting for the high loss rate observed previously.",

Currently, on-hand inventory is 175 units. The in-transit pipeline officially shows 900 units, but historical evidence from Carry-Over Insights and period logs (Periods 17-19, 24-25) confirms that 700 of these units (orders from P17-19 and P24-25) are permanently lost. This leaves 200 units of viable in-transit inventory (orders from P44 and P45). Supply chain lead times for successful deliveries continue to vary between 1 and 3 periods. With total viable inventory (On-hand 175 + In-transit 200) at 375 units, and a demand forecast of ~85 units/period, the current coverage is approximately 4.4 periods.

In-transit inventory shows 900 units, but historical analysis confirms 700 units (from P17-19 and P24-25) are lost. The remaining 200 units consist of orders from P44 and P45. Based on historical lead times (1-3 periods), the P44 order (100 units) should arrive in P48 (LT=4, slightly delayed but expected) or is potentially lost. Even excluding the potentially lost P44/P45 orders, the current 69 units plus incoming stock are being compared against an estimated 138 total demand for the rest of the game (46 units/period * 3 periods). If P44 arrives, we reach ~169 units. Considering the lead time is 2-3 periods, any order placed now (P48) would arrive in P50 at the earliest (if LT=2) or after the game ends (if LT=3).

Demand has recently fluctuated (P45-P48 values: 31, 43, 63, 72). This suggests a possible recovery toward the previous mean of ~85, but with only two periods left, we must be careful not to over-order and incur large holding costs on P50's ending inventory. The total in-transit is 900 units, but a large portion (700 units) from Periods 17-19 and 24-25 is historically confirmed lost. The relevant active pipeline consists of orders from Periods 44 (100 units) and 45 (100 units). Based on a lead time of 1-3 periods, the P44 order (placed 5 periods ago) is actually likely lost as well, given the max observed lead time of 3. The P45 order (placed 4 periods ago) is also borderline. However, we must ensure availability for P49 and P50. Any order placed now (P49) with a minimum lead time of 1 would arrive for P50. Since the game ends after P50, and we have 0 on-hand, we rely on the P45 order (100 units) arriving during P49 to satisfy P49 and P50 demand. If that fails, a new order placed now won't help for P49. To cover P50 demand (~75 units), I will place a conservative order of 100 units to arrives in P50 if LT=1, balancing the risk of a stockout against the cost of leftover stock.",

Any demand in Period 50 will result in a stockout unless an order was previously placed to arrive today. Reviewing Period 49's 'In-transit', there are 450 units total (P44=100, P45=100, P49=100, plus older lost units P17-19 and P24-25 which total 700). The reachable units in transit are the P44 order (ordered P44, LT could be 3, arriving P47-49-ish) and P45 order (LT could be 3, arriving P48-50-ish). However, even if they arrive, they arrive during the Arrival Resolution Phase of Period 50, meaning they will be available for this final period's demand. Because this is the last period, any order placed now (Period 50) would only arrive in Period 51 or later, incurring unnecessary holding costs without the possibility of being sold.
