Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no historical performance or lead time data yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 5 periods shows values [130, 147, 128, 116, 161], giving a mean of 136.4 and a standard deviation of 17.5. Given the relatively high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the system will naturally target a high service level. For this initial decision, I will use the default methods, which will utilize all 5 provided historical samples to forecast demand and standard deviation across the review and lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). Using everyone's favorite 'default' method ensures the OR backend applies the base stock policy accurately based on the initial dataset provided.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and faced a demand of 165 units. Since the order of 166 units placed in Period 1 has not arrived yet (promised lead time is 2), all demand was lost. The system currently shows 0 on-hand and 166 in-transit. Based on the 5 historical demand samples (130, 147, 128, 116, 161), the mean demand is 136.4 with a standard deviation of approximately 17.6. Period 1 demand (165) was slightly higher than the historical average but within reasonable bounds of variance. I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which utilize all historical samples. As the promised lead time is 2, and we only have 1 period of history (with no arrivals yet), the default lead time (2) and default calculation methods are appropriate to establish the base stock level to cover current and lead-time demand (L+1 = 3 periods).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders were placed in Period 1 (166 units) and Period 2 (174 units), totaling 340 units in transit. According to the execution sequence, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (visible in Period 4) and the order from Period 2 in Period 4 (visible in Period 5). On-hand inventory is currently 0, which is expected as we haven't reached the promised lead time for the first order yet. Demand for the last 5 samples (provided in prompt) is 130, 147, 128 (P3 user history shows 128), 116, 161. Note: the game history for P1 and P2 shows demand 165 and 145 respectively, which differs slightly from the sample list provided (130, 147). I will prioritize the provided sample list [130, 147, 128, 116, 161] as the structural forecasting anchor. Mean of these 5 samples is 136.4. With L=2, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods. mu_hat (3 periods) = 3 * 136.4 = 409.2. Sigma calculation for 5 samples: std is ~18.2. sigma_hat (3 periods) = sqrt(3) * 18.2 = 31.5. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 as the regime appears stable.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (166 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and become visible in Period 3's conclude message. However, the History shows that in Period 3 conclude, 0 units arrived. This suggests a potential delay in the supply chain or that the '2-period' lead time logic means arrival at the end of Period 3 is only usable in Period 4 (meaning it arrived, but we haven't seen the 'Period 3 conclude' reflect it correctly, or it's actually a 3-period lead time). Demand has been relatively stable (165, 145, 135). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 489 units in transit (166 from P1, 174 from P2, 149 from P3). I will maintain the default lead time for now but keep a close eye on arrivals. I'll use the average of the first 3 periods of demand to set mu_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1925.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we received two shipments: the order from Period 1 (lead time 3) and the order from Period 3 (lead time 1). The promised lead time is 2, and the average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. The pipeline inventory now consists only of the order from Period 2 (174 units), which has been in transit for 3 periods (ordered Period 2, now start of Period 5) and is overdue or arriving this period. Demand has been relatively stable across the first 5 periods: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161 (Mean \u2248 136). Period 5 demand was 161, following a slightly lower Period 4. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to average the variability observed and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full history of this stable regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2677.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the SKU chips(Regular). The promised lead time is 2 periods. However, observed lead times are inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), and Period 3 arrived in 1 period (P4). Period 2 order (174 units) is still missing after 4 periods (ordered P2, expected P4, currently P6), suggesting a possible lost shipment or highly variable lead time. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161 (Mean \u2248 136.4, Std \u2248 17.5). On-hand inventory is 59 units, and in-transit is 353 units (Period 2's 174 + Period 5's 179). If Period 2 is lost, the pipeline is effectively halved. I will set L=3 (explicit) to account for the longer lead time observed in the first shipment and the current delay of the P2 shipment. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the full recent distribution for forecasting demand over (L+1)=4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1121.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we experienced a stockout (sold 59 vs 145 demand), and on-hand inventory is now 0. Our pipeline (in-transit) is 525 units, representing orders from Period 2 (174 units), Period 5 (179 units), and Period 6 (172 units). Looking at arrival history: Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods; Period 3 arrived in 1 period. This suggests lead time variability around the promised 2 periods. The demand for Period 1-5 averaged 140.2, but Period 6 demand was 145. Given the stockout and current in-transit volume, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the full history including the most recent demand sample of 145. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to account for current volatility. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1) motivates a high service level, which the OR engine will target via these parameters.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 621 units in-transit. Comparing the game history, we see two orders arrived in Period 4 (from P1 and P3), but orders from Period 2 (174 units), Period 5 (179 units), Period 6 (172 units), and Period 7 (96 units) have not yet arrived. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are inconsistent (3 periods for the P1 order and 1 period for the P3 order). Specifically, the P2 order is now 6 periods old (P8 - P2), which strongly suggests it is lost. Total in-transit is 621, but excluding the likely lost P2 order (174), effective pipeline is 447. Demand remains stable around a mean of ~140. I will use recent_N for L (N=3) to account for volatility, and recent_N for mu and sigma (N=5) to capture the current stable demand regime while the OR backend attempts to recover the stock position.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 2 (174 units) is likely lost (6 periods elapsed vs promised lead time 2). Lead time is highly volatile (min 1, max 3+).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 142 units on-hand and 359 units in-transit. Historical lead times for chips(Regular) have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P5: 3, P7: 1). The order from Period 2 (174 units) is now 7 periods old and is confirmed lost, so it must be subtracted from pipeline inventory calculations. Adjusted in-transit = 359 - 174 = 185 units. Demand remains relatively stable, with a recent mean (P4-P8) of 140.8 units. Using L=2 (promised) as an average is reasonable given the alternating 1 and 3 pattern. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand forecasting to capture the current level (approx 140/period), resulting in mu_hat \u2248 420. Setting L=2 explicitly compensates for the intermittent 3-period lead times and lost stock risk while maintaining a high service level due to the $19 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Lost Shipment confirmed: Period 2 order (174 units) never arrived (7 periods elapsed). Lead time pattern alternates between 1 and 3 periods (average 2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2325.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 9 periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has been stable with a mean of approximately 137.7 units per period and a standard deviation of 17.6. However, the supply chain is highly unstable. We have confirmed a lost shipment (Period 2 order) and a bifurcated lead time pattern where orders arrive in either 1 or 3 periods (average is 2, but variance is high). Currently, On-hand is 31 and In-transit is 346 (the 172 units ordered in Period 6 are still pending and now at lead_time=4, suggesting another potential loss or severe delay). To prevent stockouts given the high supply variability, I will use recent_N (N=9) for demand to capture the stable mean, and explicit lead-time (L=2) to maintain the base stock calculation while acknowledging the high risk of late or lost arrivals. The OR backend will calculate a base_stock that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1), helping to buffer against the seen volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply Chain High Volatility: Lead times alternate between 1 and 3 periods; Period 2 order (174 units) confirmed lost; Period 6 order (172 units) is now overdue (4 periods elapsed), indicating high risk of stockout if pipeline isn't monitored closely.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11 with 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout in Period 10. The pipeline inventory is 446 units, which includes orders from Period 6 (172 units), Period 10 (100 units), and likely some from previous periods identified as in-transit. Based on historical data, the actual lead time exhibits a bi-modal pattern (1 period or 3 periods), making the average 2 periods but with high variance. The order from Period 6 (172 units) is now 5 periods old, significantly exceeding the max observed lead time of 3, strongly suggesting it is lost, similar to the confirmed lost order from Period 2. The pipeline is therefore likely inflated by 172 units. To prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs, I am setting L to 2 (promised/average) and using a recent demand window (last 5 periods) to forecast demand. The mean demand over 10 periods is ~138.4 units. Period 10 demand was 106. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu and sigma to capture current consumption rates and volatility more accurately than the full history.

Carry-over insight: Second shipment loss confirmed: Period 6 order (172 units) has failed to arrive after 5 periods (max observed lead time 3). This validates a pattern of unreliable supply where ~20% of orders are lost.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is highly unstable, with a confirmed 18-20% loss rate (orders from Period 2 and Period 6 never arrived). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in Periods 6, 7, 10, and 11. Pipeline inventory (475 units) consists of orders from P10 (100 units, L=2 expected), P11 (29 units, L=1/3 expected), and a legacy deficit from lost shipments. Demand remains stable around a mean of 137.9 units. The lead time alternates between 1 and 3 periods for successful deliveries. To combat the stockout and the risk of further lost shipments, I am setting L=2 (promised/mean), but I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate base stock as (L+1)*mean + safety stock. Mean demand is ~140. Given the high loss rate, I need to inflate mu_hat to trigger an order that covers the current 0 on-hand state while accounting for the fact that the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (some of which may be lost). I'm setting mu_hat = 600 to ensure the base stock is high enough to generate a replenishment order today, effectively 're-ordering' for the lost capacity of P6 (172 units).

Carry-over insight: Persistent supply instability: ~20% of orders are lost (P2 and P6); remaining orders arrive with L=1 or L=3 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is highly unstable, with a ~20% loss rate (confirmed losses for orders from Periods 2 and 6) and lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is in a stockout state despite 557 units being in-transit. The demand mean remains stable (~138 units/period). Given the high loss risk and lead time variance, I must set the lead time parameter to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the longest likely delay. I will use the last 5 demand samples to calculate mu_hat to capture recent variability while ensuring the pipeline inventory target is high enough to buffer against the demonstrated supply unreliability.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout (On-hand: 0) following a Period 13 demand of 73 units. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with two confirmed lost orders (P2, P6). The lead time history shows high variance, alternating between 1, 2, and 3 periods (Average ~2). Current pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 599 units, consisting of orders from P11, P12, and P13. Given the P11 order (29 units) is now at Period 3 post-order (the maximum observed lead time), there is a risk it may also be lost. However, the backend OR logic will naturally order more if we assume a longer lead time 'L' and set a high service level target (implied by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio). I am setting L=2 (the average) and using the last 8 samples for demand estimation, as demand has remained relatively stable (mean ~135) despite the logic-driven fluctuations in ordering. This configuration allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock to account for the current pipeline and the high reliability required given the lost shipments.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 570 in-transit. Historically, shipments from P2 and P6 were lost (confirmed in Carry-over insights). Subsequent arrivals show a highly volatile lead time distribution (1, 2, or 3 periods). P11 arrived on P14 (L=3), P10 arrived on P12 (L=2), while P12 and P13 have not yet arrived. This confirms the average lead time remains approximately 2 periods but with a high risk of loss (approx 2/13 ~ 15%). Current demand shifted from high levels (avg ~145 in P1-P11) to lower levels (avg ~83 in P13-P14). I will use N=5 for demand to balance this recent drop with the earlier historical mean, ensuring the system doesn't under-order if the drop is temporary. For lead time, I'll set L=2 (explicit) to align with persistent supply volatility and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the 1+L period coverage requirement.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility continues: P11 arrived with L=3 in P14. Demand drop observed in P13-P14 (avg 83 vs historical 135), requiring monitoring for a sustained regime shift.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is unstable, with approximately 20% of orders being lost (P2 and P6) and lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.1). Currently, the Period 13 order (42 units) is overdue (3 periods elapsed), raising the probability it is lost or delayed. Demand in the most recent periods (P13-P15) has been volatile, with a significant dip (73, 93) followed by a return to historical levels (146). Given the mix of supply loss and demand fluctuations, I will use a conservative forecast for lead time (L=3) to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and potential losses. For demand, I will use a recent_N window (N=5) to capture the current mean while allowing for the recent variability. This strategy aims to build a safety buffer to mitigate the 20% order loss rate and the unreliability of the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: P13-P15 showed (73, 93, 146), indicating that the dip observed in P13-P14 was not a sustained regime shift but rather high variance. Reliability remains low: Period 2, Period 6, and potentially Period 13 orders failed to arrive within promised windows.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1482.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are back to zero on-hand inventory. The pattern of supply instability is severe: shipments from Period 2 and Period 6 were lost, and we are monitoring Period 13's arrival (it arrived in P16, L=3). Currently, we have 530 units in-transit (orders from P16-184 units, and potentially others). Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, making the 'promised' 2-period lead time an unreliable metric. Since the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy and doesn't account for lost shipments, I must artificially inflate the lead time parameter 'L' to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. Historical mean demand remains around 130-135 units. I will set L to 3 (the observed maximum) to force a higher base stock and use recent_N (N=10) for demand and volatility to capture the recent high variance (samples: 170, 133, 124, 106, 167, 126, 73, 93, 146, 109).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 13 order arrived in P16 (L=3). Shipping reliability remains at ~80% (3 losses: P2, P6, and likely more if pipeline does not resolve). Lead time distribution: {1, 2, 3, lost}.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that demand has stabilized around the long-term mean after a brief period of high volatility, with the most recent three periods averaging 125 units (P15-P17). Total demand mean across all 17 periods is approximately 130. Pipeline inventory (417) consists of orders from P17 (71 units) and much older orders that are highly likely lost or severely delayed (historical losses confirmed in P2 and P6). Given the confirmed lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods, average 2.1) and a roughly 20% loss rate, my strategy is to maintain a robust base stock using an explicit Lead Time (L=3) to account for the upper end of the delivery window and prevent stockouts. I am using mu_hat based on the last 10 periods to capture recent demand trends while filtering out earlier noise, and sigma_hat with N=10 to manage risk against the observed high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1216.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unstable with a mix of lead times (1-3 periods) and confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline (503 units) includes P17 (71 units, L=2 expected) and P18 (86 units, L=2 expected), plus older shipments. Period 18 saw demand of 130, and the historical mean is roughly 131. My goal is to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. I will set L to 3 to account for the maximum observed lead time, given the frequent stockouts and the 0 on-hand state. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5 samples (146, 109, 120, 130, and initial 130 seed) yield an average of 127. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this stabilization. For variability (sigma_hat), I will use the default (all historical samples) to ensure the safety stock is robust against the high variance and erratic supply arrivals observed thus far. The OR backend will compute the order by subtracting the in-transit units (503) from the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply reliability remains at roughly 80% (P2, P6 lost). Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods without a discernible trend, necessitating a conservative L estimate for safety. Demand mean is stable near 130 despite short-term fluctuations.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the regular chips SKU remains relatively stable around a mean of 130 per period, although recent volatility is present. The supply chain continues to show significant instability with confirmed order losses (Periods 2, 6) and a highly variable lead time ranging from 1 to 3 periods. The current in-transit pipeline of 558 units includes orders from Period 17 (71 units), Period 18 (86 units), and Period 19 (55 units), most of which are still within the observed 3-period lead time window. However, the system's pipeline inventory also includes older 'lost' units (e.g., Period 2 and 6) which the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic will incorrectly count as forthcoming stock unless adjusted. I will use L=3 to ensure the inventory target covers the maximum observed lead time, which also increases the base stock to compensate for the roughly 20% shipment loss rate. I will set mu_hat using recent_10 to capture the current demand mean (~125) and use recent_10 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened variance seen in the last 10 periods (stdev ~28).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Two shipments (Period 18: 86 units and Period 19: 55 units) are currently expected based on the variable lead time (L=1 to 3), but neither arrived by Period 20's conclusion. Demand remains relatively stable with an average around 130 units. However, supply reliability is the primary concern, with ~20% of orders (P2, P6) confirmed lost and lead times frequently hitting 3 periods. To account for this volatility and the current stock-out, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I will use the mean of the last 10 samples (excluding the stock-out periods' demand which is still recorded) to capture recent demand levels (~122 units per period). Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a standard safety buffer given the high lead time variance.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain remains unstable: lead times are 1, 2, or 3 periods with roughly 20% total loss rate. Stock-outs occurred in P18-P20 due to arrival delays.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable with a confirmed loss rate of approximately 20% (orders from Period 2 and Period 6 never arrived) and high lead time volatility (1 to 3 periods). As of Period 22, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and has experienced stockouts for the last four periods (P18-P21) because the orders placed in Periods 17, 18, 19, and 20 haven't arrived yet. The 'In-transit' quantity of 559 units accounts for these pending orders (71 from P17, 86 from P18, 55 from P19, 1 from P20, and 184 were ordered in P16 which arrived in P17). Wait\u2014checking history: P17 order (71), P18 order (86), P19 order (55), P20 order (1), P21 order (0). Also, P16 (184) arrived in P17. Looking at 'In-transit: 559', this likely includes P17, P18, P19, P20 plus historical 'lost' units (P2: 174, P6: 172) which sum up: 174+172+71+86+55+1+0 = 559. This confirms P2 and P6 items are permanently lost but still in the internal 'in-transit' calculation. To force the OR backend to place an order despite these 'phantom' units, I will set L to 3 (the observed maximum) to increase the base stock and use a conservative demand forecast. The demand mean is stable around 130 per period. I'll use recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent stable demand levels while accounting for volatility.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory (559) includes 346 units from lost orders (P2: 174, P6: 172) that will never arrive. The actual pipeline inventory is 213 units (P17-P20).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a stock-out state with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical demand is stable with a mean of approximately 130 units. The critical issue is supply chain instability: Period 2 and Period 6 orders (346 units combined) are confirmed lost and remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 559. The actual effective pipeline is only 213 units (orders from P17-P20). Since none of these arrived in P21 or P22, they are likely following the L=3 pattern or are potentially lost. To recover from the stock-out and account for the ~20% loss rate and 1-3 period lead time, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers enough demand to buffer against delays. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~131 per period) and setting sigma_hat explicitly slightly higher than historical standard deviation to handle the high variance caused by both demand and supply uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged stock-out (P18-P22) due to a cluster of delayed or lost shipments. Total ghost inventory in transit is 346 units (P2, P6). Effective pipeline consists of 213 units from P17-P20, none of which have arrived by P23.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a prolonged stock-out (Period 18-23) due to a cluster of delayed/lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P17 (71), P18 (86), and P19 (55) are still in-transit and overdue based on the promised lead time of 2 (3-4 periods have elapsed). P2 and P6 (total 346 units) are confirmed lost ghost inventory. The P20 order of 1 unit arrived in P23 (L=3), showing the supply chain is still functioning but highly unreliable. Demand remains stable with a mean around 130 despite the stock-outs limiting sales data. To recover and build safety stock against the ~20% loss rate and L=3 delays, I am setting L=3 to account for the current reality of the supply chain. I'll use a recent 10-period window for demand to capture recent variance while maintaining the target service level. I must ignore the 346 lost units in the pipeline calculation; however, the OR backend automatically subtracts 'in-transit' from the 'base_stock'. To force an order despite the 558 units in-transit (where only 212 are real), I will set an 'explicit' mu_hat that covers both the projected demand for L+1 periods and compensates for the 346 ghost units that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Significant 'ghost' inventory persists. In-transit total (558) includes 346 units from P2 and P6 that are confirmed lost. Reliable pipeline is only 212 units (P17, P18, P19). Stock-outs since P18 underscore the need to over-order to compensate for the ~20% loss rate.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a prolonged stock-out (Period 18 to Period 24), primarily due to unreliable supply (approximately 20% loss rate) and lead time volatility (1 to 3 periods). The in-transit inventory of 805 units is heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory': specifically, Period 2 (174 units) and Period 6 (172 units) are confirmed lost. Additionally, orders from Periods 17 (71 units), 18 (86 units), and 19 (55 units) are now overdue (5+ periods elapsed), suggesting they may also be lost or severely delayed. To combat this, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. Demand has stabilised around 110-120 units recently; I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat (N=10 represents the last 10 samples from P15-P24) to capture this moderate mean while maintaining high safety stock via a calculated sigma_hat. The backend OR will subtract the pipeline inventory from the base stock; by setting L=3, we increase the target to account for the risk that current 'in-transit' units will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: High probability of loss for P17, P18, and P19 orders (all >5 periods since order). Ghost inventory now likely totals 573 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Real pipeline inventory is approximately 232 units (from P20 onwards, excluding the 1 unit that arrived in P23).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised with significant lost shipments and high 'ghost' inventory. Orders from Period 2 (174), Period 6 (172), Period 17 (71), Period 18 (86), and Period 19 (55) are now beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods and are considered lost, totaling 558 units of ghost inventory. The reported in-transit of 805 units minus this ghost inventory leaves an effective pipeline of only 247 units (from Period 24). On-hand inventory is 0, and the system has been in a stock-out state for 8 of the last 9 periods. Average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 108 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the massive (but phantom) in-transit count, I must increase the base stock level significantly. Setting mu_hat to an explicit value that reflects the need to cover both current demand and the missing pipeline, while setting L to an explicit 3 (the max observed lead time) to ensure the backend calculates a sufficient target level.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments confirmed for P17, P18, P19 (all >5 periods since order). Ghost inventory now totals 558 units. Reliable pipeline inventory is only 247 units (from P24). Severe supply chain disruption remains the primary constraint.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe disruption with a confirmed loss rate of approximately 50-60% for recent orders. Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 558 units) are confirmed 'ghost' inventory as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods significantly. The current in-transit visibility of 893 units is misleading; the effective pipeline is only 335 units (P24: 247, P26: 88). We have been out of stock since P18 (except for 1 unit in P23). Demand remains relatively stable with a slight downward trend in the last few periods (avg ~96 in P23-P26 vs historical ~130). To restore on-hand inventory while accounting for the high loss rate, I am setting an explicit lead time of 3 to reflect the slowest successful delivery and an explicit mu_hat that targets a higher base stock level to compensate for the significant risk of future losses. Although the OR backend uses a capped policy, providing a high mu_hat and sigma_hat will ensure the calculated base stock is sufficient to trigger meaningful replenishment orders despite the large (but mostly fake) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: ~50-60% order loss rate observed. Ghost inventory (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) totals 558 units. Effective pipeline: 335 units. Order sizes must explicitly over-compensate for recurring shipment failures.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of near-collapse with a confirmed loss rate of approximately 50-60%. Total in-transit inventory is 897 units, but 558 units (from Period 2, 6, 17, 18, 19) are confirmed ghost inventory and will never arrive. The effective pipeline inventory is only 339 units (Period 24, 26, 27). There has been a continuous stock-out since Period 18 (interrupted only by a 1-unit arrival). Demand has softened slightly but remains relatively stable around a mean of 115-120 in the recent regime. To address the massive loss rate and clear the recurring stock-outs, I am set L to 5 (reflecting the duration after which we consider an order lost) and using an explicit mu_hat of 1200. This highly aggressive mu_hat is intended to force the OR backend's capped policy to place large orders, manually compensating for the 558 'ghost units' the backend incorrectly believes are coming. This ensures a large enough order is placed to potentially bridge the inventory gap despite the likelihood of future shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply chain loss rate remains at ~55% with 558 units of 'ghost inventory' (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Demand mean shifted slightly downwards to ~110-120 units over the last 10 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show severe instability with a high loss rate (~55%). Total 'In-transit' inventory is 1031 units, but 558 units are confirmed 'ghost inventory' from periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19 (all >9 periods past order date). Furthermore, the orders from P24 (247 units) and P27 (4 units) are now overdue (P24 is L=4, exceeding max observed L=3). The arrival of the P26 order (88 units) in P28 with L=2 is a positive sign, but it was immediately exhausted by demand. Demand has stabilized at a slightly lower mean of ~115 units over the last 10 periods (109, 104, 83, 105, 98, 94, 106, 88; mean ~98 excluding stock-outs). I will set L to 5 explicitly to account for the frequent delays and losses, which forces the OR backend to look for a higher base stock. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the recent lower demand trend while maintaining a buffer for high variance. Sigma_hat is set to explicit (40) to maintain a higher safety stock given the extreme delivery uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 24 (247 units) and Period 27 (4 units) are now overdue, increasing the suspected loss rate or confirming severe lead time extensions beyond 3 periods. Ghost inventory remains at least 558 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised with an estimated 50-60% loss rate and significant 'ghost inventory'. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 1027) includes 558 units confirmed lost (Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19). Excluding these, the effective pipeline is 469 units (Periods 24, 26, 28). Period 24 (247 units) is now overdue (lead time > 5 periods), making it highly likely to be lost, further reducing the effective pipeline to 222 units (from Period 28). Demand has softened to a mean of approximately 101 over the last 10 periods (N=10). Because the OR backend's inventory balancing assumes all 1027 in-transit units will arrive, it will under-order. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat explicitly high to force an order that covers the effective lead time and compensates for probable losses, while setting L to 3 to reflect the maximum observed successful lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 24 order (247 units) is now overdue (5 periods elapsed), likely lost, bringing suspected total ghost inventory to 805 units. Significant supply chain failure persists; reliability of the pipeline is extremely low (~40%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1718.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted with a confirmed loss rate of approximately 50-60%. Currently, 805 units are reported as 'In-transit', but the vast majority of this is 'ghost inventory' from lost orders: P2 (174), P6 (172), P17 (71), P18 (86), P19 (55), and now P24 (247) which is 6 periods overdue. Subtracting these 805 units (174+172+71+86+55+247=805), the actual reliable pipeline is 0. The system's OR backend will subtract the 805 units of 'In-transit' from the base stock calculation, leading to an order of zero unless I artificially inflate mu_hat or sigma_hat. However, given the current on-hand inventory of 125 units and a recent demand mean of ~90-100 units, we have enough for one period. To force the OR backend to place a substantial order despite the 'ghost' pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using an explicit value. I estimate demand at 110 units/period. For a lead time of 2, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods, which is 330 units. Adding a significant safety buffer to account for the ~55% loss rate and to bypass the 805-unit pipeline deduction, I am setting mu_hat to 1250. This 'over-declaration' is a necessary tactical adjustment to ensure the backend generates a purchase order to replace lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 24 order (247 units) is lost (6 periods elapsed). Total 'ghost inventory' currently in system-reported in-transit is 805 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24). Real pipeline is zero.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit severe instability, with a confirmed loss rate exceeding 50%. In Period 31, we confirmed the loss of the Period 24 order (247 units) as 6 periods have elapsed. The 'ghost inventory' currently in transit consists of orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, and P24, totaling 805 units. These units will not arrive and must be excluded from pipeline considerations. The adjusted pipeline inventory is the P31 order of 360 units + the 62 units on-hand. Reliable lead times for successful deliveries range between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting a conservative L=3. Demand has slowed recently, with the last 5 periods (P27-P31) averaging 84.2 units, significantly lower than the historical average of ~130. I will adopt a 10-period window (N=10) for mu_hat (avg ~90) to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough stock to avoid stockouts during lead time volatility. Sigma is set based on recent performance to account for this higher volatility environment.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 24 order (247 units) is lost. Total ghost inventory now at 805 units. Demand regime has stabilized at a lower mean of ~85-95 units over the last 10 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $718.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted with a confirmed loss rate of approximately 50-60%. Of the 805 units reported in-transit, all 805 are confirmed or highly likely 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, and now P24). Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero. The replenishment strategy must ignore these ghost units to trigger new orders. Demand has recently stabilized at a lower mean (~85-95 units) over the last 10 periods, down from the historical ~130. On-hand inventory is currently 365, which provides a temporary buffer for about 4 periods. Since the effective pipeline is empty and lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, I set L=3 (explicit) to account for the longest observable successful lead time and use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time without being misled by ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed shift to lower mean: Periods 23-32 average ~87 units compared to early game average of ~135. Ghost inventory has reached 805 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24), meaning the system's 'In-transit' metric is entirely unreliable for pipeline calculations.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable with a confirmed loss rate of approximately 50-60%. Currently, 805 units in the 'In-transit' metric are 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost: P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24). The real pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has shifted to a lower regime; the average demand over the last 11 periods (P23-P33) is approximately 86 units per period, compared to the early game average of 135. Current on-hand inventory is 285, which at the new demand mean provides roughly 3.3 periods of coverage. I will set mu_hat to reflect this lower demand regime (recent_N=11) to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer against the high shipment loss rate. I will use L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longest successful lead time observed, effectively increasing safety stock to mitigate the frequent shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'ghost inventory' totals 805 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24), rendering the system's pipeline metric useless. Current real pipeline is 0. Demand mean has stabilized at ~86 units (P23-P33).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a confirmed loss rate of approximately 50-60%. Currently, out of the 805 units reported as 'In-transit', all 805 units (from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, and now P24) are considered 'ghost inventory' because they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a significant margin. Therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is 205 units. Demand has shifted to a lower regime, averaging approximately 86 units over the last 12 periods (P23-P34). To maintain coverage over the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3), and accounting for the high risk of shipment loss, I will set mu_hat based on this recent lower demand average (~258 units for 3 periods). Since the current on-hand (205) is below the required base stock for this regime, the OR backend should trigger an order. I am using 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the stabilized lower demand mean and variance while ignoring the earlier high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 805 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24); system 'In-transit' metric is 100% unreliable. Real pipeline is 0. Demand regime mean has stabilized at ~86 units (P23-P34).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to present extreme volatility with a long-term loss rate estimated at ~50%. Historical ghost inventory (orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24) totals 805 units, which matches the system's 'In-transit' metric, confirming the real pipeline is currently zero. Demand has clearly shifted from a historical mean of ~135 to a lower, more stable regime around 86 units (P23-P35 average). With on-hand inventory at 111 units and a reliable mean demand of ~86, the current stock covers slightly more than one period. Given the observed lead times for successful deliveries (1, 2, or 3 periods) and the high probability of order loss, I am setting L to 2 (promised) to maintain a standard base-stock calculation but will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the new demand regime. I am targeting a base stock level that covers roughly 3 periods of demand to provide a buffer against the frequent shipment failures, using the recent mean of 86. This results in a mu_hat of 258 (3 * 86). Using an explicit sigma_hat of 50 accounts for the high variance in both demand and supply reliability without over-penalizing for the ghost inventory in the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1489.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is highly unstable with a confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 805 units (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, and P24) which the system counts as in-transit but will never arrive. The real pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has shifted from an early mean of ~135 to a significantly lower mean of ~86 units over the last 14 periods (P23-P36). Current on-hand inventory is 31 units. To avoid a stock-out given the high loss rate (~50-60%) and the current low on-hand balance, I must place an order. Since the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' and it incorrectly thinks pipeline is 805, I must use 'explicit' parameters to force an order. I will set mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L=2 + review 1) at the current demand rate (~86 * 3 = 258) and set L to a value that offsets the ghost inventory or use explicit values to bypass the backend's faulty pipeline calculation. I will choose an explicit mu_hat that, when combined with the backend's logic, yields a base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the 805 ghost units. Specifically, setting mu_hat to 1000 and sigma_hat to 100 ensures the base_stock exceeds 805, allowing the system to actually place an order to replenish the 31 units on hand.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from extreme unreliability, though recent performance showed some orders (P26, P27, P28, P31) arriving successfully with lead times of 1-2 periods. The total 'ghost inventory' (orders likely lost but still in the system's in-transit metric) has reached 805 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24). Consequently, the actual pipeline inventory is much lower than the reported 1134 units: only the P37 order of 329 units is currently viable. Demand has shifted to a lower regime; over the last 15 periods (P23-P37), the mean is approximately 87 units/period. My strategy is to maintain a higher service level by using a slightly higher mu_hat to buffer against the ~50% shipment loss rate, while accounting for the fact that the backend's pipeline calculation is inflated by 'ghost' units. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15, I capture the current demand regime. Setting L to 2 reflects the promised/average arrival time for orders that actually make it through.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory (lost orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24) remains at 805 units, significantly inflating the system's pipeline metric. Real pipeline is only the P37 order (329 units). Demand regime is stable at ~87 units/period.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a reported in-transit of 1134 units. However, based on the historical tracking of lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24), we estimate that 805 of these units are 'ghost inventory' that will never arrive. This makes the system's pipeline metric highly unreliable. The actual reliable pipeline is 329 units ordered in Period 37, which hasn't arrived yet (expected lead time 1-3 periods). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 87 units per period over the last ~15 periods. To prevent prolonged stock-outs seen previously (P18-P23), we need to maintain a base stock that covers the expected lead time (2-3 periods) plus current demand. Since the OR backend uses the reported 1134 units for its pipeline inventory calculation, it will likely order 0 unless we adjust parameters. To force an order and maintain stock, I will set an explicit mu_hat that reflects the need for replenishment despite the inflated in-transit figure. However, given the massive 'ghost' pipeline, adding more orders now might lead to a huge holding cost if the 'real' pipeline (329 units) and new orders arrive simultaneously. I will use 'explicit' L=3 to account for the volatile supply chain and an 'explicit' mu_hat that targets a base stock level sufficient to cover demand while the OR engine subtracts the (unreliable) pipeline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we face a critical supply chain and inventory accounting challenge. The system reports 1134 units in-transit. Based on historical data, this is largely composed of 'ghost inventory' (orders that are almost certainly lost). Specifically: P2(174), P6(172), P17(71), P18(86), P19(55), P24(247). These sum to 805 units. Subtracting these from 1134 leaves 329 units, which corresponds exactly to the order placed in Period 37. This P37 order is now in its 3rd period of lead time (meeting the observed max actual lead time). We have 0 on-hand inventory and have faced stockouts in P38-P39. The demand regime has shifted to a lower mean; over the last 15 periods (since P25), the average demand is approximately 89.6 units per period. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture this lower demand mean (~90 units/period). Given the 60%+ loss rate and high volatility, I will set L to 3 (the max observed functional lead time) to ensure the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to trigger an order today, effectively 'ordering over' the expected losses in the pipeline. This approach acknowledges that the P37 order might arrive, but we cannot risk further stockouts given the observed unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost inventory' totals 805 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24). The only viable pipeline inventory as of P40 is the P37 order (329 units). Demand regime mean remains stable at ~90 units (last 15 periods).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face extreme disruption with a high order loss rate. Current 'In-transit' inventory of 1134 units is highly misleading. It includes 805 units of 'ghost inventory' from confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24). The orders from P31 (360) and P37 (329) have resolved or are pending. Specifically, P31 arrived in P32, meaning it is no longer in transit. The current real pipeline consists of the P37 order (329 units), which is now at Period 4 (3 periods elapsed), and any subsequent orders. However, since the system's in-transit metric (1134) minus ghost (805) equals 329, we confirm the P37 order is the ONLY real inventory in transit. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean (~89 units over the last 15 periods). With 0 on-hand inventory and the P37 order overdue relative to the promised lead time of 2, there is a massive risk of stock-out. I will set L to 3 to reflect the frequent delays and use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the stabilized lower mean. The OR backend will see the massive In-transit number and potentially order 0; however, since I cannot manually subtract ghost inventory from the system's calculation, I must use parameters that maximize the base_stock calculation to trigger an order or rely on the pipeline to resolve.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be the primary challenge, with a confirmed loss rate of approximately 50-60%. Currently, out of the system-reported 1134 units in-transit, 805 units are 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24). The real pipeline inventory as of Period 42 consists of only the units ordered in P37 (329 units), which are now overdue (L=5+). History shows lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods for successful deliveries, but recent orders are increasingly failing. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 88 units/period over the last 15 periods (approx. P26-P41). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the real pipeline is stalled, I must set parameters to trigger a significant order that accounts for the high probability of shipment loss. I will use 'explicit' values to bypass the backend's standard calculations which would be misled by the 805 units of ghost inventory. I set L=5 to reflect the current delay of the P37 order and adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the lower demand regime and high uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Real pipeline inventory is stalled; the Period 37 order (329 units) has reached L=5 without arriving. Total ghost inventory remains 805 units. Demand regime mean is stable at ~88 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be the primary concern. Total reported 'In-transit' is 1134 units. Based on historical analysis, the 'ghost inventory' (orders likely lost) includes: P2 (174), P6 (172), P17 (71), P18 (86), P19 (55), and P24 (247). This totals 805 units. Subtracting these from 1134 leaves 329 units, which matches the order placed in Period 37. This P37 order is now at L=5 (ordered P37, currently P42 conclude/P43 decision), exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. This indicates P37 is also at high risk of being lost or severely delayed. On-hand inventory is 0 for the 6th consecutive period. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean; for the last 20 periods (P23-P42), the average is 86.85 units. Given the ~60% shipment loss rate and current stock-out, I must place a significant order to offset both the zero reliable pipeline and the high probability of future order failure. I will use a recent_N of 20 for demand parameters to reflect the stabilized lower mean (~87 per period) and set an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the frequent delays, while ensuring the OR backend targets enough stock for 4 periods (L+1) of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Shipment loss/delay for Period 37 (329 units) suspected (L=5 elapsed). 'Ghost inventory' (unreliable pipeline) remains at 805 units, plus increasing probability that P37 is also lost. Demand mean remains stable at ~87 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of severe failure. Current in-transit inventory is 1134, but 'ghost' inventory from confirmed or highly probable lost orders totals 1134 units (P2: 174, P6: 172, P17: 71, P18: 86, P19: 55, P24: 247, P37: 329). Specifically, the P37 order of 329 units has now reached L=7 without arrival, far exceeding the historical maximum lead time of 3 for successful deliveries; it is now classified as lost. On-hand inventory is 0, and the real pipeline is currently 0. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 87 units (calculated from P23-P43). To restore service, I must place an order that treats the entire system-reported pipeline as zero and targets a base stock covering the stabilized demand mean plus a safety buffer for the high lead-time variance. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and 'explicit' for L to account for the unreliability of the promise.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Shipment loss for Period 37 (329 units) is confirmed (7 periods elapsed, exceeding max viable L=3). Total ghost inventory is now 1134 units. Real pipeline is 0. Reliable service requires assuming a ~60% loss rate on all orders.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of near-collapse with a confirmed loss rate of ~60%. 'Ghost inventory' (orders that will never arrive) has reached 1134 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and now P37). The system's 'In-transit' metric of 1134 units is entirely composed of these lost orders, meaning the real pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is also zero, leading to a sustained stock-out. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the average demand over the last 15 periods (P30-P44) is approximately 83 units. To restore service in the final periods of the game despite the high loss rate, I must set the OR parameters to ignore the 'ghost' pipeline and force a large order. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values that significantly exceed current demand and account for the 60% failure rate, I aim to trigger the OR backend to place an order that overcomes the pipeline inflation and high risk of non-delivery.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Ghost inventory increased to 1134 units with the confirmed loss of Period 37 order (L=7 elapsed). Total pipeline reliability is effectively 0% for existing in-transit units. Demand mean is stable at ~83 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised with a confirmed shipment loss rate exceeding 50%. As of Period 46, current on-hand inventory is 0. The system-reported In-transit inventory of 1824 units is highly misleading due to 'ghost inventory' from confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and now P37). Total ghost units are 1134 (174+172+71+86+55+247+329). Subtracting this from 1824 leaves a real pipeline of 690 units (the order placed in P45). Given the persistent pattern where only ~40% of orders actually arrive, I must significantly over-order to ensure any product reaches the shelf. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 85 units per period over the last 20 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on this lower demand mean (N=20) but Use L=explicit with a high value or over-compensate through mu_hat to trigger larger orders that account for the high loss probability. I will use 'explicit' for L to reflect the severe arrival delays/losses and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current lower volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Real pipeline is 690 units (P45 order). Ghost inventory (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P37) is 1134 units. Demand mean is stable at 85 units. Order arrival reliability remains at ~40%.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised with a long-term loss rate exceeding 50%. Confirmed lost orders (ghost inventory) include P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and now P37, totaling 1134 units. These units inflate the system's 'In-transit' metric (1824 units), making it entirely unreliable. The true actionable pipeline is only the order from Period 45 (690 units), which has not yet arrived. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the game ends at Period 50. Given the lead time is usually between 1-3 periods, the P45 order is expected to arrive between P46 and P48. To maximize reward while accounting for the high loss rate (~60%), I will maintain a high demand forecast. Demand mean has stabilized at a lower level of ~85 units (P23-P46). However, because the backend bases the order on 'In-transit' (1824) and we only have 690 'real' units, the OR engine will likely order 0 units unless mu_hat is set extremely high to 'push' through the ghost inventory barrier. Since we only have 3 periods left (48, 49, 50), any order placed now (P47) must arrive by P50 (L <= 3). I will use explicit values to force a high base stock to compensate for the 1134 units of ghost inventory and ensure the OR engine recognizes the need for stock before the game concludes.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Confirmed loss of P37 order (329 units); total ghost inventory now at 1134 units. True pipeline consists only of P45 (690 units).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is facing a severe supply chain crisis. The system-reported 'In-transit' of 1824 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P37), totaling 1134 units. The only reliable pipeline is the P45 order of 690 units, which is currently at L=3. Based on history, orders that don't arrive by L=3 have a ~60% chance of being lost. Demand has also shifted significantly downward, averaging ~84 units over the last 20 periods, with a further drop to ~46 units in the last 3 periods (likely due to stockout-induced demand erosion). I am setting L=3 to account for the upper end of successful deliveries. I choose 'recent_N' with N=15 for mu_hat to capture the stabilized lower demand regime (approx 85 units/period) while ignoring the most recent 3-period drop which may be an outlier. I use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the high demand volatility observed during this regime. The OR backend will see a high pipeline (1824 units) and may not order; however, the cap mechanism and the massive disparity between ghost inventory and real needs require these aggressive baseline parameters.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of P45 order if it does not arrive by Period 49 (L=4). Ghost inventory remains 1134 units. Demand regime mean is ~84 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49. The demand mean has stabilized at approximately 85-90 units over the long term, though recent periods (P45-P48) show a slight dip (avg ~52). The supply chain is the primary challenge: the 'In-transit' figure of 1824 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory' (orders that are confirmed or likely lost). Specifically, P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P37 are confirmed lost (totaling 1134 units). The order from P45 (690 units) is now at L=4. Given that the maximum successful lead time observed is 3 periods, P45 is highly likely lost as well. If P45 is lost, the 'real' pipeline is 0 and total ghost inventory reaches 1824 units, matching the system's in-transit total. To ensure product availability for the final period (P50), we must place a large order now to compensate for the ~60% loss rate and the current zero on-hand inventory. I am setting L=3 to account for the longest successful lead time, and using a recent_N of 15 for mu_hat (approx 85/period) to reflect the stabilized demand regime, while acknowledging the high risk of non-arrival.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of P45 order (690 units) in Period 49 (L=4 reached with no arrival); total ghost inventory now matches system in-transit at 1824 units. Real pipeline is zero. Supply reliability is approximately 40%.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the supply chain remains in a state of near-total collapse. The total system 'In-transit' of 1824 units is comprised entirely of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19, 24, 37, and 45. These 'ghost units' will never arrive, but they prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders because the backend's internal 'pipeline inventory' calculation sees 1824 units available. To force the backend to place an order, I must set the lead time (L) to an 'explicit' high value and the demand mean (mu_hat) to an 'explicit' very high value that exceeds the ghost inventory plus desired safety stock. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~85 units (avg of last 15 periods), but the primary goal is bypassing the 1824-unit inventory inflation. I will set mu_hat to 2200 to ensure the backend generates a significant order despite the 1824 units in-transit, effectively resetting the real pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Shipment loss for Period 45 (690 units) confirmed; total ghost inventory (unreliable pipeline) now equals 1824 units. Total pipeline reliability for existing units is 0%. Demand mean remains stable at ~85 units.
