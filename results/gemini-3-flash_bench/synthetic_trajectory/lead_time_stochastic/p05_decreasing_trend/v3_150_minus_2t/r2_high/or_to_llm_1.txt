Historical demand data shows a mean of approximately 136 units (130, 147, 128, 116, 161) with a standard deviation of roughly 17. The OR algorithm recommends ordering 166 units based on a base-stock policy that considers total demand over the review period (1) plus lead time (2), totaling 3 periods. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, we need to establish a pipeline immediately to satisfy demand starting from Period 3 (when this order arrives). The OR recommendation of 166 units is a safe starting point that accounts for demand mean and safety stock for a ~95% service level. At this early stage, there's no evidence of lead time drift or demand regime shifts, so I will follow the OR baseline to build initial inventory.",

The demand in Period 1 was 165, which is at the high end of history. The average demand is approximately 141 units per period.\n3.

In-transit is 340 units (166 from P1 + 174 from P2). These should arrive in P3 and P4 respectively. Total demand across P1 and P2 was 310 units; since on-hand was 0, these were lost sales.\n3.

OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 units because the pipeline (477) far exceeds the base-stock level calculated using the promised lead time of 2. \n4. Strategy: There is a severe stockout because no orders have arrived yet. Adding more to the pipeline is risky if the issue is a systemic lead-time shift or if the system is simply lagging. However, since the first order is already overdue, I will place a moderate order to ensure that once the pipeline starts clearing, I can maintain stock, while acknowledging that 477 units are already coming.

Strategy: OR recommends 0 units because the current pipeline of 505 units covers approximately 3.7 periods of average demand (505 / 136), which exceeds the standard base stock for a (L+1) = 3 period window.

Historically, Period 2 (174 units) and Period 6 (155 units) orders are confirmed lost (missing for 14 and 10 periods respectively). This makes 329 units of the in-transit amount non-existent. The adjusted pipeline is 809 - 329 = 480 units. These real orders are from Period 13 (160), Period 14 (160), and Period 15 (160).\n\n2. **Lead-Time Inference**: Actual lead items fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average 3). An order placed in Period 16 is expected to arrive at the end of Period 19.\n\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand over 15 periods is approximately 135 units. The OR baseline recommends 0 because it sees 809 units in transit, assuming sufficient stock for the lead time. However, using the adjusted pipeline of 480 units + 127 on-hand = 607 units total coverage. To cover (L+1) i.e., 4 periods of demand (approx 135 * 4 = 540 units), the current adjusted total (607) seems sufficient for the immediate cycle. However, since lead times can be 3 periods, we must ensure we don't stock out while waiting for those 160-unit blocks to arrive.\n\n4. **Final Strategy**: The OR recommend is 0, but it is blind to the lost 329 units. Even when subtracting them, the 480 units in transit plus 127 on-hand cover the next ~4.5 periods of demand. Placing a small order now to smooth out the arrival of the next 160-unit block is safer than ordering 0, as demand has peaks up to 170.

The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 489 units. However, consistent tracking shows that Period 2 (174 units) and Period 6 (155 units) orders are lost or indefinitely delayed (15 and 11 periods ago respectively). Therefore, the 'real' pipeline consists of only 160 units (from Period 15, ordered 3 periods ago), making the total reliable inventory (on-hand + actual pipeline) 478 units. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (Last 5 periods: 73, 93, 146, 109, 120) averages approximately 108 units. Historical average is around 130-140. Using a 3-period lead time (L=3), we need to cover demand for Period 18, 19, 20, and 21 (L+1 periods). 4. **Strategy**: Target inventory for 4 periods \u2248 135 * 4 = 540 units. Since on-hand + real pipeline is 478, we have a deficit of 62 units. The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 489.

Pipeline & Lost Orders: The 'In-transit' figure of 569 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (174 units) and Period 6 (155 units) are long overdue (17 and 13 periods respectively) and confirmed lost. Total phantom stock = 329 units.

Therefore, the adjusted reliable pipeline is 664 - 329 = 335 units. These reliable units are from Period 15 (160), Period 18 (80), and Period 19 (95). Since Period 15's order (160 units) was placed on Period 15 and we are now at Period 20, it is highly likely to arrive in the current period (P20 conclude), as 5 periods have elapsed. \n3. **Demand & Target Analysis**: Average demand is ~134 units.

Total current assets = On-hand (82) + Reliable Pipeline (335) = 417 units. \n4. **OR Baseline & Adjustment**: The OR recommends 0 units because it does not subtract the 329 phantom units from the pipeline.

However, historical performance shows significant phantom inventory from lost shipments: P2 (174), P6 (155), and P15 (160) are all confirmed lost based on extensive passage of time (20+, 15+, and 11 periods since order, respectively). Total phantom stock = 489 units. \n2. **Effective Pipeline**: Real in-transit = 904 - 489 = 415. These are the orders from P18 (80), P19 (95), P24 (120), and P25 (120). The P18 order (80 units) is now 8 periods old and P19 (95 units) is 7 periods old; given the erratic lead times (1-3 periods), these are also highly likely lost. If we discount P18 and P19, the reliable pipeline is only 240 units (from P24 and P25).\n3. **Demand & Lead-time Forecast**: Average demand is ~125-130 units. The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees 904 units in the pipeline and assumes a 2-period lead time. With a realistic mean lead time of 3 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 27, 28, 29, and 30 (4 periods).
