Initial historical demand over the first 5 periods (P1-P5 provided as samples) shows a mean of approximately 136 units (130, 147, 128, 116, 161). The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive during P3's arrival phase and be available for demand in P4 (L+1 coverage needed). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, I must order enough to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3, plus a buffer for Period 4. Forecasting demand at ~140 units per period, a 3-period coverage requirement is roughly 420 units. Adding a safety stock buffer to account for the variance seen in the history (ranging from 116 to 161), I will target an initial order to establish a pipeline.",

Period 1 demand was 149 units, which resulted in 149 lost sales because the starting inventory was 0. Since the total pipeline (On-hand 0 + In-transit 450) must cover at least (L+1) periods (Period 2, 3, and 4), and expected cumulative demand for those 3 periods is approximately 408-450 units (assuming ~136-150 per day), the current pipeline is likely sufficient to cover arrivals up until the end of Period 3. However, since the next order placed now (Period 2) would arrive in Period 4 (N+L), I need to ensure I have stock for Period 4. Adding a safety stock buffer is prudent. I will order 150 more units to maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts in Period 4, especially since Period 1 demand (149) was higher than the historical average.",

Excluding the 400 likely lost units, the 'real' pipeline is 460 units (P12, P13, P14). Calculating target inventory for L+1 (4 periods): 138 * 4 = 552 units.

Given that P12 (210 units) is now at L=3 and should arrive in the next period's arrival phase, there is no immediate risk of stockout. Adding more inventory would simply increase holding costs ($1.0/unit) which equal the profit margin ($1.0/unit), making overstocking particularly penalizing.

A review of the 'In-transit' quantity (1040 units) reveals it is mostly comprised of likely lost shipments: P2 (150), P6 (250), P18 (200), and P19 (150), totaling 750 units. The 'valid' pipeline includes orders from P25 (20), P26 (120), and P27 (150), totaling 290 units. Assuming a max lead time of 3 periods, the P25 order should arrive in P28, and P26 should arrive by P29. To satisfy demand for the current period plus the next 3 (total 4 periods at ~105/period = 420 units), I need to account for existing on-hand (25) and valid in-transit (290), leaving a requirement of 105 units. I will order 150 units to provide a safety buffer against continued shipment losses and to ensure service levels are maintained despite the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.",

Reviewing the 'In-transit' pipeline of 1160 units, we must account for historical losses. Based on Carry-Over Insights, 1090 units are confirmed or likely lost (Orders P1: 450-450=0, P2: 150, P6: 250, P18: 200, P19: 150, P25: 20, P29: 40, P33: 150, P37: 110. Total: 1070+ others identified previously). The verifiable active pipeline includes P40 (50) and P41 (40), totaling 90 units. At current demand levels (~65/period), the total position (146 on-hand + 90 active in-transit = 236) covers approximately 3.6 periods, which aligns with the observed lead time of 1-3 periods. To maintain safety stock against potential delivery variability, I will place a small order of 30 units to target a coverage level of roughly 4 periods.",

The active pipeline consists only of orders from Period 40 (50 units), Period 41 (40 units), and Period 42 (30 units). On-hand inventory is 83 units. Since we are planning for a 3-period lead time (L) plus the current period (L+1=4), the required target stock to cover the next 4 periods with 0 safety stock would be ~260 units (65 * 4). Currently, my accessible inventory (On-hand 83 + Active In-transit 120) is 203 units. To reach a safe stock level that accounts for the lower regime's variance and the end of the game (P50), I need to place an order to bridge the gap.

Expected total demand for P49-P50 is ~120-130 units. Between P45, P46, and P48, there are 300 units in the active pipeline.
