Based on historical data (P1-P5), mean demand is 136.4 units with a standard deviation of 17.6. The OR recommendation of 166 units is calculated using a base-stock policy (base_stock = (1+L)*mean + z*sqrt(1+L)*std). Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical fractile is 0.8, resulting in a safety factor z \u2248 0.84. However, with L=2, the next arrival won't happen until the start of Period 4. We need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (the current period and the lead time). Total expected demand for 3 periods is ~409 units. The OR recommendation of 166 seems to be the 'capped' value (single period mean + safety margin) rather than the full pipeline requirement. Since we have zero inventory in a 2-period lead time environment, I will scale up the order significantly to fill the pipeline and prevent stockouts in Periods 2 and 3, while noting that the OR cap is designed to prevent over-ordering which I must balance.

However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This indicates the actual lead time is likely \u2265 3, or the shipment is delayed/lost.

Current Stockouts: Periods 1-3 have resulted in 100% lost sales (demand: 165+145+135=445) because arrivals haven't occurred. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Average historical demand is approximately 144 units/period. Demand in the first three periods was 165, 145, 135. Demand is stable. 4. **OR Baseline**: OR recommends 0 units.

In-transit inventory is 343, consisting of orders from P12 (100 units) and P13/P14 (both ordered 0). Wait, P12 ordered 100 units (placed in P12, expected P14/P15). There's a discrepancy in 'In-transit: 343'. Let's re-verify: P12(100), P11(200 arrived), P10(50 arrived), P9(140 arrived). The 343 units in-transit likely represent the P12 order (100) plus historical 'lost' orders (P2: 43 and P6: 200). 343 - 43 - 200 = 100. Thus, effective in-transit is only 100 units arriving shortly. 3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been lower (P13: 73, P14: 93) compared to the long-term average (~136). However, to cover a lead time of 3 periods + 1 review period (4 total), at an average demand of ~130, I need a target inventory of ~520. 4. Strategy: Current effective inventory (OH 107 + Effective In-transit 100) = 207. Target 520 - 207 = 313. OR recommends 0 because it likely accounts for the 'lost' 243 units as valid pipeline.

The promised lead time is 2, but 3 is a safer planning horizon given the frequency of delays. 2. Pipeline Analysis: Current In-transit is 643 units. This consists of orders from P15 (200), P17 (150), and P18 (50). P15 is heavily overdue (4 periods), suggesting it might be lost. P17 (ordered 2 periods ago) and P18 (ordered 1 period ago) should arrive within the next 1-2 periods. 3. Demand Analysis: The average demand over 18 periods is approximately 132 units. Recent demand (P15-P18) has been consistent (146, 109, 120, 130). 4. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. If we assume the P15 order (200) is lost and only consider P17 and P18 (total 200 units), we are under-stocked relative to a 3-period demand window (~396 units). 5. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 because it likely counts all 643 units in-transit as arriving soon. However, with P15 likely lost and P16/P17 already having arrivals accounted for in part, we need more stock to bridge the gap and rebuild on-hand safety stock.
