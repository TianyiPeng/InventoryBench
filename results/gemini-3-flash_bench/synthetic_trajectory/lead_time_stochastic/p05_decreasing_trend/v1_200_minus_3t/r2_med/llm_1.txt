Therefore, this order must cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (the periods before the Period 2 order can arrive). Historical demand for the first three periods was 217, 207, and 170 respectively (average ~198). Given the downward trend in the first four samples (217 -> 207 -> 170 -> 131), I will use a conservative average of approximately 170 per period to avoid excessive holding costs, especially since holding cost ($1) is 25% of profit ($4).

The sudden drop to 0 demand in Period 39 is considered an outlier or a possible reporting delay, rather than a permanent shift, as the product is a staple SKU. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure (1420) is heavily inflated by 1130 units from historically lost shipments (P2, P6, P12, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30). After discounting these, the viable pipeline consists only of the Period 37 order (120 units) and Period 39 order (120 units). However, checking Period 39's 'conclude' message, the Period 37 order (ordered 3 periods ago) has not arrived yet, and the Period 38 order arrived in 1 period. This confirms the viable pipeline is P37 (120) and P39 (120). With on-hand inventory at 317, the total effective inventory (on-hand + viable pipeline) is 557 units. Given an average demand of ~110 units and a maximum lead time of 3 periods, a target inventory level of ~440 units (4 periods of demand) is sufficient. Current inventory (557) exceeds this target. Therefore, I will place a minimal order to maintain flow while allowing the excess stock to deplete toward a more efficient level.",
