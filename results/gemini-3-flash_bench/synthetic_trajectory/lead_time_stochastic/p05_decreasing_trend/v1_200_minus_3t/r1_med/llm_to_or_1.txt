Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows 217, 207, 170, 131, and 185, resulting in an average of 182 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 34. Since this is the initial period with no specific calendar context or evidence of lead-time drift, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to set the baseline for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the (1+L) coverage required (3 periods of demand). L will be set to 'default' (2).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 238 units, which are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (L=2 means arrivals during P1+2=P3). On-hand inventory is 0, and we lost 217 sales in Period 1 because we started with no stock. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (including those provided in context) is [217, 207, 170, 131, 185], which averages 182 units. Since we are in the very early stage of the game and have limited lead-time data, I will use 'default' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the baseline behavior while we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because the shipments from Period 1 and Period 2 have not arrived yet due to the promised lead time of 2 periods. Following the 'Critical Timing Example', the Period 1 order (ordered N=1, L=2) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and will be visible in the Period 4 'conclude' message. Total demand for the first two periods was 217 and 213. The OR backend needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. I will use the promised lead time (L=2) and the mean of observed demand (avg ~215) to set the base stock level. Since my actual on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 476, the OR engine will calculate if additional units are needed to meet the base stock target of approximately 3 * 215 = 645 units, adjusted for variance.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in P1 (238), P2 (238), and P3 (146). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0, and on-hand inventory remains 0. This confirms a delay or departure from the promised lead time. Since the P1 order (placed 3 periods ago) has not arrived, I will explicitly increase the lead time parameter L to 3 to allow the OR backend to account for a longer pipeline. Demand has been declining (217 -> 213 -> 163). I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture this downward trend while maintaining a buffer for the stockout units that will likely be demanded once inventory arrives.

Daily Profit: $724.00, Daily Holding Cost: $203.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $521.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we have 203 units on-hand and 460 in transit. Looking at the history, the promised lead time (L) is 2, but observed lead times have been 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), averaging 2. Demand over the first 5 periods (217, 213, 163, 181, 185) shows a mean of 191.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 21.8. Since there is no clear evidence of a regime shift or seasonality (no calendar dates provided), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the full available history. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed arrivals (Avg: 2). The parameters aim to cover demand during the replenishment lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $682.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods has been [217, 213, 163, 181, 177], showing a slight downward trend or stabilization around 180-190 units. The mean is 190.2 and standard deviation is approximately 23. Lead time behavior is volatile: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period, suggesting a variance in delivery speed against the promised 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (26 units) while in-transit is high (603 units). The base stock calculation must cover the review period plus lead time (L+1). I will use the promised lead time (L=2) as the baseline for the OR engine but monitor for further delays. For demand, I'll use the mean of the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture the recent stabilization (approx 174 per period). This helps prevent over-ordering as the initial high demand periods (P1, P2) fade. Sigma will be calculated from the last 5 samples to maintain a buffer.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0. History shows that in Period 6, we had a stockout (sold 26 units against a demand of 193). There are 603 units in-transit: from Period 2 (238), Period 4 (222), and Period 5 (143). Promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times vary: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period. Average demand across 6 periods is 190.67 (217, 213, 163, 181, 177, 193). The demand seems relatively stable with a slight downward trend in the middle and a recovery in Period 6. Given the stockout and the high in-transit volume (603), which is roughly 3 periods of demand, the goal is to stabilize inventory without over-ordering. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the variability and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the recent slight increase in volatility and volume (last 5 periods).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 20 units on-hand and 552 units in-transit. Historically, demand has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 180-190 units (P1-P7 demand: 217, 213, 163, 181, 177, 193, 202). Lead times have shown significant variability: P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), P3 arrived in P4 (L=1), and P4 arrived in P7 (L=3). The promised lead time is 2, but the average observed is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. Current in-transit includes orders from P2 (238), P5 (143), and P7 (171). The P2 order (238 units) is now 6 periods overdue (ordered P2, currently P8), which strongly suggests it is a lost shipment. Excluding the potentially lost P2 shipment, the net pipeline is 314 units (143 + 171). To ensure coverage over the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3), and accounting for the highly variable delivery schedule, I will set L to 'calculate' to use historical averages. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stable but slightly lower demand seen since Period 3 (~183 avg), and N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we analyze the lead time history: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1, P4 in 3, P5 in 3, and P7 in 1. This suggests an oscillating actual lead time (avg = 2.2) compared to the promised 2. I will use 'calculate' for L to capture this variability. Demand remains stable around a mean of 191 (P1-P8 actual demands: 217, 213, 163, 181, 177, 193, 202, 182). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to adapt to the most recent demand levels (avg ~187). Sigma_hat will use 'default' to incorporate overall volatility across all samples, as demand variance appears consistent. The system has 152 on-hand and 425 in-transit (P2: 238, P8: 187). The OR backend's service level target (0.80) is balanced against the holding cost of $1.0.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, demand for chips(Regular) remains stable around a mean of 185 units, with the most recent sample at 158. The lead time (promised as 2) has shown significant variability: P1(3), P3(1), P4(3), P5(3), P7(1), and P8(1). The average observed lead time is exactly 2.0 periods ((3+1+3+3+1+1)/6). Given this fluctuation, the 'calculate' method for L is the most robust approach. For demand forecasting, I will use all 9 available historical samples to stabilize the mean estimation, as there is no evidence of a structural regime shift (the demand range is 131-217). The on-hand inventory is 181 and in-transit is 451. Using default settings for mu_hat and sigma_hat with L calculated from history will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the observed lead time variance while maintaining the target service level (q = 0.8).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 with 0 on-hand inventory and 571 units in-transit. Historical demand shows a stable average around 180-190 units (P1-P10 mean = 189.7). The lead time behavior is highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1). The average observed lead time is 2.0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. However, the system is currently stock-out because zero arrivals occurred in Period 10 despite the pipeline. Given the alternating lead time, I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the average behavior. For demand (mu_hat), a 10-period lookback (recent_N=10) provides a stable estimate of the current regime. Sigma_hat is also set to a 10-period lookback to capture the observed demand volatility (std \u2248 23). The OR engine will use these to determine if the 571 units in-transit (orders from P9 and P10) are sufficient to cover the 3-period window (L+1).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 0, with 735 units in-transit. Demand has been stable, averaging approximately 181 units over the last 11 periods (P1-P11). The lead time has shown significant variance: while the promised lead time is 2, observed actual lead times are 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, and 1. This averages to approximately 2 periods. Currently, 735 units are in-transit (ordered in P9: 213, P10: 120, P11: 164, plus earlier un-concluded orders). The inventory depletion in P10 and P11 was caused by the zero arrivals in those periods, despite orders being placed. Given the volatility in lead time (ranging from 1 to 3), I will use 'calculate' for lead time to average history and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current stable regime (N=11). This set of parameters will help the OR backend aim for a base stock level that accounts for the pipeline and recent demand while buffering against lead-time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile with values {1, 3}, averaging 2.0; observed lead times: P1->P4 (3), P3->P4 (1), P4->P7 (3), P5->P8 (3), P7->P8 (1), P8->P9 (1).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 175 units with 566 units in-transit (reflecting the cumulative pipeline). Demand remains stable with a historical mean of approximately 181 units per period and a standard deviation of 22. Lead times show significant volatility between 1, 2, and 3 periods; the recent observation from Period 12 confirmsarrivals from Period 9 (LT=3) and Period 10 (LT=2). Given that the current inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 577 units and the expected demand over a 3-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=4) is roughly 724 units, more stock is needed to maintain service levels. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=12) to capture the stable mean of 181. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend utilize the average of all observed lead times (currently averaging 2.14 periods), which accurately reflects the current high-variance environment.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as volatile with a range of {1, 2, 3} periods; recent arrivals from P9 and P10 (observed P13) show LT=3 and LT=2 respectively. Demand remains stable around a mean of 181.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 following Period 13, where demand (176) slightly exceeded our starting inventory (175). Demand has been relatively stable, with a 13-period mean of approximately 183 units. Lead time continues to exhibit high volatility, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (observed values: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2). While the mathematical average of observed lead times is 2.125, the presence of 3-period lead times poses a significant stockout risk. To protect against this volatility and the current 0 on-hand balance, I am setting L to 2 (the promised value and near-average) but using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=5 captures the most recent demand behavior (averaging ~173 per period) while the OR backend's service-level logic (based on profit $4 vs holding $1) should naturally buffer for the lead time uncertainty. I am not using 'explicit' because current demand is stable and the OR mechanism's built-in safety stock should manage the risk if parameters are set to recent historical levels.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 180 over the last 10 periods (P5-P14 avg \u2248 180). Lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Recent observed LT: P11 arrived P14 = 3 periods). As of P15, on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), with 377 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, and P14). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent maximum observed lead time, which increases the protection window to L+1 = 4 periods. mu_hat will use the recent mean of 180 over the last 10 periods (N=10), resulting in (1+L)*180 = 720. sigma_hat will use recent volatility (N=10) to address the high service level requirement (profit/holding ratio = 4:1).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 181 over the last 15 periods. However, lead time is highly volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods (Average = 2.1). We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. Two orders are currently in-transit: one from P13 (135 units, now at T=3) and one from P14 (4 units, now at T=2). Given the 2-period promised lead time and the history of arrivals occurring at T=3, the P13 order is expected to arrive during Period 16, and the P14 order by Period 17. The parameters are set to cover a lead time of 2 (current estimate) plus the 1-period review cycle. I use recent_N=10 to capture the stable demand mean while minimizing noise from the earliest periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $490.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand for chips(Regular) appears to have stabilized or slightly decreased based on recent observations (P15: 163, P16: 125), following a long period of stability around 180. I will adopt a recent_N window for demand forecasting to capture this possible downward shift without overreacting to the single low P16 value. Lead time history shows high volatility (values of 1, 2, and 3), with many recent orders taking 3 periods to arrive (P11->P14, P13->P16). Using L=calculate (average) or L=2 (promised) may underestimate the actual lead time required to ensure coverage, especially with the high volatility. I will use L=3 (explicit) to reflect the recent worst-case arrivals and ensure the pipeline covers the expected lag. On-hand inventory is low (10 units), and the pipeline is significant (445 units), reflecting orders from P14, P15, and P16. Setting L=3, mu_hat with recent_N (N=5), and sigma_hat with recent_N (N=5) will allow the OR backend to target a base stock that accounts for the current instability in both demand and supply timing.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight downward trend over the last 5 periods (mean ~140 vs overall mean ~177). Inventory is currently 0 with a large in-transit pipeline of 630 units. Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with most recent orders (P11, P13, P14) arriving with a lead time of 3. To prevent over-ordering while accounting for the high volatility and potential stockouts, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to better capture the actual cycle. mu_hat will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the recent lower demand levels (~140/pd), and sigma_hat will use the last 10 samples to capture the standard deviation of this stable but seasonally lower regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 13: Average demand decreased from ~185 to ~140 (-24%) over the last 5 periods. Lead time remains volatile but has consistently hit the maximum of 3 periods for the last 3 arrivals.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 19 with 0 on-hand inventory. Historical data shows a clear demand regime shift starting around Period 14. Average demand from P1 to P13 was ~181 units, but from P14 to P18, the average dropped to ~144 units (a ~20% decrease). Lead time (L) remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, but specifically hitting 3 periods for the last four tracked arrivals (P11, P13, P14). To protect against stockouts during this period of stockouts (P15, P17, P18) and uncertain lead times, I will set L to 3 (the observed upper bound) and mu_hat based on the recent 5-period demand average. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient for the longer lead time and the current, lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 14: average demand dropped from 181 to 144 (-20%). Lead time has stabilized at the upper bound of 3 periods for the last four concluded shipments (ordered P11, P13, P14).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a significant pipeline (639 units). Analysis of concluding periods reveals that the lead time has consistently hit 3 periods for the last five concluded shipments (ordered P11, P13, P14). Demand has shifted to a lower regime starting around Period 14; the mean demand over the last 6 periods (P14-P19) is approximately 148.5 units. To prevent over-ordering due to the high pipeline while ensuring we cover the extended lead time, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this lower demand regime (148.5 * (1+3) = 594). The pipeline (639) currently exceeds the base stock target (approx 594 + safety stock), so the OR backend's capped policy will likely order zero or the minimal amount to prevent ballooning holding costs once the backlog arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 14: average demand dropped to ~149 (-18% from the initial 181 average). Lead time has stabilized at the upper bound of 3 periods for five consecutive concluded shipments (orders from P11, P13, P14 arrive with LT=3).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a significant pipeline inventory (639 units). Analysis of recent history confirms a demand regime shift started around Period 14; while earlier periods saw demand drop to ~144, the last two concluded periods (19 and 20) have shown a substantial rebound with demands of 172 and 182, bringing the mean of the last 7 periods (P14-P20) to 153.1 and the last 3 periods to 166.3. Most importantly, lead time has consistently hit 3 periods for the last five concluded arrivals (from orders placed in P11, P13, P14), suggesting that while promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time is currently 3. I am setting L to 3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the extended lead time (protecting against the delivery delay). For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 7 to capture the shift from Period 14 while recognizing the recent uptick. This combination allows the OR engine to set a sufficient base stock level that accounts for both the 3nd and 4th period of demand (L+1) and the high stockout cost (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), which results in a high critical fractile requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected: after a drop to ~144, the last 3 periods (P18-P20) averaged 166.3, indicating a return toward initial mean levels. Lead time remains consistently at 3 periods for five consecutive concluded shipments.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a reversal of the previous drop. After a period of low demand (~144), the last four periods (P18-P21) have recorded demands of 145, 172, 182, and 162, averaging 165.25. This justifies moving away from the 'low' regime of 144 and back toward the initial average of ~180. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this rebound. Regarding lead time, there is a severe inventory stockout (on-hand is 0) despite 652 units being in-transit. Shipments from P15, P17, P18, and P21 are outstanding. The last 5 concluded shipments (for orders P11, P13, P14) all arrived with a lead time of 3 periods. However, several shipments (P15 order of 203 units, P17 order of 189 units) are now clearly overdue relative to the promised 2-period and the observed 3-period lead times. Specifically, the P15 order is now 6 periods overdue. This suggests either a further extension of lead time or lost shipments. To protect against this uncertainty while managing the current stockout, I will explicitly set L=3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and maintain the base-stock calculation using the recent 6-period demand average to reflect the recovery in sales volume.

Carry-over insight: Significant delay/potential loss of shipments detected: Order from P15 (203 units) is 6 periods past order date without arrival; Order from P17 (189 units) is 4 periods past order date without arrival, despite previous actual lead times stabilizing at 3.

The system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a critical supply chain failure. Major shipments from P15 (203 units) and P17 (189 units) are now 8 and 6 periods past their ordering date, respectively. Given that the previously observed maximum lead time was 3 periods, these shipments are likely lost or significantly delayed. The total in-transit quantity of 652 units includes these potentially lost orders (392 units), leaving only 260 units in active transit from P18, P21, and P22, none of which have arrived despite the 2-period promised lead time. Demand has returned to its historical mean (~170) after a brief dip, but the focus must be on bypassing the OR engine's reliance on 'in-transit' numbers that contain ghost inventory. By explicitly setting L=4, I increase the base stock calculation. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' for the last 10 periods (covering both the dip and the recovery), I provide a robust demand target. This configuration encourages the OR backend to place larger orders to compensate for the inventory deficit caused by the stalled pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: Orders from P15 and P17 (total 392 units) are overdue by 3+ periods relative to the established 3-period lead time, suggesting they are lost. Current 'In-transit' accounting is inflated by these missing units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing significant disruptions. Orders from Period 15 (203 units) and Period 17 (189 units) are now 9 and 7 periods old respectively, vastly exceeding the previously observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. These 392 units are considered lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 795 is misleading; the effective pipeline is only 403 units (from P18, P21, P23). Demand has stabilized at a lower level after a brief rebound; the average of the last 10 periods (P14-P23) is 147.8. To compensate for the lost inventory and stockouts (on-hand is 0), I am setting L explicitly to 3 (the last reliable actual lead time) and mu_hat to an explicit value that targets a base stock covering 4 periods (L+1) of the recent mean demand (148 * 4 = 592). Because the OR engine subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from the base_stock, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 392 lost units to trigger an actual order. Target base stock 592 + 392 lost units = 984. This ensures the backend places an order despite the 'phantom' in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: Orders from P15 and P17 (total 392 units) are lost. Pipeline inventory is over-reported by 392 units; OR parameters must be adjusted upward to force ordering until these units are manually accounted for or the 'In-transit' clears.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely disrupted. Historical lead times stabilized at 3 periods, suggesting that orders from Period 15 (203 units) and Period 17 (189 units) are lost as they are now 10 and 8 periods old respectively. These 392 'ghost' units are inflating the 'In-transit' count (1024), causing the OR engine's capped policy to throttle new orders while we are actually at 0 on-hand inventory. Demand has softened recently (avg of last 3 periods is ~117), but the primary goal is to bypass the pipeline inflation. To force the backend to place a significant order, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at a level (1300) that exceeds the current inflated pipeline (1024) + target stock, while keeping L at the established actual lead time of 3. This ensures the calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in a meaningful order to replenish the empty warehouse.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure persistent: Orders from P15 and P17 (392 units) confirmed lost after 8+ periods of non-arrival. Pipeline inventory significantly over-reported. Demand regime shifted lower: P22-P24 average is 116.7 compared to previous 160+.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face severe disruptions. Orders from Period 15 (203 units) and Period 17 (189 units) are now 11 and 9 periods old respectively, and clearly lost. However, they remain in the system's 'In-transit' count (1199 units total). Recently, lead times have fluctuated (P21 arrived in 2 periods, P23 arrived in 2 periods), but demand remains volatile. The last three periods (P23-P25) saw demands of 130, 108, and 165, averaging 134.3. The 'In-transit' number is severely over-reported because of the 392 lost units plus several smaller old orders that never arrived. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock', I must increase 'mu_hat' significantly to force an order. Since we have 0 on-hand and are consistently stock-outing, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate actual demand mean at ~150. For a lead time of 2, the expected base stock should be (1+2)*150 = 450. To offset the ~400 units of 'phantom' inventory (lost P15/P17), I need to set mu_hat to approximately 850+ to ensure the OR engine places a meaningful order despite the inflated Pipeline Inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure persistent: P15 and P17 orders (392 units) are definitively lost. Lead time for recent successful shipments has shortened to 2 periods (P21, P23). Demand mean for P23-P25 is 134.3.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face a massive discrepancy due to lost orders from Period 15 (203 units) and Period 17 (189 units). These 392 units are still counted in the 'In-transit' total of 1227, but will never arrive. This artificially inflates the pipeline inventory, preventing the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it thinks stock is forthcoming. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that overrides this ghost inventory. Total In-transit (1227) minus Lost (392) equals 835 actual units in transit. Demand has stabilized in a lower regime; the average of the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is 125.4. I am setting L to 2 based on the most recent successful arrivals (P21 and P23 both arrived with LT=2). To force an order and maintain stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand plus a buffer, I set mu_hat = (Expected Demand * 3) + Lost Units = (130 * 3) + 392 = 782. This ensures the backend sees a requirement that exceeds the ghost inventory. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent demand volatility (std dev ~26 over the last 5 periods) scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time has shifted from 3 periods to 2 periods based on orders from P21 and P23. Demand regime remains in the lower range, averaging 125 over the last 5 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted. Orders from Period 15 (203 units) and Period 17 (189 units) are 13 and 11 periods old respectively, and since the established lead time is 2-3 periods, these 392 units are definitively lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 1227 units is inflated by these 392 units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 835 units. Demand has entered a lower regime; the average of the last 6 periods is ~118. However, the system is currently stock-out (On-hand: 0). The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - pipeline. Because the backend overestimates the pipeline (thinking the 392 lost units are coming), it will under-order. To compensate, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. I estimate demand at 120/period. For a lead time (L) of 2, the review+lead period covers 1+2=3 periods. Expected demand = 3 * 120 = 360. To offset the 392 lost units in the pipeline, I override mu_hat to 360 + 392 = 752. This forces the backend to place an order despite the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains low: average P22-P27 is 117.7 units (-35% from baseline). Lost shipments (P15, P17) total 392 units, causing a persistent 392-unit over-reporting in pipeline inventory.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face a significant structural issue: orders from P15 (203 units) and P17 (189 units) are now 12 and 10 periods overdue respectively, confirming them as lost. This results in the 'In-transit' pipeline being over-reported by 392 units. To compensate for this in a restricted OR environment, I must inflate mu_hat to ensure the backend places orders despite the phantom inventory. Recent demand has stabilized in a lower regime: average demand from P22-P28 is 114 units. Lead time has settled at 2 periods (confirmed by P21/P23/P26 arrivals). To calculate the explicit mu_hat: (1 + L) * Forecast = (1 + 2) * 114 = 342. Adding the 392 unit offset to bypass the lost shipments results in 734. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(3) * standard deviation of the last 7 periods (~28), yielding ~48. This strategy forces the policy to disregard the 392 'invisible' units and order based on actual needs.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant disruption. Orders from Period 15 (203 units) and Period 17 (189 units), totaling 392 units, are considered lost as they are now 13 and 11 periods overdue, respectively. These lost units create a persistent 392-unit inflation in the 'In-transit' figure (current In-transit is 1199, but effective In-transit is 1199 - 392 = 807). Additionally, a new demand regime has emerged: the last 8 periods (P22-P29) show a significantly lower mean of 110.0 units compared to earlier levels (~180 and ~140). Recent lead times have stabilized at 2 periods (P21->P23, P23->P25, P26->P28). To compensate for the 392-unit ghost inventory in the pipeline and meet the new lower demand (L+1 = 3 periods of demand), mu_hat is set using an 'explicit' value. My target base stock is (110 * 3) + safety stock (approx 100) + 392 (to offset the lost units) = ~822. However, the OR backend logic subtracts the full pipeline (1199) from the base stock. Therefore, to force any ordering at all, the base stock parameter must be set extremely high to 'overpower' the phantom inventory, or we must accept that no orders will be placed until the backend clears the 'In-transit' (which it won't if they are lost). Since I cannot clear the backend's pipeline memory, I will set an explicit mu_hat to account for the current low demand regime while acknowledging that the OR backend will likely not order until the actual on-hand + true pipeline falls below the target.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 22: mean demand dropped to 110.0 units (-39% from initial 181 baseline). Actual lead time has stabilized at 2 periods for the last three successful arrivals.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 31, the core issue remains the supply chain failure from Period 15 and 17. Orders for 203 (P15) and 189 (P17) units, totaling 392 units, are confirmed lost as they are now more than 13 periods overdue against a current actual lead time of 2 periods. The backend OR engine sees an 'In-transit' of 1199 units, but 392 of these are ghost units that will never arrive. To compensate and ensure we actually place orders, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate current demand to be ~115 (the mean since P22). With L=2 (actual), the standard calculation is mu_hat = (1+L) * mean = 3 * 115 = 345. To offset the 392 ghost units, I add them to this target: 345 + 392 = 737. This forces the base stock calculation high enough to trigger new orders despite the inflated pipeline inventory. I set L=2 as the 'recent_N' average has stabilized there.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain situation is critical. Orders from Period 15 (203 units) and Period 17 (189 units), totaling 392 units, are long overdue (14-16 periods) and definitively lost. Additionally, orders from P24 (229 units) and P25 (331 units) have not arrived despite the recently observed 2-period lead time. This has resulted in a critical stockout (on-hand = 0) while 'In-transit' shows a massive 1,199 units, mostly comprised of lost or severely delayed stock. Consequently, the OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see the inflated pipeline and fail to place new orders. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set an artificially high 'base_stock'. I calculate the required target as (1+L)*mean_demand plus the 392 lost units to neutralize the pipeline error. Recent demand (P26-P31) averages ~104 units. With L=2, the target is 3 * 104 + 392 = 704. I will set mu_hat to 704 and use a recent_N sigma_hat to maintain responsiveness to the current lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory is over-reported by 392 units due to confirmed losses from P15 and P17. This requires inflating mu_hat or using explicit values to force ordering until the backend pipeline clears or stabilizes. Demand regime (P26-P31) has further softened to an average of ~104 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face a significant issue: orders from P15 (203 units) and P17 (189 units), totaling 392 units, are considered lost as they are now 15+ periods overdue. These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (1199 units), causing the OR backend to underestimate the required order quantity. To compensate for this 392-unit ghost inventory, mu_hat must be inflated. Recent demand (P26-P32) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 102 units. Actual lead time has stabilized at 2 periods. Therefore, I will set L to 2. The pipeline inventory should ideally cover (L+1) periods, which is 3 * 102 = 306 units. However, because the backend sees 1199 units in transit (including the 392 lost units), I must set mu_hat explicitly high enough to trigger ordering if needed, or explicitly account for the drift. Since in-transit (1199) is much higher than the needed base stock (~350), I need to use an explicit mu_hat that overrides the logic or forces the pipeline to realize it needs more units. Given the massive stockout (on-hand = 0 for many periods), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the 102 mean plus the 392 lost units to 'trick' the backend into maintaining a real pipeline of 306 units: 306 + 392 = 698.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face a significant crisis. Shipments from P15 (203 units), P17 (189 units), P24 (229 units), and P25 (331 units) have not arrived, despite a stabilized lead time of 2 periods for successful orders. This results in 952 units of ghost pipeline inventory (203+189+229+331). With On-hand at 0 and In-transit reporting 1199, the OR backend believes there are sufficient units to cover future demand, even though only 247 units (1199 - 952 ghost units) are likely to ever arrive. I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to bypass this ghost inventory and force a new order. The current demand regime (P28-P33) averages ~107.6 units. With L=2, the required base stock to cover L+1 periods (3 periods) is approximately 323 units plus safety stock. To force the OR engine to order despite the 1199 in-transit, I set mu_hat to 1600 units (accounting for both demand and the ghost inventory blockage).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure expanded: P24 (229 units) and P25 (331 units) have joined P15 and P17 as confirmed lost shipments (not arrived after 8+ periods). Total ghost pipeline inventory now stands at 952 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain infrastructure for chips(Regular) has encountered catastrophic failures. Based on history, orders from Period 15 (203 units), Period 17 (189 units), Period 24 (229 units), and Period 25 (331 units) are long overdue (9+ periods and 20+ periods for the oldest) and are definitively lost. This creates a 'ghost' pipeline of 952 units that the OR backend incorrectly believes will arrive, preventing it from placing new orders. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the current lower demand regime (avg ~104 units/period) and a lead time of 2 periods: Base Stock = (L+1) * mu + safety_stock \u2248 3 * 104 + 1.645 * (sqrt(3) * 20) \u2248 312 + 57 \u2248 369. However, the backend subtracts the pipeline (1644) from this base stock. To force an order that actually reaches the shelf, I must set mu_hat to a value that, when 1644 is subtracted, still reflects the need for inventory. Current in-transit (1644) minus lost units (952) leaves a real pipeline of 692. With on-hand at 0 and demand around 100, I will set an aggressive mu_hat to overcome the accounting error and signal the need for fresh stock, while maintaining L=2 as the confirmed actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure expanded: P24 (229 units) and P25 (331 units) confirmed lost alongside P15 and P17. Total ghost pipeline inventory is 952 units, causing a permanent order blockage unless mu_hat is manually inflated.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant disruption. We have confirmed the loss of four major shipments: P15 (203 units), P17 (189 units), P24 (229 units), and P25 (331 units), totaling 952 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Despite an actual lead time that has stabilized at 2 periods for successful orders, the OR backend sees a massive 'In-transit' total of 1841 units, which prevents any new orders because regular base stock calculations (Demand * (L+1)) are dwarfed by this figure. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The target base stock should cover the next 3 periods of demand (L=2, so L+1=3). Recent demand from Period 31-35 averages 99.8 units. I calculate the required base stock as 3 * 100 = 300 units. To force an order when the pipeline is perceived as 1841 units, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 1841 > 0'. Specifically, to target an additional order of ~200 units to meet near-term demand while awaiting P34/P35 arrivals (if they survive), I set mu_hat to 2150. This is a technical override to neutralize the 1841-unit blockage and ensure stock arrives for Period 38.

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has experienced significant disruptions with confirmed lost shipments from Periods 15, 17, 24, and 25, totaling 952 units. These units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count but will never arrive, effectively blocking the OR engine from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for both the expected demand over the lead time (L=2) and the 'ghost' inventory (952 units). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the average of the last 10 periods (P27-P36) is approximately 103 units. With an actual lead time (L) of 2 periods, the review+lead time is 3 periods. Expected demand over this window is 3 * 103 = 309 units. Adding the 952 ghost units results in a target mu_hat of 1261. This forces the OR engine to see the 'needed' stock as 1261, which after subtracting the 952 ghost units in transit, aligns with the actual 309 units requirement. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient service levels despite the lower demand mean.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed supply chain 'ghost' inventory of 952 units (P15, P17, P24, P25) continues to inflate pipeline inventory. Corrective mu_hat inflation is required to maintain ordering. Recent demand mean (P27-P36) is 103 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a major supply chain discrepancy. A total of 952 units (from orders in Periods 15, 17, 24, and 25) are confirmed lost, as they have not arrived despite the lead time stabilizing at 1-2 periods for recent successful shipments (e.g., P34, P35, P36). These 952 units are still counted in the 'In-transit' inventory by the backend OR engine, creating a 'ghost pipeline' that blocks new orders because the system believes the inventory position is much higher than it actually is. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on the current demand regime (mean ~103 units, LT=2) which would normally be around 310-350 units. However, to force the backend to place an order despite the 952 units of ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set higher than the current in-transit (1199) or the desired base stock must be reached by significantly inflating parameters. With on-hand at 769 (following arrivals from P34-36) and in-transit at 1199, we are currently overstocked relative to actual demand (101). No new order is needed this period as on-hand is sufficient for ~7 periods, but mu_hat is set to 400 (approximating 1+L * mean) to reflect the true demand environment for future planning, while acknowledging that orders will remain blocked until in-transit levels drop.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-424.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be plagued by 'ghost' inventory totaling 952 units from lost orders (P15, P17, P24, P25). These missing units inflate the 'In-transit' figure on the OR backend, which currently stands at 1199 units. Since the actual lead time for recent successful deliveries (P34, P35, P36) has stabilized at 2 periods (arriving in P36 and P37), the backend calculates a base stock based on L=2. However, with 952 units of phantom inventory and 700 units on-hand, the backend will refuse to order unless mu_hat is manually inflated to exceed this total (1652+ units). Recent demand (P34-P38) has been extremely low, averaging 92.8 units. To prevent stockouts once the current on-hand is depleted by this low demand, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 1275 (aiming for roughly 3 periods of demand + the 952 lost units) and 'explicit' L of 2 to match the recent reliable delivery performance. This ensures the backend maintains a healthy inventory level despite the pipeline distortion.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has stabilized at 2 periods for the last three successful arrivals (P34, P35, P36). Ghost inventory remains at 952 units (P15, P17, P24, P25). Demand regime (P34-P38) is currently at a period low, averaging ~93 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant inventory reporting challenge due to 'ghost' pipeline units. Orders from P15, P17, P24, and P25 (total 952 units) are definitively lost as they have not arrived after 14-24 periods. This ghost inventory inflates the backend's pipeline count, preventing it from placing new necessary orders. My strategy since Period 34 has been to manually force orders by inflating mu_hat to 1300+ to exceed the sum of ghost inventory and desired base stock. Recent demand (P34-P39) has dropped further to an average of 95.8 units. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 589 units due to the successful arrivals of P34, P35, and P36. The actual lead time has stabilized at 2 periods (calculated from P34, P35, P36 arrivals). With 589 units on hand and a demand of ~96 units, we have roughly 6 periods of supply. I will maintain L=2 and mu_hat = 1100 to keep the order system 'unblocked' without over-ordering excessively while on-hand is high.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 952 units (P15, P17, P24, P25) remains lost; backend pipeline accounting is permanently inflated. Recent demand (P34-P39) has shifted to a lower regime averaging ~96 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system faces a massive distortion in pipeline inventory. There is a confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 952 units consisting of lost shipments from periods 15, 17, 24, and 25. These orders will never arrive, but the OR backend includes them in its base-stock calculation (order = base_stock - on_hand - in_transit), preventing new orders from being placed. Simultaneously, the demand regime has settled at a lower mean; the average demand from Period 34 to 40 is approximately 89.8 units. To counteract the 952 units of ghost inventory and ensure the OR engine eventually places orders when on-hand inventory depletes, I must set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating the target: Given L=2, the review+lead period is 3 periods. With a demand of ~90, the natural mu_hat would be 270. To bypass the 952-unit blockage, I set mu_hat to 1222 (90 * 3 + 952). This effectively 'neutrals' the lost units in the logic. Sigma_hat is set to 45 (calculated as sqrt(3) * ~26 standard deviation of recent demand). L is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the stabilized 2-period lead time observed in P34-P36.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a major supply chain discrepancy where 952 units (from orders P15, P17, P24, P25) are 'ghost' units in the pipeline inventory because they were lost but never cleared from 'In-transit'. At the start of Period 42, on-hand inventory is 425 units and In-transit is 1199. However, actual viable in-transit is only 247 units (1199 - 952). The demand regime has stabilized at a significantly lower level; the mean demand from Period 34 to 41 is 92.4 units per period. With on-hand at 425 and actual viable pipeline at 247, the current total usable stock is 672 units. At a demand of ~93 units/period and a lead time of 2, the desired base stock is roughly 300-400 units. Since 672 > 400, no new orders are needed. To prevent the OR backend from being permanently blocked by the ghost inventory in future periods, I will continue using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 1250 to account for the 952 ghost units plus a buffer of ~300 units (approx. 3 periods of demand at the current 100/unit rate). This ensures that if usable inventory (on-hand + actual in-transit) drops below 300, the OR engine will trigger an order despite the 952 units of ghost noise.

Total 'In-transit' is 1199, meaning the 'true' pipeline inventory is only 247 units (likely representing a more recent order not yet concluded). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 324 units. Demand has shifted to a lower regime, with the most recent 6 periods (P37-P42) averaging 91 units. To prevent the OR backend from being blocked by the 952 units of phantom inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 2-period lead time as (1+L)*demand = 3 * 91 = 273. However, since the backend subtracts the 1199 in-transit units from this base stock, it will result in zero orders. To bypass this until on-hand inventory depletes further, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent low demand but keeping L at the observed 2. No new orders are needed yet as on-hand (324) exceeds the expected demand over the lead time (91 units/period * 3 periods = 273).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be impacted by a significant 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 952 units (confirmed lost orders from P15, P17, P24, and P25). This over-reports the inventory held by the OR backend, which has suppressed ordering since Period 37. Current on-hand inventory is 261, and demand has remained in a lower regime, averaging 89.8 units over the last 5 periods (P39-P43). Although lead time has recently stabilized at 2 periods, the ghost inventory means the system will not place new orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to exceed the phantom 952 units in transit. Since we have 261 on-hand and need to cover a demand lead+review cycle of (1+2)=3 periods (approx 300 units), we are approaching a stockout risk. To bypass the 1199 total 'in-transit' (which includes the 952 lost units plus real recent orders), mu_hat is set to an explicit value of 1300 to signal the backend to maintain a buffer, while L is set to 2 to reflect the recent stable delivery pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime appears to have softened further; average demand for P39-P43 is 89.8 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 952 units of 'ghost' inventory (orders from P15, P17, P24, and P25) that are confirmed lost but still occupy the 'In-transit' pipeline. This creates a permanent barrier to new automated orders because the OR backend believes these units will eventually arrive. Additionally, demand has entered a lower regime, with the average over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) being approximately 78 units. Current on-hand inventory is 200 units, which covers approximately 2.5 periods of demand at the current rate. Given that actual lead time has stabilized at 2 periods (as seen in arrivals from P34-P36), we have enough inventory for the immediate horizon and no new orders are required this period. I am setting L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the stabilized 2-period lead time and mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current demand softening to ~78 units per period (multiplied by 1+L=3 totals ~233) while the ghost inventory naturally prevents ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened: P40-P44 average is 77.8 units, a significant drop from the previously noted P39-P43 average of 89.8 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant issue with 'ghost' pipeline inventory totaling 952 units (from Periods 15, 17, 24, and 25) which are confirmed lost but still registered in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation. With current 'In-transit' at 1199, subtracting the 952 ghost units implies a real pipeline of 247 units. On-hand inventory is 140. Total real inventory (On-hand + Real Pipeline) is 387 units. Demand has clearly entered a lower regime; the average demand from Period 40 to 45 is approximately 83 units. Using a lead time of 2 (observed in recent successful cycles), the target stock for a (L+1) period coverage (3 periods) should be approximately 3 * 83 = 249 units plus safety stock. Since the real inventory (387) already exceeds the required stock for the current demand regime, no new orders are necessary. However, to prevent the OR backend from being permanently blocked by the ghost 952 units, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the backend's (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) logic. With In-transit at 1199, I set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the ghost units plus the desired base stock. Target base stock = 3 * 83 + 1.64 * (std * sqrt(3)) \u2248 250 + 60 = 310. To force the backend to see a need, the mu_hat parameter must be roughly (310 + 952) = 1262. This allows the backend to function despite the accounting error.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in a lower trough: P40-P45 average is 83 units. Ghost inventory of 952 units continues to obstruct standard 'In-transit' logic.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a massive 'ghost inventory' of 952 units (orders from P15, P17, P24, and P25) that are confirmed lost but still counted in the backend's 'In-transit' figure. Total 'In-transit' is currently 1199, which includes these 952 ghost units and 247 real units (if any, though 'In-transit' seems to be accumulating unaccounted units). On-hand inventory is 79. Demand has shifted to a lower regime; the average for the last 7 periods (P40-P46) is approximately 78.5 units. To force the OR backend to order when it thinks pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 79 + 1199 = 1278) is extremely high, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that exceeds this total. With 4 periods remaining and current demand at ~80/period, targeting a base stock that compensates for the 952 lost units is necessary. However, since we have 79 units on hand and 1199 in-transit, the OR engine will not order unless mu_hat is set significantly higher than its internal calculation of base stock minus pipeline. I will set mu_hat explicitly to maintain a sufficient buffer for the remaining periods while accounting for the lead time (L=2).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in a lower trough: P40-P46 average is 78.5 units. Total 'ghost' pipeline inventory remains at 952 units.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant issue with 'ghost' pipeline inventory totaling 952 units (from Periods 15, 17, 24, and 25) which are confirmed lost but still registered in the 'In-transit' balance (currently 1454). Standard policy logic subtracts this pipeline from the target base stock, effectively blocking new orders. To bypass this, mu_hat must be inflated to exceed the ghost inventory levels. Current demand has stabilized in a lower regime, with the last 8 periods (P40-P47) averaging 75.5 units. With on-hand inventory at 15 and 255 units ordered in P47 (due in P49), we need to ensure an order is placed in P48 to cover the final periods of the game (P48-P50). Target base stock needs to be ~1300 to trigger an order of ~100 units given the reported 1454 in-transit (Target - (InTransit - Ghost) - OnHand). Setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1350 units (covering L+1=3 periods) should force the necessary ordering.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to manage the 'chips(Regular)' SKU during a persistent supply chain failure. Currently, 'on-hand' is 0 and 'In-transit' is 1454. However, of this 'In-transit' amount, 952 units are confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P15, P17, P24, P25), meaning the functional pipeline is only 1454 - 952 = 502 units (which includes the 255 units ordered in P47). Demand has shifted to a lower regime; the average demand from P42 to P48 is approximately 75 units. With a stabilized actual lead time of 2 periods, the OR backend requires parameters that account for the 3-period coverage (L+1). I will set L to 2 (recent stability). To overcome the 952 units of ghost inventory that block the OR backend's ordering logic, I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Target base stock = (L+1) * 75 + Z * sigma \u2248 225 + 40 \u2248 265 units. To force an order when the backend sees 1454 units in pipeline, mu_hat must be set to approximately Target + Ghost Inventory = 265 + 952 = 1217. This ensures the backend perceives a need for units despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be obstructed by 952 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory from orders P15, P17, P24, and P25, which are confirmed lost. In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0 and the apparent in-transit total is 1454 units. Subtracting the 952 ghost units leaves a real pipeline of 502 units (which includes the P47 order of 255 units and other recent un-concluded orders). Demand has significantly softened over the last 10 periods (P40-P49), averaging approximately 70.3 units per period. To prevent the OR backend from being blocked by the ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate the target base stock based on a lead time of 2 periods plus the current review period (L+1=3). Base Stock = 3 * 70.3 (demand) + buffer. Given the service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8, and the ghost inventory of 952 units, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Real Base Stock Target + 952). A target base stock of ~300 units plus 952 ghost units implies a mu_hat around 1252. I will use 1250 for mu_hat and 100 for sigma_hat to ensure the backend recognizes a need to maintain stock despite the over-reported pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains low, averaging 70.3 units over P40-P49. 'Ghost' pipeline inventory remains at 952 units.
