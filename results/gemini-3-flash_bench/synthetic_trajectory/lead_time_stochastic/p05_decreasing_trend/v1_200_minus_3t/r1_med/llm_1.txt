The most recent demand (79) is the lowest observed in the entire history. This suggests a potential regime shift or a period of very low demand. On-hand inventory is currently nearly depleted (3 units). The 'In-transit' figure of 1350 is misleadingly high because it includes several historical orders (Periods 15, 17, 18, 19) that were explicitly confirmed lost in earlier insights, plus several more recent orders that have not yet arrived. Specifically, active/expected orders are from P24 (100), P25 (100), P26 (150), and P27 (100). The lead time has stabilized between 1-3 periods. To calculate the safety requirement, I use the current lower demand regime (~120 per period) across the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 4 periods). Required stock = 120 * 4 = 480 units. Active pipeline = 100 (P24) + 100 (P25) + 150 (P26) + 100 (P27) = 450 units. With 3 on-hand, the total visible supply is 453.

The valid pipeline consists of orders from P44 (150 units), P45 (100 units), and P46 (100 units).

However, the P45 and P46 orders are still within the potential arrival window. If the P45 order (100 units) arrives this period (P49), it will satisfy the likely demand of ~65-75 units. If it does not, a stockout will occur this period, but placing an order now (P49) with a minimum lead time of 1-2 periods would only arrive in P50 or later. Since P50 is the final period and the valid in-transit inventory (P45=100, P46=100) already exceeds the expected total demand for P49 and P50 (~140 units total), any additional order placed now would likely result in unnecessary holding costs or leftover inventory at the end of the game.
