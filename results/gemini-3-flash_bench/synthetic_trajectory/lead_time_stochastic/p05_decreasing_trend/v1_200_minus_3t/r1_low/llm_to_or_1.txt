Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit and holding cost both at $1.0/unit. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 217, 207, 170, 131, and 185. The mean of these 5 samples is 182. Given L=2, the total demand over the review + lead period (L+1 = 3) is approximately 182 * 3 = 546. However, since the current inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 0, the OR backend needs parameters to initiate the first order. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat based on the mean of the provided data multiplied by (1+L) and 'default' for L and sigma_hat to establish a baseline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 238 units with a promised lead time (L) of 2. The observation 'arrived=0' in the Period 1 conclude message is expected, as an order placed in Period 1 with L=2 would arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude (read at the start of Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order hasn't arrived yet, and we lost 217 sales in Period 1. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 5 periods shows a mean of 182 and a standard deviation of approximately 35. Since we only have 5 samples and no clear calendar-driven regime shift yet, I will use all available samples to set the parameters. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=5 (all samples) to establish a baseline. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5. L is set to default (2).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for Period 1 was 217 and Period 2 was 213 (note: user provided sample data lists P2 as 207, but the 'Period 2 conclude' message says 213; I will prioritize the conclude message). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (238 units) are expected to arrive during P3's arrival resolution (L=2: P1 + 2 = P3). Therefore, seeing 'arrived=0' in P2 conclude is normal. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 476 in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since on-hand is 0 and we are losing sales, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. Mean demand is approx 215. With L=2, (1+L) = 3. Expected demand over lead time + review is ~645 units. I will use 'default' for L (promised 2) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to capture the early mean closely. Since we have only 5 samples and high variance/lost sales, I'll use default sigma calculation.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (238 units), Period 2 (238 units), and Period 3 (139 units). As of the start of Period 4, we see from the 'Period 3 conclude' message that nothing has arrived yet. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 2 should arrive during the Arrival Resolution of Period 3 and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. Since it shows 'arrived=0', the Period 1 order is officially delayed. However, we must wait to see if it arrives in Period 4 before declaring it lost or the lead time permanently changed. Our on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because of the lack of stock. Demand has been declining from 217 (P1) to 163 (P3). I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough stock to cover the expected pipeline. I will keep L at default (2) for now but monitor for a systematic shift to 3 or lost orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-15.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first set of arrivals. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but reality shows variability: an order from P1 arrived in P4 (lead_time=3) and an order from P3 arrived in P4 (lead_time=1). The P2 order of 238 units is still in-transit and overdue based on the promise, but consistent with a lead time of 3 or more. Demand over the first 5 periods (217, 213, 163, 181, 185) averages 191.8 units. The recent demand (last 3 periods: 163, 181, 185) averages 176.33, suggesting a slight stabilization at a lower level than the first two periods. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend adapt to the observed lead time average (currently (3+1)/2 = 2). I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to reflect the full demand history while weighting it towards current realities, and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the standard deviation of these initial samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $158.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with a slight downward trend, averaging approximately 190 units over the last 5 periods (217, 213, 163, 181, 177). Regarding lead times, the promised lead time is 2. However, we have observed actual lead times of 3 periods (P1 order arrived P4) and 1 period (P3 order arrived P4), while the P2 order is still in transit as of P6. This suggests high variability in arrival times. The current on-hand inventory is very low (19 units) because the P2 order hasn't arrived. Since L=2 is the promised time and the average of 3 and 1 is 2, I will use 'calculate' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use the last 5 periods (recent_N) to capture the most relevant demand patterns while maintaining enough samples to account for variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history: Period 1 order arrived in P4 (lead_time=3), Period 2 order (238 units) is currently missing (6 periods have passed since P2 decision), and Period 3 order arrived in P4 (lead_time=1). The 'In-transit' quantity of 698 units likely accounts for the missing P2 order (238), the P5 order (230), and the P6 order (230). On-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 6. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging 190.6 over the first 6 periods (217, 213, 163, 181, 177, 193). Because the P2 shipment is significantly overdue, I will use an 'explicit' lead time of 3 to reflect the longest observed arrival delay and to buffer against the current stockout. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the mean of all 6 samples (approx 190.6) multiplied by (1+L), which is 190.6 * 4 = 762.4. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture historical volatility across the lead time.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Looking at the history, the on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 763 units in transit. Demand has been fairly stable, averaging approximately 192 units over the first seven periods (samples: 217, 213, 163, 181, 177, 193, 202). Period 7 saw a stockout. Regarding lead times, the promised lead time is 2. However, historical performance shows variability: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods, and Period 3's order arrived in 1 period. Notably, several orders (Period 2, 5, 6) have not yet concluded, creating a lag. Currently, in-transit units include orders from P2 (238), P5 (230), P6 (230), and P7 (65). Given the recent stockout and the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 50%. However, with 0 on-hand, we must ensure we don't under-order if lead times remain unstable. I am setting L to 'calculate' to use the average observed lead time (which is currently (3+1)/2 = 2). I will use the mean of all 7 periods for mu_hat (approx 192.3 * 3 = 577) to smooth out recent stockout-driven demand noise.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analyzing the history, demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with an average of approximately 188 units per period over the last 8 periods. There is no significant upward or downward trend. My focus is on the lead time behavior. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but the observed lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period, Period 5 arrived in 3 periods, and Period 7 arrived in 1 period. This suggests an average lead time of 2 periods, though with high variance. Currently, we have 113 units on hand and 468 units in transit. The in-transit units are from orders placed in Periods 2 and 6 (230 each, totaling 460, plus the 8 remaining from a previous period logic). Specifically, the Period 2 order (238 units) has not arrived after 7 periods, signaling it is likely lost. The Period 6 order (230 units) is due to arrive shortly. Given the lead time volatility and suspected lost shipment, I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the average lead time and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to focus on the most stable recent demand data, ensuring the base stock covers the lead time plus current period (1+L=3) plus a safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing history: Demand has been relatively stable with a mean around 180 (samples from Period 1-9: 217, 213, 163, 181, 177, 193, 202, 182, 158). The average demand is 185.4. Lead time observations show a pattern: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 in 1 period, Period 5 in 3 periods, and Period 7 in 1 period. This suggests an alternating or stochastic lead time averaging (3+1+3+1)/4 = 2 periods, which matches the promised lead time of 2. However, the system is currently stock-out (on-hand: 0) because the Period 9 order has not arrived yet. Applying OR parameters: L=2 (default), mu_hat based on the average demand across (1+L)=3 periods (3 * 185.4 = 556). sigma_hat is calculated using all samples to capture the volatility. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover demand until the next order arrives, accounting for the 635 units currently in-transit.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been consistently missed in periods 6, 7, 9, and 10 due to lead time volatility. Historical data shows two patterns: Period 1 was L=3, Period 3 was L=1, Period 5 was L=3, and Period 7 was L=1. This suggests an oscillating actual lead time or an average actual lead time of 2, despite the 'promised' 2 periods often resulting in 3. Currently, 635 units are in-transit (orders from Period 2, 6, and 9). The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 187 units. To ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock level given the stockouts and L=3 occurrences, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the risk of longer arrivals and use the last 5 periods of demand to capture the recent mean of ~185. This will increase the safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time volatility: observed sequence of 3, 1, 3, 1 periods. Average actual lead time is 2, but requires L=3 to avoid stockouts on longer cycles.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Current on-hand inventory is 0. History shows a fluctuating lead time pattern (3, 1, 3, 1). The last arrival occurred in Period 8. Based on the pattern, the order from Period 9 (167 units) should have arrived in Period 10 or 11 if lead time was 1 or 2, but it hasn't arrived yet, suggesting a lead time of 3 (due in Period 12 resolution). Currently, 739 units are in transit (from Periods 9, 11, and the missing Period 2 order which is likely lost). Demand is stable: the mean of the last 11 samples is approximately 185. To protect against the upper bound of the observed lead time (3 periods) and the high stockout risk seen in recent periods, I am setting L to 3. This increases the base stock level to cover the longer lead time realization. Demand mu_hat is set to (1+L) * mean of all samples to reflect the 4-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. The lead time has shown a persistent pattern of alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P1: L=3, P3: L=1, P5: L=3, P7: L=1, P9: L=3). Based on this pattern, the order placed in Period 11 is likely to arrive in Period 12 (L=1, visible in P13 conclude) or Period 14 (L=3, visible in P15 conclude). Since 'Period 12 conclude' showed an arrival from P9 but not P11, P11 follows the L=3 cycle or is simply following the promised L=2. To be safe given the stockouts in P6, P7, P9, P10, and P11, I will use L=3 to ensure the inventory covers the maximum observed lead time. Demand is relatively stable, fluctuating around a mean of ~185. I will use the mean of the last 10 samples to calculate mu_hat, adjusted for the L=3 lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14. Historical demand shows a steady regime with a mean around 180 (last 13 periods average: ~184 units/period). Lead time has been highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P9 arrived in P12, L=3). Orders from P11 (L=2? L=3?) and P12 (L=2?) are still in-transit. Based on the carry-over insight from Period 11, the underlying lead time alternates. To prevent stockouts during the L=3 cycles, I will explicitly set L=3 for the safety stock calculation. The mu_hat will be based on the recent demand average (~182) scaled by (1+L)=4, which is 728. Because we are currently out of stock (ending on-hand=0) and have 707 in-transit, setting mu_hat slightly above the in-transit amount will trigger the replenishment necessary to bridge the gap until the next arrival.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) while waiting for multiple staggered shipments. Historical data confirms a volatile lead time pattern oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P4: 3 and 1; P8: 3 and 1; P12: 3; P14: 3). Although the average is 2, using L=3 is necessary to account for the frequent 'long' cycles and prevent stockouts. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable since Period 1, with a mean around 180 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this stable regime while filtering out the earliest noise. Setting L to an explicit 3 ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the 3-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=4 periods of demand).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current inventory status shows on-hand is 0 and pipeline inventory is 709 units. Lead time is volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2. Significant stockouts have occurred because the OR backend's cap mechanism (based on promised lead time L=2) doesn't account for the alternating 3-period cycles. To protect against the 3-period lead time peaks, I am setting L to 3. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable with a slight downward trend. Historical demand samples (last 15 periods + 5 provided) show an average around 175-180 units. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the most recent demand levels while setting L=3 to ensure the inventory target (base stock) covers the likely 3-period delay. The current in-transit (709) is quite high compared to average demand, but given we are at 0 on-hand, we must ensure future orders aren't prematurely capped if the lead time stays at 3.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with a recent mean of approximately 161 units (last 5 periods). The lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, though recently sticking to 3 periods (P12, P13 both arrived with L=3). As noted in the Carry-over Insight, setting L=3 is necessary to handle the longer arrival cycles and avoid stockouts, even though the promised lead time is 2. The current inventory is low (on-hand: 6) and there is a significant amount in-transit (578), including orders from P14 (14 units) and P15 (96 units) which are expected to arrive in P17 or P18. I am using recent_N for both demand mean and standard deviation to capture the current regime of ~161 units/period while maintaining L=3 for safety. This strategy ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for a 4-period window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a downward trend recently, averaging approximately 124.5 units over the last two periods compared to the overall mean of ~174 units. Lead times continue to be volatile, primarily clustering around 3 periods despite a promised lead time of 2. Currently, there's a stockout (on-hand: 0) with 660 units in-transit. To prevent further stockouts and account for the 3-period lead time observed consistently in the last 6 concluded cycles (Periods 12-17), I am setting L=3. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=5 to capture the recent cooling in demand while maintaining a buffer for recovery (Mean of P13-P17 is ~140). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the current variability in these recent samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility stabilized at 3 periods for the last 6 consecutive arrivals (Orders from P9, P11, P12, P13, P14 concluded with L=3). Demand regime has shifted lower starting Period 16, averaging ~125 units.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19, the demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a lower regime. Since Period 16, demand readings have been 125, 124, and 145, averaging ~131.3 units, compared to the earlier average of ~178. Lead time has consistently stabilized at 3 periods for the last 6 observed arrivals (Orders from P9, P11, P12, P13, P14), despite a promised lead time of 2. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 0 and 660 units in transit (cumulative orders from P15 onwards). The order from Period 15 (96 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P19) given the observed L=3 from P15 to P18 conclude. I will set L=3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time. For demand, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the lower demand regime and prevent overstocking as the system recovers from the current stockout and processes the large pipeline.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a severe stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical analysis shows lead times have stabilized at 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. From P16-P19, demand has shown a slight downward shift followed by a spike (125, 124, 145, 172). I am setting L=3 to account for the actual lead time observed. For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N=5 (Periods 15-19) to capture the recent mean demand shift (~146/period), resulting in a forecast covering the (L+1)=4 period window. Despite the 660 units in transit, the back-to-back zero arrival in P18 and P19 suggests a significant delivery gap that the OR backend needs to reconcile; setting a higher mu_hat and \u03c3\u0302 will help ensure the order covers the risk of continued lead-time extension or demand fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Verified sustained lead time of 3 periods across 7 consecutive orders (P9-P14). Demand regime is volatile but averaging ~145 units over the last 5 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a severe stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical lead times have stabilized at 3 periods (observed for orders P9, P11, P12, P13, and P14). I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect this reality, rather than the promised 2. Demand has shown a moderate recovery in the last 5 periods (P16-P20), averaging approximately 150 units per period (125, 124, 145, 172, 182). I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this upward trend while damping the extreme volatility seen in earlier periods. sigma_hat will also use recent_N of 5 to reflect current variance. Despite the high pipeline inventory of 660 units, the lead time delay means these units are not yet available to meet current demand, and the OR engine needs to account for the (L+1)=4 period horizon. Setting L=3 ensures the base stock calculation covers 4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains stable at 3 periods (last 7 arrivals). Demand regime has transitioned from a low of ~125 (P16-17) back toward a higher average of ~160 over the last 3 periods following a mid-game dip.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 22 with 0 on-hand inventory and 660 units in-transit. History shows a sustained lead time of 3 periods (observed consistently from P9-P14 orders), although no arrivals have been recorded since P17. This indicates a potential bottleneck or mass delay. The orders currently in transit are from P15 (96 units), P17 (96 units), P18 (0), P19 (0), P20 (0), and P21 (0), which is unusual. Wait, checking the history: actually, the 'In-transit' figure of 660 units suggests multiple orders are pending that haven't arrived yet. Looking at recent demand: P18: 145, P19: 172, P20: 182, P21: 162. The demand has recovered from the brief dip in P16-17 and is now averaging approximately 165 units over the last 4 periods. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level q = 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the real-world delay identified in carry-over insights. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level (~165) while discounting the earlier lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 21, demand has stabilized at a higher level (~165/period) following the Period 16-17 dip. Inventory depletion to 0 is caused by lead-time delays and prior under-ordering; in-transit volume is high (660) but arrivals are currently stalled since P17 conclude.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0 and no arrivals since the Period 17 conclude (which was the order from Period 14). We have 660 units in-transit, which includes orders from Period 15 (96 units) and Period 17 (96 units), plus a large block of 468 units accumulated from earlier periods where on-hand was 0. Given the 'Carry-Over Insights' and history, lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for most successful cycles, though we are currently experiencing a significant delay (Period 15's order is now 8 periods old). However, orders are not 'concluded' as lost yet. I will set L=3 as it has been the consistent actual lead time for the last several successful arrivals. For demand, the last 4 periods (P19-P22) have averaged 157 units (172, 182, 162, 112). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility and the recent dip in Period 22, while acknowledging the backend will scale this by (1+L). The OR backend's inventory calculation (on-hand + in-transit) will see the 660 units against a base stock target of roughly (1+3)*157 = 628, likely resulting in a zero or small order until the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: In-transit pipeline is significantly delayed: Order from Period 15 (L=2 promised) has not arrived as of Period 23 start (8 periods elapsed). Pipeline inventory (660) now exceeds the calculated (1+L) base stock requirements.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently experiencing a massive lead-time failure. The order placed in Period 15 (96 units) has now been 'in-transit' for 8 periods, far exceeding the promised 2 and the previously observed stable lead-time of 3. There have been no arrivals since Period 17 conclude (which was the order from Period 14). Total in-transit inventory is 660 units (comprising orders from P15, P17, and potentially others if they were placed but not noted as ordered=0). On-hand inventory is 0 and demand is being completely lost. The OR backend's logic for calculating the order is: final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). With a pipeline of 660 units and a demand regime of ~150-160, the pipeline already far exceeds any reasonable (1+L) base stock. Therefore, even with explicit settings, the backend will likely order 0. I will maintain L=3 as the 'stable' baseline for when shipments resume, but the primary issue is the bottleneck. Demand has fluctuated between 112-182 over the last 6 periods, averaging 147. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this recent volatility while the system waits for the backlog to clear.

Carry-over insight: Critical Supply Failure: No arrivals for 6 consecutive periods (P18-P23). Order from P15 (96 units) is 6 periods past expected arrival (L=3), suggesting systemic delay or loss of recent shipments.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a state of critical supply chain failure. No inventory has arrived for 7 consecutive periods (P18-P24), and the order from P15 (96 units) is now 7 periods past its expected arrival (L=3). There are 660 units currently in-transit (orders from P15, P17, and possibly others if the backend auto-filled). The pipeline is saturated far beyond any reasonable demand forecast for (1+L) periods. Demand has softened recently, averaging ~120 over the last 3 periods (P22-P24). Since the backend uses a capped policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), and our pipeline (660) is roughly 4-5x the current (1+L) demand (approx 120-150), additional orders are neither necessary nor possible under the cap. I will maintain L=3 and use recent_N=3 for demand to reflect the downward trend, while effectively placing no new orders due to the pipeline saturation. The primary goal is to wait for the logjam of in-transit inventory to break.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Failure: No arrivals for 7 consecutive periods (P18-P24). Order from P15 is 10 periods old; total pipeline (660) creates a massive surplus once delivered. Demand has cooled to ~120/period (P22-P24).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a STATE OF SYSTEMIC SUPPLY FAILURE. No orders have arrived for 8 consecutive periods (P18-P25). The last successful arrival was in Period 17 (order from P14). The order placed in Period 15 is now 11 periods old (promised lead time 2, inferred 3). There are 660 units currently 'In-transit', which is significantly more than our total demand over any foreseeable lead time (avg demand ~146). Ordering more units now would be counter-productive as the OR backend's capped policy will already be triggered by the massive pipeline relative to the base stock calculation, and any additional orders would only exacerbate future holding costs once the logjam clears. We must maintain L at its highest recently observed stable value (3) and hold ordering at 0 by allowing the pipeline to cover all theoretical requirements until arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Failure persists as of Period 26: No arrivals for 8 consecutive periods (P18-P25). Total in-transit (660) is roughly 4-5 times the current period demand (~146), making the pipeline sufficient for ~4 periods of inventory once it arrives.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of systemic failure. There have been no arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (since Period 17 conclude, which was an order from Period 14). Specifically, orders from Periods 15 (96 units) and 17 (96 units) are now massively overdue (12 and 10 periods since ordering, respectively). The total in-transit pipeline is 660 units, while the current demand regime (recent_N=5) averages approximately 125 units per period. If the backend OR logic calculates a base stock (1+L) * mu_hat, even with L=3, the requirement would be roughly 500 units. Since pipeline inventory (660) already exceeds this coverage requirement, any positive order would likely lead to excessive holding costs once the logjam clears. I will continue to set all parameters to force a zero-order state (holding L at the presumed actual lead time of 3, and using recent demand trends), relying on the massive pipeline to satisfy demand whenever arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Failure persists as of Period 27: 9 consecutive periods without arrivals. Order from P15 is now 12 periods old. Pipeline (660) remains more than sufficient to cover 4-5 periods of demand once delivered.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28, the systemic supply failure has reached its 10th consecutive period without an arrival. The oldest pending order (Period 15) is now 13 periods overdue. The total in-transit pipeline of 660 units is roughly 4-5 times the current average demand (~140-150 units/period). Since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), and our pipeline (660) far exceeds the probable base stock for L=2 or L=3 (roughly 450-600 units), the backend will naturally refrain from ordering more. I will maintain L=3 explicitly to reflect the most recent 'normal' lead time and use recent_N (N=10) for demand estimation to account for the \ucd5c\uadfc volatile demand (ranging from 79 to 182). No new orders should be placed until visibility into the pipeline is restored.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Failure persists as of Period 28: 10 consecutive periods without arrivals. Pipeline (660) remains very high relative to recent demand, making further ordering unnecessary until arrivals resume.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29, the systemic supply failure has persisted for 11 consecutive periods (no arrivals since Period 17). The in-transit pipeline (660 units) is extremely high, representing approximately 5-6 periods of recent average demand (~110-120 units). Current on-hand inventory is 0, but additional ordering is irrational because the OR backend's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) would result in zero anyway, and adding more to the pipeline while it is stalled increases the risk of massive future holding costs once the logjam clears. I will continue to hold the L at 3 periods to maintain a proper service level calculation should arrivals resume, but I am setting demand parameters conservatively (recent_N=5) to reflect the recent cooling trend in demand (averaging ~111 over P24-P28) compared to earlier regimes.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Failure persists as of Period 29: 11 consecutive periods without arrivals. Pipeline (660) remains very high relative to recent demand (P24-P28 avg: 111).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30, the 'Systemic Supply Failure' has entered its 12th consecutive period without a single arrival. The last arrival occurred in Period 17 (order from P14). The oldest undelivered order from Period 15 is now 15 periods old\u2014far exceeding the promised lead time of 2 and the previously observed actual lead time of 3. Currently, there are 660 units in-transit. Mean demand has dropped over the last 5 periods (P25-P29) to approximately 107 units/period. Given that 660 units represent over 6 periods of supply at current demand rates, and since nothing is arriving, placing additional orders would only exacerbate future holding costs if the backlog suddenly clears, or be wasted if the supply line is permanently broken. I will continue to hold ordering (ordering 0) by setting L and mu_hat such that the base stock level remains below the current pipeline of 660 units. I am setting an explicit L of 3 (the last known reliable lead time) and mu_hat reflecting a slightly conservative demand estimate to minimize the risk of over-ordering once arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Failure persists as of Period 30: 12 consecutive periods without arrivals. Pipeline (660) is significantly larger than current demand requirements (P25-P29 avg: 107).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to experience a complete supply chain failure, with no arrivals for 13 consecutive periods (last arrival was in Period 17). The in-transit pipeline of 660 units consists of orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22. This pipeline is significantly higher than the current demand requirements. Recent demand (P26-P30) averages 103.8 units per period. With 660 units in transit, we have roughly 6 periods of supply queued up. Ordering more units now would only exacerbate potential holding cost issues if the pipeline clears all at once. We maintain L=3 based on the last known stable lead time, but effectively keep the base stock calculation low to prevent any new orders until the existing pipeline begins to arrive. Demand has shown a downward trend but remains volatile.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Failure persists as of Period 31: 13 consecutive periods without arrivals. Pipeline (660) is roughly 6x recent average demand (P26-P30 avg: 104).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32, we are facing an unprecedented supply chain disruption with 14 consecutive periods of zero arrivals (since Period 18). The last shipment to arrive was ordered in Period 14 and arrived in Period 17. There are currently 660 units in-transit (orders from Period 15 onwards), which is more than sufficient to cover approximately 6 periods of demand based on the recent average of ~105 units (P27-P31). Ordering more units now would be counterproductive as it would only increase future holding costs once the logjam clears, especially since on-hand inventory is effectively zero and we are already losing all demand. The strategy remains to maintain a 'zero' order signal by keeping the pipeline inventory (660) above the base stock calculation until arrivals resume. I will continue using a conservative lead time (L=3) and a demand forecast reflecting the recent cooling (~105/period).

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Failure persists as of Period 32: 14 consecutive periods without arrivals. In-transit pipeline (660) is significantly larger than current demand requirements (P27-P31 avg: 103).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to exhibit a total supply chain failure for 'chips(Regular)' with no arrivals since Period 17 (15 consecutive periods). The on-hand inventory is 0, while the in-transit pipeline is stagnant at 660 units. This pipeline contains orders from Periods 15, 17, and likely several other unfulfilled requests. The 660 units currently in transit are more than sufficient to cover approximately 6 periods of demand based on the recent 5-period average (P28-P32) of ~105 units/period. Ordering more would only exacerbate potential future holding costs if the pipeline suddenly clears. Therefore, I am maintaining zero orders by setting parameters that result in a base stock lower than the pipeline inventory. I will stick with L=3 based on historical stability before the failure, and calculate mu_hat using the last 7 periods to reflect the sustained lower demand regime (~103 units).

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Failure persists as of Period 33: 15 consecutive periods without arrivals. In-transit pipeline (660) is roughly 6x recent average demand (P28-P32 avg: 105).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34, we are in the 17th consecutive period of a complete supply chain failure, with no arrivals since Period 17 (last arrival was from Period 14). The order from Period 15 is now 19 periods old, far exceeding the promised lead time of 2 or the previously observed lead time of 3. There is an extremely large pipeline of 660 units currently in-transit, which represents approximately 6.3 periods of supply relative to the recent 5-period average demand of 111.2 units (Period 29-33). Adding more orders to this stalled pipeline would only increase the risk of massive holding costs once the bottleneck breaks, especially since the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1 (targeting a 50% service level). Therefore, I maintain an 'order zero' strategy by keeping the pipeline inventory high and ensuring the OR engine's order logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in no new orders.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Failure persists as of Period 34: 16 consecutive periods without arrivals. In-transit pipeline (660) is roughly 6x recent average demand (P29-P33 avg: 111).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a catastrophic failure, with no arrivals for 17 consecutive periods (since Period 17). Currently, there are 660 units in-transit, which were ordered between Periods 15 and 21. Given the recent demand average of approximately 111 units per period (P29-P33), the existing pipeline of 660 units is sufficient to cover nearly 6 periods of demand once it eventually arrives. Placing additional orders now would only exacerbate the risk of excessive holding costs if the backlog arrives simultaneously. The priority remains managing the existing pipeline. Therefore, I am continuing to set parameters that result in zero new orders by maintaining a standard lead time and demand forecast while the pipeline remains significantly higher than the theoretical base stock.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Failure persists as of Period 35: 17 consecutive periods without arrivals. In-transit pipeline (660) is roughly 6x recent average demand (P30-P34 avg: 113).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a severe supply failure state. No units have arrived for 18 consecutive periods (since Period 17). The last successful arrival was an order from Period 14. There are currently 660 units in-transit (ordered between Periods 2 and 17), which remains significantly higher than any reasonable estimate of the base stock level given the current demand trend. Average demand over the last 10 periods (P26-P35) has fallen to approximately 102.8 units per period. If the 660 units in-transit were to arrive, they would cover more than 6 periods of demand. Placing additional orders now would only exacerbate future holding costs without solving the current stockout, as the bottleneck is in the supply chain rather than the order quantity. Therefore, I continue to set parameters that result in zero new orders while maintaining the 'explicit' lead time to reflect the actual delayed state.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Failure persists as of Period 36: 18 consecutive periods without arrivals. Pipeline (660) is roughly 6.5x recent average demand (P26-P35 avg: 103).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of systemic failure, with no arrivals recorded since Period 17 (19 consecutive periods). The 'In-transit' quantity has increased to 797 units following a small order in Period 36, which is more than 7 times the recent average demand (~110 units). Given that the backend caps orders based on pipeline inventory (base_stock - pipeline), and my pipeline is far in excess of any reasonable base stock for a (1+L) period horizon, I will continue to hold ordering. I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current lower demand regime (averaging ~106 units) while setting L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the last known stable lead time before the outage, though the actual delay is now exceeding 20 periods for the oldest items. No further orders are needed until the current massive pipeline begins to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Failure persists as of Period 37: 19 consecutive periods without arrivals. In-transit pipeline (797) is roughly 7x recent average demand (P27-P36 avg: 106).

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially resumed as the order from Period 36 arrived in Period 37 (actual lead time of 1, vs promised 2). However, there is still a massive backlog of 660 units from Periods 15-23 that has not arrived, which is significantly older than the promised or recently observed lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 36 units. Recent demand (P32-P37) averages 101 units per period. If I order more now, I risk extreme overstocking if the 660 units arrive simultaneously. However, to maintain service levels in case the backlog is lost, I will adjust L to reflect the current observation (1 period) and keep \u03bc\u0302 aligned with recent demand (~110). Given the OR backend's logic, a pipeline of 660 will result in zero orders unless I use an 'explicit' L or \u03bc\u0302 to override the state; I will set parameters to 'default' and 'recent_N' to let the OR engine realize the pipeline is already full, thus avoiding unnecessary costs while monitoring the stuck shipment.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain activity resumed in P37: P36 order arrived with L=1. Pre-P36 backlog (660 units) remains missing for 14+ periods and is likely lost or significantly delayed. Recent demand regime (P32-P37) is stable at ~101 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Supply chain activity resumed in P37 with an order from P36 arriving with L=1. However, the 660 units ordered between P15 and P23 (the 'lost backlog') have not arrived for over 15 periods and must be treated as lost. Consequently, the 'In-transit' figure of 660 is misleading for the OR backend, which assumes all units in the pipeline will eventually arrive. To force the OR engine to place a new order despite this ghost pipeline, I must set the lead time L to 'explicit' at 2 (the promised value) and mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the current demand forecast (avg ~100) and offsets the 660 units currently in-transit that the backend will subtract. Demand has slowed recently (P38 demand was 69; P32-P37 avg ~101). Target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods is ~300. To order ~300 units while the backend subtracts 660, I set mu_hat to 960 (300 target + 660 in-transit offset). Sigma_hat is set to a recent 10-period window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Resumed supply chain activity in Period 37 confirms that orders can now arrive with L=1. The batch of 660 units ordered between P15-P23 is confirmed lost (15+ periods overdue).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Supply chain activity has resumed as of Period 37, with evidence of L=1 (Order P36 arrived P37). The 660 units ordered between P15 and P23 (pipeline backlog) have not arrived for 16-24 periods and are medically confirmed lost. Consequently, total effective in-transit inventory is far lower than the headline 960 units. Specifically, only the P39 order (300 units) is considered active. Demand has fluctuated but remains lower than the early game, averaging ~96 units over the last 5 periods. With on-hand at 0 and only 300 units in the 'live' pipeline, I will set L to 1 (recent actual) and use recent_N for demand to bridge the gap and ensure the OR backend ignores the noise of the large (lost) historical pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain resumed in Period 37 with L=1 confirmed. Sequence of orders from P15 to P23 (660 units) are confirmed lost/blocked indefinitely. Effective pipeline is only composed of orders placed from P36 onwards.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Supply chain activity resumed in Period 37, confirming that new orders arrive with an actual lead time of L=1 (observed for orders placed in P36 and P39). The historical pipeline of 660 units (ordered P15-P23) is confirmed lost/blocked as it is now over 15 periods overdue. Current on-hand inventory is 246 units. Recent demand (P36-P40) is averaging ~89.6 units, but has shown high volatility (range: 54-113). Since L=1, the base stock needs to cover (1+L)=2 periods of demand. With 246 units on hand, we already have approximately 2.7 periods of demand covered (246 / 90). The OR engine's 'cap' and base stock logic will automatically suggest a 0 order if pipeline + on-hand exceeds the target. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent stabilized (though lower) regime and L=1 to reflect the restored fast delivery speed.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has resumed operations with a consistent actual lead time of 1 period, as evidenced by orders from P36 and P39 arriving in P37 and P40 respectively. The backlog of 660 units from P15-P23 is confirmed lost. Current on-hand inventory is 136 units. Demand has entered a lower regime, with the last 10 periods (P32-P41) averaging approximately 95 units, significantly lower than the early game. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which means we should aim for a base stock close to the mean demand over the protection interval (1+L periods). With L=1, the protection interval is 2 periods. The current on-hand inventory (136) is sufficient to cover the next period with a buffer, but because the OR backend subtracts the 'lost' 660 units in-transit from the calculated base stock, it would likely result in no order. To correct for the lost pipeline, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that reflects the desired base stock (approx 200 units for 2 periods) plus the lost units (660), effectively telling the OR backend that our 'ideal' level including the phantom units is 860. This ensures the engine places an order to maintain on-hand flow.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilized at L=1 (confirmed arrivals P37, P40). Demand regime P32-P41 stabilized at ~95 units/period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time (L) of 1 period, as confirmed by arrivals in Period 37 and 40. The systemic supply failure (Periods 18-36) resulted in 660 units being lost; those units remain in the 'in-transit' statistics but are not expected to arrive. For Period 43, on-hand inventory is 35 and there is a 54-unit order (placed P42) which will arrive during Period 43. Total reliable pipeline + on-hand is 89 units. The demand regime from P32 to P42 has stabilized at an average of ~99 units per period with moderate volatility. I am setting L=1 (explicit) to align with recent observations. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*100 = 200 using the explicit method to reflect the stable ~100/period demand. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=11) to capture the current volatility profile since the demand cooled down. This strategy ensures we replenish enough to meet the 100-unit demand while accounting for the units arriving this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~100 units/period (P32-P42). Lead time is verified at L=1 for recent functional shipments. The 660 units ordered between P15-P23 are confirmed lost and ignored for pipeline calculations.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of L=1 (confirmed by recent arrivals in Period 37 and 40). Historical data shows that orders placed before Period 36 (660 units) are lost/discarded and should be ignored for pipeline calculations. The current in-transit inventory is 714 units (effectively orders from P42 onwards plus the 'lost' units the OR engine still counts). Since the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base stock, and the pipeline includes these 660 lost units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this. Average demand is ~100. Base stock for L=1 should be ~200. To force an order when the pipeline is 'clogged' with 660 lost units, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order (mu_hat approx 660 + 200 = 860). However, the OR engine also caps the order. I will set the lead time L to 1 (actual) and use explicit mu_hat to overcome the phantom pipeline while maintaining a safety buffer for the current stable demand of ~100.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain resumed functionality starting Period 37 with a consistent lead time of L=1 (confirmed by arrivals in P37 and P40). Orders placed between P15 and P23 (660 units) are confirmed lost and must be ignored. While total in-transit shows 860 units, the functional pipeline is actually 200 units (146 from P44, 54 from P42). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has cooled recently, dropping from an average of ~100 to an average of ~68 over the last three periods (P42: 101, P43: 63, P44: 61). I will adjust mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture this deceleration (averaging ~78/period). Given L=1, the required inventory to cover the review and lead period (2 periods) is approximately 156 units. The functional pipeline (200) currently exceeds this, so the OR backend will likely mitigate further ordering to avoid overstocking while demand remains at this lower level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has softened significantly: P42-P44 average is ~75 units/period, down from the previous ~100 average. L=1 is the current stable lead time.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 41-45) has softened significantly, averaging 79 units/period, compared to the earlier ~100 units/period average between Periods 32-41. This represents a distinct downward shift in volume. The lead time remains volatile but generally functional again; while orders from P36 and P39 arrived with L=1, the order from P42 arrived with L=3. To be safe, I will treat the effective lead time as 3 periods to prevent stockouts during these longer cycles. The current in-transit (806 units) includes the long-confirmed 'lost' batch of 660 units (from P15-P23), which must be ignored. Effective in-transit is therefore 146 units (ordered Period 44). With on-hand at 0, the current pipeline of 146 units is insufficient for a (1+L=4) period window at the current ~79 demand rate (~316 units needed). I set mu_hat to explicitly account for this new softened demand regime (79 * 4) and use the recent demand variance to set sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand softening: Period 42-45 average demand is ~79 units/period, down from previous ~100 average. Lead time remains erratic but functional, with recent observations of L=1 and L=3; L=3 remains the conservative planning lead time.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has softened significantly over the last 5 periods (P42-P46), averaging approximately 69.2 units. Lead time remains erratic but functional; while P36 and P39 arrived with L=1, the P42 order arrived with L=3. Period 44's order (146 units) is currently in-transit and should arrive by P47 (if L=3). Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline (excluding the 660 lost units) is 146 units, the stock needs to be replenished based on the updated demand mean (~70) and a conservative lead time (L=3). I will use recent_N=5 for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the current softening and L=3 (explicit) to account for the most recent lead-time observation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently recovering from a major disruption. I have confirmed that the 660 units ordered between P15-P23 are effectively lost as they are over 25 periods overdue. Recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P36: L=1, P39: L=1, P42: L=3). To be conservative and prevent stockouts, I am using L=3 for parameter calculations. The current pipeline inventory (In-transit: 806) is heavily skewed by the lost 660 units; therefore, the 'real' active pipeline consists only of the 146 units ordered in Period 44. Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and the current active pipeline (146 units) is already significant compared to recent demand (P44-P47 average ~62 units/period), the OR backend's capped policy should naturally prevent over-ordering. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the sustained softening in demand observed since Period 42 (~75 units/period average), and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect this lower-volume stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains soft at ~75 units/period (P42-P47 average: ~68.3). Lead time remains erratic but functional with L=3 being the safest planning horizon for current conditions.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has resumed functionality but remains erratic. Recent arrivals (P37, P40) showed L=1, but the P45 arrival (from P42) confirmed that L=3 is still a frequent and necessary planning horizon. A block of 660 units from P15-P23 is confirmed lost. Current in-transit inventory (806) includes the lost 660 units and a pending order for 146 units from P44. Excluding the lost units, the effective pipeline is only 146 units. Demand has shifted lower, averaging ~68 units over the last 7 periods (P42-P48). With on-hand inventory at 0 and the next expected arrival (P44 order) likely arriving between P45+1 and P45+3, we must maintain a conservative L=3 to prevent stockouts while reflecting the lower demand regime (~70/period). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 samples to match this softened demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand softening: Period 42-48 average demand is ~74 units/period. Effective pipeline excludes 660 lost units from P15-P23.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the final period, the goal is to maximize the terminal reward. The on-hand inventory is 0, and the in-transit pipeline is 806 units. Historically, 660 units from Periods 15-23 were confirmed lost, meaning the effective pipeline consists only of orders placed from P36 onwards (P36: 137 [arrived], P39: 300 [arrived], P42: 54 [arrived], P44: 146). Effectively, only 146 units are 'live' in transit. However, any order placed in Period 50 will not arrive until Period 51 or later, which is beyond the game's horizon. Since the backend policy is base-stock minus pipeline, and current pipeline (even excluding lost units) plus on-hand is likely sufficient for any terminal demand resolution without incurring unnecessary holding costs for units that won't arrive in time, I will set parameters to ensure no new order is placed. Demand has softened to ~71.4 units/period (P42-P49). Lead time is treated as L=3 for safety based on the most recent arrival (P45). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent softened demand regime.
