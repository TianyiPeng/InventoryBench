Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is provided (avg: 182, std: 35.6). Since we have no observation of actual lead times yet, I will use the promised lead time (L=2). The OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy. To ensure we have enough stock to cover the review period plus the promised lead time (L+1 = 3 periods), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand characteristics. This provides a balance between service level and holding costs while we await the first arrivals.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 238 units with a promised lead time of 2. As expected (L=2), these arrived=0 in the Period 1 conclude message (they are still in transit and will likely arrive during Period 3). Since on-hand was 0 in Period 1, we missed the demand of 217 units; however, we now have data points to refine our forecast. Mean demand is currently 217 (Period 1). The 'In-transit' quantity of 238 covers the initial stock-out. For Period 2, I will use 'default' lead time (2) and recent demand observations to set parameters. Since we only have one demand point (217), 'default' or 'recent_N' with N=3 (capped by current history) will utilize this sample. The target is to maintain a base stock that covers demand over (L+1) = 3 periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (238 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 471 units in transit (orders from P1 and P2). Historical demand for Regular chips is stable: P1=217, P2=213 (note: user prompt history says 213, but demand data summary says P1=217, P2=207, P3=170; I will prioritize the summary data provided in 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' for the forecast). The latest demand samples (P1-P5) are 217, 207, 170, 131, 185, but P4-P5 are future-dated relative to the 'Current Status' of P3. Based on P1-P2 (avg ~212), I will set parameters to cover the (L+1) window. Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet, I'll stick to the default promised lead time and use 'recent_N' with N=2 to weight the early demand observations.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 and Period 2 are expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3 and Period 4 respectively. However, based on the 'Period 3 conclude' message, the order from Period 1 (placed at P1) has not yet arrived (arrived=0). According to the rules, with L=2, an order placed in P1 arrives in P3 and its arrival becomes visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of P4. Since 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0, and it has been 2 periods since P1, there is either a delay or a loss. I will maintain the default lead time (L=2) for now but monitor for lost shipments. Demand shows a downward trend (217 -> 213 -> 163). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent decline and avoid over-ordering while waiting for the pipeline to arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3199.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival history from the Period 4 conclusion. Two orders arrived simultaneously in Period 4: the P1 order (238 units, lead time = 3) and the P3 order (183 units, lead time = 1). The P2 order (233 units) is noticeably missing; it should have arrived if lead time was 1 or 2, and since the P3 order arrived before it, the P2 shipment is likely lost. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show 3 and 1. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (3 and 1, avg=2). Regarding demand, the mean over 5 periods is approximately 182. Demand has drifted slightly downward from early peaks (>200) to current levels (131-185). I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and its volatility (ranging from 131 to 217). This setting helps the OR engine maintain a safety stock that accounts for the observed lead time variance and the potential for lost orders by tracking the total pipeline inventory against demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3300.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for Period_1 to Period_5 is [217, 213, 163, 181, 177], showing a slight downward trend or stabilization around 180-190 units (mean: 190.2). Lead time analysis: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), and Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The promised L=2 seems like a reasonable average, despite volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is 63, and in-transit is 488 (orders from P2, P4, P5). Given the variability in arrivals (P2 is still outstanding), I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current lower volume compared to the start, and 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to average the observed variances (1 and 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1197.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 6 where demand (193) significantly exceeded on-hand supply (63). Pipeline inventory is high at 701 units. Reviewing lead times: Order 1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), and Order 3 arrived in 1 period (P4). Order 2 (placed P2) is now 5 periods old and has not concluded, suggesting it is likely a lost shipment. Promised lead time is 2, but actual observations (3, 1, and potentially lost) show high variance. Demand has been relatively stable: P1: 217, P2: 213, P3: 163, P4: 181, P5: 177, P6: 193. The mean demand is approximately 190. Given the stockout and the likely loss of the Period 2 shipment, I need to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the current 0 on-hand balance while acknowledging the large in-transit volume. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture the stable mean of ~185-190. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed values, though I must remain cautious of the missing P2 order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $475.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains consistently high around 180-210 units per period. Lead times are volatile: Promised 2, but observed 1 and 3. Orders from P2 (233 units), P5 (230 units), and P6 (213 units) are currently in-transit and overdue or pending. Specifically, P2 was ordered 6 periods ago (P8-P2=6), which is significantly beyond the promised 2 and the maximum observed 3; this order may be lost. P5 and P6 were ordered 3 and 2 periods ago respectively; they are the most likely arrivals in the coming periods. To prevent stockouts given the recent lost sales (P6, P7), I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed arrival time) to increase the protection window. I'm using recent_N (N=5) for demand forecasting to capture the steady high demand and ensure mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: ranges from 1 to 3 periods. Order from Period 2 (233 units) is likely lost (6 periods elapsed without arrival).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3307.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable with a mean around 191 units (last 5 periods: 177, 193, 202, 182, and historical samples). The order from Period 2 (233 units) is now officially considered lost as 7 periods have elapsed without arrival, far exceeding the observed maximum lead time of 3. On-hand inventory is 151 units, and 450 units are in-transit (orders from Periods 6 and 8). Lead times observed so far are 3, 1, 3, 3, 1. Using 'calculate' for lead time will average these observations (average = 2.2). For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the stable demand pattern since Period 1. The OR engine will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that accounts for the 2.2-period lead time plus the review period, effectively buffering against the observed lead-time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 2 order (233 units) confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Current lead time observations fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2945.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the supply chain remains volatile. The inventory is currently 0, with 668 units in-transit. The order from Period 2 (233 units) is officially considered lost (8 periods elapsed). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods: P1(3), P3(1), P4(3), P5(3), P7(1), and P8(1). The average lead time of these 6 arrivals is 2.0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. However, to account for the lost shipment and the 3-period peaks, I will use 'calculate' for L. Demand has slightly softened in the most recent periods (P8: 182, P9: 158) compared to earlier periods. I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture this subtle downward trend (~175 average) while maintaining enough buffer for the observed variance. This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock that prioritizes high service levels (given the 19:1 profit-to-holding ratio) while adjusting to the current supply instability.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Period 2 order (233 units) confirmed lost (8 periods elapsed). Actual lead times are bimodal (either 1 or 3 periods), averaging 2.0 periods across 6 confirmed arrivals.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the agent is facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory and 754 units in-transit. Based on 'conclude' messages, the actual lead time is highly variable, oscillating between 1 period and 3 periods (Average is 2.0). The order from Period 2 (233 units) is officially categorized as lost. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has stabilized around an average of 184.6 units per period (177, 193, 202, 182, 188), which is higher than the long-term history including periods 3-4. To recover from the stockout and handle lead time volatility (L=3 peak), I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average of 2.0. mu_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the current demand regime (~185 units/period) across the lead time + review cycle. sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current demand volatility. This strategy aims to rebuild the pipeline to cover for the lost order and potential 3-period delays.

We are currently at Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory and 754 units in-transit.

To get the true pipeline inventory, we subtract the lost order (754 - 233 = 521 units). Recent demand (Periods 1-11) shows a stable mean of approximately 187 units per period. The lead time is highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average is 2.0). However, the system is currently experiencing a stockout because the orders from Period 9, 10, and 11 have not arrived yet. Given the bimodal lead time (1 or 3), and having seen no arrivals since Period 9, we must ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the variability. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to reflect the observed average of 2.0 periods, and 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while acknowledging recent stockouts don't reflect actual demand levels.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the on-hand inventory is 150 units with 446 units in transit (likely the orders from Period 6 and Period 11/12, though note that the 'In-transit' figure on the dashboard represents the total pipeline). The Period 2 order (233 units) is confirmed lost, as it is now 11 periods since it was placed. Historical lead times have stabilized at a bimodal pattern (1, 2, or 3 periods), with recent observations being 1, 3, 1, 3, and 2. The average lead time is approximately 2.0. Demand over the last 12 periods has been relatively stable, with an average of roughly 183 units per period. Since the ending inventory in Period 12 was 150 and current demand is around 180, we need to maintain a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) period cycle. I will set L to 'calculate' to use the average observed lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full history of the current stable regime while excluding the very first few initialization periods if necessary, though all 12 provide a consistent mean (~184).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the system is stockout (0 on-hand) following a stockout in Period 13 where demand (176) exceeded inventory (150). The order from Period 2 (233 units) is confirmed lost. Historical demand remains stable with a mean of ~183 units (excluding the low Period 4-5 samples, focus on last 13 periods). Lead times are highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Average: 2.1). Currently, 592 units are in-transit (orders from P11, P12, P13). Using L=2 is appropriate as the average. mu_hat is set using recent_N=13 to capture the stable demand mean (~183) multiplied by (1+L)=3, totaling ~549. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=13 to capture volatility. These settings ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time and the current period, accounting for the lost order by excluding it from 'pipeline inventory'.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout situation with 0 units on-hand. Historical demand for the last 14 periods shows a relatively stable mean of approximately 181 units per period (moving average of late periods 9-14 is ~171). However, the lead time is highly variable (1, 2, or 3 periods). The order from Period 2 is definitively lost. Currently, there are 735 units in-transit (orders from Period 6, 11, 13, 14, and potentially P2's lost units). Since the OR Backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (in-transit + on-hand) to calculate the order, and the in-transit figure erroneously includes the lost Period 2 order (233 units), I must use the OR parameters to compensate. I will set the lead time to an explicit '3' based on the observed maximum lead time and current stockouts. For mu_hat, I will use recent trends (last 5 periods mean approx 174) to set a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) coverage. Given the stockout and the 'in-transit' overhead of the lost shipment, I use a slightly higher mu_hat to ensure the OR logic places an order despite the pipeline bias.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a significant stockout occurring in Period 15. The 'In-transit' balance of 741 units corresponds to orders from Period 2 (233 units - confirmed lost), Period 6 (213 units - overdue, likely lost), Period 13 (146 units), Period 14 (143 units), and Period 15 (6 units). Since the OR backend includes all 'In-transit' units in its pipeline calculation and cannot distinguish between 'fresh' and 'lost/stuck' units, it will under-order unless we compensate. To restore inventory levels, I am setting L=1 (explicitly) to force an earlier check but adjusting mu_hat to a high 'explicit' value to bridge the gap created by the lost pipeline (233 + 213 = 446 units). Average demand exhibits low volatility, centering around 178 units. By setting mu_hat for the (1+L) period (2 periods) to 800, the backend will treat the required base stock as high enough to offset the phantom 'In-transit' units and trigger the necessary replenishment. Sigma is set to recent levels to maintain sensitivity to variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Period 6 order (213 units) confirmed lost (10 periods elapsed). Pipe-line inventory is significantly inflated by 446 units of lost stock (P2 and P6 orders).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we have 21 units on-hand and an inflated 'In-transit' figure of 900 units. Critical analysis of history reveals that the 'In-transit' balance is heavily distorted by lost shipments from P2 (233 units) and P6 (213 units), totaling 446 units that will never arrive but are still counted by the OR backend. Additionally, actual lead times are unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with a mean observed lead time of 2.1 periods. Demand has slightly softened in the most recent 5 periods (avg ~158 vs overall avg ~178). To force the backend to place an order despite the 446 lost units in the pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' L value. By setting L higher than the average, I increase the target base stock level (calculated as (L+1) * mean_demand) to offset the missing pipeline inventory. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods to capture the recent moderate demand levels while maintaining enough safety stock for lead-time variability. Using N=10 for demand captures the shift away from the higher early-period peaks.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight downward trend over the last 5 periods (mean ~131 vs. historical mean ~173). I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this shift. Lead times are highly variable (1-3 periods, averaging 2.0). More critically, the pipeline inventory is currently 452 units, but this includes 446 units from two confirmed lost orders: Period 2 (233 units) and Period 6 (213 units). The OR engine's 'base stock - pipeline' calculation will subtract these 446 phantom units, preventing necessary new orders and leading to future stockouts. To force the OR backend to ignore these lost units and place an order, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that covers the desired base stock plus the lost units. Base stock calculation: (1+L)*mean + z*sigma. Using L=2, mean=131, z=1.45 (approx 93% SL), and sigma=25: Target Base Stock \u2248 3*131 + 43 \u2248 436. Explicit mu_hat = 436 (Target) + 446 (Lost) = 882. This ensures the OR logic (882 - 452) results in a replenishment that accounts for the lost items and current on-hand position.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg decreased from ~180 to ~131 (-27%). Pipeline inventory remains corrupted by 446 units of lost stock (P2, P6), requiring manual offsets in mu_hat.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we face two critical issues: 1) A confirmed demand regime shift starting at Period 13 where the average demand dropped from ~180 to ~131 (-27%), and 2) a pipeline inventory that is significantly over-reported by the OR backend. Specifically, orders from P2 (233 units) and P6 (213 units) are lost (17 and 13 periods elapsed, respectively). This creates a phantom 'In-transit' buffer of 446 units. To force the OR engine to order despite this fake buffer, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the ideal base stock as (L+1) * mean_demand = (2+1) * 131 = 393. With z* at ~1.9 (for 95% service level), the safety stock is roughly 1.9 * sqrt(3) * 15 \u2248 50, making total target base stock ~443. To offset the 446 lost units hidden in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to approximately 890 (Target 444 + 446 Offset). I keep L at 'default' (2) to minimize calculation complexity, as the OR engine uses L to determine the 'review + lead' window. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the lower volatility of the current demand regime (Periods 13-18).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 analysis: The demand regime remains lower than the initial periods, with the average of the last 7 samples (P13-P19) being approximately 145 units. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 752 units, but this includes 446 units from orders placed in Period 2 (233) and Period 6 (213) that are confirmed lost (8+ periods overdue). To ensure the OR engine orders correctly, mu_hat must be adjusted to offset these ghost units. Formula: target_base_stock = (1+L)*mean_demand. OR engine orders: base_stock - (total_pipeline - lost_stock). To compensate for the 'lost_stock' being counted in total_pipeline, I set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_demand + lost_stock. With L=2, (1+2)*145 + 446 = 435 + 446 = 881. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to provide this corrected figure. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility of the lower regime (std dev \u2248 20), scaled: sqrt(3)*20 \u2248 35.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 911 units in-transit. However, historical data confirms that 446 units (orders from P2 and P6) are lost. Pipeline inventory is therefore effectively 465 units (911 - 446). Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 13, averaging approximately 144 units over the last 8 samples (P13-P20). With 0 on-hand units and upcoming demand, we must ensure arrival. Lead times are volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.0). To account for the 'lost' units inflating the pipeline calculation in the OR backend (base_stock - pipeline), I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. This value is calculated to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) at the current rate (~144) PLUS an offset to neutralize the 446 units of phantom inventory: (3 * 144) + 446 = 878. This forces the engine to target a higher base stock, effectively ignoring the lost units when placing the order.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 22. Historical analysis confirms two significant issues: 1) Lost inventory totaling 446 units (Period 2 and Period 6 orders), and 2) High lead time variability. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts for two consecutive periods (P20 and P21). Demand since Period 13 has averaged approximately 144 units per period (176, 162, 163, 125, 124, 145, 172, 182, 162). To set the base stock level correctly, we must account for the OR engine's 'inventory position' calculation, which includes the 446 units of lost 'in-transit' stock. Since the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock, we must inflate the mu_hat parameter by the amount of the lost stock to 'trick' the backend into ordering enough to cover actual demand. Calculation: Expected demand over (L+1) periods (where L=2) is 3 * ~155 \u2248 465. To offset the 446 lost units visible in the backend's in-transit count, mu_hat must be set to approximately 465 + 446 = 911. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time (approx 2.1), and mu_hat to 'explicit' with a value of 911 to force an order that compensates for the pipeline deficit. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=9) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Stockout occurred Period 20-21 due to non-arrival of Period 18/19 orders. Pipeline remains corrupted by 446 lost units (P2, P6).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and the pipeline shows 978 units. However, we have confirmed that orders from Period 2 (233 units) and Period 6 (213 units) are lost, totaling 446 lost units. To the OR engine, these still appear as 'in-transit', which would lead it to under-order significantly. The actual effective pipeline is 532 units (978 - 446). Current demand regime (calculated from Period 13 onwards) averages 151 units per period. Promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times are frequently 3. To compensate for the 446 units of 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean + safety stock. With L=2, (2+1)*151 = 453. However, since the OR engine subtracts the full 978 'in-transit' units from its target, I must artificially inflate mu_hat by the lost amount (446) to force a corrective order. Targeted 'explicit' mu_hat = 453 + 446 = 899. This ensures the backend places an order to refill the actual empty shelf and cover the lead time demand.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 13; the average demand over the last 11 periods is approximately 149 units per period. The pipeline inventory (752 units) is severely corrupted by confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (233 units), Period 6 (213 units), Period 18 (161 units), and Period 19 (139 units). Total lost stock equals 746 units (233+213+161+139). To the OR backend, 'pipeline_inventory' includes these lost units, which would lead it to stop ordering. To circumvent this, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the required base stock (149 * 3 periods = 447 units) and ADD the lost inventory sum (746 units) to 'trick' the backend into placing an order that reflects the actual physical deficit. This results in a mu_hat of 1193. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average of ~2.2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Cumulative lost stock confirmed at 746 units (P2: 233, P6: 213, P18: 161, P19: 139). Pipeline inventory is non-functional for standard logic; mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to offset these lost units until they are cleared from the window or the game concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1824.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as of Period 25. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts recently. The lead time displays high variability, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2). A major complication is the presence of 746 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline that are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P18, and P19). Since the OR backend uses pipeline_inventory (In-transit) in its calculation (order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory), these phantom units prevent the system from ordering enough stock. Demand has settled into a lower regime (approx 130-150 units). To force an order that covers the current period and the expected 2-period lead time (3 periods total), I must explicitly set mu_hat. I am targeting a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (~140 * 3 = 420) plus a safety buffer, and then adding back the 746 lost units to neutralize the backend's subtraction. Total mu_hat target: 420 + 200 (safety) + 746 (offset) = 1366. This ensures the OR engine places a substantial order despite the corrupted 'In-transit' count.

Carry-over insight: Lost stock tally remains at 746 units (P2: 233, P6: 213, P18: 161, P19: 139). Pipeline inventory remains functionally corrupted, necessitating explicit mu_hat inflation.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is currently compromised by significant lost shipments. Cumulative lost stock is confirmed at 746 units (Orders from Periods 2, 6, 18, and 19). Because 'In-transit' inventory counts these units but they will never arrive, the standard logic (base_stock - pipeline) will chronically under-order, leading to the current stockout. To bypass this, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Theoretical base stock for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) is modeled on the current demand regime (~140-150 units/period). Base Stock \u2248 150 * 3 + Z * sigma \u2248 550. To force the OR engine to order despite the 'phantom' 746 units in transit, I must set mu_hat to approximately (Base Stock + Lost Stock) = 550 + 746 = 1296. I chose 1350 to provide a small buffer against the high demand volatility and recent stockouts. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect the increased variability in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns. Current status: 746 units of permanently lost stock (P2, P6, P18, P19) continue to corrupt pipeline inventory, requiring explicit overrides of mu_hat.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for chips(Regular) continues to be severely impacted by 746 units of permanently lost stock (P2, P6, P18, P19) that remain in the 'In-transit' figure (1449 units). This 'ghost' inventory prevents the OR backend's standard logic from placing necessary orders. To compensate, I must explicitly override the mu_hat parameter. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has averaged approximately 144 units over the last 10 periods (P17-P26). With a promised lead time of 2 and an observed effective lead time often reaching 3, I use (L+1) = 4 periods as the base-stock horizon. Required base stock = 144 * 4 = 576 units. However, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 746 lost units: Effective Base Stock Goal = 576 + 746 = 1322. Given current In-transit (1449) is already above this, but includes 746 units results that won't arrive, actual effective pipeline is 1449 - 746 = 703 units. To trigger a sufficient order to cover the current stockout and future demand, I set mu_hat to 1400 (explicitly including the 746 lost-stock offset plus demand coverage). Sigma is set conservatively using recent volatility.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is significantly compromised by 746 units of permanently lost shipments (P2: 233, P6: 213, P18: 161, P19: 139) that remain in the 'In-transit' total (1488 units). These lost units trick the OR logic into under-ordering because it assumes they will arrive. Current On-hand is 0, and we have experienced a stockout since Period 24. Average demand is ~135 units. With a lead time of 2-3 periods, the required pipeline (base stock) for L=2 should be around 405 units (3 * 135). To force the 'min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)' logic to actually place an order when pipeline inventory is falsely inflated by 746 units, mu_hat must be set explicitly high. Total active in-transit (excluding lost stock) is 1488 - 746 = 742 units. Since 742 units is already above our target base stock for a normal regime, but we are currently stocked out, we must ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the immediate demand gap and account for the fact that some recent orders (P24, P25) are still in transit and should arrive soon. I will set mu_hat to a value that offsets the 746 lost units plus the desired base stock (approximately 400), totaling ~1150 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory caused by lost shipments. Analysis of history confirms that orders from Period 2 (233 units), Period 6 (213 units), Period 18 (161 units), and Period 19 (139 units) are permanently lost, totaling 746 units. These units still appear in 'In-transit: 1488 units', which causes the OR backend to under-order significantly if not corrected. Additionally, recent demand (last 6 periods) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 115 units per period. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 746 units of stale pipeline stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. This value is calculated as: Base Stock (Target Inventory) + Pipeline Correction. Target Inventory = (Promised L + 1) * Demand Mean = 3 * 115 = 345 units. Pipeline Correction = 746 units. Total explicit mu_hat = 1091 units. This ensures the engine 'sees' a requirement that overwhelms the ghost inventory, triggering a replenishment for real demand. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 29, the cumulative lost stock remains at 746 units (P2, P6, P18, P19). Demand regime has shifted lower since Period 22, now averaging ~115 units/period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30, the supply chain remains heavily compromised by 746 units of permanently lost stock (P2: 233, P6: 213, P18: 161, P19: 139). These units remain in the 'In-transit' figure (1449), but will never arrive, causing the OR backend to underestimate the required order because it believes the pipeline is full. To compensate, I must explicitly increase mu_hat. Since Period 22, demand has settled into a lower regime, averaging ~115 units per period. Using a lead time (L) of 2, the total required stock across the review and lead time (L+1 = 3 periods) is approximately 345 units. However, I must also offset the 746 ghost units in 'In-transit' to prevent the OR logic from subtracting them. Therefore, I set mu_hat to 345 + 746 = 1091. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to 50 based on recent volatility in this lower demand regime.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is currently experiencing significant order losses and lead time variability. As of Period 31, 746 units from orders placed in Period 2 (233), Period 6 (213), Period 18 (161), and Period 19 (139) are confirmed lost and remain in the 'In-transit' figure on the OR backend. With total in-transit at 1449 units, the 'effective' pipeline is actually only 703 units (1449 - 746). Additionally, orders from Period 24 (364 units) and Period 25 (333 units) are overdue (5-6 periods elapsed against a 2-period promised lead time), suggesting further potential losses or severe delays. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~115 units since Period 22. To prevent the OR engine from halting orders due to the inflated (and non-existent) pipeline inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. This value is calculated to cover 3 periods of demand (L=2 + Review=1) at the current average (115 * 3 = 345) plus an offset of the 746 lost units to bypass the backend pipeline check: 345 + 746 = 1091. This ensures the engine places an order to meet actual stock needs.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed lost units (P2, P6, P18, P19) total 746. Orders from P24 (364) and P25 (333) are now significantly overdue (5+ periods), potentially increasing lost stock tally to 1443 if no arrival occurs by Period 32.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a massive inventory crisis. On-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory is 1449 units, but at least 1443 of these are likely lost. Confirmed lost: P2 (233), P6 (213), P18 (161), P19 (139). Highly probable new losses: P24 (364) and P25 (333), which have not arrived within 7 periods (max observed lead time is 3). Total estimated loss = 1443 units. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' (1449) to subtract from the base stock. If we use standard logic, the backend thinks we have enough stock, resulting in a zero order and continued stockouts. To force an order, I must set mu_hat (the Target Stock Level) significantly higher than the corrupt pipeline value. Average demand since the regime shift in P22 is ~115. With a lead time of 2, the target stock should be roughly 345 units. To force an order when the pipeline is 1449, I must set mu_hat = 1449 + 345 = 1794. This 'explicit' override bypasses the pipeline corruption, ensuring the system places an order to satisfy actual demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total likely lost units reached 1443 (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P25). Pipeline inventory is essentially a phantom figure. Until these units are cleared or arrived, mu_hat must be set as [Desired Stock + 1443] to generate orders.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical due to massive lost shipments. As of Period 33, 'In-transit' shows 1881 units, but at least 1443 units are effectively permanent losses (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P25). On-hand inventory is 0. Standard OR logic 'base_stock - pipeline' will never trigger an order because the pipeline (1881) heavily exceeds any realistic base stock for the current demand regime (~115 units/period). To force an order and maintain stock, mu_hat must be set to 'Desired Base Stock + Lost Units'. I estimate local demand at 115/period. For L=2, the (L+1) window requires ~345 units. Adding some safety and the 1443 lost units, I target a total pipeline coverage of ~1900-2000 units. Since current in-transit is 1881, I use mu_hat=2000 to trick the backend into covering the phantom inventory while placing a small corrective order to replenish physical stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed total lost units increased to 1443 (including P24 and P25). In-transit inventory remains high but functionally useless. mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by at least 1443 units to bypass the 'order = base_stock - pipeline' cap and ensure replenishment.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, a large order of 432 units (ordered Period 32) arrived with a lead time of 1 period, bringing on-hand inventory to 311. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1658 is still heavily corrupted by lost shipments (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P25), totaling 1443 units. The OR backend's logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see 1658 units in transit and refuse to order unless the target base stock exceeds this phantom pipeline. To ensure replenishment for the current demand regime (~115 units/period) and maintain a safety buffer, I must continue to explicitly set mu_hat to bypass the pipe-line cap. I've set mu_hat to 1850 (approx. 1443 lost units + 400 units for active coverage) to trigger a replenishment order of approximately 200 units, sustaining the current inventory level against a demand expectation of roughly 120 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant disruption due to 'lost' orders that remain in the pipeline inventory calculation but will likely never arrive. As of Period 35, the 'permanently lost' tally remains at 1443 units (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P25). This phantom pipeline prevents the standard base-stock logic from placing new orders because it perceives 'In-transit' as 1658, which is far above the required stock levels. Effective demand has stabilized at a lower regime (~109 units/period since Period 26). To ensure replenishment, mu_hat must be set to [Target Base Stock + Lost Units]. With a lead time L=2, the target base stock is approximately (1+2)*109 + safety stock (~450 total). Adding the 1443 lost units, mu_hat is explicitly set to 1893. This offset 'tricks' the backend into ordering enough to cover actual demand by negating the deadweight of the lost pipeline units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1447.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant logistical corruption. As of Period 36, the total confirmed lost units have increased to 1,443 (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P25). The 'In-transit' balance of 1,760 reflects these 1,443 phantom units plus valid orders from P33 (209) and P35 (102) which are within the lead-time window. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1,760 from the base stock calculation, it will never order unless the base stock exceeds 1,760. To maintain availability, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that overrides this subtraction. Target inventory for (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods) based on recent demand (~100/period) and 95% service level is roughly 400-500 units. Adding the 1,443 lost units as a buffer to force the order logic, I set mu_hat to 1,843 (Base Stock = ~400 + 1443). L is set to 'calculate' as lead times for arriving orders (like the P32 order arriving in 1 period) show high variability.

Carry-over insight: Lost stock tally remains at 1,443 units (confirmed: P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P25). In-transit inventory is permanently inflated by this amount, necessitating a mu_hat offset of approx 1,443 + [desired target stock] to trigger replenishment orders.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is compromised by a cumulative 1,443 units of lost stock (Orders from P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P25), which remain in the 'In-transit' figure indefinitely. Since the OR backend uses 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and the pipeline inventory is artificially inflated by 1,443 units, the system will not place necessary orders unless mu_hat is explicitly set to exceed this phantom inventory. Current demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 115 units/period (mean of last 10 periods is ~106, but slightly higher recently). Setting L=2 (promised) and targeting a base stock (demand over L+1 periods) of approximately 450 units, the mu_hat parameter must be set to 1443 + 450 = 1893 to force a replenishment order that overcomes the pipeline inflation and maintains adequate on-hand stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1880.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 has stabilized at approximately 115 units per period. Lead times continue to be highly variable (observed: 1-3 periods). The critical issue remains the 1,443 units of lost stock (from P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P25), which are counted in the 'In-transit' figure of 1,814 but will never arrive. To calculate the effective pipeline, we subtract these lost units: 1,814 - 1,443 = 371 units of 'real' in-transit stock. With a desired target stock level (base stock) for L=2 being approximately (1+2)*115 = 345 units (plus a safety buffer for volatility), the current 'real' inventory (39 on-hand + 371 real in-transit = 410) technically covers the immediate need. However, to ensure the OR backend generates an order and doesn't stop due to the 'lost' inventory bloat, I must keep mu_hat inflated. I will set mu_hat explicitly to [desired_base_stock + lost_units]. For Period 38, targeting a base stock of ~500 (115*3 + safety) plus 1,443 = 1,943.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment suffers from significant permanent lost shipments (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P25), totaling 1,443 units. These units remain in 'In-transit' indefinitely, corrupting the OR backend's order logic (order = base_stock - pipeline). To force a replenishment order when on-hand inventory is 0, mu_hat must be set as [1,443 + desired_safety_stock]. Current demand has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 22, averaging ~105 units/period. For a target inventory covering L+1 periods (approx 3 periods), we need roughly 315 units. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 1,758 (1,443 + 315) to ensure the system places an order of ~160 units despite the phantom pipeline. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility which averages around 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 39, confirmed lost stock remains at 1,443 units. The demand regime has sustained a lower average of ~105 units since Period 22. Total 'In-transit' of 1,981 includes 538 actual active units and 1,443 phantom units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40, the supply chain remains heavily affected by 1,443 confirmed lost units (orders from P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, and P25) which permanently inflate the 'In-transit' pipeline inventory. The OR backend calculates the order as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. With 1,814 in-transit units (of which only ~371 are active/legitimate), the backend will refrain from ordering unless \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat) is explicitly inflated to offset the 1,443 phantom units. The current demand regime (since P22) averages ~108 units per period with moderate volatility. To maintain a target inventory that covers demand during the lead time (L=2) plus a safety buffer, I require a base stock of approx. 500-600 units. Adding the 1,443 lost units offset gives a target mu_hat of ~2,000. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=15) to capture the volatility of the current lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed lost stock tally remains at 1,443 units (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P25). Pipeline inventory is corrupted by this amount, requiring mu_hat to be inflated by 1,443 + [desired base stock] to ensure the OR backend places replenishment orders.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41, the system shows 1,975 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 1,443 of these units are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, and P25). The remaining 532 units are active (P33: 209, P37: 156, P40: 161, and the current P41 order). The demand regime since Period 22 has stabilized at approximately 105 units/period. The OR engine calculates orders as [base_stock - pipeline_inventory]. Because the pipeline is permanently inflated by 1,443 phantom units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat by this amount to override the subtraction. A safe base stock for a lead time of 2-3 periods at 105 units/period is roughly 400-500 units. Therefore, I set mu_hat to 1,900 (1,443 + 457) to ensure replenishment orders are generated despite the corrupted pipeline. L remains 3 to reflect the high end of observed actual lead times.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant disruption due to 1,443 confirmed lost units (orders from P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P25), which permanently inflate the 'In-transit' pipeline to 1,975 units. Actual active orders in the pipeline are P40 (161 units) and P37 (156 units, which is now overdue after 4 periods). On-hand inventory is depleted (0). The demand regime has stabilized around an average of 105 units since Period 22. To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend, I must set the base stock (mu_hat) significantly higher than the reported 'In-transit' figure. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, targeting a value that accounts for the ghost inventory (1,443) plus a 3-period safety stock (3 * 105 = 315) plus the existing active orders (approx 317), totaling 2,075. This should force the OR logic to place an order despite the pipeline corruption.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of operational crisis due to 1,443 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory (orders from P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, and P25 that are confirmed or effectively lost). As of Period 43, the total in-transit is 2,142 units. Subtracting the 1,443 lost units leaves 699 units of genuine pipeline inventory (from P37, P40, and P42). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (last 10 periods) has stabilized at a lower regime, averaging 92 units/period with a standard deviation of 23. To overcome the OR backend's order calculation [order = base_stock - in_transit], I must explicitly set mu_hat so that it covers both the desired stock for the lead time (avg ~92 * 3 = 276) and offsets the 1,443 units of lost stock. A value of 1850 for mu_hat ensures that even after subtracting the 1,443 phantom units, the system targets a base stock that triggers necessary replenishment. sigma_hat is set to 45 (approx sqrt(3)*23 + safety margin) to maintain service levels amidst lead time uncertainty.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 22, averaging approximately 105 units per period. The critical issue remains the 'In-transit' figure of 1,981, which is heavily corrupted by 1,443 confirmed lost units (orders from P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P25). This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR backend's standard logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) from placing necessary replenishment orders, as it believes we have nearly 2,000 units on the way. To bypass this, I continue to use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to force an order. A safe base stock target for a lead time of 2-3 periods at 105 units/period is roughly 400-450 units. Therefore, I set mu_hat to 1,893 (1,443 lost units + 450 target units), which should trigger a replenishment order of approximately 150-200 units. Sigma_hat is set to a moderate level to handle the observed demand volatility (std dev ~30).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 has settled into a lower average of approximately 105 units per period. The primary operational challenge remains the 1,443 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory (orders from P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, and P25) which are confirmed lost but still occupy the pipeline in the OR engine's logic. To trigger replenishment, the target base stock must be added to this lost quantity. With a desired target stock for L=2 of three periods of demand (approx 3 * 105 = 315), the explicit mu_hat is set to 1443 + 315 = 1758. No arrival occurred in Period 44, and current on-hand is 37 units. Setting mu_hat to 1758 ensures the backend subtracts the 1,981 in-transit units and adds 37 on-hand units, resulting in a gap that triggers a replenishment order to maintain service levels for the remaining 5 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46, we are entering the final stages of the game (ending at P50). The primary operational challenge remains the corrupted 'In-transit' figure of 1,814 units, which contains 1,443 confirmed lost units (orders from P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, and P25). The true pipeline inventory consists of only 371 units (1,814 minus 1,443). The demand regime has significantly softened since Period 38, averaging approximately 75 units per period over the last 8 periods, compared to the previous ~105-115 range. With on-hand inventory at 144 units and Period 45 demand at 60, we have roughly 2 periods of stock. However, since the OR backend uses the formula 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and the pipeline inventory is visually 1,814 (while base stock would normally be ~350-450), the system will not place any orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset the 1,443 lost units. To ensure we have stock for the final periods (P47-P50), I will set mu_hat to 1,850. This represents a desired base stock of ~400 plus the 1,443 offset. This should trigger a modest replenishment order to cover the remaining periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softened further starting P38: average dropped from ~105 to ~75 units/period (-28%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1076.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face severe data corruption in the 'In-transit' pipeline due to 1,443 units of confirmed lost stock (Orders from P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P25). This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary replenishment orders because it believes the pipeline is overfilled. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than the lost stock tally (1,443) plus the desired safety stock. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~75 units/period over the last 9 periods (P38-P46). Given we are at Period 47 (3 periods remaining) and the lead time fluctuates up to 3 periods, we need to ensure current on-hand (83) and new arrivals cover the remaining demand. To trigger a replenishment order that overcomes the 1,443 unit 'In-transit' block, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1,850. This accounts for the 1,443 lost units plus approximately 407 units to cover demand and safety stock for the final window. L=3 is used to reflect the maximum lead time observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1197.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains softened, averaging ~75 units/period since Period 38 (latest samples: 54, 110, 101, 63, 61, 60, 61, 64). The primary operational challenge is the persistent corruption of the pipeline inventory by 1,443 confirmed lost units (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P25). With current 'In-transit' at 1,834 units, approximately 1,443 are phantom units that will never arrive, and 391 units (from P47 and potentially other invisible orders) are real. To trigger any replenishment order from the OR backend, mu_hat must be set to exceed the phantom pipeline. I am targeting an ending inventory of ~225 units (approx 3 periods of softened demand). The required base stock is therefore (On-hand + Phantom Pipeline + Target) = 19 + 1,443 + 225 \u2248 1,687. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure this value is passed directly to the backend. Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, so 'calculate' remains the best approach for L.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 49, the game is nearing its conclusion (Period 50). The primary challenge continues to be the 1,443 units of confirmed lost stock (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P25) which permanently inflate the 'In-transit' figure, effectively blocking the OR backend's replenishment logic (Base Stock - Pipeline). Since Period 38, demand has softened to a new regime averaging approximately 75 units per period. With current on-hand inventory at 0 and the final decision being for Period 49, no new order placed now would arrive in time to satisfy demand for Period 49. However, an order might arrive for the very last resolution phase. To ensure the backend generates any required order despite the phantom 1,443 units of pipeline inventory, mu_hat is explicitly set to 1,750 (representing the phantom 1,443 units plus a target base stock of ~300 units to cover remaining potential demand). Standard L calculation is used as lead times remain variable between 1-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Final decision period. Lost stock remains at 1,443 units, requiring continued mu_hat inflation to bypass the corrupted pipeline inventory calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final decision period. Due to the 1,443 confirmed lost units (from periods 2, 6, 18, 19, 24, and 25) that are permanently stuck in the 'In-transit' figure, the OR backend's standard logic (ordering base_stock minus pipeline) would result in zero orders because the phantom pipeline (1,834) far exceeds any reasonable base stock for a demand of ~75 units/period. To ensure a final replenishment and maximize the chance of meeting Period 50 demand (which occurs after this decision), I must set mu_hat to an explicit value that exceeds the phantom in-transit amount of 1,443 plus a target stock level. I am targeting a base stock of roughly 225 (3 periods of ~75 demand), necessitating an explicit mu_hat of approximately 1,668. The current on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 49, so a failure to order now will result in zero sales for the final period.
