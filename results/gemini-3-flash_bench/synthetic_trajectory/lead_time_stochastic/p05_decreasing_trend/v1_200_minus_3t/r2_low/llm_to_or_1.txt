Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' and the promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (which were provided in the prompt even though we are currently making the decision for Period 1) shows values: 217, 207, 170, 131, 185. The mean of these 5 samples is 182 and the standard deviation is approximately 34. Since we have no confirmed arrivals or lead time drifts yet, I will use the 'default' lead time of 2. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I will use 'explicit' to incorporate the average of the available samples (182) multiplied by (1+L), which is 182 * 3 = 546. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'explicit' with sqrt(1+L) * std, which is sqrt(3) * 34 \u2248 58.88. This ensures we start with a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period, balancing the high holding cost (equal to profit) by targeting a 50% service level via the OR backend's formula.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 238 units, which are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (Period 1 order + 2 lead time = Period 3 arrival). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and since demand is satisfied after the decision phase, the 193 units of demand in Period 1 resulted in 0 sales. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 182 units (P1: 217, P2: 207, P3: 170, P4: 131, P5: 185; Note: P1 user history says 217, but Period 1 conclude says demand was 193 - I will rely on the provided historical sequence where average is ~182). I will use the default promised lead time (L=2) and calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all available historical samples (N=5) to stabilize the forecast against initial stockouts.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Orders were placed in Period 1 (238 units) and Period 2 (226 units), totaling 464 units in transit. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because starting inventory was 0. Demand for the first 5 periods (including historical samples) was 217, 207, 170, 131, and 185, while the 'conclude' messages for Periods 1 and 2 show demands of 193 and 180 respectively. The average demand across all available data points (217, 207, 170, 131, 185, 193, 180) is approximately 183.3. With a lead time L=2, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most relevant recent levels and use the 'default' lead time of 2 as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (238 units), Period 2 (226 units), and Period 3 (52 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates either a delay in lead time or a lost shipment for the Period 1 order. Since the 'In-transit' quantity (516) exactly matches the sum of orders from P1, P2, and P3 (238+226+52=516), the shipments are not lost but delayed. I will use 'explicit' for L to account for the observed delay (L=3), and use all 5 available historical samples (217, 207, 170, 131, 185) to estimate demand. Mean demand is 182. Standard deviation is approximately 34.3. I will use explicit values to ensure the OR backend reacts to the lead time extension.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the 'Period 4 conclude' message, we see two arrivals: the order from Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (lead time = 3), and the order from Period 3 arrived in 1 period (lead time = 1). The promised lead time is 2. This suggests variability in delivery times, with an average lead time of 2 ((3+1)/2). Regarding demand, the samples are: P1: 217, P2: 207, P3: 170, P4: 131, P5: 185. The mean demand is approximately 182. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the backend will target the median demand (z=0). My goal is to ensure the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) covers the expected demand over (L+1) periods. Current pipeline is 136 + 438 = 574 units. With L=2, (L+1)=3. 3 periods of demand at ~182 is 546. The current pipeline is adequate for the promised lead time. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the OR engine use the observed history and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the full recent history while remaining responsive to the slight downward trend observed in Periods 3 and 4.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on history, demand for 'chips(Regular)' across P1-P5 is: 193, 180, 207, 154, 239. The average demand is 194.6. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variability: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 600 units in transit (orders from P2, P4, and P5). Since we ran out of stock in P5 (sold 136 out of 239 demand), we need to ensure local replenishment accounts for the lead time (L) and the review period (1). The total pipeline inventory (600) is significant compared to recent demand, but we must protect against further stockouts if L fluctuates. I will use 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to use the average of completed cycles (3 and 1, avg=2). I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the full available history which shows stable but high-variance demand around the mean of 195.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable with an average around 191 units (P1-P6: 193, 180, 207, 154, 239, 170). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variability: P1 order arrived in 3 periods, while P3 order arrived in 1 period. Currently, 779 units are in-transit (orders from P2, P4, P5, and P6). The backend OR engine uses a base-stock policy. To ensure we cover demand during the review and lead time (L+1), I will set L to the promised 2 periods (default). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand fluctuations (avg ~190, so mu_hat should be around 570 for L=2). For sigma_hat, I'll use the default calculation across all samples to ensure enough safety stock given the recent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of the start of Period 8, we have 14 units on-hand and 567 units in-transit. Historical demand has shown a mean of approximately 184 units per period (samples: 217, 207, 170, 131, 185, 193, 180, 207, 154, 239, 170, 198) with moderate variance. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have been 3, 1, and 3. This averages to 2.33, indicating that the promised lead time of 2 is a reasonable center but carries risk. The system has experienced stockouts (Period 5, 6) due to late arrivals. Currently, we are awaiting shipments from Period 2 (226 units), Period 5 (162 units), and Period 6 (179 units). The Period 2 order is significantly overdue (5 periods since order) and should be monitored for loss, though given the variability in lead times (1-3 observed), it might just be highly delayed. I will use 'default' for Lead Time (2) to let the OR compute base stock, but I'll use 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) to capture the slightly higher recent activity (avg ~192) compared to the long-term average, ensuring we order enough to cover the (L+1) window.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but historical data shows volatility: orders from P1, P4, and P5 all arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, while P3 arrived in 1 period. The most recent and frequent lead time is 3, so I will set L=3 to ensure the pipeline covers the necessary duration. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable, with recorded samples (including pre-game) hovering between 131 and 239. The average of the last 8 periods (P1-P8) is approximately 193.3. Balancing the high holding cost ($1.0) against the profit ($1.0) leads to a target service level of 50%. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution accurately. Current on-hand is 0 with 405 in-transit (P2 and P6), which aligns with the observed lead-time of 3-4 periods for those older orders.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time frequently deviates to 3 periods instead of the promised 2 (confirmed by P1, P4, and P5 arrivals).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. The historical data shows a consistent demand regime with a mean of approximately 192 units per period (N=9). However, inventory management has been severely hampered by lead time volatility. While the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times observed are 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 arrivals) and occasionally 1 period (P3 arrival). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (226 units) and Period 6 (179 units) have not arrived yet. If Period 2 were to arrive with a lead time of 3, it would have appeared in Period 5's conclude message; it is now 7 periods overdue, suggesting it is likely lost. The order from Period 6 is also overdue if we assume a lead time of 3. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To compensate for the unreliable delivery (actual L=3) and the lost Period 2 stock, I will set L to an explicit value of 3. I will use a recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat to capture the stable demand mean and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the observed volatility. This should raise the base stock level to better handle the 3-period lead time and the risk of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 2 (226 units) appears lost; demand remains stable around 190-200 units.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains stable, with the average of the last 10 periods being approximately 191.4 units. A significant issue is the lead time instability and a lost shipment: the order from Period 2 (226 units) is now 9 periods old and must be considered lost, as it has not arrived despite a promised 2-period lead time. Observed successful lead times have mostly been 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), suggesting an actual lead time L=3. The pipeline currently contains 771 units (from periods 6, 9, and 10), but removing the lost P2 order leaves 545 active units in transit. Given the current zero inventory and persistent demand, I will set L=3 explicitly to account for the observed delay. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the stable demand mean around 191 units. Since holding cost equals profit ($1), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, directing it to stock for the mean. I'll maintain default sigma to allow for some safety stock due to zero inventory.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current observation shows on-hand inventory is 0 and 771 units are in-transit. A review of history confirms extreme lead-time volatility and lost shipments. The shipment from Period 2 (226 units) is officially confirmed as lost, having passed both the promised (2) and observed average (3) lead times significantly. Shipments from Period 4 and 5 arrived with a 3-period lead time, while Period 3 arrived in 1. This inconsistency makes the 'promised' lead time of 2 unreliable. I will use an explicit L of 3 to account for the frequent delays observed. Demand has been relatively stable, with a mean around 180-200 units. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the slight downward trend in the last few periods (188, 181, 152) to avoid over-ordering given the $1 holding cost. sigma_hat will use the last 5 samples to reflect recent volatility.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 conclude, we see orders from Period 9 (236 units) and Period 10 (130 units) arriving with lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively. Current on-hand inventory is 222 units, and we have 405 units in-transit (likely from periods 11 and 12). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times since Period 1 have predominantly been 3 (P1, P4, P5, P9 reached finality with L=3). Recent demand has stabilized: Period 10 (181), Period 11 (152), and Period 12 (144) show a downward trend compared to the initial ~200. I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent delays. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the mean of the last 5 samples (approx 170) multiplied by (1+L) = 4, totaling 680 to reflect the current moderate cooling in demand while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat is calculated similarly using recent history to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly variable but frequently settles at 3 periods (4 out of 6 documented arrivals had L=3). Demand has trended lower in the last 3 periods (average ~159) compared to previous periods (~197).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, following the conclude of Period 13, on-hand inventory is 58. Demand over the last three periods has decreased to an average of ~153 units (P11: 152, P12: 144, P13: 164), compared to the earlier average of ~197. This supports the observation in carry-over insights regarding a lower demand trend. The shipment from Period 2 (226 units) is confirmed lost. Actual lead times have consistently settled at 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, P8, and P12). Because the lead time is effectively 3, and the OR engine uses (1+L) periods of demand to set the base stock, I am setting L=3 explicitly. For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the downward trend in demand while maintaining a buffer for variability. For sigma_hat, recent_N of 5 is used to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a lower regime established around Period 11, averaging approximately 153 units over the last 3 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and 606 units in-transit. Historical data reveals a sustained lead time shift where the actual lead time is frequently 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, and P9 all arrived with L=3). The Period 2 order (226 units) is long overdue and confirmed lost. Demand has shifted to a lower regime starting around Period 11; the average demand over the last 4 periods (P11-P14) is 158 units. To account for the unreliable lead time, I am setting L=3 (explicitly) instead of the promised 2. For forecasting (mu_hat), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~158). This results in a mu_hat covering (1+L) periods, providing the OR backend with a lookahead for 4 periods of demand (~632 units). I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the lower volatility observed in this new regime, which helps prevent over-ordering while maintaining a safety buffer against stockouts.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant backlog of lost demand, though total in-transit is 632 units. Historical analysis confirms that the actual lead time is more frequently 3 periods rather than the promised 2 (Observed L: 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2). The shipment from Period 2 is confirmed lost. Demand has shifted to a lower regime starting around Period 11; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 157.6, compared to the earlier average of ~191. I will set L to 3 to reflect the realized delivery pattern. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this lower demand regime (avg 157.6), resulting in a forecast of (1+3)*157.6 = 630.4. This will guide the OR engine to maintain a pipeline that covers the observed 3-period lead time plus the planning period at the current demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory with a high demand environment. Analyzing the 'conclude' messages, we observe that lead times are consistently 3 periods (P13 order arrived in P16), which is longer than the promised 2. The shipment from P14 (132 units) and P15 (26 units) are still in-transit and expected to arrive in P17 and P18 respectively if the 3-period lead time holds. Demand has shifted to a lower regime; the average demand over the last 6 periods (P11-P16) is approximately 152. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the consistent delay and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand level. Since holding costs and profits are equal ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level inherently, but the safety stock calculation will help mitigate the impact of the high lead-time variance observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 11: average demand decreased from ~197 to ~152 (-23%). Lead time remains stable at 3 periods despite promised 2.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant backlog of demand over the last three periods. The primary driver for the current stockout is the persistent lead time shift from the promised 2 periods to an actual 3 periods. Historical records (P1, P4, P5, P9, P13, P14) confirm that lead time is consistently 3 periods. Furthermore, demand has shifted to a lower regime starting around Period 11. Over the last 7 periods (P11-P17), the average demand is 150.7, significantly lower than the initial ~197. Currently, there are 479 units in transit (ordered in P15, P17, and potentially delayed/lost items if any from before that, though P15 and P17 comprise the bulk). To account for the actual delivery speed and the current lower demand level, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the actual 4-period risk cycle (L+1). mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 7 to capture the current lower demand regime (~151 units/period), and sigma_hat is set with recent_N of 7 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 0 after several periods of stockouts or near-stockouts. The Carry-Over Insights and history confirm a demand regime shift starting around Period 11, with the average demand decreasing from ~197 to ~153. Over the last 8 periods (P11-P18), mean demand is 154.1. The actual lead time is consistently 3 periods, despite the promised 2. A major concern is the high in-transit volume (603 units), which significantly exceeds the base stock level for a (L+1)=4 period horizon. This pipeline likely contains recent orders (P15, P17, P18) and potentially delayed or lost shipments. Because the OR backend subtracts total pipeline inventory from the calculated base stock, and the pipeline is currently very high (~603), the engine will likely order 0. Using L=3 and recent_N=8 for demand ensures the base stock reflects the current lower demand regime while accounting for the reality of 3-period lead times.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face 0 units of on-hand inventory and 617 units in-transit. History confirms a sustained lead-time shift where the actual lead time is 3 periods rather than the promised 2 (observed in P1, P4, P5, P9, P13, and P14 arrivals). Demand entered a lower regime starting Period 11, with the average demand for the last 9 periods being 156.2 units, a significant decrease from the early periods (~200). We set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the current logistics reality. For mu_hat, we use recent_N with N=9 to capture the mean of the current regime (156.2 * (1+3) = 624.8). Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=9) to reflect the localized volatility of this regime. Current in-transit inventory (617) nearly covers our pipeline requirement (base stock is likely around 624 + safety stock), which will result in small or zero orders this period, preventing overstocking given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context shows a sustained lower demand regime (starting Period 11) with an average of approximately 154 units and a persistent actual lead time (L) of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand = 0), though 625 units are in-transit. These in-transit units include orders from P15 (26 units, overdue), P17 (48), P18 (124), P19 (14), and P20 (8), plus potentially earlier unaccounted units. Given the persistent stockouts and the fact that lead time is consistently 3 periods, I am explicitly setting L=3. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current lower demand regime (Periods 11-20), while sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. This configuration helps the OR backend target a base stock level that accounts for the extended lead time and the stable but lower demand profile.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). History shows a demand regime shift around Period 11, with the average demand decreasing from ~197 to ~152 units. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages 151.6 units. Lead time is consistently 3 periods based on previous 'conclude' messages (P1, P4, P5, P9, P13, P14 all arrived with L=3), despite the promised L=2. There are 625 units in-transit (orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P20), but none arrived in P21. The OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 for the (1+L) window. Given L=3, the window is 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to 606 (151.5 * 4) and using explicit L=3 to ensure the backend accounts for the typical arrival delay. Sigma is set based on recent volatility to prevent over-ordering in a stockout-prone environment with high holding costs.

However, in-transit inventory is very high (625 units), which includes orders from Period 15 (26 units), Period 17 (48 units), Period 18 (124 units), Period 19 (14 units), and Period 20 (8 units), most of which are significantly overdue. Even accounting for a 3-period lead time, we are missing arrivals from Periods 15 through 19. If these are not lost but merely delayed, they total 625 units, which is over 4 periods of demand (~154 * 4 = 616). Adding more orders now would lead to excessive holding costs if the backlog clears simultaneously. Therefore, I will maintain parameters that reflect the current lower demand (mu_hat) and the observed actual lead time (L=3), allowing the OR backend to restrict ordering until the pipeline resolves.

Carry-over insight: Significant pipeline backlog as of Period 23: 625 units are in-transit despite a consistent 3-period lead time history, suggesting a high risk of shipment loss or future inventory bloating if arrivals coalesce.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has a massive in-transit pipeline of 617 units with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows a consistent lead time of 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, P8, P12, P16, P17, and P23). Demand entered a lower regime around Period 11, averaging approximately 152 units per period compared to the earlier 197. Currently, we are facing a severe bottleneck where shipments from Periods 15 (26 units), 17 (48 units), 18 (124 units), and 19 (14 units) are overdue or at the limit of the 3-5 period delay window. If these units arrive together, the holding cost ($1.00/unit) will equal the profit margin, causing significant reward loss. Additionally, Period 23 had an extremely low demand of 107. To prevent catastrophic inventory bloating when the backlog arrives, I am setting L to 3 (actual observed) and mu_hat based on the recent lower regime (N=13, from Period 11 onwards). Given the high pipeline and potential for stockouts already occurring, the OR backend's capped policy will likely halt ordering until the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline backlog reaches critical levels at Period 24 (617 units in-transit). Significant risk of supply 'bunching' where multiple overdue orders (P15, P17, P18, P19) arrive simultaneously, leading to high holding costs.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a state of severe supply chain disruption for chips(Regular). The 'In-transit' quantity is 617 units, while the current on-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of the history shows a total of 617 units from orders placed in Periods 15 (26), 17 (48), 18 (124), 19 (14), and then no orders from 21-24. However, Period 2 received an order of 226 units that has never arrived (lost). The current in-transit visibility likely includes several overdue orders (P15 is now 10 periods late, P17 is 8 periods late). There is a massive bullwhip risk: if these orders arrive simultaneously, we will face catastrophic holding costs (Holding Cost = Profit = $1). Demand has also trended significantly lower, hitting a low of 85 units in Period 24. With 617 units in the pipeline and a demand regime of ~150 units, we are already covered for over 4 periods even if mean demand recovers. Therefore, I will set L to 3 (reflected actual) and use recent demand data (last 14 periods) to reflect the lower demand regime (~150 units), which effectively informs the OR backend that our pipeline is already over-saturated.

Carry-over insight: Critical demand decline: Demand in the last 2 periods (107, 85) is significantly below the previous regime average of 152, suggesting a potential further downward shift or high volatility. Pipeline remains congested (617 units) with extreme risk of inventory bailing if multiple overdue shipments arrive.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation for Period 26 is critical. On-hand inventory is 0, yet the pipeline is heavily congested with 617 units in-transit. Multiple shipments (ordered Periods 15, 17, 18, 19) are significantly overdue based on the established 3-period lead time. Demand in the most recent period (P25) rebounded to 171 after two very low readings, but the long-term trend since Period 11 remains roughly 150 units per period. With current pipeline (617) far exceeding the base stock required for a 3-period lead time (roughly 4 periods * 150 = 600), ordering more would only exacerbate the massive 'bullwhip' risk of shipments bunching up, which would lead to catastrophic holding costs if they arrive together. I will maintain L=3 explicitly and use recent demand (N=15) to cover the regime shift, but keep orders at zero (by letting the backend see the huge pipeline) to wait for arrival resolution.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline remains dangerously congested (617 units) with four shipments (P15, P17, P18, P19) over 6 periods old, signaling either extreme lead-time tail risk or catastrophic loss; however, the volume in-transit already exceeds total needs for the next 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical inventory state with excessive in-transit units (617) against zero on-hand inventory. Key segments are: (1) Demand Analysis: Demand has entered a lower, more volatile regime. While early periods averaged ~197, the last 5 periods (P22-P26) averaged ~136, with significant fluctuations (85 to 171). (2) Pipeline Status: There are 617 units in-transit. Several orders (P15, P17, P18, P19) are severely overdue (lead times of 7-11 periods vs historical 3), which likely indicates they are lost. However, even excluding those, the OR logic uses 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to determine order quantities. Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the backend target service level is 50% (q = 0.5). (3) Strategy: The total in-transit units (617) provide roughly 4-5 periods of coverage at current demand levels. To prevent a massive inventory glut if these eventually arrive or if new orders added to this high base, I must suppress new ordering. The best way to do this within the OR framework is to maintain the realistic lead time estimate (L=3) while setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent lower demand. The backend capped policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will result in zero orders so long as pipeline_inventory is significantly higher than the base_stock target. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Extended shipment delays for orders P15, P17, P18, and P19 (all >7 periods old) strongly suggest lost cargo, though they remain in the pipeline inventory calculation. Recent demand (P22-P26) shows increased volatility with a mean of ~136 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 begins with 0 units on-hand and 617 units in-transit. The game history and carry-over insights confirm that orders from P15 (26 units), P17 (48 units), P18 (124 units), and P19 (14 units) are now extremely overdue (9-13 periods ago), suggesting they are likely lost. However, the OR backend includes all in-transit units in the pipeline inventory calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). Since there are 617 units in-transit and recent demand (P22-P27) has averaged approximately 130 units, the current pipeline effectively blocks any new orders from being placed. Even if 212 units (P15, P17, P18, P19) are assumed lost, the remaining 405 units in-transit still far exceed the current demand requirements for a 3-period lead time. I will maintain L=3 as the effective lead time observed throughout the history. Demand has shown increased volatility and a recent downward trend, so I will use a recent_N window (N=7, covering P21-P27) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (avg ~130) while managing the risk of inventory bloating if shipments eventually arrive.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently in a state of 'pipeline paralysis.' We have 617 units in-transit, which includes five deeply overdue orders: P15 (26 units, 13 periods old), P17 (48 units, 11 periods old), P18 (124 units, 10 periods old), P19 (14 units, 9 periods old), and P2 (226 units, 26 periods old). These 617 units are over 4x the current average demand (~135 units/period), yet on-hand inventory is 0. The OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders. Because 617 units are in-transit, the backend will not order any new units unless base_stock exceeds 617. Ordering more units now would either be ignored by the backend or, if it did pass, create a catastrophic inventory bloat (Holding Cost = Profit) when the logjam eventually clears. We must set parameters to reflect the current lower demand regime (avg ~135) and the 3-period lead time, essentially waiting for the system to either deliver the 'lost' units or for us to eventually write them off by adjusting parameters. No new orders should be placed until visibility into the pipeline improves or the stockout risk becomes more manageable than the holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory of 617 units is likely comprised of lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) as they are well beyond the 3-period lead time. Order cycle has halted as internal logic sees these as incoming stock. Demand regime remains at approximately 135 units (Period 22-28 avg).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently paralyzed by a massive 'In-transit' figure of 617 units, which primarily consists of lost or severely delayed orders from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, and 19. Because the OR backend's inventory calculation is (on-hand + in-transit), it believes the supply is sufficient and has stopped ordering, leading to stockouts. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 130-135 units (Mean of Periods 22-29 is ~125, but slightly higher recently). To break the ordering deadlock, I must use 'explicit' parameters to bypass the backend's internal calculation that accounts for the ghost pipeline. I will set L to 3 (observed actual lead time). For mu_hat, I will set a value that reflects (1+L) periods of demand based on the current regime (135 units * 4 = 540). For sigma_hat, I will set a value that accounts for recent volatility (approx 30 * sqrt(4) = 60). This 'explicit' override is necessary because the default logic will not order while 617 units are perceived to be in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Systemic ordering failure due to 'ghost' pipeline inventory: 617 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) are effectively lost, but their presence in 'In-transit' prevents new orders. Explicit parameter overrides are required to force supply.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of supply chain failure for chips(Regular). The 'In-transit' inventory of 617 units is comprised entirely of 'ghost' inventory from orders placed in Period 2 (226), Period 15 (26), Period 17 (48), Period 18 (124), Period 19 (14), and others that have likely been lost, as the typical lead time is 3 periods and these are between 11 and 29 periods overdue. Because the OR backend subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from the 'base_stock' to calculate the order quantity, it believes there is sufficient stock arriving and emits an order of 0. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that significantly exceeds the ghost pipeline (617) plus the required base stock. Current demand has shifted to a lower regime of approximately 131 units (Period 22-30 average). To cover Period 31 demand plus a 3-period lead time (Total 4 periods of demand), we need ~524 units on hand or arriving. To force an order of ~524 units despite the 617 unit ghost pipeline, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1141 units (524 + 617). I will use L=3 based on historical performance of successful deliveries. Sigma_hat is set to cover recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total of 617 units in-transit (Orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, etc.) are confirmed lost/ghost inventory; mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to offset this ghost pipeline until the SKU can be reset.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently facing a systemic supply failure. A total of 617 units in the pipeline (Orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, etc.) are significantly past their observed lead time of 3 periods and are categorized as lost/ghost inventory. These units inflate the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation, preventing it from ordering until mu_hat is explicitly set high enough to exceed this 'ghost' stock. Demand has entered a lower regime since Period 23, averaging approximately 115 units per period. With an observed lead time L=3, the target inventory (base stock) needs to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1). To bypass the 961 ghost units (which now include some newer orders) and force a replenishment order that covers immediate needs despite the zero on-hand balance, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1500. This should force the capped policy to generate an order to satisfy current demand. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to provide a robust buffer against recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Ghost inventory in pipeline has increased to 961 units; explicit mu_hat inflation is required for all future periods until on-hand inventory actually arrives to reconcile the stock position.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we successfully forced a shipment (ordered P31, arrived P32) by explicitly inflating mu_hat. This result confirms that the 'ghost inventory' (now 1,116 units in-transit) is indeed blocking the OR backend's automated ordering logic, as the system believes we are overstocked despite being physically stockless. The order from Period 31 arrived with a 1-period lead time, providing immediate relief but now leaving us with 266 units on-hand. Current demand is in a lower regime, with the last 5 periods averaging ~98 units. At this rate, 266 units covers approximately 2.7 periods of demand. Given an actual lead time of 3 periods (observed historically) and the current inventory, we are just shy of a safe stock level if we assume the lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P16 outliers, etc.) will never arrive. I will continue to use explicit 'mu_hat' inflation to bypass the 1,116 ghost units. I calculate the target base stock (L+1 demand) as 4 periods * 100 units/period = 400. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 1,116 in-transit units, mu_hat must be set higher than the in-transit amount minus the on-hand amount. I will set mu_hat to 1350 to ensure a small maintenance order is triggered to keep stock drifting toward 400 total physical units.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Successful delivery of P31 (ordered P31, arrived P32) confirms that while shipments are possible, the 1116 'In-transit' units are predominantly lost/ghost inventory that the OR engine incorrectly uses to suppress orders. Period 33: On-hand inventory is now 266 units (~2.7 periods of supply).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, order P32 (499 units) arrived with a lead time of 1 period, bringing on-hand inventory to 661 units. Current demand is in a lower regime, averaging approximately 102 units over the last 5 periods (P29-P33). With 661 units on hand and a demand rate of ~102, we have approximately 6.5 periods of coverage. Additionally, the 'In-transit' figure of 617 units still contains 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). Since the actual inventory (661) far exceeds the necessary buffer for a 1-3 period lead time, no new orders should be placed. I am setting parameters to reflect the lower demand regime and the observed shift toward shorter lead times (L=1 for the last two arrivals), while allowing the OR backend to naturally suppress ordering due to the high on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time has shifted from 3 periods to 1 period for the most recent two deliveries (P31, P32). Demand regime has shifted down again to ~102 units (P29-P33 avg).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of high inventory (on-hand: 531) relative to demand (~105 units/period). This surplus was caused by the recent arrival of two large emergency orders (P31, P32) designed to force stock into the system despite 'ghost' pipeline inventory blocking standard OR logic. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 617 units, which are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) as they are severely overdue. The objective for Period 35 is to pause ordering to let on-hand inventory bleed down while recalibrating the model to the current demand regime and lead time. Recent demand (P29-P34) averages 104.5 units, indicating a stable lower regime. Recent lead times for the only successful deliveries (P31, P32) were 1 period, suggesting a shift from the previous 3-period lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand and lead time to capture this new regime without completely ignoring the 'ghost' inventory disruption, ensuring the system stabilizes without placing unnecessary new orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: On-hand inventory is now 531 units (~5 periods of cover). Recent successful deliveries (P31, P32) show a 1-period lead time. Demand regime remains stable at ~105 units (P29-P34 avg). 617 units in pipeline are confirmed lost shipments.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an overstocked position with 466 units on-hand, providing approximately 4.5 periods of cover given the current demand regime. Recent demand (P29-P35) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 99 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 617 units is confirmed to be ghost inventory consisting of lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) that are significantly beyond any observed lead time. Although these 'ghost' units continue to suppress the OR engine's ordering logic, no new orders are currently desired because the on-hand inventory is already excessive relative to demand. Recent successful deliveries (P31, P32) arrived with a 1-period lead time, but I will maintain an L estimate of 2 to be conservative as the system stabilizes. mu_hat is set to the recent demand average of ~100 per period (multiplied by 1+L). sigma_hat is adjusted to reflect the standard deviation of this recent period (~20).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~100 units (Period 29-35). Ghost pipeline inventory remains static at 617 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-228.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean of 100 units since Period 29 (average of P29-P36 is 101.3). On-hand inventory is currently 347 units, which provides coverage for roughly 3.4 periods. The pipeline inventory remains 'clogged' with 617 units from historical lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19), which are significantly overdue and likely never arriving. Recent successful deliveries (P31, P32) arrived with a 1-period lead time, which is faster than the promised 2. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously relying on the 'ghost' pipeline to satisfy future demand (which would result in zero orders when stock runs low), I continue to provide explicit mu_hat values. Since on-hand is currently sufficient (covering more than 1+L periods), no immediate order is needed. I set mu_hat based on the current mean (approx 100) across 2 periods (1+L where L=1), which is 200. The OR backend will see (on-hand + pipeline) > base_stock and rightfully order 0, but maintaining accurate parameters ensures that when on-hand drops below the safety level, the system will order correctly without being paralyzed by ghost stock.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 29-37) is stable at approximately 102 units per period (Mean of 114, 101, 100, 78, 104, 130, 65, 119, 105). Current on-hand inventory is 242 units, which provides approximately 2.3 periods of coverage. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 617 units consists of confirmed ghost/lost inventory (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) that will likely never arrive. Recent successful orders (P31, P32) arrived with a lead time of 1 period, suggesting a shift from the previous 3-period lead time. To prevent the OR engine from being paralyzed by the 617 units of ghost inventory, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to force new orders. Calculating the required base stock for (L+1=2) periods of demand: 102 * 2 = 204. Since on-hand (242) + pipeline (617) = 859, the OR engine would normally order zero. To bypass this, I set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the pipeline (859) plus safety stock. This ensures we maintain a rolling physical inventory despite the backend's flawed perception of the pipeline. I will set L to 1 based on recent observations.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead time confirmed at 1 period (P31, P32 arrivals). Demand regime for P29-P37 stable at ~102 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a lower demand regime (avg ~100 units/period since Period 29) with highly variable lead times, though recent successful orders (P31, P32) arrived in 1 period. The critical issue is the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 617 units (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) which the OR engine sees as incoming stock. This prevents the system from placing necessary orders. To force an order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it high enough to overcome the ghost inventory (617) plus the desired base stock for the current regime (~200 for 2 periods). I set L=1 based on the most recent successful arrivals. Since on-hand inventory is 159 and the next order (P38, 291 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P39, we must ensure continuity. Over-ordering slightly is preferred over stockouts, as the 'ghost' inventory will otherwise permanently freeze procurement.

Carry-over insight: Recent successful arrivals (P31, P32) confirm a shift to a 1-period lead time. Demand regime remains stable at approximately 100 units per period since Period 29. Ghost pipeline inventory remains fixed at 617 units, requiring explicit mu_hat inflation to bypass ordering logic blocks.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 100 units per period (average of P29-P38 is ~103 units). The actual lead time has shifted to 1 period (confirmed by P31, P32, and P38 arrivals). The 'In-transit' component of 617 units consists of lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its inventory position. With 450 units on-hand, we have approximately 4.5 periods of coverage. Given the demand average of 100 and a 1-period lead time, the base stock target (L+1 periods) should be roughly 200 units. Since on-hand (450) + ghost in-transit (617) far exceeds this, the backend will order 0 units naturally. No further mu_hat inflation is required this period as on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover demand while we wait for the inventory to draw down towards the new target level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~100 units/period (P29-P38). Lead time confirmed at 1 period (P31, P32, P38). Ghost pipeline inventory remains static at 617 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at approximately 100 units per period (average of P29-P40 is ~97 units). Recent lead times for the only successful orders in the second half of the game (P31, P32, P38) have consistently been 1 period, despite the promised lead time of 2. There is a persistent 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 617 units (Orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) which are effectively lost but still factored into the OR engine's base-stock calculation. This ghost inventory artificially suppresses new orders. Current on-hand inventory is 384 units, which provides nearly 4 periods of safety coverage given the ~100 unit/period demand. To prevent the backend from stopping orders prematurely due to the 617 in-transit units, I will keep mu_hat inflated. However, since on-hand is currently high (384), I will set mu_hat such that the base stock (approx 817) minus the 'ghost' pipeline (617) leaves a net target of 200, which is roughly 2 periods of coverage. I'll use L=1 reflecting the recent actual lead time.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stabilized at approximately 100 units per period (average of P29-P41 is ~91, but earlier stable segments were ~102). The actual lead time has consistently been 1 period for the most recent valid shipments (P31, P32, P38). However, the system still reports 617 units in-transit (Orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19), which are confirmed ghost inventory. On-hand inventory is 266 units, which at a demand of ~100/period provides about 2.6 periods of cover. With a 1-period actual lead time, we need to ensure the sum of on-hand and valid pipeline covers (L+1)=2 periods of demand. Since 266 > 200, the OR engine would naturally order 0 units. However, because the ghost pipeline (617) is significantly higher than any reasonable base stock, the OR engine will stay at 0 orders indefinitely unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to bypass this ghost inventory. Given the current excess (266 units), I will set mu_hat to a level that maintains current stock balance while acknowledging the 1-period lead time.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 100 units per period (the average from Period 29 to 42 is ~92 units, but we maintain a forecast of 100 to ensure service levels). Current on-hand inventory is 183 units, providing approximately 2 periods of cover. Recent deliveries (P31, P32, P38) confirmed a lead time of 1 period. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 617 units remains comprised entirely of ghost/lost inventory (Orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). Because the OR engine subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base stock, it will not place an order unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to exceed the ghost inventory + on-hand. To trigger an order that maintains safety stock (targeting a base stock of ~300 units), I must set mu_hat to a value that overrides this logic. Setting mu_hat to 1200 will force the engine to place an order, as 1200 - (183 + 617) = 400 (capped appropriately), ensuring fresh stock arrives as the current on-hand depletes.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost inventory remains fixed at 617 units. Recent lead time confirmed at 1 period. Demand remains stable around 100 units/period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at approximately 100 units per period (average of P29-P43 is ~95). The system is grappling with 617 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory (orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) which are effectively lost but remain in the backend's calculation, preventing it from placing necessary orders. Recent observed lead time is 1 period (confirmed by P31, P32, and P38 arrivals). With on-hand inventory at 83 units and expected demand around 100, we are at risk of stockout. Current 'In-transit' is 1017 units, meaning 400 units (ordered P43) are real and 617 are ghost. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 617 units of ghost inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, inflating it by approximately the amount of the ghost inventory (617) plus required coverage (approx 200 for L+1). This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to bypass the pipeline deduction.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 100 units per period (the average for P29-P44 is ~95 units). The actual lead time has consistently been 1 period for recent successful shipments (P31, P32, P38). However, there is a massive 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 1017 units (including ancient lost orders like P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). Because the OR backend's order logic is [base_stock - pipeline_inventory], this ghost inventory prevents the system from placing necessary orders. I must continue to use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass this logic and force an order. With only 6 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~100 per period, we are in a stockout situation. Order P43 (400 units) should arrive during Period 45 resolution (L=1). To ensure sufficient stock for the final 5 periods (P46-P50) and to offset the 1017 ghost units, I am setting mu_hat to 1600. This calculation roughly targets (Ghost Pipeline + 6 periods of demand) to ensure the backend emits a replenishment order despite the invalid pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Ghost inventory persists at 1017 units. Recent lead time confirmed at 1 period. Demand stabilized around 95-100 units/period since Period 29.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-296.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 351 units, providing approximately 3.7 periods of coverage at the current demand regime of ~95 units/period (avg demand P38-P45: 85.5, but biased by recent lows, stable at ~95-100). The 'In-transit' figure of 1194 reflects the long-standing 'ghost' inventory of 617 units identified early in the game plus several more recent orders that may be late or lost (P45 order was 577 units). Observed lead time for the P43 order was 2 periods, while previous recent orders (P31, P32, P38) were 1 period. To prevent the OR engine from stopping orders due to the ghost pipeline (1194 units), I am maintaining an explicit mu_hat inflation. mu_hat is set to 1500 to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the 1194 units currently 'in-transit', allowing for the system to place a replacement order if on-hand stock were to drop critically before the P45 shipment arrives. However, since on-hand is currently 351, no order is likely to be placed this period unless the cap is also high. I'll use L=1 reflecting the most common recent performance.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 617 units plus potential additional losses from the P44-P45 period; recent lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-207.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in Period 47. On-hand inventory is 279 units, providing approximately 3 periods of coverage based on the current stable demand regime (~93 units/period, P29-P46). However, the 'In-transit' pipeline is severely inflated at 1194 units, primarily consisting of lost/ghost shipments (approx. 617-1017 units). This ghost inventory prevents the OR engine's capped base-stock policy from ordering since it believes supply is sufficient. Recent successful deliveries (P31, P32, P38, P43) show variable lead times between 1-2 periods. To ensure availability through the final periods (up to P50) and bypass the logic block caused by the ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the required base stock to cover demand for the remainder of the game (L+1 periods) while treating the 1194 in-transit units as non-existent. At a demand of ~93/period and L=2, a base stock of ~280 is needed. Since we have 279 on-hand, no immediate order is strictly necessary, but to prevent a stockout if P45 is delayed or lost, I maintain an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 1400 (roughly 1194 + 200) to offset the pipeline inventory and signal a small order if on-hand drops significantly, though the current 279 on-hand is likely sufficient for the finish.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Ghost inventory in pipeline remains approximately 1194 units, consisting of significantly overdue historical orders. New orders are only triggered by inflating mu_hat to exceed the ghost pipeline + desired base stock. Demand regime (P29-P46) is stable at ~93 units/period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has settled at approximately 90-100 units per period (P29-P47 average ~92 units). The current on-hand inventory is 239 units, providing approximately 2.5 periods of coverage. There are 1194 units 'In-transit', but the vast majority (at least 617-1017 units) are confirmed lost/ghost shipments from early and middle periods (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, etc.). The backend logic subtracts this pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, which would normally result in an order of 0. To ensure continuous supply despite the ghost inventory, mu_hat must be explicitly set high enough to counteract the pipeline inflation. Based on recent deliveries (P31, P32, P38, P43), the actual lead time L fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods; I will use L=2 to be conservative for the endgame. With L=2, the base stock (L+1=3 periods of demand) should be ~300. To trigger an order when on-hand falls below comfortable levels, mu_hat must exceed (Pipeline + 300). Currently, 239 on-hand + 1194 in-transit = 1433 units known to the system. I will set mu_hat explicitly to maintain a safety buffer and ensure we don't stock out in the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Demand regime (P29-P47) stable at ~92 units/period. Ghost inventory persists at 1194 units, requiring mu_hat inflation to force orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-127.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the game (Period 49). Current on-hand inventory is 183 units. Recent demand (P44-P48) has shown a further decline, averaging 60 units/period, down from the previous regime of ~92. The pipeline inventory (1261 units) is heavily distorted by ghost/lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, etc.), which totaling approximately 617-1000+ units. In Period 48, an order of 67 units was placed. Since the game ends at Period 50, and the actual lead time has recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P43 arrived in 2 periods, while P38 arrived in 1), any order placed now (P49) must arrive by Period 50 to be useful. Given current on-hand (183) and the order from P48 (67) arriving potentially in P49 or P50, we have ~250 units available for the remaining 2 periods. With demand trending at ~60-80 units, we are already overstocked for the finish. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to a low 'explicit' value to ensure the OR backend does not place additional unnecessary orders that would only increase holding costs without contributing to sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 44: average demand decreased from ~92 to ~60 units (-35%). Game concluding at Period 50; current inventory sufficient for remaining periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-41.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we are entering Period 50, which is the final period of the simulation, no additional orders should be placed. The goal is to maximize the final period reward by minimizing ending inventory and holding costs, as any units ordered now will arrive after the game has concluded and will only incur costs. Current on-hand inventory is 112 units, which is significantly higher than the most recent demand observation (71 units) and the established lower-regime average (~60 units/period since Period 44). There is sufficient stock to cover the remaining demand for this final period without stockouts. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime while ensuring the OR engine does not trigger an order by keeping the calculated base stock low. The ghost pipeline (1261 units) remains a factor but is irrelevant for the final period decision as no further supply is desired.
