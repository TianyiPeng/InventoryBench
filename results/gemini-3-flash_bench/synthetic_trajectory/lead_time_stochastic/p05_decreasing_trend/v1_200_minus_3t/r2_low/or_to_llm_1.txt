The OR recommendation for Period 2 is 235 units, calculated using L=2 and historical samples.

The order from Period 2 (235 units) should arrive during Period 4 and be visible at the start of Period 5. This aligns with the 'In-transit' total of 473 units. 2. Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the first two periods was 193 and 180 (average ~187). Total demand over (L+1) = 3 periods is expected to be ~560 units. 3. Strategy: We have 473 units in the pipeline. To cover 3 periods of demand plus some safety stock, we need a total availability of roughly 600-650 units. The OR recommendation of 77 units seems low because it uses a cap and empirical data from the pre-game samples (which had lower demand: 217, 207, 170, 131, 185 - average 182) compared to the actual initial game periods. However, looking at the pre-game data, demand is relatively stable around 180-190. Current pipeline (473) + proposed order (77) = 550 units. Given high holding costs ($1) equal to profit ($1), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning we should target the median demand (no safety stock). Average demand is ~182. 3 periods * 182 = 546.

However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. Per the game mechanics, an order placed in N arrives in N+L (1+2=3). Since it didn't arrive in Period 3, it is either delayed or lost. 2. **Inventory Analysis**: Current on-hand is 0. Demand for Periods 1-3 was 193, 180, and 207, resulting in total lost sales of 580 units because on-hand was zero. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Historical samples (217, 207, 170, 131, 185) suggest an average demand of ~182. 4. **Pipeline**: There are 550 units in-transit (Orders from P1, P2, P3). 5. **OR Recommendation**: The OR suggests 9 units. This is extremely low because the OR sees a large pipeline (550) and a low cap based on historical demand, assuming the pipeline will arrive. 6. **Strategy**: I have a massive backlog of lost sales and zero current inventory. While the P1 order is 'missing' in the P3 conclude, the lead-time definition says it arrives *during* the period and is visible in the *next* conclude message. This means the Period 1 order should be visible in the Period 4 conclude (at the start of Period 5). If I order too much now, and the pipeline finally clears, I will face high holding costs ($1/unit). However, I must ensure I don't continue to stock out.

To cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods), we need roughly 315-330 units. \n3. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely accounts for the massive (lost) 'In-transit' quantity as available inventory. This is incorrect. With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 360 units (expected to arrive in P45, P46, and P47), we have enough coverage for the immediate 3-period horizon.

Based on the Carry-over Insights, 1863 units from periods P2 through P30 are confirmed lost. Recent arrivals (P45) show that units ordered in P42 and P43 arrived with lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively. This validates that the supplier is still delivering, but lead times are variable. The current effective pipeline consists of orders from P44 (120 units), P45 (120 units), and P46 (100 units), totaling 340 units. On-hand inventory is 113. Demand has shifted from a historical mean of ~170/period to a more recent regime of ~100/period, with even lower figures in the last few periods (55, 72). The OR recommendation of 0 units likely stems from the inflated 'In-transit' figure and the recent demand drop. However, with only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P47-P50), we must ensure we have enough stock to cover the final periods without over-ordering and incurring holding costs. Expected demand for the remaining 4 periods is approximately 400 units. Our total availability (On-hand 113 + Effective Pipeline 340 = 453) is sufficient to cover this.

Since 'Period 47 conclude' shows arrived=0, and we are entering P48, the effective pipeline is currently unreliable. On-hand inventory is 73 units. Recent demand has cooled significantly (moving from ~105/period to ~55/period over the last three periods), but we must maintain stock for the final three periods (P48, P49, P50). The OR recommendation is 0 units, likely because it includes the phantom 2093 'In-transit' units. I will override this. We need to cover demand for the remainder of the game. Total expected demand for P48-P50 is ~240 units (using a conservative 80/period estimate). Subtracting on-hand (73) leaves ~167 units.
