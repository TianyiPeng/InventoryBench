The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first five periods shows a mean of approximately 182 units (217, 207, 170, 131, 185). Since lead time is 2 periods, the order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 3. Therefore, I need to cover demand for Period 1 (current), Period 2, and Period 3 (L+1 coverage logic). Total forecasted demand for 3 periods at the historical average is roughly 546 units. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, I must order enough to cover this window while considering the high holding cost ($1.0/unit), which equals the profit. Given the high holding cost relative to profit, I will aim for a lean inventory strategy. I will order 550 units to establish a baseline inventory that covers the first few periods of demand.",

To cover at least 3 periods of demand (L+1) at a mean of 100 units, plus a safety buffer for the high shipment loss rate, a target pipeline + on-hand of ~350-400 is appropriate.

Assessing the pipeline: Orders from P42 (130) and P43 (130) are within the 1-3 period delivery window. The order from P41 (100) just arrived in P44. Given the high loss rate, I must maintain a robust pipeline to ensure service level. Target inventory for (Lead Time 3 + 1) periods at 110 units/period (safety-adjusted mean) is 440 units. Current reliable pipeline (P42, P43, P44) is 380 units. On-hand is 23. Total reliable stock/pipeline is 403 units. To reach the target of 440, I will order 40 units, but considering the 33% loss probability, a slightly larger buffer is prudent. However, with only 5 periods left in the game, I should avoid over-ordering to minimize ending inventory holding costs. I will place a standard replenishment order for 100 units.",

Since game ends at Period 50, we only have 4 periods of demand remaining (P47, P48, P49, P50). Expected total demand until the end is ~320-400 units. Cumulative inventory on hand plus the reliable pipeline (156 + 320 = 476) already covers the remaining expected demand until the end of the game. Additional ordering risks incurring high holding costs ($1/unit/period) with limited upside, especially given the game conclusion is near.

Therefore, the optimal action is to place an order of 0. Current status: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand in Period 49 was 71 (inventory was 60, resulting in 11 lost sales).
