Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips (Regular) with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available (though we are technically at Period 1, the prompt provides P1-P5 data as 'samples' to inform the forecast). The samples are: 204, 155, 134, 72, 108. The mean of these 5 samples is 134.6, and the standard deviation is approximately 50.8. Since L=2, the exposure period is (1+L) = 3. Initial mean estimate mu_hat = 3 * 134.6 = 403.8. Initial sigma_hat = sqrt(3) * 50.8 = 88.0. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the provided historical samples while setting L to 'default' (2).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 219 units. Given the promised lead time (L) is 2, those units are scheduled to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 219 in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 191 units. Historical demand across the first 5 samples shows a mean of 134.6 (204, 155, 134, 72, 108). Period 1 demand (191) was slightly higher than the mean but within reasonable variation. Since we have no confirmed shifts in lead time yet, I will use the default lead time (L=2) and use the average of the last 3 samples to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the very early samples might be more volatile as the system settles. The backend will calculate base_stock based on (1+L) * mean.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Orders were placed in Period 1 (219 units) and Period 2 (152 units). The promised lead time is 2. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 2 should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and will be visible in the Period 4 start observation. Therefore, it is normal that 'arrived=0' was reported in the Period 1 and Period 2 conclude messages. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 371 units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including the 2 simulated and 3 provided in the prompt) shows a downward trend: 204, 155, 134, 72, 108. The average demand across these 5 samples is 134.6. Given L=2, the total window is (1+L)=3 periods. I will use the average of all 5 available samples to estimate the mean demand and volatility to ensure we don't overreact to the low Period 4 and 5 data points while waiting for the first shipment to arrive.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in P1 (219 units), P2 (152 units), and P3 (48 units). Based on the lead time definition, the P1 order (placed in P1) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This indicates a delay or a lead time longer than 2 periods. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and have lost all demand for the first 3 periods (sold=0), we are in a critical stockout. The demand history shows a downward trend (191, 113, 149 - note: user-provided 'Historical Demand Data' shows 204, 155, 134, 72, 108, but the 'Game History' reflects actual realizations). I will use the last 3 periods of game history to estimate demand. Given the stockout and the apparent lead-time delay, I will explicitly set L to 3 to increase the base stock level and pipeline coverage, helping to recover once shipments arrive.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 204, 155, 134, 72, 108 (Mean ~135). The promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual observations show variability: P1 order arrived in P4 (L=3), and P3 order arrived in P4 (L=1). On-hand inventory is 159, with 337 in-transit (orders from P2 and P4). Since demand has settled into a lower range (average of last 4 periods is ~117 vs P1's 204), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to reflect this shift. For lead time, since we've seen L=1 and L=3, 'calculate' (average) is appropriate. Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-37.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 98 units with 402 units in-transit. Historical demand shows a declining trend: Period 1 was 204 (per prompt historical data, though conclude message says 191), while the last three periods (3, 4, 5) averaged approximately 106 units (149, 108, 61). Specifically, Period 5 demand was just 61. Lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (P4). Period 2's order of 152 units is currently at L=4 (ordered P2, not arrived by P5 conclude), suggesting a potential delay or loss. Given the promised L=2, the backend calculation 'calculate' is best to average these variances. For demand, the most recent 3 periods (P3-P5) reflect a lower demand regime compared to the start, so N=3 is used for mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering during this downward shift.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 28 units with 402 units in transit. Historical demand shows a significant downward trend: Period 1-3 averaged 151 units, while Period 4-6 averaged 79.7 units (a ~47% drop). Lead times have been inconsistent: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods (P4), while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period (P4). There are two outstanding orders: Period 2 (152 units) and Period 4 (185 units) and Period 5 (65 units). The total in-transit (402) is calculated as P2(152) + P4(185) + P5(65) = 402. Since demand has stabilized at a lower level for the last 3 periods, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering, as the pipeline already significantly exceeds the current demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: average demand decreased from 151 to 80 (-47%). Lead time variability observed (range 1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-35.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the demand regime shifted downward starting around Period 4. The average demand for Periods 1-3 was approximately 151, while Periods 4-7 show an average of 82. Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average is roughly 2.33 based on arrivals from P1, P3, and P4). At the start of Period 8, we have 124 units on hand and 217 units in-transit (from orders in P2 and P5). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the service level target q = 0.5, meaning we target the median of the demand distribution. I am using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (approx 82/period). Given the actual lead times observed (3, 1, 3), the default L (promised 2) is slightly optimistic, but the pipeline is currently well-stocked for the lower demand level, so I will allow the backend to use the calculated average lead time to account for the variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a clear shift. From Period 1-3, demand averaged 151. From Period 4-8, demand shifted lower, averaging 86.4. The last 3 periods (6, 7, 8) show a slight uptick (70, 89, 104), suggesting demand may be stabilizing or slowly increasing from the low. Actual lead times have been 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods, making the average 2.5 vs the promised 2. Using L=3 (explicit) is safer given the recent streak of 3-period arrivals. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (mean ~86) while accounting for the recent rising trend. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the volatility in this period range.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a low on-hand inventory of 16 units. Analyzing the history, demand has significantly stabilized around a lower mean since Period 4. The average demand from Period 4 to Period 9 is approximately 83.5 units, confirming the previous carry-over insight of a regime shift. Lead times are volatile; while the promised lead time is 2, observed actual lead times have been 1 period (P3 order) and 3 periods (P1, P4, and P5 orders), with the P2 order (152 units) still missing after 8 periods, suggesting it is likely lost. Because the backend OR logic uses the promised lead time (L=2) to calculate pipeline inventory, it will include these lost 152 units in its calculation unless I adjust L or mu_hat. However, setting L=3 (recent average) and using N=6 for mu_hat (period 4-9) will allow the OR engine to better reflect the current demand regime. The pipeline currently contains 109 units (ordered P9) and the presumably lost 152 units (ordered P2). By setting L to 3, the target base stock will be calculated over (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~334 units).

Carry-over insight: P2 order (152 units) confirmed lost: 8 periods elapsed since order without arrival. Demand regime stable at ~84 units/period since P4.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we have 0 units on-hand and are currently in a stockout situation (last period sold only 16 out of 66 demand). The Carry-Over Insights and Game History confirm that the Period 2 order (152 units) is lost, meaning it will likely never arrive. Current in-transit units (318) consist of Period 9 (109 units) and Period 10 (57 units), plus the lost Period 2 order which the OR backend still counts as pipeline inventory because it doesn't know it's lost. The lead time is highly volatile (1-3 periods, average ~2.5), which is higher than the promised 2. Demand since Period 4 has stabilized at an average of 83.8 units/period (84). To compensate for the lost shipment that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3.0 to increase the base stock calculation. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 (from Period 4 onwards) to capture the lower demand regime (~84/period). Since profit equals holding cost ($1.0 each), the target service level is 0.5 (q = 1/(1+1)). This means we aim for the median demand over the protection lead time (L+1). By setting L to 3.0 and mu_hat to 336 (4 periods * 84), we signal to the OR backend to maintain higher inventory to cover for the lost 152 units without triggering an over-order from the 'cap' mechanism.

Lead Time Analysis: Promised lead time is 2. Historical arrivals (P4, P7, P8) show actual lead times of 1, 3, 3, and 3. The P2 order (152 units) is confirmed lost. Average successful lead time is (1+3+3+3)/4 = 2.5 periods. I will set L to 3 to be conservative given the history of delays and losses.
Demand Analysis: Demand shifted in P4. Mean demand from P4 to P11 is (108+61+70+89+104+69+66+85)/8 = 81.5. Sigma (std) for this period is approximately 17.5. 
Parameters: L=3 (explicit). mu_hat = (1+L) * 81.5 = 326. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) * 17.5 = 35. This ensures the OR backend target (base stock) covers the expected demand during the lead time plus current period, accounting for existing pipeline inventory.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received 166 units (orders from P9 and P10), resolving the stockout from P11. Current on-hand inventory is 121 units. The demand regime remains stable in the lower range (~83 units/period) since Period 4. Analysis of lead times (P4: L=3, L=1; P7: L=3; P8: L=3; P12: L=3, L=2) shows a mode and mean closer to 3 periods than the promised 2. I will set L=3 to ensure the inventory covers the extended lead time. mu_hat is calculated using a recent_N of 9 (Period 4 through 12) to capture the lower demand regime accurately. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend targets an approx 50% service level for the base stock calculation, which I've buffered by choosing a longer L.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-11.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in a lower regime since Period 4, with an average of approximately 75 units per period over the last 10 periods (P4-P13). The lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with many orders arriving at exactly 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9). Since the promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times often reach 3, I am explicitly setting L=2.5 to provide a buffer for the 3-period arrivals. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current stable demand regime (approx. 75 units * (1+2.5) = 262.5). sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. We have 66 units on hand and 189 in-transit (P11: 6, P12: 2, P13: 29, plus potentially older missing/long-lead items), which the OR backend will reconcile against the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: mean demand ~75 units/period (P4-P13). Lead time persists at 2-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing chips(Regular). The demand has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 4. From Period 4 to 14, the mean demand is approximately 75 units (mean of the last 11 periods is 72.4). We currently have 27 units on-hand and 192 in-transit. The in-transit inventory includes orders from P12 (2 units), P13 (29 units), P14 (9 units), and several older orders that are likely lost or extremely delayed (specifically orders from P2 remains missing and is treated as lost). Recent arrival history confirms lead times fluctuate between 2 and 3 periods (P11 arrived P14, LT=3; P10 arrived P12, LT=2). Given the stable demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume accurately. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the actual average lead time experienced (approx 2.4 periods) rather than the promised 2 periods, which helps the OR backend better estimate the necessary pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $29.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 12-15) has dipped to an average of ~48 units, which is lower than the previous regime of ~75-80 units. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this lower volume for mu_hat. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times (P4, P7, P8, P12, P14, P15) have been predominantly 3 periods (with one instance of 1 and 2). Setting L to an explicit value of 3 reflects this consistent delay and ensures the pipeline covers a realistic horizon. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) with 261 units in-transit (P13, P14, P15 orders). Given the lead time of 3, the P13 order (29 units) should arrive in Period 16, but we must protect against further stockouts. The OR backend uses a profit/holding cost ratio where q=0.5 (as profit and holding costs are both $1), suggesting a base stock targeting the median demand. By providing explicit L and recent_N parameters, the engine will compute a base stock sufficient to bridge the 4-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: average demand decreased from ~75 to ~48 (-36%). Lead time remains predominantly 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $29.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downwards around Period 12. In the last 5 periods (P12-P16), the mean demand is 48.2 units per period (45, 55, 45, 46, 50). This confirms the carry-over insight from Period 16. On the supply side, the actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in most recent arrivals: P11, P12, and P13 all arrived with L=3). One shipment (P2, 152 units) is confirmed lost. Currently, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have 232 units in-transit (orders from P14: 9, P15: 71, P16: 0, and some residue). However, given the lead time of 3, the P14 order (9 units) should arrive this period, and P15 (71 units) next period. To navigate this, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the consistent delay. I'll set mu_hat to (1+3)*48.2 = 192.8 using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the lower demand regime and ensure the base stock calculation uses the current behavior. With Profit=1 and Holding=1, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning we want to target the median demand over the lead time to minimize total costs.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 12, stabilizing at a lower average of ~50 units per period compared to the previous ~75 units (P4-P11). Average demand for P12-P17 is 50.5. Lead times have consistently been 3 periods for the last 5 confirmed arrivals (P11, P12, P13, P14), despite a promised lead time of 2. Currently, there is an inventory shortage (0 on-hand) while waiting for the P15 order (71 units) and potential future arrivals. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, translated by the OR backend. I will set L to 3 to reflect the observed reality and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime starting at P12. This approach identifies the need for stock while avoiding over-ordering in a lower-demand environment.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 12, averaging approximately 48 units per period. The inventory is currently critically low (On-hand: 0) with 223 units in-transit. These in-transit units primarily consist of the order from Period 15 (71 units) and potential previous balances. Since lead times are consistently 3 periods, the order from Period 15 (placed at Period 15, expected lead time 3) should arrive in Period 18's conclude message (visible now), but it hasn't appeared yet, signaling a slight delay or loss risk. However, the last several arrivals (Periods 12, 14, 15, 16, 17) all confirmed a lead time of 3 periods (except one instance of 2). Therefore, I will set the lead time L to 3. For demand forecasting, I will use the most recent 7 periods (P12-P18) to capture the current lower demand level (mean ~48.2). This setup ensures the OR backend targets enough stock to cover the 3-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=4 periods), while accounting for the recent decrease in volatility.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with 223 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the demand shifted around Period 12 to a lower average of approximately 48 units per period (P12-P19 average: 48.25). The actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed for orders placed in P11, P12, P13, and P14), which is longer than the promised 2 periods. The 71 units ordered in P15 are expected to arrive in P18 conclude, but since they didn't, they are likely arriving during P19 or P20 resolution phases. Given the lag, I will set L to 3 to reflect actual delivery times and use the recent 8-period demand window (P12-P19) to calculate the forecast and volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current lower demand regime and longer lead time.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a severe stockout because multiple orders from Periods 15 through 20 have not arrived. Observations from 'Carry-over Insights' and history show that the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods, yet orders from P15 (71 units) are now 5 periods overdue, and subsequent placeholder orders (of 0 units) have resulted in a pipeline that is stalled. Demand from Period 12 to 20 has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 50 units/period. The current 'In-transit' of 223 units includes the P15 order (71) and potentially other units, but since On-hand is 0 and demand is ~50, I must set parameters to trigger a recovery order if the backend perceives a gap. I will use L=3 based on consistent history and recent_N for demand to capture the lower regime (avg ~50).

Carry-over insight: Significant stockout confirmed Periods 18-20 due to delayed/lost arrivals from P15 onwards. Pipeline inventory exists (223 units) but availability is zero.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0 and a significant demand backlog (lost sales). Demand has shifted to a lower regime since Period 12, averaging approximately 48 units per period (N=10). Lead times are consistently longer than the promised 2 periods, typically arriving at 3 periods (observed in P12, P14, P15, P16, P17). Currently, there are 223 units in-transit, which includes orders from P15 (71 units), and potentially later periods if the OR engine placed orders (though history shows 'ordered=0' from P16-P21, the 'In-transit' figure of 223 suggests there are outstanding orders not reflected in the conclude messages yet, or legacy pipeline). Given Lead Time L=3, the order placed in P15 is now at the 6-period mark (P21 conclude), signaling it might be lost or extremely delayed. However, I will set L to 3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time and use recent_N (N=10) for demand parameters to capture the current lower volume regime of ~48 units/period, ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the lead time and the current period (L+1 = 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Lead time reliably established as 3 periods (not promised 2). P15 order (71 units) is potentially lost or severely delayed (6 periods elapsed).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a prolonged stockout state (Periods 18-22). Inventory on-hand is 0, while 223 units are in-transit. Based on 'Carry-over insights', the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods, yet significant delays are occurring. The order from Period 15 (71 units) is now 7 periods old and likely lost. Subsequent orders (if any were placed, though history shows ordered=0 since P17) are not materializing. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 223 units suggests orders were placed by the OR backend that aren't fully reflected in the 'ordered=' history snippets or involve earlier periods. Demand since Period 12 has stabilized around 50 units/period (Mean of P12-P22 is approx 49.9). I will set L=3 based on established history, and use N=11 (P12-P22) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime. This keeps the base stock calculation aligned with the 3-period lead time requirement while acknowledging the recent demand drop.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe supply crisis with no arrivals since Period 17, despite a pipeline of 223 units. Based on historical data, the most recent arrivals (P12-P17) showed a consistent lead time of 3 periods. However, orders from P15 (71 units) and subsequent periods are now significantly overdue (P15 order is 9 periods past its placement, indicating it is almost certainly lost). Despite the stockout, the demand regime is stable. Since P12, demand has averaged approx 49.5 units/period (P12-P23). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline contains 223 units (which are either severely delayed or lost), I must set parameters to trigger replenishment while acknowledging the 3-period lead time. I will use L=3 and set mu_hat based on the last 12 samples (P12-P23) to reflect the current lower demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 4-period risk cycle (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: No arrivals observed for 6 consecutive periods (P18-P23). P15 order (71 units) and potentially subsequent pipeline units (up to 223 total) are likely lost or indefinitely delayed.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has effectively collapsed, with no arrivals since Period 17 (7+ consecutive periods). My current in-transit inventory of 223 units includes the Period 15 order (71 units, now 10 periods old) and potentially other units that appear lost or indefinitely delayed. The OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' from 'base_stock', so if I leave 'in-transit' at 223 while no physical inventory arrives, the backend will never order more, resulting in continuous stockouts. I must manually zero out the 'in-transit' logic by using an 'explicit' L that represents the true lead time (observed as 3) and an 'explicit' mu_hat that covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand plus an aggressive buffer to trigger new orders despite the ghost in-transit count. Since demand has averaged ~48-50 units recently, I am setting mu_hat to 400 (which is ~100 per period x 4 periods) to force the backend to place a new shipment of approximately 177 units (400 - 223 pipeline), ensuring we attempt to re-establish supply.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse finalized: No units arrived from Period 18 to Period 24 (7 periods). Existing pipeline (223 units) is likely lost or unreliable. New orders must be forced by overestimating mu_hat to offset inactive in-transit counts.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of failure, with no arrivals since Period 17 (9 consecutive periods). The total in-transit inventory of 339 units includes orders dating back to Period 15 (ordered 10 periods ago) and other units that are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. In Period 25, an order of 116 units was placed to attempt to restart the flow. However, because the backend logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) subtracts the entire (likely lost) in-transit count from the target, the system will not place new orders unless I artificially inflate mu_hat or sigma_hat to exceed the 339-unit threshold. Recent demand (P21-P25) has averaged ~39 units/period. For Period 26, I use an 'explicit' mu_hat of 500 to force an order that overrides the phantom pipeline inventory. I set L to 3 based on the last reliable observations before the stoppage. This strategy aims to force new procurement despite the backlog of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure extended: 9 consecutive periods without arrivals (P18-P26). Accumulated in-transit inventory (339 units) is confirmed non-functional. Strategy shifted to 'forced procurement' by inflating parameters to bypass pipeline logic.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely compromised with no units arriving for 10 consecutive periods (P18-P27). The pipeline inventory (500 units) consists of orders from P15 onwards, most of which are significantly past the observed 3-period lead time and are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. Following the strategy established in P25, I must force new orders to bypass the OR backend's 'logic' that subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to explicit values that significantly exceed documented in-transit units, I aim to trigger the maximum order (cap) allowed by the OR engine. Demand has stabilized at approximately 45 units/period over the long term, but current period demand is lower (~30). I will set mu_hat to 1000 and sigma_hat to 200 to ensure the backend perceives a massive deficit and places an order despite the 500 units in transit.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Supply chain blackout extended to 10 periods. In-transit inventory (500 units) is non-functional. Explicit parameter inflation remains necessary to force replenishment orders.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of total blackout. No units have arrived for 11 consecutive periods (P17-P27), despite a massive pipeline of 915 units. The OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy (base_stock - in_transit), meaning as long as the 'In-transit' figure is high, it will not place new orders unless the parameters are extremely inflated. Since demand is currently stable at approximately 30-40 units per period, and we have zero on-hand stock and no incoming visibility, I must continue to 'force' orders by using the 'explicit' method. I am setting L to 3 (effectively the observed actual lead time when the system worked) and mu_hat to a value significantly higher than the current pipeline (915) to ensure the backend generates a replenishment order. Setting mu_hat to 1400 and sigma_hat to 300 creates a base stock target of roughly 1600-1700, which after subtracting the 915 in-transit units, should prompt an order to cover potential demand if arrivals ever resume.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain blackout extended to 11 periods (P17-P27). Cumulative in-transit (915 units) is non-functional. Explicit parameter inflation (mu_hat=1400) is being used to bypass the pipeline-inventory cap and force replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-67.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, a major supply chain breakthrough occurred: 161 units (ordered in P26) arrived with a lead time of 2 periods. This confirms that the supply chain is no longer in a total blackout and that the 'lost' in-transit inventory (approx. 915 units prior to recent orders) remains effectively lost or significantly delayed, while new orders are flowing through. Current on-hand is 114 units. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 40-50 units in the current regime. Since the backend OR logic subtracts the massive (and largely non-functional) pipeline of 1239 units from the base stock calculation, I must continue to provide an inflated mu_hat to ensure new orders are placed to maintain stock, although I will temper the inflation slightly now that some stock has arrived. I will set L to 3 (observed actual) and an explicit mu_hat of 1200 to keep the base stock high enough to trigger replenishment orders against the ghost pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain blackout ended Period 28: Order from P26 arrived (lead time 2). Historical in-transit inventory (approx. 900+ units) remains non-functional/lost. Forced procurement via inflated parameters remains necessary to counteract the 'ghost' pipeline in OR logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-461.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain blackout ended in Period 28 with the arrival of the P26 order, followed by the P27 order in Period 29 (both arriving with a lead time of 2 periods). Current on-hand inventory is 495 units, which is significantly above the current average demand (mean ~38 units/period since Period 24). However, the 'In-transit' count of 824 units still contains approximately 339 units from the historical 'lost' period (orders from P15 onwards that never arrived) and the large order from P28 (485 units), which is expected to arrive during Period 30 or 31. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (824) from its target base stock, it will stop ordering. Given the high on-hand inventory (495) relative to demand (~38), we are now overstocked for the short term. The primary goal now is to allow the on-hand inventory to deplete toward a normal level while ensuring that the 'ghost' pipeline doesn't prevent future replenishment once stocks drop. I will set L to 2 (observed recently), and revert parameters to more realistic levels, but keep mu_hat slightly elevated at a 'normal' safety level (approx 150 units for 3 periods of demand) to ensure the system doesn't completely freeze if more shipments fail.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered at P28: Lead time resolved to 2 periods for P26 and P27 orders. Demand remains in a lower regime (~38 units/period since P24). Historical pipeline (approx 339 units) remains lost/unreliable.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has fully recovered, with orders from Period 26, 27, and 28 arriving with a stable lead time of 2 periods. However, the aggressive 'forced procurement' strategy used during the blackout (P25-P28) to bypass the 'ghost' pipeline inventory has resulted in a massive on-hand surplus of 934 units. Current demand is in a low regime, averaging approximately 38 units/period over the last 7 periods (P24-P30). With on-hand inventory (934) and functional in-transit inventory (339) totaling 1,273 units, and a demand rate of ~38 units, the system currently holds over 30 periods of supply. The objective must now shift entirely to inventory depletion to minimize holding costs, which are $1.0/unit/period. I will set the parameters to reflect the true demand regime (38 units/period) and a lead time of 2. The OR backend will see that (on-hand + pipeline) far exceeds the base stock level and will cease ordering naturally.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain fully recovered at Period 28 with lead time stabilized at 2 periods. Significant inventory surplus (934 on-hand) created by forced procurement during the P18-P27 blackout. Demand established in a low regime (~38 units/period) since Period 24.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has fully recovered from the Period 18-27 blackout. We now face a significant inventory surplus (898 on-hand units) resulting from the forced procurement strategy used to bypass the OR engine's pipeline-inventory logic during the crisis. Recent demand (P24-P31) has stabilized at a lower regime, averaging 37.5 units per period. With nearly 900 units on hand and a demand rate of ~38, we have approximately 24 periods of inventory coverage. The 'In-transit' figure of 339 units represents the historical ghost orders that are likely lost or permanently delayed, but even if they were to arrive, the oversupply is already established. Our current objective is to minimize holding costs by preventing any new orders until the inventory level drops to a reasonable base-stock level. We set a low \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on recent demand samples (N=8) and lead time (L=2) to ensure the OR engine's base-stock calculation remains far below our current on-hand + pipeline total, effectively halting replenishment.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain recovered significantly starting Period 28, but the 'forced procurement' strategy used during the blackout (P18-P27) to bypass logic errors caused by lost shipments has resulted in a large inventory surplus. On-hand inventory is currently 847 units, which is extremely high given the current demand regime of approximately 38-40 units per period. The 339 units in-transit are the legacy shipments from before the blackout that are effectively lost and will likely never arrive. Since on-hand inventory alone covers over 20 periods of current demand, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from ordering, I will set mu_hat to a very low value and use the default lead time. Sigma_hat is set to recent levels to maintain a realistic volatility buffer once inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Inventory surplus: Current on-hand inventory (847 units) is sufficient for ~20 periods of demand. No new orders required until inventory levels significantly deplete.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is currently characterized by a massive surplus (819 units on-hand) resulting from the forced procurement strategy used during the Period 18-27 supply chain blackout. Current demand is stable in a low regime, averaging approximately 38 units per period (P24-P33). With on-hand inventory covering over 20 periods of demand and a holding cost equal to the unit profit ($1.00), minimizing further arrivals is critical to prevent total profit erosion. The 'In-transit' count of 339 units represents the legacy orders from the blackout period that are likely lost or will further exacerbate the surplus if they eventually arrive. To ensure the OR backend does not place any new orders, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with a small N to reflect the current low demand, and rely on the existing inventory to satisfy all requirements for the foreseeable future.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has a massive inventory surplus of 764 units on-hand, which at the current demand regime of ~40 units per period, is sufficient to last for approximately 19 periods. The OR backend uses a pipeline inventory logic where 'base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)' determines the order quantity. To avoid placing any new orders while we deplete this expensive surplus (holding cost $1.0 vs profit $1.0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to the lowest possible values. This ensures that the calculated 'base_stock' remains significantly lower than the current inventory position (On-hand 764 + In-transit 339), resulting in zero new orders. The supply chain has stabilized at a lead time of 2 periods, but that is secondary to the inventory management priority here.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high inventory surplus (695 units on-hand) following a supply chain recovery in Period 28. The current demand regime, established around Period 24, remains low with an average of approximately 42 units per period (last 12 periods: mean=42.4). With a holding cost of $1.0 per unit and a profit of $1.0 per unit, the backend logic targets a 50% service level. Given the current on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 16 periods of demand at the current rate, no new orders should be placed. I will maintain lead time L at the default (promised 2) even though 3 is common, as it doesn't impact current decisions. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=12 to capture the current stable low-demand regime. The high pipeline inventory (339 units) is a mix of likely lost orders from the blackout period and units that may eventually arrive, but regardless, the massive on-hand stock makes procurement unnecessary for the foreseeable future.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-657.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a surplus state following the 'forced procurement' strategy used to resolve the Period 18-27 supply chain blackout. Current on-hand inventory is 676 units, while the recent demand regime (Period 24 onwards) averages approximately 38 units per period. This on-hand stock alone covers over 17 periods of demand. The in-transit inventory of 339 units (likely from the blackout period or initial recovery) is still listed but is either severely delayed or unnecessary given current stock levels. To ensure no further orders are placed while we deplete this expensive surplus (holding cost is $1.0 vs $1.0 profit), I will continue to set the OR parameters to their minimum levels. Specifically, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to 'recent_N' with N=14 to reflect the stable low-demand period, and keep L at default (2). No new orders will be triggered by the OR backend as current inventory significantly exceeds any reasonable base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-650.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a significant overstock state following the forced procurement strategy used to break the Period 18-27 supply chain blackout. Current on-hand inventory is 663 units, whereas the mean demand since Period 24 has stabilized around 37 units per period. At this consumption rate, the existing stock will last for approximately 18 periods, which is well beyond the 50-period game horizon (ending in 12 periods). Any further ordering would only increase holding costs without providing any additional service level benefit. Therefore, the goal is to set parameters so that no new orders are triggered. I will use the established low-demand regime (Period 24 onwards, N=14) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L at the recent observed lead time of 2 periods. The backend logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will correctly result in zero orders given the massive inventory surplus.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-inventory state (619 units on-hand) following the resolution of the Period 18-27 supply chain blackout. Current demand is low, averaging approximately 41 units per period over the last 15 periods (since Period 24). With 619 units on-hand and an additional 339 units in-transit (though these 339 are likely the 'lost' units from the previous supply chain failure), the current stock covers at least 15 periods of demand. No new orders are necessary. I will set parameters to ensure the OR backend's calculated base_stock remains below the current inventory plus the (potentially ghost) pipeline, resulting in a zero order. I'll use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting to reflect the current low-demand regime, and keep L at default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-579.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 599 units on-hand and an additional 339 units in-transit (though these in-transit units are from the historical supply chain failure and likely lost). Current demand is in a low regime, averaging approximately 37 units per period since Period 24 (last 16 periods). At this consumption rate, the existing on-hand inventory (599 units) is sufficient to cover approximately 16 more periods of demand. Given that there are only 10 periods remaining in the game (ending at Period 50), and the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.0), it is optimal to continue depleting the current surplus without placing new orders. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs without increasing revenue, as stockout risk is zero for the remainder of the session. L is set to calculate to reflect the restored lead time, while mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N (N=16) to capture the current low-demand environment, though the OR engine will not trigger an order due to the high on-hand balance.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently burning through a large inventory surplus (561 units on-hand) created by forced procurement during a previous supply chain blackout. Current demand is in a low regime, averaging approximately 37 units per period since Period 30 (range: 13-69). With 561 units on-hand and an estimated demand of ~40 units/period, there is sufficient stock for approximately 14 more periods, which exceeds the remaining 10 periods of the game (ending at Period 50). Therefore, no new orders should be placed to avoid unnecessary holding costs. The OR engine will naturally refrain from ordering as long as the base_stock calculation remains below the sum of on-hand (561) and in-transit (339) inventory. I am setting parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime: L=2 (stable since recovery), mu_hat based on the last 15 periods to capture the ~37-40 mean, and standard sigma_hat. This will result in a base stock significantly lower than 900, ensuring zero units are ordered.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently dealing with a massive inventory surplus (520 on-hand units) resulting from forced procurement during the Period 18-27 supply chain blackout. At the current demand regime of approximately 42 units per period (average of the last 10 periods), the existing on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 12 periods of demand without further ordering. The inventory holding cost ($1.0) equals the unit profit ($1.0), making it economically critical to avoid further replenishment until inventory levels are significantly lower. Lead time has stabilized at 2 periods since the recovery. I will continue to set parameters such that the OR backend does not place new orders, allowing the surplus to naturally deplete. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set based on the recent stable demand of the last 17 periods (starting around P25) to maintain a realistic baseline, but on-hand inventory will correctly prevent the OR engine from triggering new purchases.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently dealing with a significant inventory surplus of 508 units on-hand, resulting from protective over-ordering during a historical supply chain blackout (Periods 18-27). Demand has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 24, with an average of approximately 38 units per period. At the current demand rate, the on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 13-14 periods of demand. No new orders are required. The OR backend uses the logic: 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)'. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to moderate values reflecting current demand (recent_N=10), the calculated base_stock will remain far below the total inventory (on-hand + in-transit), ensuring zero new orders are placed to minimize further holding costs while the surplus depletes. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as the supply chain has stabilized at a 2-period lead time recently.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently dealing with a massive inventory surplus (466 units on-hand) relative to the current demand regime. Since Period 24, average demand has stabilized at approximately 37 units per period. With current on-hand inventory, we have approximately 12.5 periods of stock remaining (466 / 37), which covers the game until the end (Period 50). The 'In-transit' quantity of 339 units consists of the original failed/lost shipments from the supply chain collapse (calculated as approx. 339 units ordered across late-teen periods). Because on-hand inventory is far above any reasonable base stock level, the OR backend will naturally correctly place zero orders as long as the base stock calculation (determined by mu_hat and sigma_hat) remains below the pipeline inventory + on-hand. I will continue to use recent_N for demand to track the current low-demand regime, as no new orders are desired until significant depletion occurs.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a significant inventory surplus state with 465 units on-hand. Given the current demand regime which has averaged ~35 units per period over the last 20 periods (P25-P44), the existing on-hand stock is sufficient to cover approximately 13 periods of demand. This comfortably exceeds the remaining 5 periods of the game (ending at Period 50). The OR backend's supply logic will naturally result in zero orders when on-hand + pipeline inventory exceeds the calculated base stock. To ensure no unnecessary costs are incurred and profit is maximized via existing stock, I am maintaining default parameters. Although there is a 'ghost' pipeline of 339 units from Period 25 and prior, the on-hand inventory alone is more than enough to meet all remaining demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a state of extreme inventory surplus (on-hand: 402) relative to current demand levels. Since Period 24, demand has transitioned to a lower regime with an average of approximately 36 units per period. At this consumption rate, the existing 402 units on-hand will cover demand for the next 11 periods, extending beyond the end of the simulation (Period 50). The 'In-transit' quantity of 339 units consists of older, likely lost/stalled orders which do not impact the current availability but are ignored because the on-hand inventory alone is sufficient. No further orders are required to maximize profit and minimize holding costs. Parameters are set to reflect the most recent demand regime (last 21 samples) to inform the base-stock calculation, though the high 'on-hand' will naturally result in zero orders from the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-316.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-inventory state (359 units on-hand) following a massive over-procurement to resolve a previous supply chain blackout. Demand has settled into a lower regime since Period 24, averaging approximately 36 units per period. With current on-hand inventory at 359 units, we have enough stock to satisfy demand for roughly 10 periods. Since the game ends at Period 50 (only 4 periods remaining), and the objective is to maximize profit minus holding costs, we should strictly avoid placing any new orders. The 'In-transit' quantity of 339 units represents the historical 'ghost' pipeline from the supply chain failure period (P15-P25) which is likely lost. Even if it were not lost, our on-hand stock is more than sufficient. I will use 'default' or 'recent_N' parameters to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation stays well below our current inventory+pipeline levels, preventing further orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-309.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 48 of 50. Analysis of the current state reveals a significant inventory surplus of 334 units on-hand. Since Period 24, the demand regime has stabilized at a lower average of approximately 38 units per period (the average from P24 to P47 is ~37.3 units). With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50), the current on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to meet the total expected demand (approx. 112 units) without incurring stockout risks. In fact, a major challenge is the high holding cost ($1.0/unit/period) relative to profit ($1.0/unit), making it optimal to avoid any further orders. The 'in-transit' inventory of 339 units, much of which was flagged as 'ghost' inventory or lost during the supply chain blackout (P18-P27), is irrelevant as the current on-hand stock already exceeds the total remaining demand. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure a zero order quantity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-268.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 49, which is the penultimate period of the game (Period 50 is the final). The primary objective is to maximize reward, which is Profit * Units_Sold - Holding_Cost * Ending_Inventory. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 301 units. Given that the demand regime since Period 24 has been consistently low (averaging approximately 36 units per period, with recent samples at 43, 25, and 33), the existing 301 units are more than sufficient to cover the demand for the remaining two periods (Periods 49 and 50). In fact, the project ending inventory will likely be around 230 units, incurring a significant holding cost. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, any order placed now (Period 49) would arrive in Period 51, which is outside the game horizon and would only contribute to pipeline inventory without the possibility of being sold, while potentially incurring costs or simply being irrelevant. Because on-hand inventory (301) + in-transit (339) already far exceeds any possible demand for the final two periods, I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are placed. I am using 'recent_N' with N=20 for demand mean and standard deviation to reflect the low-demand regime established in the latter half of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-203.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 50. Historical data shows a clear inventory surplus (252 units on-hand) following a supply chain recovery phase around Period 28. Current demand has stabilized in a lower regime, averaging approximately 34 units per period over the last 15 periods (P35-P49). With on-hand inventory at 252 units and a pipeline of 339 units (even if some of the pipeline remains suspect from 'ghost' orders), the total inventory position is far in excess of immediate needs (it covers ~7-17 periods depending on how much of the pipeline is functional). Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime and standard lead time, allowing the OR backend's capped policy to result in a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~34 units/period (P35-P49). Inventory surplus continues to deplete but remains sufficient for multiple future periods without replenishment.
