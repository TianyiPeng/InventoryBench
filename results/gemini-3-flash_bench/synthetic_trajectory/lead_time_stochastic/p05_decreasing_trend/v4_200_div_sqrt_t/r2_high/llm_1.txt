Historical data provided shows demand for the first 5 periods: 204, 155, 134, 72, and 108 units. The average demand across these samples is approximately 135 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be available for sale in Period 4 (after the Period 3 conclude message is read in Period 4). Therefore, I must account for demand in Periods 1, 2, and 3 to ensure availability when the next order arrives. Total exposure time = L+1 = 3 periods. Estimated demand for 3 periods (using the average) is 135 * 3 = 405. Since I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will place an order for 400 units to establish an inventory pipeline while remaining slightly under the initial peak demand seen in Period 1 (204) to avoid excessive holding costs if demand stabilizes lower.",

Lead times have fluctuated between 1-3 periods, but recent orders (P37) are showing signs of significant delay or loss. Given that we are at P43 of 50, and the functional pipeline (175 units) should cover roughly 6-7 periods of demand at the current average rate (~27 units), but zero units arrived in P41 or P42, I need to protect against a stockout while avoiding excessive holding costs as the game ends.

Additionally, the orders from P37 (75), P41 (50), P42 (50), and P43 (50) represent the remaining 225 units of 'functional' in-transit inventory. The P37 order is now at L=6 and is highly suspicious but not yet confirmed lost. Recent successful deliveries show lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods. With 0 on-hand inventory and the last three orders (P41, P42, P43) expected to arrive within the next 1-3 periods, there is a high risk of stockouts in P44. I will place a moderate order of 50 units.
