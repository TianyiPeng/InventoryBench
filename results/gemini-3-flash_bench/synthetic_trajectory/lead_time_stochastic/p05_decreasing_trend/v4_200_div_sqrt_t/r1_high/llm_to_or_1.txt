Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility (samples: 204, 155, 134, 72, 108). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since there are no previous orders or arrivals, I will use the 'default' method for L (promised lead time = 2). For demand forecasting, the mean of the 5 historical samples is 134.6. I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat initially to capture the full variance of the provided history. This ensures the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 = 3 periods) is grounded in the available data. As the simulation progresses and more samples are observed, I will look for regime shifts or confirmed seasonal patterns to refine these parameters.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 217 units, but since lead time is 2, they won't arrive until the Arrival Resolution of Period 3 (visible in Period 4). In Period 1, demand was 207, which resulted in 207 lost sales because starting on-hand was 0. The current in-transit is 217. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 204, 155, 134, 72, 108. The mean of these 5 samples is 134.6. Given the promised lead time L=2, the base stock should cover 1+L=3 periods of demand. Using the mean (134.6 * 3 = 403.8), and considering the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), the system will target a high service level. Since we only have 5 historical samples and just starting, I will use recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture the initial variance effectively. No lead time data is yet available to contradict the default.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Evaluation of the history shows that orders placed in Period 1 (217 units) and Period 2 (219 units) have not yet arrived. This is consistent with the promised lead time of 2 periods, as the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution phase (and will be visible at the start of Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and total in-transit is 436. Historical demand for the first 5 samples shows a clear downward trend (204, 155, 134, 72, 108). Averaging these samples gives a mean of 134.6. Given the trend, using all samples (N=5) for the mean and volatility is appropriate to capture the initial variance while reflecting the cooling demand. I will use L=default (2) and recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations based on the observed data stream.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (217 units) were expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests a potential lead time delay or lost shipment. Under the lead time definition (P1 order arrives P3, observed P4), we should have seen the P1 order by now. Since on-hand is 0 and we have missed demand for 3 periods, we need to ensure the pipeline is sufficient. Looking at demand, it has been declining/volatile: P1: 204 (historical data provided in prompt differed slightly from game history conclude, I will prioritize game history: P1: 207, P2: 126, P3: 88). There's a clear downward trend. I will use a recent_N approach for demand to adjust to this lower trend (N=3), and use the promised lead time (L=2) while monitoring for the missing P1 shipment. If P1 doesn't arrive in the next conclude message, I will assume a longer lead time or loss.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two orders arrived: the Period 1 order (217 units) arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, and the Period 3 order (94 units) arrived with a lead time of 1 period. The Period 2 order (219 units) is still in transit and is currently overdue based on the promised lead time of 2. On-hand inventory is 227 units. Demand has been declining significantly from Period 1 (207) to Period 4 (84). To prevent overstocking while managing lead-time uncertainty, I will use a recent window for demand estimation (N=3) to focus on the lower recent demand (avg ~87), while setting the lead time to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed variance (1 and 3 periods).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we have 131 units on-hand and 284 in-transit. Comparing historical data, we've seen significant lead time variability: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods (Period 4), while Period 3's order arrived in 1 period (Period 4). Period 2's order (219 units) is still in-transit and is now 4 periods old, which is a cause for concern regarding potential loss or extreme delay. Demand has stabilized significantly after a high Period 1 (207 units). Since Period 2, demand has ranged between 84 and 126, with the last two periods at 84 and 96. Total demand for the last 4 periods averages 98.5. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this lower, stable regime. For lead time, since the promised L=2 has been exceeded by the Period 2 order and fluctuated widely (1 to 3), I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend start incorporating the observed variance. I will use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the recent lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant lead time variability observed: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P2 is currently overdue (4 periods). Demand regime shifted down from ~200 at P1 to ~100 from P2-P5.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 50. In-transit inventory is 326, composed of orders from P2 (219 units), P4 (65 units), and P6 (42 units). The P2 order is significantly overdue (5 periods since ordering, vs promised 2). Historical demand analysis: Period 1 had high demand (207, though history says 204), but Periods 2-6 show a stable lower regime averaging 95 units/period (126, 88, 84, 96, 81). I will set mu_hat based on this lower regime (N=5). Regarding lead time: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1, and P2 is still missing. This suggests high LT variance. I will use L=3 (explicit) to account for the delays and ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon, helping to buffer against the unstable supply chain while the backend OR logic balances the high profit margin ($19) against the low holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: P2 order (219 units) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting potential loss or extreme congestion; demand stabilized at ~95 units/period over the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1165.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, we have an on-hand inventory of 51 units. The demand has stabilized into a lower regime: P1 saw 207 units, but P2-P7 averaged approximately 89.8 units (std dev ~21). The P2 order (219 units) is now 6 periods overdue, reinforcing the 'lost shipment' hypothesis or extreme congestion. However, the P1, P3, and P4 orders eventually arrived with lead times of 3, 1, and 3 periods respectively, making the average observed lead time 2.33 periods. I will use L=3 for the explicit lead time to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and the high probability that the P2 shipment is gone. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=6 to capture the stable demand regime starting from P2 (~90 units/period). Sigma_hat will also be based on recent_N=6 to reflect the reduced volatility in this new regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock enough to cover roughly 4 periods of demand (L+1) without over-ordering for the lost P2 units.

Carry-over insight: P2 shipment (219 units) confirmed as extremely delayed/lost (6 periods overdue). Demand stabilized at ~90 units/period since Period 2. Observed lead times are predominantly 3 periods (P1, P4).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has stabilized significantly since Period 2. The average demand from Period 2 to Period 8 is 87.8 units, compared to the initial 207 in Period 1. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture this lower, stable regime. Regarding lead times, the history shows high volatility: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P7=1. The average observed lead time is 2 periods, which matches the promised lead time, but the inconsistency suggests a higher safety stock is needed. Order P2 (219 units) is now 7 periods overdue and almost certainly lost; it has been excluded from pipeline considerations by the OR engine effectively if it hasn't arrived, but I must ensure mu_hat reflects the current stabilized demand. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the Period 1 outlier while capturing the current variance.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (219 units) confirmed lost (7 periods overdue). Demand stabilized at mean ~88 (P2-P8). Lead time remains volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1089.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, current on-hand inventory is 32 units, with 261 units in-transit. Historic arrivals show high lead time variability: P1 (3), P3 (1), P4 (3), P7 (1), P8 (1). The average lead time from concluded orders is 1.8 periods, effectively aligning with the promised 2. However, the P2 order (219 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is definitely lost. The current in-transit (261) includes P6 (42 units, 4 periods elapsed), and potentially recent orders from P9 (though none were placed) or P10. Wait, the history shows P6 ordered 42, P7 ordered 64 (arrived), P8 ordered 52 (arrived). So 261 in-transit = 219 (P2, lost) + 42 (P6, likely lost/delayed). Excluding the 219 units lost in P2, the effective pipeline is only 42 units. Demand has shifted from ~200 in P1 to a stable regime averaging 85.5 units/period over P2-P9 (N=8). I will set L to 2, mu_hat to (1+2)*85.5 = 256.5, and use recent_N (N=8) for sigma to reflect the current stability. By counting only 42 units as valid pipeline, I ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the gaps left by the lost P2 and P6 shipments.

Carry-over insight: P2 (219 units) and P6 (42 units) shipments are confirmed lost or extremely delayed (8 and 4 periods overdue respectively). Valid pipeline inventory should exclude these units for accurate replenishment.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 10. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is reported as 280 units, but this includes Period 2 (219 units) and Period 6 (42 units) orders, which are 9 and 5 periods overdue respectively and are highly likely lost based on historical patterns. The actual reliable pipeline is essentially 19 units (ordered Period 10). Demand has stabilized at a lower level since Period 2; the mean for Periods 2-10 is approximately 81.5. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods where L=2 (promised), plus an extra buffer to account for the reliability issues. Using N=9 for recent_N captures the stable post-spike demand regime. Given the stockout and unreliable 'in-transit' data, an explicit L of 2 is used to ensure the OR engine targets current demand levels without assuming the lost units will ever arrive.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reliability check: P2 (219 units) is 9 periods overdue and P6 (42 units) is 5 periods overdue; these 261 units should be considered lost in order-up-to calculations.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a Stock-Out state (On-hand: 0) and has failed to satisfy demand for the last two periods (P10, P11). In-transit inventory is reported as 305 units, but history shows substantial order losses: P2 (219 units, 10 periods overdue) and P6 (42 units, 6 periods overdue) are almost certainly lost. This means 261 units out of the 305 in-transit are 'phantom' stock. The effective pipeline inventory is only 44 units (P10: 19 units, P11: 25 units). I must set mu_hat to a high explicit value to bypass the capped policy calculation which incorrectly identifies the 261 lost units as available. This will force a replenishment order to cover the current demand regime of ~65-75 units per period. I am setting L to 2 (promised) as recent actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. mu_hat is set to 225 (roughly 75 units * 3 periods) to ensure the target base stock is high enough to trigger an order despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory accuracy warning: Orders from P2 (219 units) and P6 (42 units) totaling 261 units are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Effective pipeline is only 44 units as of Period 12.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 286 units in-transit. However, historical evidence confirms that orders from Period 2 (219 units) and Period 6 (42 units) are lost/indefinitely delayed (11 and 7 periods overdue respectively). The effective pipeline inventory is therefore only 25 units (from Period 11). Since the OR backend includes all in-transit units in its calculation (286 units), and the order-up-to level (base stock) is compared against this inflated pipeline, the backend would erroneously skip ordering. To force a replenishment that covers the 261 missing units and 3 periods of lead-time demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Demand has stabilized at ~65 units/period over the last 6 periods (P7-P12). Assuming a 2-period lead time (L=2) plus the review period (1), total demand to cover is ~195 units. To offset the 261 units of 'phantom' inventory the backend thinks we have, I am setting mu_hat to 195 + 261 = 456. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger an actual order.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory correction: 261 units (P2: 219, P6: 42) are confirmed lost. Effective pipeline at P13 is 25 units, not 286.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the system shows an In-transit inventory of 459 units. However, based on the historical concluding messages and carry-over insights, 261 units (from orders P2 and P6) are confirmed lost/overdue by more than 7 periods. Additionally, the recent orders of 25 units (P11) and 173 units (P13) are still in transit, but P11 is now 3 periods old and should have arrived if the lead time was the average 2-3. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced stockouts. Demand since Period 7 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 61 units. To recover from the stockout and the pipeline gap (where 261 units are 'ghost' units), I must set mu_hat explicitly high enough to trigger the OR backend to place a significant order, effectively ignoring the lost units in its internally calculated 'pipeline_inventory'. I will set mu_hat based on the (L+1) horizon (3 periods) using a more robust recent demand mean (~80 units) to ensure the target inventory level clears the 261-unit deficit.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: P11 (25 units) is now 3 periods overdue, following the pattern of high lead-time volatility or potential loss. True effective pipeline is 173 units (P13) as of P14 start.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. The current in-transit (pipeline) is 517 units, but this includes significantly delayed/lost orders. Specifically, P2 (219 units) is 13 periods overdue and P6 (42 units) is 9 periods overdue. These 261 units are confirmed lost based on historical performance and the promised lead time of 2. Removing these, the effective pipeline is 256 units (P13: 173, P14: 83). Observed lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.2). Demand has stabilized since Period 2, with the last 13 samples averaging 74 units/period (down from Period 1's ~200). To ensure the OR engine replenishes correctly despite the lost stock, I am using 'explicit' L to account for the slightly longer observed lead time and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the stabilized regime (N=13 from Period 2 to Period 14). mu_hat and sigma_hat settings will allow the engine to target a stock level sufficient for the 3-period horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Correction: Effective pipeline is 256 units (total 517 - 261 lost from P2 and P6). Demand regime (P2-P14) mean ~74 units/period. Lead time volatility persists between 1-3 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system faces a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' count of 517 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments from Period 2 (219 units) and Period 6 (42 units), totaling 261 units that must be excluded. The 'true' pipeline consists of orders from P13 (173 units) and P14 (83 units), totaling 256 units. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P7: 1, P8: 1, P10: 2, P11: 3) show high volatility with an average of 2. Since the on-hand is zero and we have significant demand pending, I will use an explicit lead time of 2. For demand forecasting, the period P2-P15 exhibits a stable regime significantly lower than P1. The mean demand for P2-P15 is approx 74.4 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 14 samples to capture this regime accurately, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1327.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we have 98 units on hand. The 'In-transit' balance is 344 units, but based on carry-over insights, 261 units from early periods (P2: 219, P6: 42) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 83 units (the P14 order). Demand has shifted to a lower regime; since P12, demand has averaged approximately 60.6 units (range 38-82). Lead times remain highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.2 for received orders). To protect against this volatility and the corrected pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering P12-P16 demand) to capture the current lower demand trend, and setting an explicit lead time L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals. sigma_hat is set to default to allow for standard volatility calculations across the dataset.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline correction: Of the 344 units in-transit, 261 units (P2: 219, P6: 42) are lost. Only 83 units (P14) are effectively in-transit. Demand regime (P12-P16) mean is ~61 units/period.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 125 units with an apparent pipeline of 261 units. However, consistent history (since Period 7) identifies that these 261 units (P2: 219, P6: 42) are lost or indefinitely delayed. Consequently, the effective pipeline is 0. Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level; the mean of the most recent 6 periods (P12-P17) is approximately 61.5 units. Current on-hand (125) covers about two periods of demand. Given the observed lead time volatility (ranging 1-3 periods, average currently trending toward 3 for recent arrivals P11, P13, P14), setting L to 2 (promised) is insufficient for safety. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the current lower demand regime and its volatility, while maintaining L as default to allow the OR engine to use its internal logic, noting that the 'effective' pipeline is now zero, which will trigger an order to replenish based on the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: mean demand (P12-P17) is 61.5 units/period. Lead time for the last three successful arrivals (P11, P13, P14) was 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $795.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19, the demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 61.5 units (based on the Period 12-18 regime). The lead time remains volatile, but recent successful arrivals (P11, P13, P14) have consistently shown a lead time of 3 periods, which is longer than the promised 2. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 261 units consists entirely of orders from P2 (219 units) and P6 (42 units) which are now 17 and 13 periods overdue respectively and must be treated as lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. With 79 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 0, a replenishment order is necessary. To cover demand across the current period and the expected 3-period lead time (L+1=4), I am setting L to 3 (explicitly reflecting the current bottleneck) and mu_hat to 246 (approx 61.5 * 4). Sigma_hat is set to 40 (explicit) to account for demand variance and ensure a high service level given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 19, effective pipeline is 0 units (observed 261 units are lost P2/P6). Demand regime (P12-P18) mean is ~61.5 units/period. Recent observed lead time is stabilized at 3 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, the effective pipeline is 0 units, as the 261 units currently in-transit (P2: 219, P6: 42) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed (18 and 14 periods overdue, respectively). The demand regime has stabilized following a downward trend; the mean demand from Period 12 to Period 19 is approx 53 units/period, but focusing on the most recent 5 periods (P15-P19) shows a slight deceleration to 53.6 units/period. The actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last three successful arrivals (P11, P13, P14). To ensure adequate stock despite the 3-period lead time, I am setting L to 3. I will use the last 8 periods (since the demand drop in P12) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which provides a balance between responsiveness and stability in the current regime (average ~53 units/period). This setting will command the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level considering a 4-period horizon (L+1) and the verified effective pipeline.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 20, demand regime (P12-P19) mean is ~53 units/period. Effective pipeline remains 0 (261 units from P2/P6 are confirmed lost).

Daily Reward (R_t): $510.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 12-20) shows a stabilized downward trend with mean demand now at approximately 52.5 units/period (average of last 9 periods). Recent observed lead times have settled at 3 periods (P11, P13, P14). The current 'In-transit' count of 261 units is composed entirely of orders from P2 (219) and P6 (42), which are 19 and 15 periods overdue respectively and are confirmed lost. To ensure the OR engine triggers a necessary replenishment, I am using the 'explicit' method for L to account for the real lead time (3 periods) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the current low-demand regime (~52.5 units). I am also using 'explicit' for sigma_hat to reflect the lower volatility of this recent period. Because the backend subtracts pipeline inventory, and the pipeline inventory it sees is 261 units (all lost), I am setting mu_hat and L such that the base stock (approx 210 units) is lower than the phantom pipeline. However, since the system is currently at inventory 22 and the backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and the backend's internal pipeline (261) exceeds the target, no order will be placed unless I adjust. To force the OR engine to recognize we need stock, I set L=1 and mu_hat to a value that reflects the demand need plus the 'lost' units to offset the backend's subtraction error, ensuring we maintain service level for the true demand of ~53.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P12-P20) mean is ~52.5 units/period. Lead time reflects 3 periods for successful recent arrivals. Effective pipeline is 0 units as all 261 in-transit units are lost.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the system reports 409 units in-transit. Based on 'Carry-over Insights' and shipment history, we must perform a reconciliation: 219 (from P2) and 42 (from P6) are confirmed lost/extremely delayed (20+ and 16 periods overdue respectively), totaling 261 invalid units. The order of 148 units placed in P21 is the only valid pipeline component (409 - 261 = 148). The demand regime has lowered; from P12 onwards, demand has averaged approx 52 units/period. The most recent successful lead times (P11-P14 arrivals) consistently showed 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. Using L=3, the OR backend logic will target a base stock covering (L+1)=4 periods. Setting mu_hat to 208 (52 * 4) and using default sigma_hat with N=10 to capture recent volatility. This ensures the order-up-to level accounts for the lost P2/P6 units while adjusting for the lower demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation at P22: Total in-transit 409 units contains 261 lost units (P2: 219, P6: 42). Effective pipeline is currently 148 units (P21). Recommended L=3 based on consistent history (P11, P13, P14).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported pipeline is 409 units, but historical evidence strongly indicates that 261 of these units (P2: 219 and P6: 42) are lost/indefinitely delayed. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 148 units (ordered in Period 21). Based on recent successful arrivals (P11, P13, P14), the actual lead time L=3. To compensate for the dead inventory (261 lost units) and a lead time of 3, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The demand regime has shifted downwards significantly; from Period 12 to 22, the average demand is ~48 units/period. To cover current and future demand (L+1 = 4 periods) while accounting for the phantom pipeline (261 units), I set mu_hat to 453 units. Calculation: (Target Stock for 4 periods \u2248 4 * 48 = 192) + (Missing units that the OR backend incorrectly thinks are coming = 261) = 453. I use L = 3 and sigma_hat based on the last 11 samples (since P12) to reflect the current lower volatility environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 12-22 mean demand is 48.4 units/period. Lead time parity at 3 periods for the last three historical arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $772.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24, on-hand inventory is 102 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 367 units includes 261 units from Period 2 and Period 6 that are confirmed lost (7+ periods overdue). Subtracting these lost units, the effective pipeline is 106 units (ordered in Period 23). The actual lead time has stabilized near 3 periods, although the most recent arrival (P21) took 2 periods. To be safe, I will set L=3 as the primary planning horizon (L+1 = 4 periods of coverage). Demand remains in a lower regime; the mean demand from Period 12 to Period 23 is 48.2 units/period. Therefore, mu_hat is calculated as (L+1) * mean_demand = 4 * 48.2 \u2248 193. The sigma_hat is adjusted based on recent volatility in this regime. These settings ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock levels that account for 4 periods of demand, effectively ignoring the zombie units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: P21 order arrived in 2 periods, suggesting a possible return toward the 2-period promised lead time, but planning remains at L=3 for safety. Demand mean (P12-P23) is 48.2 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $958.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the context shows a stable demand regime following a significant drop around Period 12. From Period 12 to 24, the average demand is approximately 48.6 units/period (total 632 units over 13 periods). The most recent demand (Period 24) was 53. Regarding logistics, the 'In-transit' figure of 367 units is highly misleading because it includes 261 units from Period 2 (219) and Period 6 (42) that are confirmed lost. Thus, the effective pipeline consists only of the 106 units ordered in Period 23. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with the most recent arrival (P21) taking 2 periods. However, to maintain safety against the frequent 3-period lead times observed previously, I am setting L to 3. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 to capture the current demand regime (since P12). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=13 to reflect the current reduced volatility. These settings will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers approximately 4 periods (L+1) of demand while accounting for the correct pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable since Period 12 with a mean of ~48.6 units/period. Lead time for the most recent order (P21) was 2 periods, but 3 periods remains a frequent occurrence in history.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 12, with a mean demand of approximately 48.6 units per period. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (P12-P25) to capture this lower volume accurately. Regarding current inventory: On-hand is 123. The 'In-transit' figure of 261 consists entirely of lost orders (P2: 219 and P6: 42), which are now over 20 periods overdue. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. While the two most recent arrivals (P21 and P23) had a lead time of 2 periods, historical volatility between 1-3 periods suggests that setting L=3 as a planning horizon is safer to ensure sufficient base stock for potential delays, as reflected in the Carry-over Insights.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead times (P21, P23) have normalized to 2 periods, but volatility remains a risk; planning continues with L=3. Effective pipeline remains 0 as all 261 units in-transit (P2, P6) are confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $697.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the current regime (Period 12 to 26), with a mean demand of approximately 48.6 units per period. The recent period (P26) demand was 41 units. Regarding lead times, the most recent arrivals (P21, P23) have consistently arrived in 2 periods, suggesting a stabilization at the promised lead time. However, I will use L=3 to maintain a safety buffer given the historical volatility (lead times of 3 were common in previous cycles). On-hand inventory is 82 units. The in-transit inventory of 261 units consists entirely of lost orders from Period 2 (219 units) and Period 6 (42 units). Therefore, for the OR engine's calculation, the effective pipeline is 0. By setting L to 'explicit' value 3, mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=15 (covering the stable regime back to P12), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=15, the OR backend will calculate a base stock target based on the recent lower demand levels (~48.6 units/period). This target minus the effective pipeline inventory (0) will trigger a replenishment order if the current on-hand levels are insufficient to cover demand for (L+1) periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a stable, lower regime since approximately Period 12, with a mean demand of 48 units per period over the last 15 samples (P12-P27). Recent demand observations are consistent with this (P26: 41, P27: 41). The lead time has shown variability ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with the most recent two arrivals (P21 and P23) arriving in exactly 2 periods. However, a significant portion of the historical 'In-transit' inventory (261 units from P2 and P6) is confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Currently, there are 41 units on-hand and 0 units in effective pipeline (the 261 units in-transit are the lost ones). To maintain a high service level while accounting for the historical risk of 3-period lead times, I will set L=3. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the stabilized lower demand regime accurately while filtering out the high-demand volatility seen in the first 11 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stabilized (P12-P27 average: 48 units). Effective pipeline is 0; the 261 'in-transit' units are lost (P2, P6).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 12, with a mean demand of approximately 48 units per period (sample mean P12-P28: ~47.8). Recent demand continues to hover in the 30-50 range. On-hand inventory is currently low at 7 units. The 'In-transit' count of 261 units consists entirely of lost orders from Period 2 (219 units) and Period 6 (42 units), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. Although recent successful deliveries (P21, P23) arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, history shows frequent occurrences of 3 periods (P11, P13, P14). To ensure adequate service levels and avoid stockouts given the currently low on-hand stock and the time since the last order, I am setting L=3 for safety. mu_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=17) to capture the stabilized mean of ~48 units/period since Period 12, resulting in a base stock targeted at (1+L)*48. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=17) to capture the observed volatility of this stable period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a significantly lower level since Period 12, with a mean of approximately 48 units per period (P12-P29). Recent lead times for fulfilled orders (P21, P23) have balanced at 2 periods, but historical volatility (3 periods) and the confirmed loss of 261 units (P2, P6) suggest that planning for a lead time of 3 is safer to ensure service levels. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the effective pipeline is also 0 because the 261 units in-transit are confirmed lost from P2 and P6. I will set L=3 and use a 17-period window (P12-P29) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect the current stable demand regime while ignoring the early high-demand noise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P29 mean is ~47.6 units/period. The 261 units in-transit (P2, P6) are confirmed lost and must be ignored for pipeline calculations.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31, the environment remains in a stable demand regime and face a critical inventory shortage. The demand mean from Period 12 to 30 is approximately 47.9 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the demand in Period 30 was 42 units with 0 units sold (stockout). The 261 units listed as 'In-transit' are the confirmed lost orders from Period 2 (219 units) and Period 6 (42 units); thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Lead times have recently shown stability between 2 and 3 periods. To ensure replenishment triggers immediately and aggressively to cover the stockout and lead-time risk, I am setting L=3 (the conservative estimate). I'll use mu_hat based on the stable regime since Period 12 (N=19) to set a base stock that accounts for the current zero-inventory state. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to capture recent volatility.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 12, with a mean demand of approximately 47.7 units per period. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), and the in-transit balance of 261 units consists entirely of lost shipments from Period 2 (219 units) and Period 6 (42 units). Consequently, the actual effective pipeline is 0. To protect against the demonstrated lead time volatility (which has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods), I am setting L=3 to ensure the order-up-to level covers four periods of demand (L+1). mu_hat is set to roughly 191 ((3+1) * 47.7) using the recent_N method with N=20 to capture the stable post-Period 12 regime. sigma_hat is set based on the same period to account for the consistent variance in this regime. This strategy aims to trigger a replenishment order to restore stock levels after a long period of selling down existing inventory.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to maximize reward. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the 261 units showing as 'in-transit' have been historically confirmed as lost (Orders from P2 and P6). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 12. Calculating mean demand from Period 12 to 32 yields ~45 units/period. The current stockout (starting Period 29) needs to be addressed immediately. Although promised lead time is 2, historical analysis (P4, P7, P14, P16, P17) shows lead times frequently hit 3 periods, suggesting L=3 is a safer planning horizon. Since 0 units are effectively in-transit and on-hand is 0, the backend OR logic will generate an order based on the base_stock calculated from these parameters to recover t\u1eeb the stockout.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows a stabilized demand regime from Period 12 to the present, with a mean demand of approximately 44 units per period (P12-P33 average is 43.8). We are currently at on-hand inventory of 0. The 'in-transit' figure of 261 units consists entirely of orders from Period 2 (219 units) and Period 6 (42 units), which are now over 25 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 0. Recent successful arrivals (P21, P23) showed lead times of 2 periods, but historical volatility (3 periods) necessitates a slightly conservative planning horizon. To resume replenishment and satisfy the stabilized demand, I am using L=2 (promised), mu_hat based on the recent 20-period demand mean to capture the lower volume accurately, and sigma_hat from the same period to account for current volatility. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=20 ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus one period of demand (3 periods total), effectively clearing the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Effective demand regime (P12-P33) has shifted lower to ~44 units/period from the previous ~50. Pipeline inventory remains zero; the 261 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments from the first 10 periods of the game.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 30, demand has averaged approximately 30 units per period (30, 32, 18, 40, 26), which is lower than the previous ~48 units/period average seen from P12-P29. The current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is effectively 0 because the 261 units 'in-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (219 units) and Period 6 (42 units). Although recent successful lead times (P21, P23) were 2 periods, historical volatility and early-game delays make 3 periods a safer planning horizon (L=3). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the most recent demand drop (avg ~30) to avoid over-ordering, while maintaining sufficient safety stock via sigma_hat to handle the inherent variance and avoid further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime identified starting Period 30: Mean demand has dropped to ~30 units/period (previously ~48 units/period).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a new, lower regime starting around Period 30. The average demand from Period 30 to Period 35 is approximately 32 units/period, compared to the previous regime of ~48. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is effectively 0 because the 261 units 'in-transit' are from historical shipments (Period 2 and Period 6) confirmed lost. To prevent further lost sales, replenishment is critical. I will set L=3 to account for historical volatility even though some recent orders arrived in 2 periods. Mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~32) for the 4-period window (L+1). Sigma_hat is also calculated over this recent window to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand over the lead time plus current period while recognizing the loss of earlier shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 30-35 has stabilized at a lower mean of ~32 units/period. The 261 units in-transit (P2, P6) remain confirmed lost and should be disregarded for pipeline math.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has settled into a new lower regime starting around Period 30, with a mean of approximately 33 units over the last 7 periods (P30-P36). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the 261 units listed in-transit are confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 and Period 6, meaning the effective pipeline is 0. To restart replenishment and cover the 0 on-hand situation, I am setting L=3 based on the historical upper-bound of lead time arrivals (P13, P14 both took 3 periods) to ensure safety, even though some recent orders took 2. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current low-demand regime (~33 units/period), and sigma_hat is also calculated from this same stable period to reflect current volatility. This will trigger the OR backend to place an order that restores the base stock necessary to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) and has been for several periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 261 units consists entirely of lost orders from Period 2 (219 units) and Period 6 (42 units), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 30, with mean demand dropping to approximately 32 units. However, recent demand (P37) spiked to 62, suggesting a potential upward trend or volatility. To calculate mu_hat, I'm using N=8 (covering P30-P37) to capture the recent lower-demand regime while including the latest spike. For lead time (L), although the promised time is 2, historical arrivals varied between 1-3 periods; I'll use explicit L=3 to ensure the order-up-to level covers a sufficient buffer against stockouts during potential 3-period lead times. Sigma_hat is calculated using the recent 8-period window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 30-37 averaged ~36 units/period, despite an outlier of 62 in P37. The 261 'in-transit' units remain confirmed lost and are excluded from replenishment logic.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-volume state starting around Period 30. The mean demand from Period 30 to 38 is approximately 34.3 units (calculated from 42, 32, 18, 40, 26, 34, 44, 62, 11). Although there was a brief spike to 62 in Period 37, the subsequent drop to 11 in Period 38 confirms the high volatility within this lower-mean regime. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the in-transit inventory of 261 units is confirmed to be lost shipments from Periods 2 and 6. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this lower demand regime (P30-P38). For lead time, I will stick with a planning lead time (L) of 3, as history shows frequent extensions to 3 periods, providing a safety buffer despite the promised 2 periods. Setting L=3 with this reduced demand mean will trigger a replenishment order to satisfy current and near-future demand while accounting for the zero effective pipeline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted and stabilized at a lower mean from Period 30 onwards. The average demand from P30 to P39 is approximately 32.2 units per period (42, 32, 18, 40, 26, 34, 44, 62, 11, 11). Although there are outliers like P37 (62) and P38-39 (11), the overall trend suggests a mean near 32. For the lead time L, while the promised L is 2, historical data shows frequent 3-period arrivals. We maintain L=3 for safety to avoid stockouts given the zero on-hand inventory. The 261 units in-transit (P2: 219, P6: 42) are confirmed lost/extremely delayed (P2 is 38 periods overdue) and must not be counted in the pipeline. We use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime (32 * (1+3) = 128) and ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment order reflecting the current stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 30-39 has stabilized at a lower mean of ~32 units/period. The 261 'in-transit' units (P2, P6) remain confirmed lost and are excluded from effective inventory calculations.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a much lower regime. Since Period 30, demand has averaged approximately 32.8 units per period (P30-P40), significantly lower than the previous ~48 units/period. The outlier in P37 (demand=62) followed by very low demand (P38=11, P39=11) suggests some volatility, but the overall mean has clearly shifted. Regarding inventory, the 261 units showing as 'in-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from the early periods of the game (P2 and P6) and must be excluded from effective pipeline calculations. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the effective pipeline is 0. I will set the lead time L to 'explicit' with a value of 3 to account for the frequent historical delays observe (3 periods), providing a safety buffer. For demand (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the stabilized lower regime observed from Period 30 to 40. This will allow the OR backend to target a base stock reflecting the current lower consumption rate while maintaining a service level appropriate for high-profit/low-holding cost items.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new, lower regime starting around Period 30. For the last 12 periods (P30-P41), the mean demand is approximately 29.2 units per period (350 total / 12), including some volatility (range 11 to 62). However, looking at the most recent 10 periods (P32-P41) provides a more accurate reflection of the current trend, with a mean of ~28 units. Effectively, the on-hand inventory is 0 and the 261 units listed as 'in-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 and Period 6 (as noted in historical carry-over insights). I will set L=3 to account for historical lead-time volatility and the 3-period arrivals seen earlier in the game, providing a safety buffer. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=12 to capture this lower demand regime. For sigma_hat, N=12 will likewise reflect the current volatility of this regime.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime (P30-P41) mean is ~29.2 units/period. The 261 units 'in-transit' remain verified losses (P2, P6) and must not be counted towards pipeline inventory.

The 261 units reported as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments (P2 and P6) and must be disregarded for current replenishment math, meaning the effective pipeline is 0. Recent successful lead times have fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods; I will set L=2 for the backend while manually providing a mu_hat based on L=3 (4 periods total of demand coverage) to ensure safety stock covers the potential 3-period lead time. Using N=13 for mu_hat (P30-P42) provides a stable estimate of the current regime. Sigma_hat is calculated explicitly to reflect the recent lower volatility (std \u2248 14.5, adjusted for L+1=4 periods).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 30, with a current mean of approximately 30 units/period (observations: 34, 44, 62, 11, 11, 19, 21, 24, 42). The system shows 261 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms these were orders from Period 2 (219 units) and Period 6 (42 units) that are now over 35 periods overdue and effectively lost. With 0 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 0, a replenishment order is necessary. While the promised lead time is 2, historical lead times have frequently fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods; I will use L=3 to ensure sufficient stock coverage across the replenishment cycle. The target mu_hat reflects the demand across (L+1) periods (3+1=4) at the recent average of ~30.5 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 30-43 has stabilized at a lower mean of ~30.5 units/period. The 261 units 'in-transit' (P2, P6) are confirmed losses and must be excluded from effective pipeline calculations.

Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. With only 6 periods remaining in the simulation (Period 45-50), I need to re-establish inventory to prevent further lost sales. I will set L=2 (the promised lead time), as recent successful arrivals (P21, P23) showed a return to this lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the stabilized regime from Period 30 onwards (~30.5 units/period). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=15 to reflect the current volatility. This will trigger the OR backend to place an order that covers the (L+1) period demand window while discounting the 'phantom' in-transit units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 46, and the game ends at 50. With a promised lead time of 2 (historical actual lead time often 3), any order placed now (Period 46) is likely to arrive around Period 48 or 49. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the 261 units 'in-transit' are confirmed lost (P2, P6), we must place an order to capture remaining demand. The demand regime from Period 30 onwards has stabilized at a lower mean (~31-32 units/period). Calculating for the remaining periods (46-50), and using a lead time of 3 for safety, I am setting mu_hat to cover 4 periods (L+1) at the recent average of ~31 units. Setting L to 3 and N to 16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations (capturing the Period 30-45 regime).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly decreased and remained lower for the last 17 periods (Period 30-46). The mean demand during this period is approximately 31.4 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 13 units. The 261 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are from Period 2 and Period 6 and are confirmed lost; they have not arrived in over 40 periods and must be discounted from the pipeline for the OR backend to trigger an order. The last observed successful lead times were 2 and 3 periods, so I will maintain L=3 as a conservative buffer. Since we are at Period 47 of 50, and the effective pipeline is 0 with 0 on-hand inventory, an order is necessary to capture demand for the final periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture the characteristics of this lower demand regime accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 30 to 46 has stabilized at a mean of ~31.4 units/period, significantly lower than the preceding regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime starting around Period 30. From Period 30 to 47, the mean demand is approximately 31.4 units/period with moderate volatility. Currently, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and 261 units 'in-transit'. However, historical data confirms that these 261 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are lost/indefinitely delayed and will never arrive. Because the backend OR engine counts all in-transit units toward the base-stock target, and 261 is significantly higher than any reasonable base-stock for a 31-unit demand regime, the backend will not place any orders unless I intervene. With the game ending at Period 50 and a 2-3 period lead time, I must place an order now to satisfy remaining demand. To force the backend to place an order despite the 261 phantom units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that exceeds the phantom pipeline + desired safety stock. Target base stock = (L+1)*Avg + Z*Std. Estimating L=2, Avg=31, and a safety buffer, I calculate a target around 400 to trigger a net order of ~140 units, which should cover the remaining 3 periods of the game.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 30 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 30 units per period, with Period 48 showing 28. Lead time has historically fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods, so I am maintaining L=3 as a conservative planning estimate. The current in-transit inventory of 395 units includes 261 units (from Periods 2 and 6) that are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. However, the order of 134 units placed in Period 48 is legitimate. At the start of Period 49, on-hand inventory is 0. My goal is to ensure the base stock (calculated as mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) is reached by subtracting only the 'effective' pipeline from the target. Since the OR backend uses the full 'in-transit' value (395), I must set mu_hat such that the backend's calculation (base_stock - 395) results in the correct order. The desired target for L=3 is approximately (L+1)*30 = 120 units. However, we are near the game end (Period 50). An order placed now (P49) with L=3 would arrive at the start of Period 53 (P49+3=P52 conclude), which is beyond the game's horizon. Even with L=2, it would arrive for P52. Thus, further ordering is likely suboptimal as units will not arrive in time to be sold. I will set parameters to prevent further ordering and rely on the 134 units already in transit from P48 (expected P51/P52).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 30, with a mean of approximately 30 units per period. In the current state (Period 50), on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 395 units is deceptive: it includes 261 units from Period 2 and Period 6 that were confirmed lost in early game cycles, plus the 134 units ordered in Period 48. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 134 units. Our observed lead time (L) has historically fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods; I will use L=3 to remain conservative given the stockout since Period 30. The OR backend needs to replenish based on the stable demand of approximately 30 units/period (total 120 for L+1=4 periods) while acknowledging that 261 units of reported pipeline must be bypassed. Setting \u03bc\u0302 to approximately 105 (reflecting slightly higher than the mean to account for recent variability like P45 demand) and \u03c3\u0302 based on recent volatility and the risk of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 50, the demand regime continues to stabilize at ~30 units/period. The in-transit discrepancy remains persistent: 261 units (P2, P6) are lost, making the effective pipeline substantially lower than reported. Order lead times are typically 2-3 periods.
