My P1 order (217 units) was placed during P1 decision phase and should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (making it visible in P3 conclude, readable at P4 start). This aligns with Scenario A in the instructions. Currently, on-hand is 0 because the P1 order hasn't physically arrived yet. \n2. Inventory Analysis: Total pipeline is 452 units (P1: 217 + P2: 235). This inventory is expected to arrive over the next two periods (P3 and P4). \n3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand shows P1: 207, P2: 126, P3: 134, P4: 72, P5: 108. The average demand is ~129. \n4. Strategy: The OR recommends 52 units based on its base-stock calculation. Given the total pipeline of 452 units (covering ~3.5 periods of average demand) and the current on-hand of 0, I need to ensure coverage until P5. The pipeline of 452 units is substantial. However, the OR recommendation is quite low, likely because it sees the high pipeline relative to the mean. Since the P1 shipment (217) is expected to arrive this period (P3) and cover the current demand (P3 history shows 134, though I'm acting in a simulation where P3 demand happens AFTER my decision), and the P2 shipment (235) arrives in P4, I am well-covered for the lead-time horizon.

The promised lead time is 2. This suggests variability, but the Period 2 order (235 units) has not arrived yet. Since it was ordered in Period 2 and now we are deciding for Period 6, if it doesn't arrive in Period 5, it's overdue or lost. 2. Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand is 185. In-Transit is 285 (this includes the Period 2 order of 235 and the Period 4 order of 50). 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand: 204, 155, 134, 72, 108. Mean \u2248 135. Lead time L=2 means we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods \u2248 405 units. 4. Strategy: Current total inventory (On-hand 185 + In-transit 285) = 470 units. This is technically enough to cover the expected demand of 405. However, there is a risk that the Period 2 order (235 units) is lost or significantly delayed. If we exclude the likely 'overdue' Period 2 order, our reliable inventory is 185 (on-hand) + 50 (Period 4 order) = 235 units. Against a 3-period demand of ~405, we would be short by 170 units.

Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees a massive pipeline of 385 units. However, because the bulk of that (235 units) is likely lost, I must order to protect against a stockout. Targeted inventory level (L+1) = 3 periods * ~100 units/period = 300 units. Current reliable stock (89 on-hand + 150 reliable pipeline) = 239 units.

Given the risk of P6 being lost and lead times being up to 3 periods, I need to ensure a safety buffer.

Since we are at 0 on-hand, we need to ensure the P11 order arrives this period to meet demand. If we order more now, it won't arrive for 1-3 periods. Given the existing 210 units of active pipeline for a 1+2 period horizon (210 required for 3 periods at 70/unit), we are technically covered once arrivals resume.

With an average demand of 43, this covers approximately 2.5 periods. The 70 units ordered in P26 are expected to arrive within 1-3 periods. Total effective inventory (On-hand + active In-transit) is roughly 178 units.\n\n4. Target Calculation: To cover lead time (2) + review period (1) = 3 periods of demand at ~45 units/period (conservative), we need approximately 135 units. Our effective inventory of 178 is currently sufficient.\n\n5. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0, which aligns with the high on-hand inventory relative to the current demand regime.

The 'In-transit' display shows 630 units. Based on historical carry-over insights, 510 units of this are legacy lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19).

This is a recovery from the very low dip seen around Period 38-40 but remains below the previous ~40 average.\n4. **Final Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely misinterprets the 630 'In-transit' units as available pipeline for its base-stock calculation. Since we have 0 on-hand and the active pipeline is only ~120 units (much of which is overdue), we must order to cover the remaining periods (P45-P50) and buffer against supplier unreliability.

However, based on carry-over insights, 510 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19). This leaves an effective in-transit pipeline of 170 units (P44: 50, P45: 80, P40: 40? No, P40 order was 0. Looking closely: P44: 50, P45: 80. Total effective pipeline: 130 units). 3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P41-P45) is 21, 24, 42, 32, 37 (average ~31). This is an increase from the P38-P40 dip. 4. **Strategy**: We have 0 on-hand and 130 units in the effective pipeline. The OR recommendation of 0 is likely based on the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 680. Covering (L+1) periods (3 periods) at ~35 units/period requires ~105 units. Since we have 0 on-hand and 50 units (P44) likely arriving in Period 46 or 47, we need to ensure we don't stock out further.

The effective active pipeline consists of orders from P44 (50 units), P45 (80 units), and P46 (40 units), totaling 170 units.\n2. **Inventory & Demand Analysis**: Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown high volatility recently, with P43-P45 averaging ~37 units, followed by a sharp drop to 11 in P46. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50), we must ensure enough stock to cover the remaining demand while avoiding excessive holding costs at the end. \n3. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation of 0 is likely based on the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 720. If we ignore the 510 lost units, the OR would likely see a deficit. However, we have 170 units in the active pipeline. If we assume an average demand of 30 units for the remaining 4 periods (P47-P50), total demand is ~120 units. Our active pipeline of 170 units (P44-P46) is already sufficient to cover this, provided they arrive. P44 (50 units) is due now (P47) or P48. P45 (80 units) is due P47-P48. Adding more now would likely result in high holding costs during the final periods (P49/P50) if the supplier finally delivers.

The effective in-transit pipeline consists of: P44 (50 units), P45 (80 units), and P46 (40 units), totaling 170 units. Recent arrivals at P45 (P42 and P43 orders) confirm that the supplier is still shipping with a lead time of 2-3 periods. Since P47 conclude showed arrivals of 0, the P44 order (50 units) is expected to arrive during Period 48 or 49. Recent demand has fluctuated but averaged ~26 units/period over the last 10 periods (with some stockouts). With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50), the total remaining demand is estimated at 75-80 units. The active pipeline of 170 units significantly exceeds this remaining demand.

Given that the game ends next period (Period 50), any order placed now (Period 49) would only arrive in Period 50 if the lead time is 1. However, historical lead times are erratic (1-3 periods). Placing an order now is unlikely to arrive and be sold before the game ends, especially with a 1-period observation delay.
