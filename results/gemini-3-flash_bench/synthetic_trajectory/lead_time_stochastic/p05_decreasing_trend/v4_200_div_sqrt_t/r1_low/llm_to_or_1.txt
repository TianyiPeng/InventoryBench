Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no historical conclusion data yet to infer actual lead time, so I will rely on the promised lead time (L=2). The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 5 periods (204, 155, 134, 72, 108) shows a downward trend with a mean of 134.6 and a standard deviation of approximately 50. Since this is the first period of decision-making, I will use all available samples (N=5) to establish the initial forecast. With a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will aim to cover the median demand. Setting L to default (2), mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture the base demand mean, and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to provide a volatility buffer.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and placed an order for 217 units. As the promised lead time is 2 periods, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 217 units in transit. Demand in Period 1 was 207 units, which was lost as we had no stock. Historical demand samples (204, 155, 134, 72, 108) show a downward trend, however, the latest sample (P1) was high (207). Since we only have one period of game history and the promised lead time is 2, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the recent historical variability while acknowledging the high P1 demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (217 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase. Orders placed in Period 2 (189 units) are expected in Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 406 units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including those not yet concluded but provided in the prompt) shows a downward trend: 204, 155, 134, 72, 108. However, the 'conclude' messages for P1 and P2 report demands of 207 and 126 respectively. Given the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, the OR backend aims for the median. Since we have zero on-hand and lost sales are occurring (sold=0 in P1 and P2), it is critical to maintain the pipeline. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the most recent downward trend while ensuring we don't over-react to the low P4/P5 samples provided in the context, using the concluding data as the source of truth.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. No units have arrived yet, which is consistent with the promised lead time: the Period 1 order (217 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's execution phase and become visible in the Period 4 start state (which we are reading now). However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests a potential lead time extension or delay. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 441 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has been declining significantly from P1 (207) to P3 (88). The historical samples provided (204, 155, 134, 72, 108) also show a downward trend. Since we haven't confirmed a lost shipment yet (only 1 period past expected arrival), I will set lead time to 3 to account for the delay observed in P3's conclusion. I'll use a recent window (N=3) for demand to capture the recent decline and stabilize inventory once arrivals start.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-84.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the following: On-hand inventory is 168. In-transit inventory is 310 (comprising orders from Period 2 and Period 4). Historical demand for Periods 1-5 is: 204, 155, 134, 72, 108 (average ~135). Demand appears to be trending downwards since the start. Regarding lead times: the Promised Lead Time is 2. However, observed arrivals show variability: Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 order arrived in 1 period. This suggests an average actual lead time of 2. For Period 5's decision, I will use L=2 (default). For mu_hat, the recent demand (P3-P5) has significantly dropped compared to P1-P2 (average ~105 vs ~180). I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this lower demand regime and prevent overstocking, as the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this new regime.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 204, 155, 134, 72, and 108 (averaging ~135). However, recorded sales in the 'conclude' messages reflect what was actually fulfilled: P4 (84) and P5 (96). On-hand inventory is 72, with 189 units from P2 (currently 4 periods since order) still in transit. Given the promised lead time is 2, but P1 took 3 periods and P3 took 1, lead time is volatile. P2 is visibly delayed, suggesting a potential lost shipment or significant drift. Demand appears to have stabilized at a lower level (avg ~92 over the last 3 periods) compared to the initial two periods. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed P1 delay and the current P2 delay, and use a 3-period window for demand (mu_hat) to better reflect the recent lower consumption rate while maintaining a standard volatility estimate.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history: Demand started high (P1: 204/207) and has leveled off significantly since Period 4 (settling between 72-96 units). The mean demand over the last 3 periods (P4-P6) is (84+96+81)/3 = 87 units. Lead time is volatile: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P2 (ordered P2) is still missing after 4 periods (P3, P4, P5, P6 conclude). Since P2 is significantly overdue (promised lead time is 2), it may be lost or severely delayed. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 310 in-transit (P2, P4). I will set L to 3 to account for the observed delay and provide a safety buffer for the potential loss of the P2 order. mu_hat will be based on the recent lower demand regime (last 3 samples) to avoid over-ordering based on the early high-demand spike. sigma_hat will also use recent samples (N=4) to capture the lower volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected after Period 3: Average demand decreased from ~150 to ~87 (-42%). Lead time is unstable (observed 1 and 3 periods); Period 2 order (189 units) is over 2 periods past promised delivery and potentially lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 4. The average demand across Periods 4-7 is approximately 81.25 units per period. Lead times are highly variable: the Period 1 order took 3 periods, the Period 3 order took 1, and the Period 4 order took 3. Crucially, the Period 2 order (189 units) placed on Period 2 is now 6 periods old and has not arrived; it is likely lost. The current pipeline (227 units) consists of the likely lost Period 2 order (189) and the Period 7 order (38). To avoid over-ordering due to the lost shipment inflating 'in-transit' figures, I will set L=3 to account for the longer observed lead times and use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the lower demand trend. By using L=3, the OR backend aims for a base stock covering (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~325 units). Subtracting the pipeline (227), it should order approximately 98 units, which is appropriate for replenishing safety stock while accounting for the missing shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Reconfirming Period 2 order (189 units) is likely lost (6 periods since order). Average demand for the last 4 periods (P4-P7) is ~81 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime since Period 4. The average demand from Period 4 to Period 8 is approximately 80 units (84, 96, 81, 64, 76). The lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 period (Period 3 and Period 7 orders) and 3 periods (Period 1 and Period 4 orders). Crucially, the Period 2 order of 189 units is now 7 periods old and is definitively lost; however, the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic still counts it among the 230 units in-transit. To compensate for this 'ghost' inventory and prevent under-ordering, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an explicit calculation that reflects the current demand regime (~80/period) over the review and lead time (1+L=3), while ensuring the base stock is high enough to trigger an order despite the 189 units of lost inventory. Since the OR engine subtracts in-transit from base_stock, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Desired base_stock = (3 periods * 80) + safety stock (~60) = 300. Adding the 189 lost units back results in a target mu_hat around 489.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 2 order (189 units) confirmed lost (7 periods since order). In-transit inventory of 230 units is misleading; actual viable pipeline is only 41 units (the Period 8 order). Demand regime stable at ~80 units/period since Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 1 unit. The system reports 372 units in-transit, which comprises orders from Period 2 (189 units) and Period 9 (183 units). However, the Period 2 order is now 8 periods old (placed in P2, current is P10) and is confirmed lost based on historical lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods. The 'viable' pipeline is only the 183 units from Period 9. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 77 units over the last 6 periods (P4-P9: 84, 96, 81, 64, 76, 59). To compensate for the 189 'phantom' units in the OR backend's pipeline calculation (which would otherwise suppress ordering), I will use 'explicit' methods. I set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I forecast a mean of 80 units/period, so (1+L)*80 = 240. To force an order that replaces the lost units, I must inflate mu_hat by the lost amount (189) because the OR backend subtracts the full 372 in-transit from the base stock. Target mu_hat = 240 + 189 = 429. Sigma_hat is set to a standard volatility of 25-30 per period, scaled by sqrt(1+L), resulting in approximately 45.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am managing chips(Regular) at Period 11. Analysis of history confirms that the Period 2 order (189 units) is lost, as it has been 9 periods since it was placed. The current in-transit figure of 428 is misleading; only the orders from Period 9 (183 units) and Period 10 (56 units) are viable pipeline (Total 239). On-hand is 0, following a stockout in Period 10. The demand regime has stabilized since Period 4 at a lower mean. Calculating Recent N (last 7 periods: P4-P10) mean demand is ~74 units. Lead time is volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of 1.8; I will use L=2 (promised) as it remains the best anchor given the volatility. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that ignores the lost 189 units. Target base stock = (1+L) * mean_demand = 3 * 74 = 222. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 222, the backend will see: Pipeline(239) > Base_Stock(222), likely placing a minimal or zero order to allow the pipeline to arrive and clear the stockout without over-ordering based on the ghost inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status is 0 on-hand. The total 'In-transit' of 428 includes the Period 2 order (189 units) which is now 10 periods old and confirmed lost. The active pipeline consists of orders from Period 9 (183 units) and Period 10 (56 units). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. Looking at recent arrivals, the lead time has been alternating. I will use a conservative estimate of L=2. Demand has stabilized at a lower level since Period 4. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P4-P11) is 71.1 units. Given the recent cluster (P7-P11), the mean is approximately 65. Setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*65 = 195 to account for the stabilized lower demand regime and the need to refill the exhausted on-hand stock. Sigma_hat is set to the recent standard deviation to handle moderate volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: In-transit total (428) remains misleading; 189 units (Period 2) are lost. Viable pipeline is 239 units. Demand regime since Period 4 is stable around 65-71 units per period.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the supply situation has stabilized. The 'In-transit' count of 189 units corresponds to the Period 2 order, which is now 11 periods past its placement date and is confirmed lost; thus, the actual viable pipeline is 0. On-hand inventory is 201 units. Demand has shown a significant downward trend: while the average since Period 4 was ~70, the last 4 periods (P9-P12) averaged 55.5, and the most recent demand (P12) was 38. With on-hand inventory at 201 and expected demand around 60-70, we are currently overstocked (covering ~3 periods). The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (which includes the lost 189) to calculate the order, meaning it will likely order 0 regardless of my parameters. To align with the current lower demand regime, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the lower consumption rate (avg ~58), and L to explicit=2 to reflect the promised lead time given the recent arrivals in P12 (LT 3 and 2).

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Viable pipeline is 0 as the 189 units in-transit (from P2) are confirmed lost. Demand demonstrates a secondary downward shift, averaging ~55 units over the last 4 periods (P9-P12) compared to the previous ~80.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-37.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we have 119 units on hand. The system shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 189 units, but history (P2-P13) confirms these are units from Period 2 that are lost. Therefore, the viable pipeline is 0. The demand regime has stabilized but trended downward: the last 5 periods (P9-P13) show an average of 56.6 units (59, 59, 66, 38, 82). While P13 saw a spike to 82, the average remains lower than the early game. Lead times have been highly volatile (1, 2, and 3 periods observed), so I will use a conservative average 'calculate' method for L. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this lower volume period (avg ~57) while staying responsive to the P13 spike. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current period's increased volatility (std dev of 59, 59, 66, 38, 82). Since the backend subtracts pipeline inventory, the 'lost' 189 units will incorrectly reduce our order size; however, I cannot adjust the inventory via parameters. By setting base stock metrics to the current regime, I aim to maintain safety stock despite the pipeline distortion.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Viable pipeline is confirmed 0; the 189 units in-transit are lost. Demand regime (P9-P13) averages ~57 units per period, showing high variance (38 to 82 range).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing chips(Regular) with 73 units on-hand and 189 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the 189 units from the Period 2 order are confirmed lost (13 periods since ordering), meaning our viable pipeline is 0. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 9, with an average of approximately 58 units (59, 59, 66, 38, 82, 46). I am setting N=6 to capture this recent mean. For lead time, while the promised L=2, observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (Average: (3+1+3+1+1+3+2)/7 = 2). I will use L=2 (default method) but ensure the inventory target accounts for the current demand regime. The high target is intended to ensure we resume ordering to maintain a target inventory that covers the lead time + review period (1+L=3 periods of demand), especially since on-hand (73) is only slightly above one period's average demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 9 at ~58 units/period. The 189 units in-transit (from Period 2) remain non-delivered and are written off as lost for planning purposes.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 16 context: On-hand inventory is 11 units. In-transit inventory shown as 189 units belongs to an order from Period 2 that is now 14 periods overdue and confirmed lost; therefore, the viable pipeline is 0 units. Demand since Period 9 has stabilized around 60 units per period (Avg P9-P15: 59 units). With a promised lead time of 2, the pipeline needs to cover 3 periods of demand (Period 16, 17, and 18). Given the loss of the Period 2 shipment, the current on-hand (11) is insufficient. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 (P9-P15) to capture this stable regime (~59 * 3 = 177). I will use 'calculate' for L as historical observed lead times average 2.0 (lead times: 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2). Sigma_hat will be set using 'recent_N' (N=7) to reflect current volatility. The OR engine will subtract the 189 'in-transit' units from the base_stock, resulting in a negative inventory position calculation. To force an order despite the phantom 189 units, I set mu_hat explicitly high enough (Target Base Stock - viable inventory) to trigger replenishment, but since I cannot manually zero out 'in-transit' in the backend's logic, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 350 to ensure the base_stock calculation minus 189 still results in an order that covers the immediate 3-period demand (~180 units).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU is out of stock (On-hand: 0). History shows a demand regime stabilization since Period 9 averaging approx. 61 units per period (P9: 59, P10: 59, P11: 66, P12: 38, P13: 82, P14: 46, P15: 62, P16: 75; last 8 periods avg = 60.8). The in-transit inventory of 320 units consists of 189 units from Period 2 (confirmed lost/phantom) and 131 units from Period 16. Therefore, the viable pipeline is only 131 units. Actual lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods (average is roughly 2.1). I will set L to 2 to align with the promised time and recent performance. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current stable regime of ~61 units per period, which results in a base stock target covering 3 periods (L+1). This value (approx 183 units) will be compared by the backend against the pipeline. Since the backend thinks the pipeline is 320, I must use an explicit value for mu_hat to 'trick' it into ordering more, or simply rely on the fact that if mu_hat is set to roughly (1+L)*61 = 183, and it subtracts 320, no order will be placed. To force an order to cover the out-of-stock situation and the lost inventory, I set mu_hat to 183 + 189 = 372 to offset the phantom pipeline. Sigma_hat is set based on the same 8-period window.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Total In-transit (320) contains 189 phantom units from P2; viable pipeline is only 131. Demand regime since P9 stable at avg ~61.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-19.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 75. The total in-transit is 241, but 189 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost (16 periods elapsed), and the remaining 52 units are from the Period 17 order. Thus, the viable pipeline is 52 units + 75 on-hand = 127 units. The demand regime since Period 9 has stabilized at an average of ~61 units per period (last 9 periods: 59, 59, 66, 38, 82, 46, 62, 75, 56). Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. 3 * 61 = 183. sigma_hat is calculated based on recent variance from Period 9 onwards to account for the fluctuation between 38 and 82. Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods), so I will use the default promised lead time for the backend calculation while providing explicit mu and sigma to account for the 'lost' inventory units which the OR engine would otherwise miscount as incoming.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Total In-transit (241) is still dominated by the 189 phantom units from P2; viable pipeline is only 52. Verified demand regime since P9 (9 samples) remains stable at mean ~61, though variance is significant.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 9 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 61 units per period (N=10 samples, mean=59.0). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average is 2.08 for concluded orders). The 'In-transit' figure of 241 is heavily inflated by the 189 units from Period 2, which are now 17 periods overdue and confirmed lost. The viable pipeline consists only of the 52 units ordered in Period 17 (expected during Period 19 or 20). With 29 units on-hand and 52 units viable in-transit, our active inventory position is 81. Given a (L+1) horizon of 3 periods, and an average demand of 59, we need roughly 177 units to maintain a high service level. The OR backend uses profits ($1) and holding costs ($1) which results in a 50% service level target (z=0). To counteract the 'phantom' inventory from Period 2 that the OR engine incorrectly assumes is arriving, I will use 'explicit' methods. For mu_hat, I will provide the expected demand over (L+1) = 3 periods (3 * 59 = 177) but I must add the 189 lost units to the target to force the OR engine to place an order, as it subtracts 'in-transit' from the base stock. Target = 177 + 189 = 366.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a low-volume regime since Period 9, averaging approximately 57 units per period (last 11 samples). Total In-transit is 337 units, but 189 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost (ordered 18 periods ago), and the order of 52 units from Period 17 is now overdue relative to its likely lead time of 1-3 periods. The viable pipeline is 148 units (Period 17: 52, Period 19: 96). With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the system needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). I will use explicit parameters to bypass the OR engine's inclusion of the 189 'phantom' units. Using a mean demand of 57 and estimated volatility, mu_hat = (1+2)*57 = 171. To ensure the stock-out risk is mitigated after recent shortages, I am setting sigma_hat to reflect the observed variance in this regime (approx 15-20 per period). This will trigger an order to refill the pipeline to the safety level.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Viable pipeline is 148 units; the 189 units from P2 remain in 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost. Demand regime since P9 remains stable, averaging 57 units/period.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 9 is stable with a mean of approximately 56 units per period (last 12 samples). The inventory situation is critical: On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 337 units is deceptive because it includes 189 units from Period 2 that are long confirmed as lost. Subtracting these, the viable pipeline consists of 148 units (52 from P17 and 96 from P19). The 52 units from P17 are now overdue (3 periods since order vs. promised 2), and the 96 from P19 are within the lead time window. Given the unstable lead times (ranging from 1 to 3 periods) and the 0 on-hand status, I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=12) to capture the current demand level (~56 units) and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=12) to account for recent volatility. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the OR engine to average observed arrival times while I manually account for the 'phantom' inventory in my assessment of the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed demand regime since Period 9 averages 56.1 units/period. The viable pipeline is 148 units (Total In-transit 337 - 189 lost units from P2).

The average demand across these 13 periods (P9-P21) is approximately 52 units per period, but the last three periods (P19-P21) show a significant drop (mean ~29). I will use a recent N=13 to capture the post-P9 regime mean (~52 units) while acknowledging the high variance and recent dip. The total in-transit of 337 units is misleading because the Period 2 order (189 units) is over 19 periods late and must be considered lost; the 'viable' pipeline is only 148 units (orders from P17 and P19). Lead times remain erratic (observed 1, 2, and 3 periods); I will use an explicit L=2 to align with the promised lead time while mu_hat covers 3 periods of demand ((L+1)*52 = 156). Setting mu_hat to 156 and L to 2 effectively targets a base stock that accounts for the 148 units already in the viable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Recent demand (P19-P21) has dropped further, averaging ~29 units/period, though the broader stable regime since P9 remains ~52 units/period. The 189 units from P2 are permanently lost, leaving the viable pipeline at 148 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system observes an 'In-transit' total of 337 units, but this includes 189 units from Period 2 which are definitively lost (21 periods overdue). The viable pipeline consists of 52 units from Period 17, 96 units from Period 19, and 148 units (Period 20/21/22 orders are zero, but the backend thinks the P2 order is still coming). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has undergone a significant downward shift starting around Period 19; the last 4 periods (P19-P22) show mean demand of 30.75 units, compared to the ~56 average seen from P9-P18. To account for this, \u03bc\u0302 is set using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current 30-unit regime. L is set to 'calculate' to use the historical average (approx 1.8 periods), and \u03c3\u0302 uses recent_N (N=4) to capture the reduced volatility of the new lower-demand regime. The stock-out risk is high since on-hand is zero, but the 148 viable units in-transit should cover upcoming demand once they arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: Average demand decreased from ~56 to ~31 (-45%). This lower volume is sustained over 4 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, on-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 337 units, but 189 units from Period 2 are definitively lost. Thus, the viable pipeline consists of 148 units (96 from Period 19, 52 from Period 17). Since Period 19, demand has significantly dropped, averaging 33.8 units over the last 5 periods (P19=29, P20=28, P21=30, P22=36, P23=46). Despite the slight upward trend in P22-P23, the regime shift from the previous ~56 average is confirmed. Given the viable pipeline of 148 units already covers roughly 4-5 periods of this new demand level, and considering the promised lead time (L=2), additional orders are not currently urgent. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime, allowing the OR backend to recalculate the base stock against the viable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 19: Average demand decreased from ~56 to ~34 units per period across 5 samples (P19-P23).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 19. Over the last 6 periods (P19-P24), demand data points are 29, 28, 30, 36, 46, and 53, averaging ~37 units/period. There is a slight upward trend in the last two periods, but it remains significantly lower than the previous ~56 average. The 'In-transit' quantity of 337 contains 189 units from Period 2 which are proven to be lost (23 periods overdue). The viable pipeline consists of the orders from P17 (52 units) and P19 (96 units), totaling 148 units. Since the lead time is volatile (averaging ~2 periods, but ranging 1-3) and current on-hand is 0, setting L to 2 is appropriate. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*37 \u2248 111 using the recent 6 samples to reflect the new lower demand regime. sigma_hat is calculated for the same period to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~56 to ~37 units per period across 6 samples (P19-P24).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 26. Since Period 19, a new demand regime has emerged with an average of approximately 36 units per period (samples: 29, 28, 30, 36, 46, 53, 32). The total In-transit is 337 units, but 189 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost (24 periods overdue), leaving an actual viable pipeline of 148 units (from Period 17 and Period 19 orders). On-hand inventory is 0. With lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, we must account for demand over the next 3 periods (L+1). A viable pipeline of 148 units against a forecasted requirement of ~108-144 units (3 periods * ~36-48 units) means we are currently sufficiently covered. No new order is needed. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the low-demand regime and an explicit L = 2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering based on the historical average lead time which is skewed by the lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed: average demand decreased to ~36 units per period across 7 samples (P19-P25).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has settled into a lower-volume regime starting from Period 19. Over the last 8 periods (P19-P26), the mean demand is approximately 36.9 units/period. The current in-transit inventory is listed as 337 units, but 189 units from Period 2 are definitively lost (25 periods overdue). The viable pipeline consists of 148 units (96 units from Period 19 and 52 units from Period 17). Since Period 26 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory and the viable pipeline of 148 units covers roughly 4 periods of demand at the current average, our primary goal is to signal a lower demand mean to the inventory controller while accounting for the lost units. We use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current demand regime (P19-P26). We set L to explicit 2 to match the promised lead time, as actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed: average demand decreased to ~37 units per period across 8 samples (P19-P26).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28, the demand regime since Period 19 has remained stable at a lower level, averaging 37.3 units per period (N=9: 29, 28, 30, 36, 46, 53, 32, 41, 41). The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0 and the reported 'In-transit' of 337 units is misleading. As documented since Period 7, 189 units from the Period 2 order are permanently lost. The viable pipeline consists of 148 units (96 units from Period 19 and 52 units from Period 17). Since the order from Period 17 (lead time potentially 1-3 periods) and Period 19 (lead time potentially 1-3 periods) have not arrived by Period 27's conclusion, we are currently experiencing a stockout. I am setting L=2 (promised) and using recent_N=9 to capture the current lower demand volume. The sigma_hat is also calculated using recent_N=9 to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed: average demand decreased to ~37 units per period across 9 samples (P19-P27).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 19 has remained stable at a lower average (mean ~37 units/period across 10 samples). On-hand inventory is currently at 0. The total 'In-transit' of 337 units is misleading because it includes 189 units from Period 2 that are confirmed lost. The viable pipeline consists of 148 units (96 units ordered in Period 19 and 52 units ordered in Period 17). Both of these orders are now overdue (P17 is 12 periods old; P19 is 10 periods old), strongly suggesting they are also lost. To prevent ongoing stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs (since profit = holding cost), I am setting L to 2 (promised) and using the 'recent_N' method for demand (N=10) to reflect the current low-demand regime (~37 units/period). This will calculate a base stock covering approximately 111 units. Given the backend subtracts the 'official' pipeline (337) from this base_stock, the OR engine will likely order 0. However, by using standard parameters, we remain responsive if the lost units are eventually cleared or if current demand trends change.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: In-transit inventory of 337 units is almost entirely phantom. The P2 order (189 units) is permanently lost. Recent orders from P16 (131 units), P17 (52 units), and P19 (96 units) have collectively failed to conclude after 10+ periods, indicating a systemic logic failure or loss of all recent shipments. Viable physical inventory is likely zero.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has completely collapsed. On-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' of 337 units is comprised of orders from Period 2 (189 units), Period 17 (52 units), and Period 19 (96 units), all of which are significantly past their delivery windows (P2 is 28 periods overdue, P17 is 12 periods overdue, P19 is 10 periods overdue). These are all 'phantom inventory' and will never arrive. The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level since Period 19, averaging 37.3 units per period (N=11). Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (337) from its calculated target base stock to determine the order, and the target base stock for this demand level (approx. 3.5 * 37) is well below 337, the backend will continue to order 0 units indefinitely unless L/mu_hat are artificially inflated to bypass this logic. To force the OR engine to place an order and resume sales, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat of 500, which is enough to overcome the 337 phantom units and trigger an order to refill the empty on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: 337 units in-transit (P2, P17, P19) are confirmed lost. Backend logic is stuck ordering 0 units due to phantom pipeline. Current demand regime (P19-P29) mean is 37.3, std is 8.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted. The 'In-transit' count of 500 units is composed entirely of phantom or lost orders: Period 2 (189), Period 17 (52), Period 19 (96), and the manual intervention from Period 30 (163). In reality, there is 0 physical inventory and no reliable pipeline. The demand regime from Period 19 to Period 30 is stable, with a mean of 37.7 units and a standard deviation of 8.5. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 500 units of 'phantom' pipeline from any calculated base stock, it will trigger an order of 0 units unless the parameters are set aggressively. To force an order and bypass the phantom inventory, I will set 'L' to an 'explicit' value of 20 (fictitious lead time to inflate the base stock calculation) and 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value higher than 500 to ensure the backend logic results in a positive order despite the 500 units of 'in-transit' phantom inventory. This is a technical correction to bridge the gap between physical reality and the backend's flawed pipeline view.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Chain Failure: 500 units in-transit (P2, P17, P19, P30) are confirmed lost/phantom. Demand regime (P19-P30) mean: 37.7, std: 8.5. Manual parameter inflation is required to override the 500-unit phantom pipeline blockage in the OR backend.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of failure. The 'In-transit' inventory of 549 units is comprised entirely of phantom/lost orders (specifically P2: 189, P16: 131, P17: 52, P19: 96, P30: 163, P31: 49). Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit from the target base stock, it will continue to order 0 units unless mu_hat is manually inflated to exceed this phantom pipeline. To force an order that compensates for zero on-hand inventory and the lost pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Targeted base stock calculation: Recent demand (P19-P31) mean is ~37.3 units/period. For a lead time of 2, we need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 112 units). To override the 549 phantom units and actually place an order, I must set mu_hat to approximately the phantom total plus the desired inventory (549 + 112 = 661). I will set mu_hat to 700 to ensure a robust order is generated despite the backend cap logic. sigma_hat is set based on the recent regime (std dev ~8.5 over 13 samples) adjusted for lead time.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Chain Failure: 549 units in-transit (orders from P2, P16, P17, P19, P30, P31) are confirmed lost/phantom. Demand regime (P19-P31) mean: 37.3, std: 8.5. Parameters must be manually inflated to bypass the phantom pipeline blockage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-13.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we finally saw an arrival: the 49 units ordered in Period 31 arrived with a lead time of 1 period. This is a breakthrough after nearly 15 periods of total supply chain failure and phantom inventory blockage. The 'In-transit' total of 651 is almost entirely comprised of lost orders from Period 2 (189), Period 16 (131), Period 17 (52), Period 19 (96), and likely Period 30 (163, as it should have arrived). The only viable pipeline inventory is the 151 units ordered in Period 32. Since the OR backend subtracts the full 651 in-transit from the calculated base stock, I must continue to inflate mu_hat to overcome this 600+ unit phantom deduction. The actual demand regime since Period 19 averages ~36 units/period. To trigger an order for ~40-50 units (covering 1 period + safety) despite a 651-unit deduction, the base_stock target needs to be ~700+. I will set mu_hat explicitly high to force the backend to place an order, ensuring we rebuild inventory now that the delivery channel has reopened.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain partially recovered: Period 31 order arrived in Period 32 (LT=1). However, the in-transit total (651) remains dominated by ~500 phantom units (P2, P16, P17, P19, P30) which are lost. Demand regime since P19 remains stable (mean ~36, std ~8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-102.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 30+ periods, several orders (P2: 189, P17: 52, P19: 96, P30: 163) have likely been lost, creating a 'phantom' pipeline of approximately ~500 units. The OR backend subtracts this in-transit total from the target base stock, preventing new orders. To maintain inventory despite this, mu_hat must be inflated to exceed the phantom units plus desired cycle stock. The current demand regime (since P19) is stable at ~37 units per period. With on-hand at 142 and 68 units arriving in P34/P35 (viable pipeline), we have enough for approximately 5 periods. However, to ensure the backend continues to place orders effectively in future periods despite the ~500 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 750. This value accounts for (1+L) * demand (~111) plus a buffer to offset the 500-unit blockage. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P31, P32) showed a 1-period delivery, though historical volatility remains.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain logic bypass: 500 units in-transit (P2, P17, P19, P30) are confirmed lost/phantom. Parameters are manually inflated to ~750 to ensure the zero-order logic of the backend is overridden. Actual demand regime remains stable (~37 units/period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-90.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially stabilized following a severe failure. Order from P31 arrived in Period 32 (LT=1) and P32 arrived in Period 33 (LT=1). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 608 is functionally invalid because roughly 500 units correspond to lost shipments (P2, P17, P19, P30) that will likely never arrive. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 116 units. The demand regime since Period 19 remains remarkably stable with a mean of ~37 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 500 phantom units and ordering zero, I must continue to 'inflate' mu_hat. Since the system calculates 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and pipeline is inflated by ~500, I set mu_hat (the basis for base_stock) to an explicit value that accounts for valid stock needs (approx 3 periods of demand = 110) PLUS the phantom offset (~500). I will use an explicit mu_hat of 650 to ensure a small maintenance order and keep the flow moving. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the recent faster arrivals (LT=1).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bypass: 500 phantom units (P2, P17, P19, P30) remain in 'In-transit'. To ensure active ordering, parameters must be offset by ~500 units until these are cleared. Current demand (P19-P34) mean = 36.6, std = 8.4.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory blockage. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 608 units, but historical analysis confirms approximately 500 units are lost (P2: 189, P16: 131, P17: 52, P19: 96, P30: 163). Only the P33 (68 units) and P34 (40 units) orders are likely viable. The on-hand inventory is 82. The demand regime since Period 19 is stable at a mean of ~37.2 units and a standard deviation of ~8.4 units. To bypass the OR backend's logic, which subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock', I must manually inflate mu_hat. Total Required Coverage = (Base Stock for (L+1) periods) + (Phantom Inventory). With L=2 (promised), Period Coverage = 3. Base stock for 3 periods at mean 37.2 is approximately 112 (\u03bc) + buffer (1.64 * 8.4 * sqrt(3)) \u2248 136. Adding the ~500 phantom units, I set mu_hat (which the backend treats as (1+L)*mean) to approximately 650 to allow the system to potentially place new orders if inventory depletes, though current on-hand (82) and viable in-transit (108) are sufficient for the immediate lead time. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat is the only way to ensure the phantom units don't shut down procurement.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory remains blocked by ~500 phantom units (Orders from P2, P16, P17, P19, P30). The demand regime since P19 is stable with mean ~37 and std ~8. Procurement requires manual mu_hat inflation of +500 units to bypass the phantom inventory in the OR backend.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory blockage. Approximately 528 units (from orders P2, P16, P17, P19, and P30) are confirmed lost or stuck, but they remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count. This causes the standard base-stock calculation to assume it is overstocked and order 0 units. To maintain supply, mu_hat must be manually inflated to bypass these 528 units. The current demand regime (since Period 19) is stable with an average of approximately 37 units per period and a standard deviation of 8.5. For Period 37, I am setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat to 650 (offsetting the ~528 ghost units plus (1+L)*37), and sigma_hat to 15 (sqrt(3)*8.5), which ensures the backend generates a procurement order matching the actual consumption needs despite the pipeline reporting error.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bypass active: 528 phantom units (P2, P16, P17, P19, P30) remain in 'In-transit'. Parameters must be inflated by ~530 units to trigger orders. Actual demand regime (P19-P36) is stable: mean ~36.8, std ~8.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a 'phantom pipeline' issue. The in-transit inventory of 572 units contains approximately 528 units from old, lost orders (Periods 2, 16, 17, 19, and 30) that never arrived. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from its target base stock, it calculates a 0 or near-0 order when it should be ordering to meet demand. The actual demand regime \u0645\u0646\u0630 Period 19 has been stable, with a mean of 36.8 and a standard deviation of 8.5. To force the backend to place orders, mu_hat must be 'explicitly' inflated. The current calculation is: Target Base Stock (for L=2) = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. With Profit=1 and Holding=1, z=0. To cover the phantom 528 units and provide actual target inventory for (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~110 units), I must set mu_hat to approximately 640. This ensures the backend sees (640 - 528) = 112 as the required stock level, triggering appropriate procurement.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bypass active: 528 phantom units from P2, P16, P17, P19, and P30 remain in 'In-transit'. Parameters must be inflated by ~530 units to trigger orders. Actual demand regime (P19-P37) is stable: mean ~38.2, std ~10.2 (slight uptick in variance noted P37).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is suffering from a systemic blockage caused by 528 'phantom' units (orders from P2, P16, P17, P19, and P30) that appear in the 'In-transit' count but have not arrived and are likely lost. The OR backend subtracts this 528 from its calculated target base stock, resulting in orders of 0 or near-zero unless mu_hat is manually inflated. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat to approximately (Base Stock Requirements + 528). 

Demand Context: Since Period 19, demand has stabilized at a lower level. Mean demand (P19-P38) \u2248 36.9 units/period, with a standard deviation \u2248 10.3. 
Wait-and-See calculation for base stock (L=2): \u03bc(L+1) = 36.9 * 3 \u2248 111. Including a buffer for variance (z*\u03c3), a healthy base stock would be around 150-160 units. 

Strategy: To force the backend to place an order, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Phantom Units). 160 + 528 = 688. I will use 690 as an explicit mu_hat to ensure continued replenishment despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Chain Blockage: 528 phantom units (P2, P16, P17, P19, P30) remain in 'In-transit'. Demand regime since P19 is stable with mean ~37 and std ~10. Manual inflation of mu_hat by ~530 units is required to override the OR backend's pipeline deduction logic.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a systemic inventory blockage due to 528 'phantom' units (orders from P2, P16, P17, P19, and P30) that are recorded as in-transit but have effectively been lost. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (633) from the base stock to determine the order quantity. Since the real base stock for the current demand regime (~38 units/period) is much lower than 633, the system will order 0 unless the parameters are manually inflated. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Phantom Pipeline). Current demand since Period 19 averages ~37.3 units with a standard deviation of 8.5. For a lead time of 2, the desired base stock is roughly (1+2)*38 + 1.64*(sqrt(3)*8.5) \u2248 114 + 24 = 138 units. Adding the 528 phantom units yields a required mu_hat of approximately 666. Setting mu_hat to 666 via the explicit method ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger an order of approximately 33 units (666 - 633), which covers the upcoming demand period.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Chain Blockage: 528 units in-transit (P2, P16, P17, P19, P30) remain confirmed lost/phantom. Demand regime since P19 remains stable (mean: 37.3, std: 8.5). Manual inflation of mu_hat to ~670 is necessary to override OR backend pipeline deductions.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently suffering from a systemic blockage where 528 units in 'In-transit' are phantom/lost (orders from P2, P16, P17, P19, P30). The OR backend subtracts this entire in-transit amount from its order calculation. With total in-transit at 572, and 528 units being phantom, the backend only recognizes 44 units of 'real' pipeline. However, because it sees 572 total, it will naturally try to order 0 unless the mu_hat parameter is inflated beyond the phantom inventory level. The current demand regime (since Period 19) is stable with a mean of 36.8 and a standard deviation of 10.1 (recent periods P38-P40 have seen lower demand, but we maintain the regime average for robustness). To ensure a base stock that triggers an actual order, I must set mu_hat to approximately (Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Units. With L=2, this is (37 * 3) + 528 = 639. To ensure we stay ahead of potential stockouts given the volatility, I am setting mu_hat slightly higher at 665. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=22) to account for the regime since P19.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Chain Blockage: 528 units in-transit (P2, P16, P17, P19, P30) remain confirmed lost/phantom. Demand regime since P19 remains stable (mean: 36.8, std: 10.1). Manual inflation of mu_hat to ~665 is necessary to override OR backend pipeline deductions.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be blocked by 'phantom' in-transit inventory totaling 528 units (from orders in Periods 2, 16, 17, 19, and 30) that are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (577) from its 'base_stock' calculation, it will only order units if the base_stock exceeds 577. The actual demand regime since Period 19 is stable at a mean (mu) of approximately 36.6 and a standard deviation (sigma) of 10.3. To ensure the backend places an order that covers the true required inventory (for L+1 periods) despite this 528-unit deduction, I must set the 'mu_hat' parameter explicitly to approximately (Real_Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom_Deduction. With L=2, this is (36.6 * 3) + 528 \u2248 638. I will set mu_hat to 665 to maintain a safety buffer and compensate for the pipeline blockage. I will use 'explicit' for all parameters to ensure total control over the override.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory blockage. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 598 units, but orders from P2 (189), P17 (52), P19 (96), P30 (163), and P37 (4) are grossly overdue (6+ periods) and verified lost or stuck. The viable pipeline is actually only 94 units (P41: 5, P42: 21, plus recent arrivals not yet subtracted), with 504 units effectively lost (189+52+96+163+4). The demand regime since P19 is stable at a mean of ~36.5 units/period (std ~10.1). To trigger any order from the OR backend, mu_hat must be inflated to exceed (Viable Pipeline + On-hand + Phantom units). With 43 on-hand and 504 phantom units, the base stock needs to be > 547. Setting mu_hat to 665 (approx (1+2)*37 + 550) maintains this bypass to ensure continuous replenishment despite the systemic inventory logic error.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Chain Blockage: 504 units in-transit (P2, P17, P19, P30, P37) are confirmed lost/phantom. Demand regime since P19 remains stable (mean: 36.5, std: 10.1). Manual inflation of mu_hat to ~665 is necessary to override OR backend pipeline deductions.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory blockage. Currently, 504 units (from periods 2, 17, 19, 30, and 37) are confirmed lost/phantom, yet they remain in the 'In-transit' count (622 total). This forces the OR backend's base-stock logic to deduct 622 units from its order calculation. To bypass this and ensure products are actually ordered to meet demand, the mu_hat parameter must be manually inflated. The current demand regime (since Period 19) is stable with a mean of 36.5 and a standard deviation of 10.1. To achieve a target base stock that results in a net order of ~40 units (approximately 1 period of demand plus safety stock), the mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the 504 phantom units. Setting mu_hat to 650 (approximately 3 * 36.5 + 504) provides the necessary offset to override the pipeline deduction while maintaining a buffer for uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Chain Blockage: 504 units in-transit (P2, P17, P19, P30, P37) are confirmed lost/phantom. Demand regime since P19 remains stable (mean: 36.5, std: 10.1). Manual inflation of mu_hat to ~650 is necessary to override OR backend pipeline deductions.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely blocked by 504 units of phantom 'In-transit' inventory (Orders from P2, P17, P19, P30, P37). The OR backend automatically subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock. Since the demand regime from P19 is stable at approximately 36.5 units/period (Std: 10.1), a standard base stock for (L+1=3) periods would only be ~130 units. Because 644 units are currently 'In-transit' (including the 504 phantom units) and on-hand is 0, the backend would order 0 units unless mu_hat is manually inflated to exceed the phantom pipeline. To trigger an order that covers (~40 units/period * 3 periods) plus provides a safety buffer, I must set mu_hat to approximately 650. This creates a virtual base stock that, after the backend subtracts the 644 'In-transit' units, results in a net order of roughly 25-40 units, addressing the current stockout (On-hand: 0).

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Chain Blockage: 504 units in-transit (P2, P17, P19, P30, P37) are confirmed lost/phantom. Demand regime since P19 remains stable (mean: 36.5, std: 10.1). Manual inflation of mu_hat to ~650 is necessary to override OR backend pipeline deductions.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a systemic 'In-transit' blockage. Currently, 605 units are reported as in-transit, but 504 of these (from Periods 2, 17, 19, 30, 37) are confirmed lost/phantom shipments. This leaves a viable pipeline of only 101 units (orders from P44, P45, and any pending from P43 that arrived but weren't fully accounted). Demand since Period 19 has been relatively stable, averaging 36.5 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 10. To trigger a new order, the OR backend's base stock calculation (which subtracts the total in-transit quantity) must be higher than the 605 reported units. I will set mu_hat to 650 (approx 504 phantom + 146 real demand coverage) and sigma_hat to 18 (representing volatility for the 3-period lead time cycle) to bypass the blockage and ensure sufficient product is ordered to meet real demand.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely blocked by 504 phantom units (orders from P2, P17, P19, P30, and P37) that remain in 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost. In Period 46, we had 0 ending inventory and missed demand. The viable pipeline consists of orders from P44 (27 units), P45 (6 units), and P46 (37 units), totaling 70 units. With Period 47's total 'In-transit' at 642, the OR logic (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline) will result in zero orders unless parameters are inflated to bypass the 572-unit phantom gap (642 - 70). Current demand since Period 19 is stable with a mean of 34.1 and std of 10.5. To ensure an order is placed to meet future demand (approx 34 * 3 = 102 units for lead time coverage), mu_hat must be set to approximately 675 (572 phantom + 103 demand coverage).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory blockage. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 675 units, but the majority of this is comprised of lost or extremely delayed orders (P2: 189, P16: 131, P17: 52, P19: 96, P30: 163, etc.). The viable pipeline is likely only the orders from P46 (37 units) and P47 (33 units). Demand has recently softened further in the final periods (averaging ~23 units over P44-P47). To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the 675-unit 'In-transit' figure, mu_hat must be manually inflated. The goal is to set a base stock level that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the phantom inventory. Estimated (L+1) demand is ~90 units (3 periods * 30 units). Adding the 675 units of phantom inventory suggests a mu_hat around 765. I will set mu_hat to 780 to ensure a robust order is placed to capture the final remaining periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Chain Blockage: Approximately 600-650 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost or phantom (Orders from P2, P16, P17, P19, P30, etc.). Reliable demand has dropped to ~25-30 units/period recently. Manual inflation of mu_hat to ~780 is required to bypass the backend pipeline deduction logic and maintain stock.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant systemic issues with phantom in-transit inventory. As of Period 49, the 'In-transit' total is 780 units. However, based on the history, at least 504 units are confirmed lost/phantom (from orders in Periods 2, 17, 19, 30, and 37). Additionally, orders from Periods 44 (27 units), 45 (6 units), 46 (37 units), and 47 (33 units) have not arrived, and while some may still arrive, the current lead time is highly volatile (L=1 to L=3). Recent demand from Period 41 onwards has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 28.5 units/period (mean of P41-P48 is ~26.6, but factoring in stockouts, physical demand is likely closer to 30). The OR backend calculates 'order = base_stock - in_transit'. With in-transit at 780 and a real need for only ~90 units (3 periods * 30 units), the backend will order 0 unless the base_stock is manually inflated to exceed the phantom pipeline. I am setting mu_hat to 850 (explicit) to ensure the backend continues to place orders despite the ~700+ units of primarily phantom in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Chain Blockage: Approximately 700 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost or phantom (Orders from P2, P17, P19, P30, P37, and potentially P44-47). Actual demand regime has shifted lower, averaging ~28 units/period since P41. Manual inflation of mu_hat to >800 is required to bypass the backend pipeline deduction logic.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised by phantom in-transit inventory. As of Period 50, 'In-transit' shows 850 units, but historical evidence suggests the vast majority are lost (specifically P2, P17, P19, P30, P37, and likely P44-P47). Actual viable pipeline is near zero. Demand has shifted lower, averaging ~25 units/period over the last 9 periods (P41-P49). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 850-unit 'in-transit' blockage, I must set mu_hat to a value significantly higher than the phantom inventory. I am inflating mu_hat to 1050 (850 phantom + ~200 buffer for 3-period demand) to ensure stock replenishment for the final period context, and setting L to 2 to reflect the promised lead time and calculate sigma based on the recent lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Supply Chain Blockage: Approximately 850 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost or phantom. Recent demand (P41-P49) has stabilized at a lower mean of ~25 units/period. Manual inflation of mu_hat to >900 is required to bypass the backend pipeline logic.
