Historical data shows demand increasing rapidly: P1: 107, P2: 252, P3: 298, P4: 376, P5: 544. This indicates a strong upward trend or a growth phase. The average demand across these 5 samples is ~315, but the most recent period (P5) reached 544. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, an order placed now (P1) will arrive at the start of Period 4 (Decision for P4). I need to cover demand for P1, P2, and P3 to start, but since arrivals happen after the decision phase, I must ensure I have enough to cover the pipeline. To address the immediate stockout and the high growth trend, I will target a high initial stock. Assuming demand continues to climb or stabilizes near P5 levels (500-600 units), I need to account for at least 3 periods of demand (P1, P2, P3) while awaiting this order. However, since I start with 0, I am already at a disadvantage. I will order 1200 units to cover approximately average demand for the next 3-4 periods (roughly 400/period) while accounting for the growth trend observed in the history.",

With demand averaging ~1200-1300 and expected to grow, target inventory for (L+1)=3 periods should be ~4200 units (allowing for growth and safety stock). Current effective pipeline is 1500 + 1800 + 3200 = 6500 units. Since 6500 > 4200, the pipeline is sufficiently saturated for the next few periods.

Given that the L+1 demand (Period 15 and 16 forecasted at ~1400 each) totals ~2800 units and the expected arrivals total 5000+ units over the same window, ordering more now would lead to excessive holding costs ($1/unit) once the backlog arrives.
