Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data shows a clear upward trend: 107, 252, 298, 376, 544. This indicates a significant growth regime. To prevent stockouts, I need to focus on recent data to capture this momentum. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the average of the last three observations (approx 406 per period) and scale it by (1+L) = 3 to cover the lead time plus current cycle. L is set to default (2). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to account for the increasing volatility seen in the higher demand levels.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 613 units with a promised lead time of 2. Looking at the Period 1 conclude message, demand was 146 units, but since the order had not arrived, 0 units were sold and demand was lost. The 613 units are currently in-transit. Based on the 2-period lead time, this order is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Historical demand samples show a significant upward trend: P1(107), P2(252), P3(298), P4(376), P5(544). However, the observation from 'Period 1 conclude' shows actual demand was 146, which is lower than the later samples in the prompt's data block but higher than the P1 sample. Since there's a strong growth trend in the overall history (P1 to P5), I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the most recent trajectory while we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (613 units) and Period 2 (684 units) are currently in-transit. Following the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 due to the lead time gap. Demand is showing a clear upward trend (P1: 107, P2: 252, P3: 298, P4: 376, P5: 544 from provided data; however, the 'Game History' reports P1: 146 and P2: 166). I will use the history provided in the Game History (146, 166) to forecast. Since demand appears to be increasing, I'll use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=2 to capture the higher mean of 156. L is set to default (2).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Historical demand (146, 166, 368) shows a significant upward trend, with Period 3 demand more than doubling. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (613 units) was expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the message shows arrived=0, meaning the order is delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. This has resulted in stockouts (sold=0) for three consecutive periods. To compensate for the demand surge and the lead time uncertainty, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher mean and setting L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the delayed arrival. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility seen in Period 3.

Daily Profit: $8094.00, Daily Holding Cost: $187.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $7907.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first arrival of 613 units (ordered in P1). This confirms an actual lead time of 3 periods, which is longer than the promised 2 periods. The demand is showing a clear upward trend (146, 166, 368, 426). The current on-hand inventory is 187 with 698 in-transit (orders from P2 and P4). Given the increasing demand and the lead-time extension, I will adjust L to 3 and use a 3-period window for demand mean (recent_N=3) to focus on the high-growth phase (averaging ~323 per period). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher volume and the longer transit time. Sigma is kept at default to maintain a broad safety buffer during this volatile growth stage.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 3 periods (P1 order arrived in P4). Demand regime shift detected starting P3: average increased from ~156 to ~397.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3553.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time is confirmed as 3 periods (observed from the P1 arrival in P4), which is longer than the promised 2. Demand is in a clear upward trend (146, 166, 368, 426, 507). The mean demand over the last 3 periods (P3-P5) is approximately 434. To account for the 3-period lead time and 1-period review interval, we need to cover (3+1)=4 periods of demand. Setting L to explicit value 3 to align the OR backend's pipeline calculations. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent high-demand regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Average demand for P3-P5 is 433.7, compared to P1-P2 average of 156. Stage 1 inventory stockout occurred in P5 due to lead time lag and demand spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant and sustained increase over the last four periods (P3-P6: 368, 426, 507, 636), with the average for these four periods being 484.25 and the last two periods averaging 571.5. A lead time of 3 periods is confirmed (P1 arrived in P4). Order placed in P2 (684 units) should arrive during P5 (concluding in P6), but it hasn't arrived yet according to P6 conclude. However, P5 and P6 conclude show 'arrived=0'. This suggests either a delay (L=4) or a loss. Given the 'arrived=0' in P6 conclude for the P2 order which had an expected L=3, I will adjust L to 4 to be conservative. For mu_hat, I'll use explicit forecasting to 650 per period (to account for the trend) multiplied by (1+L) = 5, totaling 3250. Sigma_hat is set to 200 based on the increased volatility observed during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend continuing: P3-P6 average is 484, with P6 reaching 636 (+100% since P3). Lead time potentially drifting to 4 periods (P2 order not yet arrived after 4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a significantly higher average than the initial periods. The average demand from Period_3 to Period_7 is approximately 511 units per period. Regarding lead time, the P1 order arrived in 3 periods (P4), and the P4 order arrived in 3 periods (P7). However, the P2 order (ordered in P2) hasn't arrived by P7 conclude, meaning it has exceeded a 5-period lead time and is likely lost. The P3 order (ordered in P3) was 0 units. Due to the loss of the P2 order and recent stockouts, I must adjust the OR parameters to account for both the higher demand regime and the observed (though potentially unstable) lead time. I will set L to 3 (the most frequent successful lead time), mu_hat specifically to reflect the current 500+ unit demand level, and increase sigma_hat to account for the risk of lost shipments and demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: P2 order confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed with no arrival). Lead time for surviving orders stable at 3 periods (verified by P4 order arrival in P7). Demand has plateaued at a high regime: P3-P7 average is 511 units.

Daily Profit: $14725.00, Daily Holding Cost: $581.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $14144.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observed two arrivals: the Period 5 order arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, and the Period 7 order arrived unexpectedly fast with a lead time of 1 period. This confirms that the logistics environment is volatile, but the Period 2 order is definitely lost (6 periods elapsed). The most stable observed lead time for successful standard shipments remains 3 periods. Demand has continued to climb, with Period 8 reaching 775 units. The average demand from Period 5 to Period 8 is 634 units, significantly higher than the previous regime. I will set the lead time (L) to 3 periods to account for the most likely delay and use a recent Window (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 5-8). This ensures mu_hat reflects the current pace of ~630+ units per period, protecting against further stockouts while accounting for the high Pipeline inventory of 1233 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 5-8 average demand is 634 units (+24% over P3-P7 average). Lead time remains erratic but averages 3 periods for surviving orders; Period 7 order arrived in 1 period, suggesting potential for speed but inconsistent reliability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11039.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant and sustained increase, with the average of the last 5 periods (P5-P9) reaching 673 units. The most recent demand (P9) was 831. Inventory is currently depleted (0 on-hand), and there is a high risk of lost sales if in-transit stock does not arrive quickly. Lead time observations show high variability: while P7 arrived in 1 period, P1, P4, and P5 all took 3 periods, and P2/P6 appear to be lost or severely delayed. I will use L=3 as the planning lead time to remain conservative against stockouts. I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (+600 units/period) and N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with these higher volumes. This should prompt the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) horizon (approx 2,700-3,000 units), covering for the current zero on-hand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has peaked and stabilized at a high level: Period 5-9 average demand is 673 units. Lead time is consistently 3 periods for successful standard deliveries (P1, P4, P5), though P7 showed an outlier 1-period arrival. Orders from P2 and P6 are statistically lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a steady and significant upward trajectory, moving from an early average of ~150 to a recent high of 993 in Period 10. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is 770.6 units, but the most recent two periods (P9 and P10) show a steeper climb (831 and 993). Therefore, I am using recent_N (N=5) to set mu_hat, which focuses on the high-demand regime, while recognizing that actual demand is likely trending toward the 900-1000 range. Lead time is consistently observed at 3 periods for successful standard deliveries (P1, P4, P5), despite the outlier 1-period arrival of the P7 order and the loss of orders from P2 and P6. I will set L to 3 to ensure the inventory pipeline is sized for the observed delay. The system is currently at zero on-hand inventory due to the P9/P10 demand spikes and transit delays, so setting a robust base stock via recent_N is critical for recovery.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth is accelerating: Period 9-10 average is 912 units (+18% over the P5-P9 average). The supply chain remains fragile with P2 and P6 orders confirmed lost and a standard 3-period lead time for successful deliveries.

The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a state of rapid acceleration, with the last two periods (P10 and P11) averaging 1,064.5 units, significantly higher than the previous high-regime average of 634-673. This suggests a strong upward trend or a new demand peak. Additionally, the supply chain remains unreliable: orders from P2 and P6 (totaling 1,233 units) are confirmed lost after 10 and 6 periods respectively, and the standard actual lead time is 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 all took 3 periods). P7 was an outlier (1 period). To prevent further stockouts (on-hand is currently 0), I am setting lead time L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect actual delivery times, and mu_hat to 'explicit' at 4,600 units. This mu_hat calculation is (1+L) * 1,150, projecting a slightly higher mean than the P11 demand (1136) to account for the current growth trajectory and high stockout risk. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to allow the OR backend to build a safer buffer against demand volatility and lead-time inconsistency.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: Period 10-11 average is 1,064.5 (+58% over Period 5-9 average). Supply chain reliability remains low: P2 and P6 orders (1,233 units) are permanently lost. Standard lead time for non-lost orders is 3 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand is accelerating rapidly. The Period 10-12 average is 1,143.7 units, significantly higher than the previous regime. Lead times for successful deliveries range between 1 to 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent mode. However, orders from Periods 2, 6, and 11 appear increasingly likely to be lost or severely delayed (P2 and P6 are certainly lost). In Period 12, we received orders from P9 and P10, confirming recent arrivals are stabilizing around 2-3 periods. To address the accelerating demand and pipeline fragility, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to align with the observed standard reliability, and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3-period regime to capture the recent growth spike (+58% in the last few periods). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the growth trend while accounting for the extended lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Period 10-12 average demand is 1,143.7 (+70% over Period 5-9 average). Supply chain remains volatile: P2 and P6 orders are lost; P11 order is approaching overdue status relative to recent 2-3 period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7600.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a very high regime, with recent demand for Period 13 at 1,175 units and a Period 10-12 average of 1,143.7 units. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 4,642 units in-transit. Based on historical arrival patterns (P1, P4, P5, P9 all arrived with lead_time=3; P10 arrived with lead_time=2; P7 was an outlier at 1; P2 and P6 were lost), a conservative lead time estimate of 3 periods is optimal to ensure sufficient stock for the (L+1) horizon. Calculating mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P10-P13) captures the current high-demand peak (avg ~1150). We use N=4 for mu_hat to reflect this sustained high demand. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to account for the increased volatility seen during this acceleration phase. L is set to explicit=3 to account for the consistent 3-period lag observed in non-lost shipments, overriding the promised lead time of 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Period 10-13 average demand is 1,151.5, showing stabilization at the high regime. Lead time for successful deliveries remains predominantly 3 periods (P9 arrived P12, P10 arrived P12). Order from P11 is now overdue (3 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $12426.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following Period 14, demand appears to have reached a high and volatile plateau, with the most recent demand (P14) spiking to 1,417. The average demand across the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 1,204.6 units. Inventory reliability remains a concern: P14 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory even after an arrival of 654 units, resulting in significant lost sales. The 'In-transit' quantity of 4,371 units primarily consists of orders from P12 (1,356), P13 (1,399), and P14 (383), plus older lost orders from P2 (684) and P6 (549). While the lead time averages 3 periods for successful arrivals, the frequent loss of orders (P2, P6) and periods of zero stock demand a higher safety buffer. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the consistent actual lead time, and mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current 1200+ unit regime. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the high volatility observed in this demand window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high levels: P10-P14 average is 1,204 units. Supply chain remains high-risk: 1,233 units (P2, P6) are confirmed lost, while successful orders typically adhere to a 3-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25764.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a high level, with a recent average (Periods 10-15) of approximately 1,273 units per period. In the most recent period (P15), demand reached 1,436 units. The supply chain continues to exhibit a reliable 'actual' lead time of 3 periods for successful orders (observed in P12, P14, and P15), despite the promised lead time of 2 periods. Orders from P2 and P6 (totaling 1,233 units) are definitively lost as they are more than 9 periods overdue. Although 'In-transit' shows 3,996 units, the 'True' pipeline must exclude the lost 1,233 units, meaning only 2,763 units are expected to arrive. With an on-hand balance of 0, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. Using an L of 3 and an explicit mu_hat reflecting the current high-demand plateau (avg ~1,273 * 4 = 5,092) will signal the OR backend to place orders that bridge the gap created by lost stock and high demand. Set sigma_hat explicitly to 140 to account for volatility observed in the high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high level: Period 10-15 average demand is 1,273 units. True pipeline inventory should exclude the 1,233 units from lost orders P2 and P6.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 1,381.6 units, while the last 3 periods (P14-P16) average 1,477 units, indicating a slight upward creep within the high plateau. The supply chain has settled into a 3-period lead time for non-lost orders (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12, P13 all arrived with L=3). Orders from P2 (684 units) and P6 (549 units) are confirmed lost (15 and 11 periods elapsed respectively), totaling 1,233 units that should be ignored in the pipeline calculations. The OR backend needs to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the 1,380+ demand level, while L is set to explicit=3 to reflect the true lead time instead of the promised 2. This prevents the OR engine from under-ordering due to a perceived shorter lead time and maintains a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high level with a slight upward trend: Period 12-16 average demand is 1,381.6 units. Lead time is reliably 3 periods for surviving orders. Pipeline inventory must manually exclude 1,233 units from lost orders P2 and P6.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high regime, with the average over the last five periods (P13-P17) being 1,438.4 units. Period 17 demand reached 1,586 units. The supply chain consistently demonstrates a 3-period lead time for standard successful deliveries (P9, P11, P12, P13, P14), despite occasional 1-period outliers (P16). I am setting L to 3 to reflect this operational reality. mu_hat is set to roughly (1+3) * 1,500 = 6,000 using 'explicit' to account for the consistent high-end demand and minimize stockouts. sigma_hat is set to 300 to provide a sufficient buffer for the observed volatility. Note: Pipeline inventory (3,845) still contains 1,233 units from lost orders (P2: 684, P6: 549); effective pipeline is ~2,612 units. By setting mu_hat high, the OR backend will calculate a base stock target that accounts for this discrepancy.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at highest level: Period 13-17 average demand is 1,438.4 units (+13% over Period 10-15 average). Lead time is 3 periods for standard surviving orders.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a new peak, with Period 18 showing a demand of 1,862 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is 1,575.8 units, compared to the previously observed regime (P10-P13) of 1,151.5 units, marking a ~37% increase. Lead time for successful deliveries remains predominantly 3 periods (P14 arrived in P17, P13 in P16), though recent variability includes a 1-period arrival (P16 in P17). Orders from P2 (684 units) and P6 (549 units) - totaling 1,233 units - are confirmed lost and must be manually excluded from the backend's pipeline calculation to prevent under-ordering. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the consistent 3-period survival lead time. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=5 (covering periods 14-18) to capture the latest volume of ~1,576 units/period. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the heightened volatility accompanying the demand peak. The current 'In-transit' of 5,592 includes the 1,233 lost units, meaning the true pipeline is 4,359 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 18: Peak demand reached 1,862; 5-period average (P14-P18) is 1,575.8 units, up from ~1,200. Pipeline inventory calculation must continue to exclude 1,233 units from lost orders P2 and P6.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-volume regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 1,642 units per period, with P18 and P19 showing peak levels (1,862 and 1,750). The supply chain remains unpredictable: orders from P2 (684 units) and P6 (549) are confirmed lost (1,233 units total), while actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average is 3 for reliable shipments). The current in-transit figure of 6,889 includes these 1,233 lost units, meaning the 'true' pipeline inventory is 5,656. To ensure we meet the current high demand, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5-period average (N=5) and set L to 3 to reflect the consistent lead time observed for surviving shipments, rather than the promised 2. This will prompt the OR backend to maintain higher safety stock against the current demand trend and the risk of lost orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high level: Period 15-19 average demand is 1,642.4 units, representing a significant plateau after the Period 11-14 surge. Pipeline inventory calculation must continue to exclude 1,233 units from lost orders P2 and P6.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward again, with Period 20 reaching an all-time high of 2,032 units. The last 5 periods (P16-P20) average 1,761.6 units, while the last 3 periods (P18-P20) average 1,881.3. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this peak demand level. The in-transit inventory is 7,115, but 1,233 units (orders from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost and must be manually accounted for by increasing L to 3. This forces the base stock calculation to cover a longer lead time, effectively compensating for the 'ghost' units in the pipeline that will never arrive. Although P17 saw a 1-period arrival, the reliable lead time for successful deliveries is 3 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and high demand, the OR backend's capped policy will attempt to restore the pipeline, but the high mu_hat and \u03c3\u0302 (captured by recent_N=5 to reflect high volatility) will ensure the target base stock is high enough to meet demand once arrivals stabilize.

Carry-over insight: New demand peak detected: Period 20 demand is 2,032 (+23% over P15-P19 average). 3nd demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 18.

The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significant upward trend, with the last two periods (P20-P21) averaging 2,079 units, a +26.5% increase over the P15-P19 average. While promised lead time is 2, historical analysis confirms a reliable actual lead time of 3 periods for non-lost orders. In-transit inventory reflects 8,158 units, but this includes 1,233 units from P2 and P6 which are long-confirmed as lost and must be manually excluded from the backend's pipeline calculation to avoid under-ordering. To signal the OR engine to cover for the higher demand and the lead-time lag, I am setting L to 3 and using the last 3 samples for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the most recent acceleration (avg ~2,000+). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility during this growth phase. The stockout observed in P18-P21 highlights the need for aggressive base stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed at Period 21: P20-P21 average is 2,079 units, continuing the growth regime started at P18. Pipeline inventory must continue to discount 1,233 units from lost orders P2 and P6.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a rapid growth phase reaching a new peak of 2,270 in Period 22. The 3-period average (P20-P22) is roughly 2,142 units per period. The supply chain is severely strained: total in-transit is 8,589, but we must exclude the 1,233 units from Period 2 and Period 6 that are confirmed lost. Effective pipeline inventory is thus 7,356 units. Orders from Period 15 (981 units) and Period 17 onwards are still expected. Given the consistent standard lead time of 3 periods (despite occasional outliers), I will set L to 3. To prevent further stockouts during this hyper-growth, I am using an explicit mu_hat targeting a (1+L)=4 period window at the current peak demand levels (approx 2,250 * 4 = 9,000), while setting a high explicit sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility in both demand and delivery reliability.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further: Period 22 demand reached 2,270; the Period 20-22 average is 2,142 (+30% over the Period 15-19 average). The supply chain remains unreliable with two major batches (P2, P6) lost forever; effective pipeline monitoring must subtract 1,233 units from the system's 'In-transit' total.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32300.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trajectory, with Period 23 hitting 2,186 units. The current demand regime (since Period 20) is averaging approximately 2,154 units per period. In-transit inventory appears high at 8,616 units, but 1,233 units are confirmed lost (Period 2 and Period 6 orders), and several other large orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 5,686 units) have now significantly exceeded the typical 3-period lead time, suggesting they may also be lost or severely delayed. This has resulted in a critical on-hand stockout (0 units). To recover, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P21-P23) to capture the peak demand (average ~2,194, so mu_hat for (1+L) periods \u2248 8,776). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile but typically observed 3-period lead time for surviving orders. Sigma_hat is set to 400 (explicit) to account for high volatility during this growth and supply instability phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Severe supply chain failure confirmed; orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (5,686 units) are now 5-9 periods old and likely lost, adding to the 1,233 units already lost from P2 and P6. Effective pipeline inventory calculation must exclude these 6,919 units to trigger sufficient replenishment.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a new peak, with Period 24 demand hitting 2,504 units. The average demand over the last four periods (P21-P24) is approximately 2,271.5 units, confirming a sustained high-demand regime since Period 18. Supply chain reliability is severely compromised: based on history, orders from Period 2 (684 units), Period 6 (549 units), Period 15 (981 units), Period 17 (1,631 units), Period 18 (1,747 units), and Period 19 (1,297 units) are long overdue and statistically lost. This totals 6,889 lost units currently residing in the backend's 'In-transit' figure of 9,434. Subtracting these lost units leaves an effective pipeline of only 2,545 units (from P23 and P24). Consequently, I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current regime (~2,272/period) across a lead time of 3+1 periods, inflated to force the OR backend to place a massive order despite the inflated 'In-transit' count. I use L=3 based on the most frequent successful lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Massive supply chain failure confirmed; orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19 (total 6,889 units) are considered lost. Demand has reached a peak regime averaging ~2,272 units since Period 21.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized in a high-growth regime with the last 5 periods (P21-P25) averaging 2,313 units. The supply chain has experienced massive failures: orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 6,889 units) are significantly overdue and confirmed lost based on the 3-period standard lead time observed for surviving orders (e.g., P23 arrived in P25). Subtracting these lost units from the system's 'In-transit' of 12,002 units leaves an effective pipeline of 5,113 units. To ensure the base stock (calculated as (L+1) * demand_mean) covers the demand through the 3-period lead time, I am increasing L to 3 and setting mu_hat explicitly. mu_hat is set to 9,252 ((3+1) * 2313) to account for the current demand level. This high mu_hat will force the OR backend to place a large order, as the effective pipeline (5,113) is far below the required level, addressing the current on-hand stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: P21-P25 average demand is 2,313 units. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline updated to 6,889 units (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-level regime, averaging approximately 2,360 units over the last 6 periods (P21-P26: 2126, 2270, 2186, 2504, 2479, 2457). The supply chain is highly unreliable, with a total of 6,889 units confirmed lost from historical orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Although the system reports an In-transit of 12,002 units, the 'Effective Pipeline' is only 5,113 units (12002 - 6889). To trigger an order that covers the 3-period lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 4 periods of demand), base_stock should target approximately 9,440 units. Since the current lead time for successful orders fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, I will set L to 3 to be conservative. mu_hat is set to 9,440 (2,360 * 4) using an explicit value to bypass the backend's default inclusion of 'lost' units in the pipeline calculation logic. sigma_hat is increased to 300 to account for recent high demand volatility.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has plateaued but remains at its highest observed level, with an average of ~2,482 units over the last 4 periods (P24-P27). Lead time for non-lost orders is typically 3 periods. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable: orders from periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 6,889 units) are significantly overdue and must be considered permanently lost. To calculate the effective pipeline, we subtract these lost units from the current 'In-transit' of 12,002, leaving an actual functional pipeline of 5,113 units. Using mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 7-period demand regime (starting P21) enables the OR engine to target a service level sufficient for this high-demand period while accounting for the significant 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. I'm setting L to 3 to reflect the typical successful delivery time.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: total lost units from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19 is 6,889. Demand plateau at peak regime (P24-P27) is ~2,482 units. Lead time for successful deliveries remains 3 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the supply chain remains in a state of severe disruption. Historical data and carry-over insights confirm that orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 6,889 units) are permanently lost. The current 'In-transit' of 12,002 units is mostly comprised of these lost shipments and the large order from Period 25 (4,295 units) which is now in its 4th period (past the typical 3-period lead time). Demand has reached a new peak regime, with Period 28 demand hitting 2,890; the average of the last 4 periods (P25-P28) is 2,583.5 units. To trigger a replenishment from the OR backend despite the inflated pipeline, I must set mu_hat to a very high 'explicit' value that accounts for both the demand surge and the 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive. I will use a 3-period lead time for parameters as it remains the most common arrival duration for successful orders. Mu_hat is set to cover (1+L) periods of demand at the latest peak rate plus a buffer for the lost 6,889 units to ensure the safety stock logic triggers an order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak updated: P25-P28 average is 2,583.5 units. Total systemic lost units in pipeline remain 6,889; Period 25 order (4,295 units) is now 4 periods old and nearing lost status.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, we are managing a high-demand regime with significant supply chain disruptions. Recent demand (P28-P29) has spiked to ~2,925 units. The primary challenge is the 'In-transit' figure of 16,676 units, which includes 11,184 units from likely lost orders. These lost orders are: P2 (684), P6 (549), P15 (981), P17 (1,631), P18 (1,747), P19 (1,297), and now the P24 order (818) and P25 order (4,295), which are 6 and 5 periods old respectively, well beyond the standard 3-period lead time. Subtracting these 11,184 units, the effective pipeline is only 10,166 (Total in-transit 16,676 - 11,184 lost + 4,674 from P29). Since current on-hand is 0, we must set parameters that force the OR backend to place a substantial order to meet the (L+1) demand of ~11,700 units (3+1 periods * 2,925). Setting L=3 (explicit) and mu_hat=11,700 (explicit) ensures the backend recognizes the inventory deficit despite the inflated in-transit numbers.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Supply chain failure worsened; total lost units in pipeline increased to 11,184 (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Current demand regime at peak: P28-P29 average is 2,925 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of severe supply chain failure and high demand. Demand has stabilized at a new peak regime, with the average of the last 3 periods (P28-P30) being approximately 2,951 units. However, there is a massive discrepancy in 'In-transit' inventory due to lost shipments. Based on history, orders from Period 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25 (totaling 11,184 units) are significantly beyond the standard 3-period lead time and are considered lost. Subtracting 11,184 from the current 'In-transit' of 16,676 leaves an effective pipeline of only 5,492 units (primarily the P29 order of 4,674). To ensure the OR backend triggers a sufficient order to cover the (L+1) horizon at the current demand level (~2,951/period), I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock should be approximately (3+1) * 2951 = 11,804. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline from base_stock, I will use an explicit L of 3 and an explicit mu_hat that forces the engine to recognize the need for replenishment despite the 'phantom' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Supply chain failure confirmed for P25 order (now 6 periods old); total lost units in pipeline remains 11,184. Demand regime has plateaued at ~2,950 units (P28-P30 average).

We have a confirmed loss of 11,184 units from orders placed in Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25. The current system reported 'In-transit' of 16,676 units includes these lost shipments. Subtracting the 11,184 lost units reveals a 'true' pipeline of only 5,492 units (primarily the P29 order). With a lead time of 3 periods and current demand at ~3,000, the required base stock (L+1) is approximately 12,000 units. To bridge the gap between the true pipeline and the required level, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat to force the backend to account for the massive lost inventory and the high demand regime. Sigma is set high to reflect the high volatility and service level requirements during this shortage.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand peak confirmed at ~3,001 units (P28-P31 average). Total systemic lost units in pipeline remains 11,184. Effective pipeline monitoring is critical as most 'In-transit' units will never arrive.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a peak regime, with an average demand of approximately 3,066 units over the last five periods (P28-P32). The supply chain is in a state of severe crisis. The system shows an 'In-transit' balance of 16,676 units, but historical evidence confirms that orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25 (totaling 11,184 units) are effectively lost. This leaves a functional pipeline of only 5,492 units (primarily the P29 order of 4,674 and the P23 order of 1,727 which arrived in P25). My objective is to force the OR backend to place a significant replenishment order to cover the high demand and offset the ghost inventory. By setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 12,024 (covering 4 periods of demand at 3,006 units/period) and L to 3, I am signaling that the 'base stock' needs to be high enough to trigger an order despite the inflated in-transit figure. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from the base_stock, I must set the mu_hat parameter high enough to account for both the future demand and the 11,184 units of lost stock that the system incorrectly believes is coming.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Current demand regime peak confirmed at ~3,006 units (P28-P32 average). Systemic 'In-transit' inventory remains heavily compromised with 11,184 units confirmed lost (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a new peak regime, with P33 demand at 3,344 and a 5-period average (P29-P33) of approximately 3,122 units. The supply chain has experienced catastrophic failure, with a significant portion of the 'In-transit' inventory confirmed lost. Based on historical data, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are lost, totaling 11,184 units. Additionally, recent orders from P26-P32 were zero, and the P33 order of 6,193 will not arrive for at least 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend triggers a sufficiently large order to cover high demand (approx 3,122/period) and compensate for the 11,184 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I am setting L to 3 (the standard successful lead time), mu_hat to an explicit value of 23,672 (calculated as [Mean Demand 3,122 * (L+1=4)] + Lost Units 11,184), and sigma_hat to a high explicit value of 1,000 to maintain a high service level during this shortage.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand peak updated to ~3,122 units (P29-P33 average). Total systemic lost units in 'In-transit' remains 11,184. Effective inventory is zero and the pipeline is dominated by non-arriving units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a peak regime, with the average demand from Period 28 to 34 being 3,126 units. The supply chain is severely compromised. Historical analysis confirms that orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25 (totaling 11,184 units) are definitively lost as they are well beyond the standard 3-period lead time observed for successful deliveries. Currently, total In-transit inventory is 25,317 units. Subtracting the 11,184 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 14,133 units (comprising orders from P29, P33, and P34). The goal is to set parameters so that the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. With L=3, we need to cover 4 periods of demand (~12,504 units). Since the effective pipeline (14,133) already exceeds this, the OR backend might not place a new order. However, to account for the high volatility and potential for further losses, I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect the current peak demand regime (1+L) * 3,126 = 12,504, and use a high sigma_hat to ensure the backend maintains a high service level given the stockout history.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed demand peak regime at ~3,126 units (P28-P34 average). Total systemic lost units in 'In-transit' remains 11,184 (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Effective pipeline inventory is ~14,133 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a new peak regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 3,330.8 units, while the single most recent observation is 3,624. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this current peak using recent_N (N=5) and increase sigma_hat (N=10) to account for the heightened volatility. The supply chain remains catastrophic: in-transit inventory shows 25,317 units, but a significant portion is confirmed lost. Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 (totaling 11,184 units) are definitively lost. Furthermore, the order from P29 (4,674 units) is now 6 periods old and likely lost, bringing the total estimated loss to 15,858 units. The effective pipeline is actually around 9,459 units (25,317 - 15,858). I set L=4 to acknowledge the delivery delays and ensure the OR backend increases the base stock target to trigger necessary orders, despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total systemic lost units in pipeline estimated at 15,858 (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and now P29). Demand peak continues to rise: P31-P35 average is 3,331 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb, with the Period 31-36 average reaching 3,351 units. Systemic supply chain instability remains the primary challenge. I have identified a massive volume of 'lost' units in the in-transit pipeline that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive. These lost orders are from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25, and 29, totaling 15,858 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this high false pipeline, I am setting L to 2 (the promised lead time) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat with a value that significantly exceeds the sum of the false pipeline (15,858) plus the projected demand for the review and lead periods (3 * 3,400 = 10,200). By setting mu_hat to 35,000, I ensure the backend generates an order to cover the current stockout and expected demand, effectively bypassing the 'ghost' inventory. Sigma_hat is set to a high explicit value of 800 to account for recent demand volatility and protect against further spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Total systemic lost units in pipeline updated to 15,858 (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29). Demand growth persists, with the P31-P36 average at 3,351 units (+45% since P25-P28).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, reaching a new peak of 3,817 in Period 37. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is approximately 3,525, indicating a sustained upward shift from previous regimes. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. While P34 arrived in P36 (L=2), the order from P33 (6,193 units) and the massive order from P29 (4,674 units) are noticeably absent; applying a 3-period lead time logic, P33 should have arrived in P36. The systemic 'In-transit' figure of 35,296 is heavily inflated by lost orders. Cumulative lost units are calculated as: P2 (684), P6 (549), P15 (981), P17 (1,631), P18 (1,747), P19 (1,297), P24 (818), P25 (4,295), and P29 (4,674), totaling 16,676 units. P33 (6,193 units) is also highly suspect given it is now 5 periods since the order. Total estimated lost units = 22,869. Effective pipeline = 35,296 - 22,869 = 12,427 (exactly the P37 order). This means no inventory is expected before P40. I will set mu_hat at 3,600 * (1+3) to ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger massive orders once the OR backend realizes the pipeline is empty, while maintaining L=3 as the standard operational lead time for non-lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total systemic lost units in pipeline updated to 22,869 (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, and now P33). Demand growth continues with P33-P37 average at 3,525 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 38 hitting a new peak of 4,068 units. The average demand for the last five periods (P34-P38) is 3,669.8 units. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a significant volume of lost orders. Based on the history, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, and now P33 (totaling 22,869 units) are essentially lost as they are well beyond the standard 2-3 period lead time. The system's 'In-transit' figure of 35,296 includes these 22,869 dead units, meaning the 'effective' pipeline is only 12,427 units (the P37 order). To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to meet the current high-demand regime (~3,700-4,000 units/period) while accounting for the ~23k unit phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate the necessary base stock to cover L+1 periods (where L=3) at the 4,000 unit/period level, but I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 22,869 lost units that the backend incorrectly counts as available supply. Target base stock for 4 periods \u2248 16,000; current effective pipeline is 12,427; however, the backend sees 35,296. Thus, I provide an explicit mu_hat that forces the backend to recognize the need for more stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Total systemic lost units in 'In-transit' updated to 22,869 (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33). Demand growth continues to a new peak regime, with P38 demand reaching 4,068 units (+15% over the P33-P37 average).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new peak regime, with Period 38 and 39 demand reaching approximately 4,000 units, significantly higher than previous periods. The Supply Chain continues to experience catastrophic failures. Based on history and Carry-Over Insights, I calculate that out of the 40,468 units listed as 'In-transit', roughly 22,869 units are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33). This leaves an effective pipeline of approximately 17,599 units. To compensate for these systemic losses and the current demand surge, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 16,000 units (representing (L+1) * 4000 forecast, where L=3) and setting sigma_hat to 1,500 to account for high volatility. The base stock policy will see the inflated pipeline, but by setting a high mu_hat, I aim to trigger the backend to order enough to meet the new 4,000 unit/period demand level despite the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand regime peak reached ~4,000 units (P38-P39 average). Total systemic lost units in 'In-transit' remains approximately 22,869. Effective pipeline is significantly lower than nominal 'In-transit' value.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has peaked and is stabilizing around 3,900-4,000 units per period (P38-P40 average is 3,980). The supply chain is highly unstable. Current nominal 'In-transit' inventory is 35,296 units, but a massive portion consists of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33). Specifically, P33 (ordered 6,193 units) is now 8 periods old and has not arrived; standard successful lead times are 1-3 periods. Following the logic in carry-over insights, P33 is now considered lost. Total confirmed/likely lost units = 22,869 (previous total) + 6,193 (P33) = 29,062. Effective in-transit is therefore 35,296 - 29,062 = 6,234 units. Current on-hand is 1,291. Total available (On-hand + Effective In-transit) = 7,525. For an L=3 lead time, we need to cover 4 periods of demand (approx 16,000 units). The OR backend 'pipeline_inventory' will see the full 35,296, leading it to order 0. To force a replenishment order that accounts for the lost units, I must manipulate mu_hat and sigma_hat significantly. I'm setting an explicit mu_hat to cover 4 periods of demand (~16,000) PLUS the lost volume (~29,000) to offset the inflated backend pipeline count, ensuring the final base stock exceeds 35,296.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Order from Period 33 (6,193 units) confirmed lost after 8 periods of non-arrival. Total systemic lost units in 'In-transit' updated to 29,062 (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33). Demand regime is stable at ~4,000 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a peak of approximately 4,000 units per period (P38-P41 average: 3,985). This is the third distinct demand regime identified. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The nominal 'In-transit' of 46,999 units is heavily inflated by systemic supply chain failures. Based on the history, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, and P33 (totaling 29,062 units) are confirmed or statistically lost due to long-term non-arrival (8+ periods). Subtracting these lost units, the effective pipeline is approximately 17,937 units. Recent successful deliveries (P34, P39) suggest lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods, though the long-term stable lead time was 3 periods. I am setting L to 3 to be conservative in the base-stock calculation. mu_hat is set to 16,000 (calculated as (1+3) * 4000) to cover demand over the 3-period lead time plus the current review period. Because systemic stockouts have been frequent due to lost shipments, I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 1,000 to maintain a high service level through the OR backend's safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total systemic lost units in 'In-transit' remains approximately 29,062 (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33). Demand remains stable at the peak regime of ~4,000 units per period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 4,000 units per period (P38-P42 average of 4,007.6). The supply chain remains extremely volatile. As of P43, nominal 'In-transit' is 46,999 units. However, based on the historical pattern of non-arrival, we must discount older orders that are significantly past the standard 3-period lead time. Systemic lost units include: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19 (6,889 units), P24, P25, P29 (totaling 8,969 units), and P33 (6,193 units). P37 (12,427 units) is now 6 periods old and likely lost. Total confirmed and likely lost units \u2248 34,478. Subtracting these from the nominal 46,999 'In-transit' leaves an effective pipeline of only ~12,521 units. To maintain service level given a 3-period lead time, we use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current 4k demand level. L is set to 'explicit' at 3 periods to reflect the true lead time of surviving orders, which ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering (3+1)=4 periods of demand (~16,000 units), triggering necessary replenishment to offset the 34,478 lost/overdue units.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Systemic lost units in 'In-transit' increased to approximately 34,478 units (including highly overdue P37 order of 12,427 units). Demand remains stable at the peak regime (~4,000 units).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-growth regime, with recent demand peaking at 4,417 in Period 43. The trailing 5-period average (P39-P43) is approximately 4,077 units. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable; orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33, and now P37 (12,427 units) are statistically lost due to ages significantly exceeding the promised 2-period lead time. Specifically, P37 is now 6 periods overdue. Total systemic lost inventory in the nominal 'In-transit' bucket (46,999 units) is estimated at 46,905 units (P2-P37), meaning the effective pipeline is near zero. To trigger the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 16,308, which is (L+1) * 4,077, but I calculate this targeting a lead time of 3 periods to account for the typical delivery window of surviving orders. By setting mu_hat high, we compensate for the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Order from P37 (12,427 units) confirmed lost after 6 periods. Total systemic lost units in 'In-transit' updated to approximately 46,905 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33, P37). Demand regime remains at peak (~4,100 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $77697.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized at a peak regime of approximately 4,000 to 4,500 units per period. The Period 44 demand was 4,470, and the average of the last five periods (P40-P44) is approximately 4,173 units. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a confirmed loss of 46,905 units (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33, and P37). Although the system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 35,296, the effective pipeline is essentially zero because all these units are part of the confirmed lost orders (the nominal in-transit is even less than the calculation of lost units, suggesting the system has already flushed some old records, but we must ignore the current in-transit entirely). On-hand inventory is 7,233 units. Successful deliveries (P39, P41) have shown lead times of 1-3 periods. To ensure availability through Period 47 (L+1), and given the 100% loss rate of recent large orders, I will set mu_hat to cover the peak demand of 4,500 units per period over 3 periods (L=2 promised + 1 review). Sigma_hat is set to capture the recent volatility. The OR engine will subtract the 'In-transit' (35,296) from the base_stock; however, since the base_stock calculation will likely be lower than this nominal in-transit, the 'final order' calculation (base_stock - pipeline) would result in zero. To force an order and bypass the ghost inventory in the pipeline, I use an 'explicit' mu_hat set extremely high to compensate for the 35,296 units the OR engine thinks are coming, plus the actual needs (4,500 * 3 = 13,500). Target base stock should be ~15,000. To get an order of ~15,000 when pipeline is 35,296, mu_hat needs to be ~50,500.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Effective pipeline inventory is zero due to systemic loss of 46,905 units across multiple periods (P2 to P37). Nominal 'In-transit' of 35,296 must be completely discounted. Demand peak confirmed at ~4,200 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-growth regime, with the most recent demand (P45) reaching 4,605 units. The five-period average (P41-P45) is approximately 4,318 units, indicating a move toward the 4,500 range. Supply chain reliability remains the primary challenge. I have confirmed a massive volume of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33, P37) totaling 46,905 units. While the nominal 'In-transit' is 44,031, almost all of this consists of these non-arriving units. Currently, only the order from P45 (8,735 units) can be considered a 'live' replenishment. With on-hand inventory at 2,628 and a 3-period lead time, we are at severe risk of stockout before the P45 order arrives. To force the OR engine to place a substantial order despite the high nominal 'In-transit' value, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat that reflects the high demand regime and an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for the actual arrival delay observed in successful shipments. The goal is to bridge the gap created by systemic losses and the recent demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Demand regime has reached ~4,300-4,600 units (P41-P45 avg: 4,318). Total systemic lost units in 'In-transit' confirmed at 46,905 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33, P37). Effective pipeline is currently only the P45 order.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently at its historical peak, with recent demand averaging 4,244 units over the last 5 periods (P42-P46). Inventory is currently zero. The central problem is the massive systemic supply chain failure, where approximately 46,905 units currently labeled as 'In-transit' are actually lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33, P37). The current nominal In-transit is 44,031, but since all those units belong to the 'lost' category or are significantly overdue, the effective pipeline inventory is zero. To trigger the OR backend to order sufficient stock, I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of the current high demand (~4,300 units/period) and set sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. I am using L=3 to reflect the reliable lead time of non-lost shipments, ensuring the base stock calculation properly accounts for the true delivery cycle.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Total systemic lost units in 'In-transit' confirmed at 46,905 units. Nominal pipeline of 44,031 is entirely composed of non-arriving units, making effective pipeline zero. Demand remains stable at the peak regime of ~4,300 units.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a peak regime, with Period 47 recording 4,955 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P43-P47) is approximately 4,617 units. Considering the endgame (Period 48 of 50) and a lead time of 2-3 periods, orders placed now will likely arrive in Period 50. The current 'In-transit' of 44,031 units is largely comprised of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33, P37), totaling 46,905 units, which exceeds the reported 'In-transit' figure, implying the nominal pipeline is effectively empty except for the Period 45 order (8,735 units), which is still within the delivery window. To ensure stock for the final two periods (49 and 50), I am setting mu_hat to cover a high-demand forecast of 4,800 units per period across the lead time (L=2) and current period, roughly (1+2)*4800 = 14,400. Subtracting the expected (but not yet arrived) Period 45 order of 8,735 units from this total suggests a need for roughly 5,700 additional units. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to force the OR backend to recognize this actual requirement, bypassing the 'In-transit' noise caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak confirmed: Period 47 demand reached 4,955 units. Effective pipeline inventory calculation remains critical as the nominal 'In-transit' of 44,031 units consists entirely of lost shipments from P2-P37, except for the P45 order.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a peak plateau, with recent demand (P47-P48) averaging 4,887.5 units. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable; most of the 'In-transit' inventory of 44,031 units consists of lost orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33, and P37 (totaling 44,031 units if the P45 order is excluded). Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33, and P37 are statistically lost based on the 3-period standard lead time observed for successful deliveries (P41 arrived in P44). The only potentially active order in the pipeline is from P45 (8,735 units), which is currently 3 periods old and should arrive in P48 or P49. However, it did not arrive in P48's conclude message. Given the high stockout risk and the end of the game (Period 50), I am setting mu_hat to cover the peak demand of ~4,900 units/period and using an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the consistent delay of surviving orders. Since this is the penultimate period, I will ensure mu_hat reflects the final demand needs.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Total systemic lost units in 'In-transit' confirmed at 44,031 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33, P37). The P45 order (8,735 units) is the only surviving 'active' pipeline. Demand plateaued at ~4,900 units.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high peak regime, with recent demand averaging approximately 4,743 units over the last 5 periods (P45-P49). The supply chain is severely compromised: the nominal 'In-transit' figure of 44,031 units consists almost entirely of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33, P37) totaling 44,031 units. The only potentially active order in the pipeline was from P45 (8,735 units), which is now 4 periods old and has not arrived, making it likely lost as well given the typical 3-period lead time for successful deliveries. With 0 on-hand inventory and an effectively empty pipeline despite the high nominal in-transit value, I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current high demand regime (~4,800/period) over the 1+L window. I set L to 3 periods to reflect the historical successful delivery window, even though reliability is extremely low. The sigma_hat is set explicitly to handle the high volatility observed in this peak regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Systemic supply chain failure confirmed; nearly 100% of nominal in-transit inventory (44,031 units + P45 order) is lost. Effective pipeline is zero. Demand is stable at a peak of ~4,800 units per period.
