(c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2. Orders placed now arrive in Period 3. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: Currently at 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. (e) Final Order Logic: Since I am starting at Period 1 and need to account for (L+1)=3 periods of demand to cover the pipeline, and considering the most recent demand was 544 with an upward trend, I need to order aggressively to catch up. Assuming demand might plateau or continue growing slightly, I'll estimate 3 periods of demand based on the average of the last two historical points (~460), leading to a target inventory of roughly 1380 units. I will order 1400 units to establish a baseline.",

The historical samples provided in the prompt suggest demand is scaling rapidly (doubling or more in early periods). c) Lead time: Promised is 2 periods. The order of 1400 placed in P1 is expected to arrive in P3 (P1 + 2 = P3). d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. In-transit is 1400 (from P1). We are currently in P2 decision phase. P2 demand will be lost as on-hand is 0. The 1400 units arriving in P3 will cover demand for P3, P4, and likely P5. e) Order logic: We must target enough stock to cover demand until the next possible arrival. If we order in P2, it arrives in P4. If we order in P3, it arrives in P5. Since 1400 units is roughly 10x the P1 demand, it provides a significant buffer for the immediate future. Given the rapid growth seen in the history preamble (reaching 544 by P5), I will wait one period to see the P2 demand result and the P3 arrival before committing more capital to holding costs, as 1400 units is already a substantial pipeline for a starting demand of 134.",

(b) Demand Analysis: History suggests demand is growing ~70-90 units per period. I estimate P3 demand at ~315, P4 at ~400, and P5 at ~490. (c) Lead Time: Promised L=2. Order placed in P1 (1400 units) is expected to arrive during P3 resolution and be visible in P4 start. (d) Inventory: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 1400.

Given the P6 shipment was lost, pipeline reliability is a concern. Order logic: To cover the growth trend and maintain a safety buffer against lead time volatility, I will target a pipeline position that covers the next 3-4 periods of demand plus safety stock. Current pipeline (On-hand 882 + In-transit 6300) = 7182 units. Expected demand for P14-P17 is ~6600. While the pipeline technically covers the immediate horizon, the risk of another lost shipment (like P6) and the rapid growth necessitate a continuous ordering strategy to prevent stockouts in P16-P17. I will order 1800 units to maintain the flow and match the projected demand of P17.",

While previously trending at +100 units per period, it appears more stabilized around the 3,700-3,800 range recently. Inventory status: On-hand is 2,446. Pipeline assessment: The P37 order of 5,000 units is currently 2 periods old and has not arrived; according to the history showing lead times of 1-3 periods and a risk of shipment loss, I must monitor this closely. Specifically, orders from P24, P25, P29, P30, and P33 were lost because they didn't arrive within 4-5 periods while later orders did. Currently, P37 (5000 units) is in the 'arriving soon' window (L=2 or 3). P39's order of 3,800 is also in transit. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1 safety), I need approximately 11,214 units (3,738 * 3). Current On-hand (2,446) + reasonably expected Pipeline (P37: 5,000 + P39: 3,800) = 11,246. This covers the window. However, because the system has a recurring pattern of losing 2-3 consecutive shipments every ~10 periods, and 2,446 stock is low against a 3,792 demand, I will place a conservative order to maintain flow without over-committing to holding costs if P37 arrives in Period 40.",
