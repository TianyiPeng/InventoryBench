Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0. Historical demand is provided for periods 1 through 5, although we are technically 'at' Period 1. Looking at the provided samples (30, 49, 48, 65, 56), the demand shows an upward trend or a higher mean than a typical start. The mean of these 5 samples is 49.6. Promised lead time (L) is 2. The base stock formula used by the OR backend targets a specific service level based on the critical ratio (Profit / (Profit + HoldingCost) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5). To ensure we cover demand during the (L+1) period window (3 periods), I will use the recent 5 available demand samples to calculate the forecast. This ensures that the order placed now (arriving in Period 3) accounts for the observed volatility and volume.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, an order of 71 units was placed, which is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (due to L=2). Demand in Period 1 was 50 units (historical data showed 30, but the 'conclude' message for Period 1 shows actual demand of 50). All Period 1 demand was lost/unsold as starting inventory was 0. Given the demand history [30, 49, 48, 65, 56] and the actual Period 1 result of 50, demand seems relatively stable around a mean of ~50. Since we have no on-hand inventory and the first order won't arrive until Period 3, the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that accounts for the lead time + review period (1+L = 3 periods). Using 'default' methods for now as we only have one conclude message and it's too early to detect shifts in lead time or sustained regime changes beyond the initial samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including future-peek data provided in the prompt) shows values: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56. However, the 'Game History' for Period 1 and 2 shows demand of 50 and 91 respectively, which contradicts the 'Historical Demand Data' summary (30, 49). I will prioritize the 'Game History' demand (50, 91) as it reflects the actual realized demand in the simulation. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (71 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible in P4 start), and the order from Period 2 (69 units) is expected in Period 4. With L=2, the backend needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Mean demand of P1 and P2 is (50+91)/2 = 70.5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture this initial trend. Since the sample size is very small, volatility is high; 'default' or 'recent_N' will suffice for sigma_hat.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3. As of the end of Period 3, no arrivals have been recorded. Based on the 2-period lead time definition, the order from Period 1 (71 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution and should be visible in the Period 4 start state. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message still shows arrived=0, and on-hand inventory is 0. This suggests the Period 1 order might be delayed or the actual lead time is longer than 2. Demand has been significantly higher than the initial samples provided (averaging approx 67 vs historical mean of 50). I will use recent_N=3 for demand to capture this higher mean and stay with the default lead time for now to see if the Period 1 order arrives in the next conclusion message, but I'll monitor for lost shipments.

Daily Profit: $50.00, Daily Holding Cost: $93.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-43.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5 (after Period 4's conclusion). The current demand history for chips(Regular) shows values of 50, 91, 60, and 50 (based on 'sold' and 'demand' from history), with an average around 62.75. Lead time observation: One order (P1) arrived in P4 (lead_time=3) and another (P3) arrived in P4 (lead_time=1). The promised lead time is 2. This suggests high variability in shipment arrivals, though the average is currently (3+1)/2 = 2. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average observed performance. For demand (mu_hat), the samples [50, 91, 60, 50, 56(? based on prompt listing 56 for P5)] show some stability despite the early spike. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current mean more accurately than the total history. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the service level q = 0.5; the OR backend will target the median demand. On-hand is 93, in-transit is 69 (likely the P2 order of 69 units).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead-time history. Historical demand samples (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) and realized period demand (50, 91, 60, 50, 70) show a mean around 58.4. Notably, the lead-time is volatile: Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 order arrived in 1 period (averaging 2). Currently, 158 units are in-transit (orders from P2 and P5), and we have 23 units on-hand. Because lead-time varies, I will use lead-time 'calculate' to let the OR backend use the observed average. For demand (mu_hat), a demand shift seems to have occurred (avg 64.2 over the last 5 periods vs 49.6 in initial samples), so I'll use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher activity. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand history shows relative stability with a mean of approximately 60.1 units per period (samples: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56, 50, 91, 60, 50, 70, 70). The promised lead time is 2 periods. However, looking at the 'conclude' messages: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (actual L=3), and Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (actual L=1). Period 2's order (69 units) is currently missing (it should have arrived in P4 or P5) and is likely lost, though total In-transit is 234 units (P2: 69, P5: 89, P6: 76). Given the stockout in Period 6 (sold only 23 of 70 demanded) and 0 on-hand, we must aggressively re-target the base stock. I will use 'calculate' for L to acknowledge variability, 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the most recent demand levels (~65.7 units/period), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability observed: P1 order L=3, P3 order L=1. Order from Period 2 (69 units) is significantly overdue and potentially lost.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a history of lead-time instability. Past observed lead times were 3 periods (P1) and 1 period (P3). The order from Period 2 (69 units) is now 6 periods old, far exceeding the promised lead time of 2; I will treat this shipment as LOST. The current pipeline inventory (excluding the lost P2 order) consists of orders from P5 (89 units), P6 (76 units), P7 (27 units), and the new order for P8. Since the mean demand has increased from an initial ~50 to ~82 over the last 5 periods (P3-P7), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this higher mean. Given the lead time volatility (range 1-3), I will set L to 2 (promised) but rely on the OR backend's safety stock calculation (sigma_hat with recent_N=5) to buffer against the high variance and the risk of the stockout continuing.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Shipment from Period 2 (69 units) confirmed as lost (6 periods elapsed). Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~40 to ~82 (+100%) since Period 3.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we received orders from Period 5 (L=3) and Period 7 (L=1). The order from Period 2 (69 units) is over 6 periods old and is confirmed lost. Current on-hand is 51. In-transit consists of orders from Period 6 (76 units) and Period 8 (0 units, but potentially replenished by OR). Historical demand shows a regime shift starting Around Period 3. Mean demand for P3-P8 is (60+50+70+70+106+65)/6 = 70.1. However, the most recent 3 periods (P6-P8) average (70+106+65)/3 = 80.3, aligning with the previous insight of a 100% increase from the initial P1-P2 levels (~45). Lead times are highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average = 2). I will set L to the promised 2 (using default) as the backend uses this for the base stock calculation, but I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (approx 70 units/period) while smoothing out the spike in P7. Sigma_hat will use recent_N=6 to reflect the increased volatility.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the current status is zero inventory on-hand and 160 units in-transit. A significant demand regime shift was detected starting Period 3, where mean demand increased from ~40 to ~82 units. Recent periods (7-9) show volatile demand (106, 65, 88), averaging 86.3 units. Lead times have also proven unstable; the promised lead time is 2, but actual observations are 1, 3, 1, 3, and a lost shipment (Period 2). Given the lost shipment from Period 2 and the most recent delivery taking 3 periods (Period 5 order arrived Period 8), I am setting L to 2.5 (explicit) to account for potential delays. For mu_hat, I'm using N=5 (Periods 5-9) to capture the current high-demand regime, yielding (1+2.5) * 79.8 = 279.3. For sigma_hat, N=5 captures the increased volatility.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a high mean (approx 82 since Period 3) but high volatility and stockout phases due to delivery instability. Lead times are highly variable: we've seen L=1 and L=3. The shipment from Period 2 (69 units) is definitively lost. As of Period 11, we are at 0 on-hand inventory with 268 units in-transit (orders from P6, P9, and P10). Period 10's order (108 units) was a significant catch-up attempt. For Period 11, I will continue using the high-demand regime statistics (N=7 covers periods 4-10). Given the repeated occurrences of L=3, I will set L to 3 periods to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the maximum observed delay, helping to buffer against stockouts during shipment gaps.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: arrivals occur at L=1 and L=3 (Average L=2, but high variance). One lost shipment (P2) remains at 0 probability of arrival.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Demand has shifted significantly since Period 3, averaging approximately 71 units over the last 9 periods (P3-P11), compared to the initial 40. Lead times are highly volatile, alternating between L=1 and L=3 (avg=2), which complicates the pipeline. Orders from Period 10 (108 units) and Period 11 (16 units) are in transit. Specifically, the P10 order is expected to arrive during P11-P13. Given the stockout and the high volatility of arrivals, I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time to capture the current regime more accurately. N=9 for demand covers the shift since Period 3. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the average observed variability. Because profit equals holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a 50% service level for the base stock calculation, so I am relying on the pipeline to resolve the current stockout.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is low (11 units). Reviewing the lead time history from the 'conclude' messages: P1 (L=3), P3 (L=1), P5 (L=3), P7 (L=1), P9 (L=3), and P10 (L=2). The average actual lead time is exactly 2.16 periods, aligning closely with the promised lead time of 2, despite significant volatility (alternating between 1 and 3). Shipment P2 (69 units) is confirmed lost and should be discounted from the pipeline logic. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the early periods; since Period 4, demand has averaged approximately 74 units per period (last 9 samples: 50, 70, 70, 106, 65, 88, 47, 66, 112). I will use N=9 for demand parameters to capture this higher mean and volatility while excluding the very first few low-demand samples. L is set to 'calculate' to use the historical average (approx 2). Pipeline inventory is currently 161 (likely P11: 16 units + P6: 76 units + P2: 69 units - but P2 is lost, and P6 is extremely overdue). However, the OR engine handles pipeline math; I will provide the stats for L, mu, and sigma to ensure the base stock covers a 3-period window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $11.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 274 units in-transit. A stockout occurred in Period 13 due to high demand (118) exceeding the limited stock (11). Demand has shifted significantly upward since Period 10, with the last four periods averaging 85.75, which is higher than the historical average from early periods. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, though the promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 2 (69 units) is confirmed lost and is no longer part of the expected pipeline. To recover from the stockout and handle the increased demand regime, I will use a recent_N average (N=5) for demand calculation to capture the recent high-demand trend (Periods 9-13: 88, 47, 66, 112, 118; Mean=86.2). I will maintain L at the default promised lead time of 2, as the calculate method naturally accounts for the observed arrivals (L=1, 2, 3), and sigma_hat will be calculated over the last 5 periods to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further elevated: Average demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 86.2 units, a 23% increase over the previous regime average (~70). Stockouts observed in P11 and P13 indicate the pipeline is lagging behind the current demand surge.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 15. The inventory is currently at 0 on-hand units with 258 units in-transit. Demand has significantly increased, with the last 5 periods (P10-P14) averaging 88.8 units, compared to the earlier regime. Stockouts have occurred in 4 of the last 5 periods due to the pipeline lagging behind this demand surge and lead-time variability. Observed lead times are inconsistent (1, 2, and 3 periods), with one shipment (P2) confirmed lost. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 'worst-case' 3-period arrivals and provide a safety buffer against lost units. mu_hat is set to 355.2 (calculated as (1+L) * 88.8) using the recent N=5 method to capture the current high-demand regime. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the high volatility (std ~28) observed in the recent demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~89 units/period (P10-P14 average). Lead time remains volatile but frequently hits 3 periods; using L=3 for safety. Pipeline remains the primary bottleneck for service levels.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime, with an average of approximately 89 units per period over the last five concluded periods (P10-P14). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is heavily reliant on the pipeline (356 units in-transit). Lead times are highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (P1, P5, P9, P11) despite a promised lead time of 2. Recent stockouts (P13, P14, P15) indicate that the actual service level is suffering due to this volatility and the lost shipment from P2. I will continue using an explicit lead time of L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the observed upper bound of delivery times. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) for demand forecasting (mu_hat) to capture the current high-demand regime (~89/pd). Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 periods to account for recent demand variance. By setting L=3 explicitly, I am ensuring the ordering logic covers 4 periods of demand (L+1), helping to bridge the gap caused by the lost shipment and frequent delays.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) reaching 102.6 units. Lead times continue to exhibit high volatility, alternating between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with the most recent arrival (P13 order) taking 3 periods. To prevent stockouts like those seen in P11, P13, P14, and P15, I will maintain L=3 for safety. The pipeline (in-transit) is currently high (280 units), containing orders from P15 and P16. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while allowing the OR backend to account for the substantial in-transit inventory and avoid over-ordering as these shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~103 units/period (P12-P16 average), representing a 15% increase from the previous plateau. Lead time reflects a 3-period maximum which is being used to buffer against frequent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level, with an average of approximately 103 units per period over the last five periods (P13-P17). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in P17, though 37 units arrived during that period's resolution. The pipeline inventory (349 units) includes several pending orders (P12 order [if any/not listed as arrived], P15 order, P17 order). Lead times remain highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Recent arrivals: P13 arrived after 3, P16 arrived after 1). To maximize service levels and account for the frequent 3-period lead time, L is set to 3. For demand forecast (mu_hat), recent_N is set to 5 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (~103 units/period). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the current volatility in that high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a robust base stock that minimizes stockouts while the pipeline clears.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level, with the average over the last 7 periods (P12-P18) being approximately 107 units. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we are experiencing frequent stockouts because the pipeline is not arriving fast enough to meet this elevated demand. Lead times remain highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P16 arrived in 1 period, while P13 and P11 took 3). To protect against the upper end of this volatility and the 'lost' order from P2 which is still skewing the pipeline calculation in the OR backend, I am setting L=3. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the most recent demand regime of ~107 units per period. This results in a mu_hat of (1+3) * 107 = 428. Setting L=3 increases the base stock level to better account for the 412 units currently in-transit, which include orders from Period 15 (98 units), Period 17 (106 units), Period 18 (63 units), and the likely-lost Period 2 order (69 units). This ensures the OR backend places a sufficiently large order to cover demand through the lead time plus one review period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~107 units/period (P12-P18 average). Lead time remains highly volatile (1-3 periods); conservative L=3 is necessary to buffer against stockouts given current 0 on-hand inventory.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level, with the average over the last 8 periods (P12-P19) being approximately 110 units (total 882 / 8 = 110.25). The most recent demand (P19) was 122 units, suggesting a continued upward trend or high plateau. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system has experienced stockouts in three consecutive periods (P17-P19) due to lead-time volatility. Lead times observed in history (L=3, L=1, L=3, L=1, L=3, L=2, L=3, L=3, L=1) show a high frequency of 3-period arrivals. To protect against stockouts during this high-demand period while on-hand inventory is depleted, I am maintaining an explicit L=3. I will use recent_N with N=8 for demand (\u03bc\u0302) to capture the current high-demand regime (approx. 110 units/period) and recent_N for volatility (\u03c3\u0302) to reflect the recent demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~110 units/period (P12-P19 average), a slight increase from the previous ~107 average. Stockouts in P17-P19 emphasize the need for conservative lead-time settings (L=3) to manage pipeline arrivals.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a significantly higher plateau. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P12-P20) is 109 units, justifying the use of recent_N=9 to capture this shift. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts across periods 17-20 due to arrivals not covering the elevated demand. Lead times remain highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P16 ordered arrived at L=1, while others took 3). To manage this risk and the 0 on-hand state, I am maintaining L=3 as a conservative safety estimate. The OR backend will use these parameters to try and rebuild the pipeline and satisfy the current demand regime of ~110 units/period while accounting for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~109 units/period (P12-P20 average). Recent stockouts (P17-P20) confirm that the pipeline is currently insufficient to meet the sustained demand spike.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly spiked, with the most recent sample (Period 21) reaching 155 units, pushing the average over the last 10 periods (P12-P21) to approximately 115.4 units per period. This confirms a sustained high-demand environment (~115 units/period) compared to earlier plateaus. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have significant in-transit stock (434 units), part of which includes orders from P17 (106 units) and P18 (63 units) that are now due (Promised L=2, observed max L=3). I will maintain L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high variability in lead times (1-3 periods) and the risk of lost shipments (seen in P2). For mu_hat, I'm using the most recent 10 samples to capture this elevated demand level (~115 units/period across 4 periods of protection), and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with these higher volumes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime upward shift confirmed: Average demand over P12-P21 is ~115 units, with a peak of 155 in P21. Current pipeline (434 units) is large, but arrival timing remains volatile (L=1 to L=3).

The most recent period (P22) saw a demand of 117 units, following a peak of 155 in P21. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced several consecutive periods of stockouts (P18-P22) due to volatile lead times. The 'In-transit' quantity of 452 units includes several large orders from P15 (98 units), P17 (106 units), and P18 (63 units) that are now hitting the 3-5 period mark since ordering. Although the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times observed range from 1 to 3 periods, and the P15 order is now overdue (lead time 7+). However, to protect against the sustained high demand and current inventory exhaustion, I will keep L=3 to ensure the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient for a 4rd (L+1) period horizon. I will use the last 11 samples (P12-P22) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable period of the elevated demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~115 units/period (P12-P22 average). Frequent stockouts confirm that reliance on promised lead time is insufficient; L=3 remains the necessary buffer for the OR backend despite a large pipeline, as actual arrival timing is unpredictable.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a significantly higher level, with the average demand from Period 12 to Period 23 being approximately 115 units. The most recent demand sample in Period 23 was 121 units, confirming this higher plateau. Lead time remains highly volatile, with recent arrivals occurring at L=1, L=2, and L=3. Because we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and have faced repeated stockouts, I am maintaining the explicit lead time estimate of L=3 to ensure the OR backend buffers against the maximum observed delay. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=12 to focus on the stable demand period since Period 12 (approx. 115 units/period), and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the increased volatility in this regime. These settings will help the backend compute a base stock level that covers the 4-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the current large pipeline of 426 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~115 units/period (P12-P23 avg). Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), requiring L=3 buffer to prevent stockouts.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at an elevated level. The average demand from Period 12 to Period 24 is ~114 units, with the most recent three periods (P22-P24) averaging ~121 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to persistent stockouts and arrival volatility. Although the in-transit pipeline is large (456 units), the actual lead time varies unpredictably between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P20 arrived at L=3, P21 at L=2, P22 at L=1). To ensure the OR backend builds a sufficient safety buffer to cover the maximum possible lead time and address the current stockout state, I am maintaining L=3. I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat (N=13, covering the current regime since P12) and sigma_hat (N=13) to capture the higher mean and volatility of this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable at ~114 units/period (P12-P24 average). Lead time remains highly volatile (1-3 periods), necessitating a conservative L=3 setting to recover from 0 on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is consistently elevated, with a recent average (P12-P25) of approximately 115 units per period. The last two periods (P24, P25) have seen demand climb further (126 and 137 respectively), suggesting a possible upward drift or high-end variance within the current stable regime. Lead time continues to exhibit high volatility, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P20 L=3, P21 L=2, P22 L=1, P23 L=2). Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and recent sales have been heavily restricted by stockouts, maintaining L=3 is essential to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation accounts for the full duration of pipeline risk. I am using recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat to capture the regime established since Period 12, as this period marks the start of the current high-demand environment (~115 units/period). This setting ensures the target inventory level is sufficiently high to recover from the current stockout state and handle the observed demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable with an average of ~115 units/period (based on P12-P25). Lead time volatility persists between 1-3 periods, requiring a conservative L=3 setting to mitigate recurrent stockouts.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 12, with an average of approximately 115 units per period. The last 15 periods (P12-P26) show a mean of 115.2 units. Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P20 arrived at L=3, P21 at L=2, P22 at L=1, P23 at L=2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and while the in-transit pipeline is 466 units, the inconsistent arrivals necessitate a conservative lead time setting of L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand. This helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient safety buffer to recover from recurrent stockouts. I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable high-demand regime, and explicit L=3 to account for the maximum observed lead time delay.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher level since Period 12, with the average demand from Period 12 to 27 being approximately 114.8 units. The last three periods (P25-P27) show values of 137, 90, and 107. Lead time remains highly volatile, frequently oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with several shipments from P24 and P26 effectively 'missing' in the current conclusion of P27. On-hand inventory has been at 0 for five of the last six periods due to these arrival delays. To ensure the backend OR policy targets a high enough base stock to cover both the mean demand and the variability during these extended 3-period lead times, I am setting L=3 (explicit) and mu_hat using recent_N=16 (covering the stabilized regime since P12). This will calculate a base stock based on (1+3) * ~115 = 460 units. Given the pipeline is currently 466, this will likely result in a small or zero order this period if the backend considers the existing pipeline sufficient, but it correctly positions the safety stock for when arrivals normalize.

The demand regime is stable at an elevated level, averaging approximately 117 units over the last 15 periods (P14-P28), with recent demand frequently exceeding 125 units (P28: 135, P25: 137). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline inventory is 458 units. Lead time remains highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P26 order arrived in P28, L=2; P23 order arrived in P25, L=2). To prevent continuous stockouts caused by timing gaps in arrivals, I am maintaining a conservative lead time estimate of L=3. For mu_hat, I am using the mean of the last 15 samples (N=15) to capture the current high-demand regime effectively while smoothing out recent peaks.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained increase, with the average demand from Period 12 to Period 29 reaching approximately 117 units. Recent peaks (e.g., Period 29 at 161 units) suggest higher variance and a possible further upward drift. On-hand inventory is currently 0, following a series of stockouts due to the pipeline failing to arrive in a timely manner. Lead time is volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. To mitigate stockout risk and allow the system to rebuild inventory, I am maintaining a conservative lead time estimate (L=3), which effectively tells the OR backend to target a base stock covering 4 periods (L+1) of demand. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, selecting N=18 (encompassing the stable-to-rising regime since P12) to ensure the backend properly captures the current average demand and the increased volatility observed in the most recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains elevated and slightly rising: Average demand P12-P29 is ~117 units (vs ~115 earlier), with a significant peak of 161 in P29. Inventory position remains critical (0 on-hand) due to high lead time volatility (1-3 periods).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' remains in an elevated state, with the average demand from Period 12 to Period 30 being approximately 118 units per period, and a recent high of 161 in Period 29. The current inventory position is critical with 0 on-hand units, and the pipeline of 472 units is large but has arrived inconsistently. Lead times continue to exhibit high volatility, varying between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend generates orders that account for this uncertainty and the current stockout state, I am maintaining an explicit lead time of L=3. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=19 (covering the stable high-demand regime from P12-P30) to capture the current mean of ~118 units/period. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=19 to capture the increased volatility (Std Dev ~24) observed in this regime, which helps the service level calculation buffer against spikes like the 161 units seen in Period 29.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shown a persistent upward trend, with the average demand over the last 20 periods (P12-P31) being approximately 120 units. Crucially, the last three periods (P29-P31) have seen an acceleration, with demand hitting 161, 132, and 165 units respectively (avg ~153). On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to extremely volatile lead times (1-3 periods) and the OR backend's capped ordering logic struggling to keep up with the sustained spike and pipeline gaps. The 'In-transit' quantity of 475 units represents a significant backlog of orders that have not yet arrived. To prevent further stockouts while managing the high backlog, I am using L=3 to ensure the backend projects a longer lead-time requirement. For demand, I'm using recent_N=5 (covering P27-P31) to capture the most recent escalation (avg ~140) to force the base stock higher, while the backend's internal 'cap' will prevent excessive over-ordering relative to the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: Avg demand increased from ~117 to ~153 (+30%) over the last 3 periods. Pipeline remains heavily congested (475 units) with erratic lead times (1-3 periods).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward around Period 29, with the average demand for Period 29-32 being ~143.5 units. The overall average since Period 12 is ~119 units, but the recent trend is significantly higher (161, 132, 165, 116). Additionally, lead time continues to be highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with most recent orders arriving at L=1 (P31) but many others still in-transit. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have a very large pipeline (557 units), suggesting several past orders are reaching the 3-period mark. I will set L to an explicit 3 to provide a conservative buffer for the OR engine, while using mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent demand surge (~143.5 per period). Since the pipeline is so large (557) and the base stock calculation will likely be lower than the pipeline, the backend will likely order 0 or very little, which is appropriate until the massive 'in-transit' volume arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: Avg demand increased from ~117 to ~144 (+23%) based on P29-P32. Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant regime shift starting around Period 29. The average demand from P29 to P33 is approximately 150.6 units, compared to the previous stable average of ~115 units. This represents a sustained increase of over 30%. Inventory levels are critical, with ending on-hand inventory consistently at 0 due to the pipeline failing to keep pace with demand spikes and lead-time volatility. Lead times remain highly erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P31 order arrived in 1 period, while others have historical lags of 3). To address this, I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the maximum likely delay. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the new elevated demand regime (~150 units/period). sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level (~25 units). Despite a large 'In-transit' quantity (489 units), the 0 on-hand status and the recent 179-unit demand peak necessitate these aggressive parameters to protect against continued stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 29: average demand increased from ~115 to ~151 (+31%) based on samples P29-P33. Consecutive high-demand periods (P31: 165, P33: 179) indicate a new sustained plateau.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 29. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P29-P34) is approximately 147 units (161, 132, 165, 116, 179, 131), which aligns with the previously identified 'Period 29 shift'. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline (603 units) is heavily backloaded due to significant lead time volatility; while the promised lead time is 2, we frequently observe arrivals taking 3 periods (e.g., P5, P9, P11, P13, P20). To ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation (which uses (1+L) periods of demand) is sufficiently protective against these delays and the new higher demand average, I will set L to an explicit 3. This forces the model to target an inventory level covering 4 periods of demand (~588 units). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent sustained surge (P29-P34) while smoothing recent volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect the current high variation in demand.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant upward shift starting at Period 29. The average demand from Period 29 to Period 35 is approximately 146.9 units/period, compared to the previous average of ~115. Recent observations show high volatility, with demand peaking at 179 units in Period 33. I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 to capture this new elevated plateau (averaging ~147 per period). Lead time remains highly erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; therefore, I am maintaining an explicit L=3 to ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient base stock to buffer against these delays and recover from the current zero on-hand inventory state. Although in-transit is high (603 units), the lack of arrivals in Periods 34 and 35 despite orders in Periods 15 through 31 confirms that the pipeline is currently stalled and needs aggressive re-stocking parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29 confirmed: Average demand increased from ~115 to ~147 (+28%) based on P29-P35 data. Lead time remains unstable (1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift at Period 29 is sustained, with the average demand from Period_29 to Period_36 being approximately 151 units per period (samples: 161, 132, 165, 116, 179, 131, 144, 180). This confirms the 31% increase noted in the carry-over insights. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and while 489 units are in-transit, lead time remains highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Recent arrivals: P31 at L=1, P32 at L=1, P34 at L=2). To protect against this volatility and the higher demand floor, I will continue using a conservative lead time of L=3 for the OR backend calculation. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to capture the elevated demand since the P29 shift. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the increased volatility associated with the higher demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29 confirmed: Avg demand P29-P36 is ~151 units (+31% vs previous plateau). Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime starting at Period 29. The average demand from Period 29 to Period 37 is approximately 156.3 units, compared to the previous plateau of ~115 units. Specifically, recent demand samples (P33-P37) are 179, 131, 144, 180, and 199, showing a strong upward trend. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture this Period 29 shift, which averages ~156 per period (total mu_hat = (1+L)*156). Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P34 arrived in 2 periods, while P31 arrived in 1). Given consistent stockouts and 0 on-hand inventory, I will maintain a conservative L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the maximum likely delay in the pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=9) to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29 confirmed and accelerating: Average demand P29-P37 is ~156 units (+35% vs previous plateau of 115). Demand in P37 reached a series high of 199.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting at Period 29, with the average demand increasing from ~115 to approximately 157 units per period (+36%) based on the most recent 10 samples (P29-P38). The latest sample (P37: 199 units) indicates that volatility remains high. Inventory is currently at 0 on-hand, and the system has experienced chronic stockouts. Lead time remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, although recent arrivals have trended towards 1-2 periods. To protect against the 3-period maximum observed in the past and ensure the OR backend accounts for the current demand plateau, I am setting L=3 (explicit) and mu_hat to 160 per period ($160 * (1+3) = 640$) using the explicit method to prioritize service level recovery. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the increased standard deviation of this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29 confirmed: Average demand P29-P38 is ~157 units (+35% vs previous 115 plateau). Peak demand of 199 in P37 suggests ongoing upward pressure and high variance.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant sustained increase since Period 29, with the average demand for P29-P39 stabilizing at approximately 159 units per period (a ~38% increase from the previous plateau of ~115). Period 37 saw a peak of 199, and the most recent sample (P39) was 179, confirming that high-demand pressure persists. Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating unpredictably between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P38 arrived in 1 period, while others have taken 3). With 0 on-hand inventory and frequent stockouts (P37-P39), I must maintain a conservative lead time parameter L=3 to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation accounts for the maximum likely delay in the pipeline. I will set mu_hat using the last 11 samples (P29-P39) to capture this new elevated regime while excluding older, lower-demand data. Sigma_hat is set to the same period (recent_N=11) to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation) seen during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29 confirmed: Average demand P29-P39 is ~159 units (+38% vs previous plateau of 115). Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods), necessitating L=3 to manage pipeline risk.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 29 and remains at an elevated plateau. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P29-P40), the mean demand is approximately 161.1 units per period, with significant variance (std dev ~25). The most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) average 181 units, suggesting the trend is still pushing upward or stabilizing at a very high level compared to the previous plateau of 115. Lead times remain erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P34 at L=2, P38/P39 at L=1, while others earlier hit L=3). To prevent the recurring stockouts (on-hand is currently 0), I will use a conservative lead time estimate (L=3) and an explicit demand forecast (mu_hat) based on the current regime (N=12 for a robust sample of the high-demand period) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the pipeline risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29 remains significantly elevated: P29-P40 average is ~161 units per period (+40% vs previous plateau). Recent peak demand in P37 reached 199. Lead time remains highly volatile (1-3 periods).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 29 remains significantly elevated, with the average demand from P29 to P41 calculated at ~160 units (P29-P41 average is 159.2), which is a 40% increase over the previous plateau of 115. Recent periods show high volatility with peaks up to 199. Lead times remain erratic, varying between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P38 arrived in 1, P39 arrived in 1, but P34 arrived in 2 and P37 is still pending at L=4). Although P37 is technically 'overdue' compared to the recent 1-2 period arrivals, the 3-period maximum is historically common. I will continue using L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the maximum probable lead time to protect against frequent stockouts caused by the 0 on-hand inventory position. mu_hat is set using recent_N=13 (covering the start of the current high-demand regime at P29) to capture the ~160 unit average, and sigma_hat is set using the same window to capture the increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29 confirmed as stable at ~160 units/period (P29-P41 average), with high variance (range 116-199). Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 29 continues to be significantly elevated, with a calculated average of approximately 161 units (P29-P42). The current period shows 0 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 645 units. Inventory throughput remains throttled by volatile lead times (ranging between 1-3 periods). In Period 42, no arrivals occurred, likely pushing expected deliveries of previous large orders (e.g., from Period 37) into the current period (Period 43). I am maintaining L=3 as an explicit parameter to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the maximum observed delay and prevents the system from under-ordering during this high-demand plateau. The mean demand (mu_hat) is set to a recent window (N=14, covering P29-P42) to capture the current regime average (~161 per period), and sigma_hat is also set to this recent window to reflect the current high volatility (std dev of ~25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains significantly elevated following the shift at Period 29. The average demand from Period 29 to Period 43 is approximately 161.5 units per period, with high variance (demand ranging from 116 to 199). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory is 627 units. Lead times continue to be highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P38 arrived at L=1, P40 arrived at L=3). To ensure the OR backend accounts for this volatility and maintains enough pipeline coverage to recover from the stockout state, I will keep L=3. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=15 (covering the period from P29 to P43) to capture the mean of the current high-demand regime, which is ~161.5 units per period. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=15 to reflect the current high demand variance, helping the backend maintain an appropriate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29 remains stable at ~161 units per period (based on P29-P43 average), with continued high volatility in lead times (1-3 periods).

Specifically, the last 5 periods (P40-P44) have averaged 171.6 units, indicating continued high pressure even within the elevated regime. Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P40 order took 3, P41 order took 3). With 0 on-hand inventory and the game nearing its end (Period 45 of 50), I will maintain a conservative L=3 setting to ensure the OR backend accounts for maximum lead time risk. I will use recent_N=16 for mu_hat to capture the entire elevated regime starting at P29 (N=16 periods: P29-P44) and recent_N=16 for sigma_hat to reflect the high variance observed during this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29 remains stable at ~162 units/period (P29-P44 average), with the most recent 5-period average reaching 171.6. Lead time is volatile between 1-3 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly elevated level since Period 29. The average demand from Period 29 through Period 45 is approximately 164 units per period (2,794 total units over 17 periods), a 43% increase over the previous plateau of 115. Recent demand in Period 45 hit a new peak of 201 units. Lead time remains erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P40 arrived in 3, P41 in 3, P43 in 2). Given the current zero on-hand inventory and the consistent under-delivery of the pipeline, I will continue to use a conservative lead time of L=3 to allow the OR backend to calculate a higher base stock. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=17 to capture the full scope of this current high-demand regime (P29-P45). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=17 to reflect the increased volatility (ranging from 116 to 201) associated with this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29 stabilized at ~164 units/period (P29-P45 average), with a recent high of 201 in P45. This confirms a sustained +43% increase over the previous 115-unit plateau.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly elevated level since Period 29, with the average demand from Period 29-Period 46 being approximately 164 units per period. Recent samples (P44: 181, P45: 201, P46: 144) verify this plateau persists with high variance. Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P41 arrives P44 with L=3, while P43 arrives P45 with L=2). Since on-hand inventory is currently at 0 and the pipeline contains 663 units, we must ensure the OR backend uses a conservative lead-time estimate to protect against potential stockouts in the final periods of the simulation. I am setting L=3 to account for the maximum observed lead time and using a recent_N of 18 for mu_hat (covering Period 29 to Period 46) to capture the current demand mean of ~164. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=18 to reflect the high volatility seen in this regime.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher level since Period 29, with an average of approximately 164 units per period (P29-P47). Recent demand samples (P45: 201, P47: 198) show continued upward pressure and high variance. The lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P43 arrived in 2 periods, while P40 and P41 took 3 periods). Given that we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and the game is approaching its conclusion (Period 48 of 50), it is critical to maintain a conservative lead-time estimate of L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the maximum likely delay in the pipeline. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=19, covering the regime since P29) and sigma_hat (N=10) to capture the elevated mean and the significant volatility observed in this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29 stabilized at ~164 units/period (P29-P47 average), with recent peaks near 200 units suggesting increased variance. Lead time continues to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in the elevated regime that started around Period 29. The average demand from Period 29 to Period 48 is approximately 165 units, with the most recent three periods seeing a spike (P45: 201, P47: 198, P48: 207). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to significant lost sales. The pipeline (665 units) is large relative to the current demand, but actual arrivals continue to be erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods. To recover from the stockout position and account for the high lead-time volatility, I will maintain L=3. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the full breadth of the current high-demand regime since Period 29. Sigma_hat will also be calculated using N=20 to properly reflect the increased variance observed in recent peaks. The backend capped policy will manage the large pipeline, only ordering if the projected base stock exceeds the 665 units in transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29 remains stable but high-variance, with an average of ~165 units/period (P29-P48) and recent peaks exceeding 200 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly elevated plateau since Period 29. The average demand from Period 29 through Period 49 is approximately 166 units per period, which is a 44% increase over the previous stable regime of ~115 units. Recent demand has been particularly high, with samples like 207 (P48), 193 (P49), and 201 (P45), indicating that the average is potentially trending even higher or maintaining very high variance. Lead time continues to be highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P40 arrived at L=3, P39 at L=1, P43 at L=2). Since we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and the pipeline reflects substantial unfulfilled demand, I will continue to use a conservative lead time of L=3 to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation covers the maximum observed delay. I will set mu_hat using the last 21 samples (P29-P49) to capture this entire high-demand regime, and sigma_hat will also use recent_N=21 to properly account for the increased volatility (range of ~116 to 207) observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29 remains stable and elevated at ~166 units/period (P29-P49 average), with recent peaks exceeding 200 units suggesting both a higher mean and increased variance compared to the previous 115-unit plateau.
