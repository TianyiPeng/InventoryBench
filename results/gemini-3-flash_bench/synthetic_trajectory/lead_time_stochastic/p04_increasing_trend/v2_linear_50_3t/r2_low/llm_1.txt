The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) is expected to arrive at the start of Period 4 (Decision Phase) for use in Period 4 demand. To cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (while waiting for this order), I must consider that I currently have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Therefore, I need to order enough to cover the lead time cycle (L+1 = 3 periods). Given the average demand is ~50 units/period, a safe buffer for 3 periods would be roughly 150-180 units. I will order 150 units to establish a baseline pipeline while being mindful of the $1.0 holding cost, which is equal to the profit per unit, penalizing overstocking heavily.",

(c) Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised LT is 2. Observed LT fluctuates between 1 and 3. Orders from P17, P18, P19 (230 units) and P15 (100 units) are confirmed lost. P27 (50 units) and P28 (100 units) are the recent orders in transit likely to arrive. Currently, In-transit is reported at 760, but subtracting the 330 lost units (P15, P17, P18, P19) and the units from P24 (80), P25 (50) which are nearing the 3-period max LT, there is significant uncertainty. (d) Inventory Assessment: On-hand is 0. Ending inventory for P28 was 0. (e) Decision logic: To cover demand for the next 3 periods (L+1 approach where L=2) at 120 units/period, I need roughly 360 units in the pipeline. Effective pipeline (excluding confirmed lost) = P24(80) + P25(50) + P27(50) + P28(100) = 280 units. P24 and P25 are at risk of being late/lost. I will order 150 units to refill the pipeline, compensate for the zero on-hand status, and protect against the high-frequency variability/potential loss in the supply chain.",

Pipeline assessment: Total In-transit is 1650. However, after accounting for historical lost orders (P15-P31: 840 units), P33 (140), and P37 (200) which are definitively lost (6+ periods overdue), the adjusted 'active' pipeline is significantly smaller. Specifically, arrivals from P38, P39, and P40 have already occurred. The only active orders likely to arrive are P41 (300 units). On-hand inventory is effectively 0 after Period 41's demand resolution. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1 approach where L=2) at a target demand of 180 units/period, I need ~540 units total.
