Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the lead time is 2, I need to cover demand for Period 1 (current), Period 2, and Period 3 (L+1 periods) before the first order arrives. Forecasting demand at approximately 55 units per period, the total required for the cycle is ~165 units.

The order for 170 units placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P3's conclusion and become visible in P4's history (now). However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. Per the 'Critical Timing Example', a lead time of 2 means an order placed in P1 arrives DURING P3 and is visible at the start of P4.

The in-transit pipeline includes orders from Period 24 (120 units), P25 (180), P27 (150), and P28 (150). Given the 1-3 period lead time variability, P24 (ordered 5 periods ago) is likely lost. P25 (ordered 4 periods ago) is now overdue but might still arrive. To ensure a service level covering the next 3 periods (max lead time L+1) at an estimated 150 units/period, I need roughly 600 units (including safety stock for volatility). Current pipeline (excluding likely lost P24) is 480 (P25+P27+P28) + 20 on-hand = 500.

Pipeline attrition is a significant factor: orders from P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, and P37 are now categorized as lost (totaling 1100 units). The current in-transit inventory is 1610, but subtracting these 1100 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 510 units (P40, P41, and the new P42 order). Recent successful lead times have been 1-2 periods. Effective on-hand is 0. To cover demand for the next 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at 175 units/period, I need a total inventory of 525. Current effective pipeline (P40 order of 150 + P41 order of 180) is 330 units. I will order 195 units to bring the effective pipeline to 525, ensuring we meet the higher demand regime while accounting for the ~50% historical attrition rate by maintaining a slightly more aggressive order volume.",

Lead times currently fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods (P39 arrived in 1, P38 arrived in 1, P34/P35 arrived in 2). I must account for widespread order loss (P17-P19, P24-P25, P29-P30, P33, P37, and likely P40 are lost or severely delayed). Current on-hand inventory is 0. My goal is to cover demand for the lead time plus one period (L+1 = 3 periods). Targeted stock level: 180 (demand) * 3 = 540 units plus a safety buffer for volatility. In-transit inventory stands at 1805, but after subtracting confirmed losses (1100 units from P17-P19, P24-P25, P29-P30, P33, P37), the active pipeline is only 705 units (P40-P42).

Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline (1855 units) is heavily inflated by several presumed lost orders (P17-P19, P24-P25, P29-P30, P33, P37, P41, P42). Specifically, orders from P41 (180 units) and P42 (195 units) have not arrived within a 1- or 2-period window; if they follow the 3-period lead time of the P40 order, they should arrive in P44 or P45.
