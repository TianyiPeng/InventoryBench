Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we have no historical arrivals or concluded lead-time data, but we do have 5 pre-period demand samples: [30, 49, 48, 65, 56]. The mean demand is approximately 49.6 units per period. The promised lead time (L) is 2. To cover the current period's demand plus demand during the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods), we will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to set the base stock level. Since this is the first decision period, we are initializing the pipeline to meet the predicted demand of approximately 149 units (3 * 49.6).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 71 units with a promised lead time of 2. This order is in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 3 or 4 (resolution and visibility delay). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales for Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 samples provided shows a mean of 49.6 units, but the actual demand in Period 1 was 50. Since we have no lead time observations yet to suggest a change, I will stick with the promised L=2. For demand, the sample mean is stable, so I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the average reflecting the provided historical context.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For the product 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time is 2 periods. This means an order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (after this decision) and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. As of the start of Period 3, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 137 units in-transit (71 from Period 1 and 66 from Period 2). Historical demand for the first two periods was 50 and 45 (average 47.5). Note that units sold were 0 because inventory had not yet arrived. I will use the 'default' lead time (2) and calculate the demand parameters based on the recent historical samples. Since we only have 2 periods of game history demand (50, 45) plus the 5 pre-game samples (30, 49, 48, 65, 56), I'll use a recent_N of 5 to capture the trend of the last few periods (approx mean 53).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility (P1: 50, P2: 45, P3: 86, and preliminary data P1-P5 suggesting a mean around 49.6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 170 units in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order placed in Period 1 (71 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start state. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0, and our current on-hand is still 0. This suggests the lead time might be at least 3 periods or there is a delay. I will use the 'explicit' method for L to set it to 3 to account for this observation. For \u03bc\u0302, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent higher demand (avg of 50, 45, 86 is ~60), though the backend formula (1+L)\xd7mean will adjust this. Since we have a stockout (sold=0), we need to ensure the base stock is high enough to recover once shipments arrive.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 5, we have observed two completed shipment cycles for chips(Regular). Order 1 (P1) arrived in P4 (lead time = 3), and Order 3 (P3) arrived in P4 (lead time = 1). The promised lead time is 2, and the average observed lead time is also 2. Demand over the last 5 periods has been 30, 49, 48, 65, and 56 (average ~50). Period 4 'conclude' message shows a demand of 45, while the prompt history lists P4 as 65 and P5 as 56. I will prioritize the provided 'Historical Demand Data' list (last 5 samples: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56) which averages 49.6. Pipeline inventory is currently 164 (Orders from P2 and P4). Since lead times are fluctuating (1 to 3 periods), I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the average behavior. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use all 5 available samples to establish a stable baseline after the initial stock-out phase.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 (mean \u2248 49.6). In-game history shows demand values of 50, 45, 86, 45, 57 (mean \u2248 56.6). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are 3 and 1. Period 5 concluded with only 2 units on hand and 196 units in transit (orders from P2, P4, P5). No orders concluded in Period 5, meaning the P2 order (placed 4 periods ago) might be delayed or at risk. We need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. Using all 5 samples to establish a baseline for demand. I will set L to the promised 2 (default) as the average lead time (3+1)/2 is also 2. mu_hat will use the mean of all samples to provide a stable forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory is depleted (on-hand: 0). History shows a demand mean of ~51.8 with moderate variance. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations (P1 arrived P4 [LT=3], P3 arrived P4 [LT=1]) yield an average lead time of 2. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this empirical average. Demand seems a bit volatile (range 30-86), so I'll use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime more accurately than long-term averages. No new sustained patterns are confirmed beyond initial volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $152.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was [30, 49, 48, 65, 56], and demand for Periods 1-7 (from concludes) was [50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50]. The average demand is roughly 53 units/period. Lead times have been inconsistent: promised is 2, but observed values are 3 (P1 order), 1 (P3 order), and 3 (P4 order). Total in-transit is 158 units (orders from P2=66, P5=32, P7=60). The P2 order is now significantly overdue (placed P2, current is P8 start, intended lead time 2 means it should have arrived P4 or P5). Given the variability in lead time (1 to 3+ periods) and a potentially lost or severely delayed order from P2, I will estimate the effective lead time L as 3. For mu_hat, demand appears stable around 53; using recent_N=5 captures this regime. Sigma_hat is set to default to reflect the variance across the window.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed lead times of 1 and 3 periods suggest instability. Period 2 order (66 units) is 3+ periods overdue and may be lost or severely delayed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe significant lead time variability and a likely lost shipment. History shows lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P4 arrived after 3, P3 arrived after 1, P4 arrived after 3, P5 arrived after 3, P7 arrived after 1). Promised lead time (L) is 2, but the average actual lead time is 2.2 periods. Importantly, the order from Period 2 (66 units) has not arrived after 7 periods and is considered lost. The 'In-transit' total of 113 consists of the lost P2 order (66) and the P8 order (47). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 'ghost' pipeline inventory, I must set the lead time parameter L explicitly or calculate it to reflect the true delay. Demand remains relatively stable between 45-64 (mean ~52). Setting L to 3 periods accounts for the frequent 3-period arrivals and provides a buffer for the lost stock. I will use recent demand history (N=5) to capture the slight upward trend in demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Shipment from Period 2 (66 units) confirmed lost (7+ periods since order). In-transit inventory counts are inflated by this lost order. Lead time consistently toggles between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the order from Period 2 (66 units) is 8 periods past its order date and 6 periods past its promised delivery. Based on the carry-over insights and historical arrival patterns, this shipment is confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 103 actually contains 66 'ghost' units, leaving real pipeline inventory at only 37 units (ordered in Period 9). Demand over the last 9 periods has averaged 53.2 units, but has shown high variability (ranging from 31 to 86). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.2. To reconcile the backend OR logic, I'm setting L=3 to account for the upper-end lead time observed, especially since the pipeline is lower than the UI indicates due to the lost shipment. I'm using recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=5 to capture more recent demand dynamics while ignoring the outlier period 9 (31 units).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the current on-hand inventory is 64. The 'In-transit' count is 131, but 66 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 65 (comprising orders from Period 9 and 10). Lead times are unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2). Demand has recently softened, with Period 9 (31) and Period 10 (28) lower than the long-term mean (~49). I am using 'calculate' for L to capture the historical volatility. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=5 to prioritize the recent lower demand trend while maintaining enough data to account for the overall variance. This conservative settings ensures we don't over-order into a potential surplus if the demand drop persists.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown higher volatility recently, ranging from 28 to 86. The observed lead times have been unstable, alternating between 1 period (P3, P7, P8 orders) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 orders). The P2 order (66 units) remains lost, so it must be subtracted from the logic as the OR backend includes 'In-transit' as pipeline inventory. Current 'In-transit' is 131, but 66 is dead stock, leaving an effective pipeline of 65 (orders from P9, P10). The mean demand across all historical samples (including user-provided samples P1-P5) is approximately 50. Setting L=3 (explicit) to account for recent worst-case lead times. mu_hat is set to 200 (4 periods * 50 mean) to ensure sufficient coverage for the review plus lead time. sigma_hat is set to 35 (sqrt(4) * ~17.5 std) to cover demand variability and prevent stockouts during the lead time transition.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory is critically low (2 units) following a stockout risk in Period 12. Lead times show significant volatility, alternating between 1, 2, and 3 periods: P9 arrived in 3 periods, P10 in 2 periods. The average observed lead time is approximately 2.125 periods. Most importantly, the Period 2 order (66 units) is long overdue (11 periods) and officially considered lost, which inflates the 'In-transit' figure seen by the OR backend. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5-period average (P8-P12) is 50.0 units, which is consistent with the long-term average (49.5). I will use recent_N=5 to capture this stable demand level. To compensate for the lost 66 units in the pipeline inventory (which the backend will subtract from the target base stock), I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on (1+L)*demand \u2248 (1+2)*50 = 150. Since the backend thinks pipeline is 145 (including the 66 lost units), I must boost mu_hat to ensure an order is actually placed. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 216 (150 baseline + 66 lost unit compensation) to 'force' the backend to ignore the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time distribution now includes 2 periods (P10); confirmed pattern: {1, 2, 3} periods, median 2. Transitioning from binary (1 or 3) to variable. Phantom inventory from Period 2 (66 units) remains in system totals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand spiked significantly in Period 13 (103 units) compared to the long-term average (~50) and recent average (~60). We have a stockout situation. 

Inventory Reconciliation: Total In-transit is 235. However, we have confirmed that the Period 2 order of 66 units is lost. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (Total In-Transit) to calculate the order size (order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory). Because the 66 units aren't coming, the backend will systematically under-order by 66 units unless we compensate. 

Parameters Choice:
1. Lead Time (L): Observed lead times are {3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2}. The average is roughly 2.1. Using 'calculate' allows the engine to use the average of all observed lead times, acknowledging the volatility between 1 and 3 periods.
2. Mu_hat: The recent demand (last 3 periods: 64, 63, 103) shows a sharp upward trend (avg ~77). Using 'recent_N' with N=3 captures this spike to ensure we set a base stock that can handle higher demand levels. 
3. Sigma_hat: Volatility has increased with the jump from 63 to 103. 'recent_N' with N=3 will compute a higher standard deviation, increasing the safety stock safety (z*sigma) to prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase.
4. Addressing the Lost Shipment: To fix the 66-unit 'phantom inventory' gap, I am setting mu_hat to 'explicit'. The calculated mu_hat for recent_N (N=3) would be (1+2.1)*76.6 = 237.5. I will add 66 units to this to force the backend to place a larger order, offsetting the lost 66 units: 237.5 + 66 = 303.5.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected: Period 13 demand (103) is >100% higher than the previous 5-period average (50). Monitoring for sustained regime shift.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0) following a significant demand surge that began in Period 13 (demand = 103) and continued into Period 14 (demand = 85). The average demand over these two periods is 94, which is roughly double the historical mean of ~50. I am adjusting mu_hat using the last 2 periods of data (N=2) to capture this new regime. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 341 is heavily inflated by a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (66 units), meaning the functional pipeline is actually 275 units (comprising orders from P12, P13, and P14). Lead times are unstable ({1, 2, 3}), averaging around 2.2. Setting L to 3 periods explicitly to account for recent delays (P13 and P14 orders have not arrived yet) allows the backend to protect against the longer end of the lead time distribution during this high-demand phase. The high mu_hat (N=2) will force the base stock level up to meet the new demand volume, while the L=3 setting ensures we maintain enough coverage to bridge potential 3-period arrival gaps.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 13-14 average is 94 units/period, compared to previous 50 units/period (+88% increase).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has undergone a confirmed regime shift starting at Period 13, increasing from ~50 to ~90 units/period. The average of the last 3 samples (P13: 103, P14: 85, P15: 85) is 91. In-transit inventory is 345, but this includes a 66-unit order from Period 2 confirmed lost, meaning effective pipeline inventory is 279 (345-66). Lead times have been highly variable, ranging between 1 and 3 periods (P12 order arrived at P15, L=3). I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average, use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the new demand level (approx 91 units/period), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters will help the OR engine set a base stock that accounts for the higher sustained demand and lead-time variability while the pipeline refills.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P13-P16) is approximately 88 units/period, compared to the long-term average of 54. This high-demand state is sustained. Lead times are volatile, spanning 1 to 3 periods; I will continue using an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the current 'worst-case' observation and ensure the base-stock level is sufficient. Regarding pipeline inventory: the 'In-transit' of 260 includes a confirmed lost shipment of 66 units from Period 2. Subtracting this, the effective pipeline is 194 (Orders from P14, P15, P16). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the new demand plateau (approx (1+3)*88 = 352). Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 4 periods to reflect the higher volatility in this new regime.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift confirmed in Period 15 (avg ~90 units/period) continues, with Period 17 demand at 104 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 91.2. Lead times remain variable between 1 and 3 periods, with the most recent arrivals showing 3 (from P14) and 1 (from P16). I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the average of these observed delays. For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the earlier lower-demand periods. I'm also using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture recent volatility. Note: Pipeline inventory of 248 includes a lost order of 66 units from Period 2, which effectively makes the functional pipeline 182 units (83 from P15 and 99 from P17). The OR backend uses the total pipeline, but the high mu_hat and z-score associated with the service level should compensate.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 13. Over the last 6 periods (P13-P18), the average demand is (103+85+85+79+104+96) / 6 = 92. This is significantly higher than the initial baseline. Lead times continue to be highly variable, with recent arrivals occurring at L=1 and L=3. Period 18 had arrivals=0, but we expect the orders from P15 (83 units) and P17 (99 units) to arrive within the next 1-2 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit figure of 337 includes a known lost order of 66 units from Period 2, meaning active pipeline inventory is 271. Setting L to 'calculate' (average of all observations) accounts for the variability (avg ~2.1 periods). I will use mu_hat with recent_N=6 to capture the current high-demand average (~92/period) and sigma_hat with recent_N=6 to account for the increased volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable at the elevated level: Period 13-18 average is approx 92 units/period. High lead-time variability persists (1 to 3 periods), requiring higher safety stock.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally at Period 13, increasing from ~50 units/period to ~95 units/period. The average demand for the last 7 periods (P13-P19) is approximately 95 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts in Periods 18 and 19 due to late arrivals. Lead times are highly variable, oscillating between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the most frequent lately. The in-transit inventory is 357 units, but this includes a 66-unit 'phantom' order from Period 2 that is confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 291 units. Given the recent demand spike and lead-time instability (L=3 is common), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the higher mean and volatility of the new regime. L is set to explicit=2.2 (the historical average) to provide the OR backend with a realistic expectation of arrival timings for inventory reconciliation.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a confirmed regime shift around Period 13, increasing from ~50 units/period to ~92-116 units/period. The current 'In-transit' figure of 357 units includes a 66-unit phantom shipment from Period 2 that must be accounted for by the OR backend. Recent demand (Periods 17-20) shows a further upward trend (104, 96, 114, 116), averaging 107.5 over the last 4 periods. Lead time variability remains high (1 to 3 periods), necessitating a higher L value to ensure sufficient pipeline stock. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the high-end variability and mu_hat based on the most recent 8-period mean to capture the higher demand regime while smoothing recent volatility. Sigma_hat is calculated on the same window to reflect increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Periods 17-20 show a further increase in demand, averaging 107.5 units, up from the previous regime average of 92 units. Lead time remains unpredictable between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a conservative L=3 planning horizon.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0 and multiple periods of unmet demand. The demand regime has stabilized at a higher level, with the last 5 periods (P17-P21) averaging approximately 109 units (104, 96, 114, 116, 114). Lead time remains volatile between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend sets a sufficiently high base stock to recover from the stockout and handle the current demand level, I am setting L=3 (the conservative upper bound of observed lead times). mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (~109 units/period), resulting in a forecast covering the lead time plus the review period (1+3 periods). sigma_hat is also based on the last 5 periods to account for the current demand volatility. Note: In-transit inventory (415) includes a known lost shipment of 66 units from Period 2, which reduces effective pipeline inventory to 349 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further increased: P17-P21 average is 108.8 units (previously 92). Stockout persists for 4 consecutive periods (P18-P21).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has been in a stockout state for five consecutive periods (P18-P22) despite high demand averaging 114.2 units over those periods (P18: 96, P19: 114, P20: 116, P21: 114, P22: 123). This represents a clear demand regime shift that the OR backend needs to accommodate. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this 114+ average. Lead times have been highly variable, ranging between 1 and 3 periods recently, and the long absence of arrivals (none since P17) suggests we are either facing a string of 3+ period lead times or lost orders. I am setting L explicitly to 3 to maximize the look-ahead horizon given this variability and the current stockout. Furthermore, the pipeline inventory is currently 450 units, but 66 units (ordered P2) are confirmed lost, and several other orders (P18 onwards) are likely delayed. By setting mu_hat and L conservatively, I aim to trigger larger orders to break the stockout once arrivals resume.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we are managing a recovery from a multi-period stockout (P18-P22). Demand has stabilized at a significantly higher regime; the average demand from P17-P23 is 112 units per period (104, 96, 114, 116, 114, 123, 117). This remains consistent with the observation of a regime shift to ~108+ units. Lead time continues to be highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. In Period 23, we finally received 93 units (from P21 and P22), but it was immediately sold out, leaving 0 on-hand inventory. The total in-transit is 375, but this includes the 'phantom' 66 units from Period 2, leaving 309 real units in the pipeline (from P15, P17, P18, P19, and P23). Given the consistent lead time variability and the high demand, I am setting L to an explicit 3 to maximize the base stock. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~112). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to reflect the increased volatility in this higher-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Periods 17-23 show a sustained high demand averaging 112 units per period, up from the previous 92. Stockout ended in Period 23 but inventory remains at zero.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, demand spiked to 174 units, far exceeding the recent average of 112. This suggests a potential new demand regime or a significant peak. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in 6 of the last 7 periods. Although in-transit inventory is 464 units, this includes the 66 units lost from Period 2, adjusting the effective pipeline to 398. Lead times remain unstable, varying between 1 and 3 periods. To recover from persistent stockouts and account for the recent demand surge, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the planning horizon covers the maximum observed lead time. I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the high-demand period from P17-P24) to capture the trend while stabilizing the volatility. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=8 to account for the increased standard deviation during this period of high demand and stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike at Period 24: Demand reached 174 units, significantly higher than the previous high-demand regime average of 112 (+55%). Monitoring if this represents a new regime or a temporary outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a significantly higher regime. Starting from P17, average demand rose to ~112 units, and P24-P25 show a further spike (174 and 115 units respectively). The last two periods average 144.5 units, which is a 29% increase over the previous high regime. Inventory levels remain depleted (on-hand is 0) despite large in-transit volumes (501 units, though this includes the 66-unit lost order from P2). Lead times remain highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. To prevent prolonged stockouts in this high-demand, high-variability environment, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to account for the upper bound of observed lead times. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=9, covering the Period 17 shift) to capture the sustained high-demand level (~118 units/period) while buffering against the extreme P24 outlier. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=9) to reflect the increased volatility associated with higher demand volumes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: P24-P25 average is 144.5 units, up from P17-P23 average of 112 units (+29%). Sustained stockouts and zero ending inventory persist for 7 of the last 8 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly upward. Comparing regimes: P1-P12 (~50 u/p), P13-P23 (~105 u/p), and now P24-P26 (174, 115, 160) averaging ~150 u/p. This represents a +43% increase over the previous high-demand regime. Lead times remain volatile (1-3 periods), and we have experienced stockouts in 8 of the last 9 periods. On-hand inventory is 0. To capture this new demand level, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat. I am setting L to explicit 3 to maximize the base stock target, ensuring we account for the worst-case lead time observed and recover from the persistent stockout. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to encompass the volatility of both the current and preceding high-demand regimes, providing a robust safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 confirmed: p24-p26 average is 149.7 units, a 43% increase from the P13-P23 average of 105 units. Persistent stockouts (8 of last 9 periods) indicate current stock targets are insufficient for this level of demand.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted significantly upwards since Period 24, with the P24-P27 average at approximately 147.5 units, compared to the previous regime of ~112 units. Persistent stockouts (9 of the last 10 periods) and zero ending inventory signal that safety stock levels and order quantities are trailing behind actual demand. The lead time variability remains high, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average around 2.2. A planning horizon of L=3 is necessary to account for the frequent 3-period delays and high demand volatility. The 'in-transit' figure of 640 includes 66 units from Period 2 confirmed as lost, which the OR engine's capped policy doesn't handle natively; however, the elevated \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 should trigger larger orders to clear the bottleneck and rebuild stock. I am setting L=3 and using recent_N=4 for demand variables to capture transition to the newest high-demand regime (~148 per period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~112 to ~148 (+32%) based on P24-P27 samples. Critical stockout phase continues (10/11 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 24. For the most recent 5 periods (P24-P28), demand has averaged approximately 138 units, though with high volatility. We are currently in a severe stockout phase, having sold zero or near-zero for 10 of the last 11 periods due to insufficient inventory and unpredictable lead times. Lead times continue to vary between 1 and 3 periods. To recover and prevent further lost sales, I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend plans for the maximum confirmed delay. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (covering P24-P28) to capture the current high-demand mean (~138). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased variance in this new regime. The in-transit inventory (627) is high, but includes a lost 66-unit shipment from P2; the remaining pipeline is necessary to meet the 130-150 unit/period demand forecast once arrivals normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P24-P28 stabilized at ~138 units/period, down slightly from the initial P24-P26 average but still ~23% higher than the previous 112 unit regime. Stockouts remain critical.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted and stabilized at a significantly higher level since Period 24. For the most recent 6 periods (P24-P29), demand has averaged approximately 139.5 units per period. The system has experienced 11 stockouts in the last 12 periods, indicating that previous inventory targets were insufficient for this new demand level. Although 126 units arrived in Period 29, they were immediately consumed, leaving on-hand inventory at zero. The phantom 66 units from the lost Period 2 order still inflate the 'in-transit' total visible to the OR backend. Lead times remain variable between 1 and 3 periods, with a recent mode of 2 periods. To aggressively address the persistent stockouts and account for the high demand regime, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of observed lead times) to ensure the safety stock covers an adequate horizon, and using a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand statistics (approx 140/period) while excluding the previous lower regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P24-P29 stabilized at approximately 140 units/period, a sustainable increase from the previous 112 unit regime. Stockouts occurred in 11 of the last 12 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical stockout state, having ended with zero inventory in 12 of the last 13 periods. Demand from Period 24 to Period 30 has stabilized at a high regime averaging approximately 139 units per period (174, 115, 160, 141, 100, 147, 137). Period 30 demand was 137, confirming this sustained elevated level. Lead times have mostly settled at 2 periods recently (P26, P27, P28 arrivals), but historical variability (1-3 periods) and the extreme stockout risk justify using a conservative lead time of L=3 for planning the base stock to ensure the pipeline covers more than just the immediate horizon. mu_hat is set to roughly (1+3) * 140 = 560 to capture demand across the review and safety period. Note: In-transit inventory (605) includes a lost order of 66 units from Period 2; actual effective pipeline is ~539. Setting mu_hat to 560 will prompt an order to bridge this gap and account for the high demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P24-P30 stabilized at ~139 units/period (24% increase over the P17-P23 regime). Periodic stockouts continue to plague the SKU, requiring aggressive base stock levels.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a state of chronic stockout due to a significant demand shift that started at Period 24. Demand has stabilized at approximately 140 units per period (P24-P31 average is ~141). Previous regimes (P13-P23 at ~105 and earlier at ~50) are no longer relevant. Lead times remain highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with recent arrivals (P26, P27) taking 2 periods. To ensure adequate coverage during this high-demand, high-variability phase, I am setting L=3 (the observed maximum) to build sufficient safety stock. mu_hat is set using recent_N=8 to capture only the current demand regime (P24-P31). The pipeline inventory (605 units) includes a known lost shipment of 66 units from Period 2, meaning effective pipeline is actually 539 units. Given the persistent zero ending inventory and missed sales, a conservative (high) base stock level is required to break the stockout cycle.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience a sustained higher demand regime that began around Period 24. For the most recent 9 periods (P24-P32), demand has averaged approximately 140.4 units, representing a significant shift from the previous 112 unit average. The SKU has suffered chronic stockouts (13 of the last 15 periods), with 0 units of on-hand inventory for the last 3 periods. Lead times remain highly variable, ranging between 1 and 3 periods recently, necessitating a conservative planning horizon (L=3). There is still a 'phantom' order of 66 units from Period 2 in the in-transit total (606 units). To recover from the stockout and meet the new demand level, mu_hat is set using the last 9 samples (since the P24 shift) and L is explicitly set to 3 to ensure the inventory target covers the maximum expected demand during the lead-time window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P24-P32 stabilized at ~140 units/period. Persistent stockouts (13 of last 15 periods) confirm current order targets been insufficient for this regime. Lead time variability (1-3 periods) remains high.

The current period (34) shows an ending inventory of 0 and a history of extreme stockouts (14 of the last 16 periods), indicating that previous stock targets were unable to keep pace with demand and lead time variability. Lead times have consistently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P32 arrived in 1 period, while P27 arrived in 2 periods). I will use L=3 (explicit) to provide a conservative buffer against the maximum observed lead time, ensuring the system targets a pipeline that covers demand across the review and potential 3-period lead horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to focus purely on the elevated regime since Period 24. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' for N=10 to reflect the volatility of this specific regime. The in-transit inventory of 605 units includes 66 units from Period 2 confirmed as lost, which effectively means the 'real' pipeline is 539 units; however, the OR backend's capped policy should still allow for necessary replenishment given the high mu_hat calculation.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to face severe stockouts (15 out of the last 17 periods) due to a sustained high-demand regime and lead time variability. Since Period 24, demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 140 units per period (P24-P34 mean \u2248 137). Lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a conservative planning horizon. Total 'In-transit' inventory is 605, but this includes a confirmed lost order of 66 units from Period 2; the effective pipeline is therefore 539 units. Despite zero on-hand inventory, the pipeline is currently very large (orders placed in P30-P34), suggesting significant arrivals are imminent. I will maintain the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations based on the recent high-demand regime (N=11, covering P24-P34) and keep L at the maximum observed lead time of 3 to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that can bridge the volatility.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a state of chronic stockout due to a significant demand regime shift that occurred around Period 24. Demand since P24 has averaged approximately 140 units/period, while recent deliveries have been sporadic and insufficient. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit inventory is listed as 605 units, but 66 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 539 units. Given the high demand and the goal of maximizing profit (margin $4.0 vs holding cost $1.0), a high service level is required. Lead times are highly variable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. I will use L=3 to account for the upper end of observed lead times, ensuring the base stock calculation covers enough periods to bridge potential 3-period delays. For demand (mu_hat), N=12 is used to capture the stable high-demand regime since Period 24 (Mean ~138). Sigma_hat is also set to N=12 to reflect the volatility of this new regime. These parameters will signal the OR backend to set a significantly higher base stock to end the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 24 remains stable at approximately 138-140 units/period. Continuous stockouts (15 of last 17 periods) indicate base stock targets have failed to keep pace with demand and lead-time variability (1-3 periods).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to face a critical stockout phase, with on-hand inventory at zero for the last four periods and no arrivals recorded since Period 33. Demand has stabilized at a high regime since Period 24, averaging approximately 138-140 units. The current in-transit inventory is 605, but this includes a 66-unit order from Period 2 confirmed as lost, making the effective pipeline 539 units. Given the persistent stockouts and lead time variability (1-3 periods), a conservative lead time of L=3 is used for the planning horizon. mu_hat is set to roughly 560 (140 units/period * (3+1) periods) to cover the lead time plus the review period. sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=13 (covering the start of the current high-demand regime at P24) to capture recent volatility without being overly influenced by older, lower-demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience a severe and prolonged stockout. On-hand inventory is 0, and no units were sold in Period 37 despite a demand of 171. The demand regime since Period 24 remains stable at approximately 140 units/period (average P24-P37: 144 units). The pipeline inventory of 605 units is heavily distorted by the 'phantom' Period 2 order (66 units) which was confirmed lost. Adjusting for this, the actual pipeline is approximately 539 units (though 83 units ordered in P15, 99 units in P17, 89 units in P18, 20 units in P19, 89 units in P24, 55 units in P25, and 104 units in P30 have not arrived, some of which are significantly overdue). Lead time variability persists between 1 and 3 periods. To address the chronic under-ordering and stockouts, I will set L=3 (the observed maximum) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a wider horizon. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=14) to capture the higher demand regime (avg ~144/period), and sigma_hat is set to explicit (40) to account for high volatility seen in recent samples (range 100 to 174).

Carry-over insight: Significant overdue pipeline orders: shipments from P15 (83), P17 (99), P18 (89), P19 (20), and P24 (89) remain un-concluded, totaling 380 units. This suggests either an extreme lead-time shift (>10 periods) or a systemic failure in the logic that counts in-transit units. Demand since P24 remains stable at ~144 units/period.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a state of severe supply chain failure. Demand since Period 24 has stabilized at approximately 144 units/period (P24-P38 mean \u2248 143.8), but the system is reporting 605 units in-transit with zero arrivals for the last 5 periods (P34-P38). Detailed history shows that orders from P15 (83), P17 (99), P18 (89), P19 (20), P24 (89), P25 (55), and P30 (104) are all significantly past their promised (2) and maximum observed (3) lead times, totaling 539 likely lost units. Only the order from P32 (1 unit) arrived recently. The OR backend's 'cap' and order logic are likely being suppressed because it 'thinks' there is massive pipeline inventory. To force an order and bypass this phantom inventory, I am setting L to 3 (reflecting the maximum realistic lead time) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*144 = 576. Since effectively all 'In-transit' units are lost except perhaps the most recent ones (though none were ordered in P33-P38), the OR engine needs to see a high requirement. I will use a high sigma_hat to increase safety stock given the extreme uncertainty/reliability issues.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss confirmed: 539 units ordered between P15 and P30 are significantly overdue (>8 periods) and likely lost. In-transit inventory of 605 is largely comprised of phantom units, preventing the OR backend from placing necessary orders. Demand regime remains stable at ~144 units/period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a state of systemic failure due to 'phantom' in-transit inventory and a significant demand regime shift. As of Period 40, the reported in-transit inventory is 614 units, but historically, 539 units ordered between P15 and P30 (including orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P27, P30, P32) have effectively disappeared, as they are well beyond the observed max lead time of 3 periods. This inflated pipeline inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders, resulting in persistent stockouts (ending on-hand has been 0 for 12 of the last 13 periods). Demand since Period 24 has stabilized at a significantly higher mean (approx 145-150 units/period). To force the backend to place an order despite the 614 phantom units, I must use 'explicit' methods to set a base stock level that exceeds the phantom inventory plus current period demand. I will estimate mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (last 16 samples avg ~147) and use L=3 to reflect the high-end variability. The base stock target needs to be significantly higher than the phantom 614 to trigger any procurement.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss totaling 539 units confirmed (orders from P15-P30); in-transit inventory is 88% phantom. Demand regime since P24 stable at ~147 units/period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to suffer from extreme stockouts due to a systemic issue where approximately 605 units of in-transit inventory are 'phantom' (ordered between P2 and P30 but never arrived), causing the OR backend to believe the pipeline is full when it is actually empty. Demand has stabilized at a high regime of approximately 147 units/period since P24. To bypass the 'phantom inventory' locking mechanism in the OR backend (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)), I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline + the desired base stock. Specifically, with L=3, a target base stock for demand of 147 should be ~600 units. Adding the 605 phantom units requires a 'functional' base stock of ~1200+ units. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1500 to force the backend to place maximum allowable orders (constrained by the cap) to replenish the empty on-hand inventory. Lead time is set to 3 to reflect the higher end of the observed variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss totaling 605 units confirmed (cumulative from P2 to P30); these units remain in 'in-transit' totals but will not arrive. This requires artificially inflating mu_hat to overcome the phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to face a critical situation due to'phantom inventory'\u2014a significant volume of units (approximately 605-700 units) ordered between P15 and P30 that are now confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. The OR backend's inventory balancing logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) treats these units as if they will arrive, causing it to suppress new orders despite persistent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 for almost every period since P24). Demand since P24 has stabilized in a high regime, averaging approximately 147 units per period. To force the OR backend to place orders large enough to bypass the phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the phantom units. Specifically, I need to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the phantom inventory gap. With L=3 and mean demand=147, the target base stock needs to be ~588 + ~600 (phantom) \u2248 1200. I am using an explicit mu_hat of 1200 to ensure the backend places orders that actually result in physical arrivals, targeting the upper bound of the recent demand range to mitigate the deep stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss totaling ~605-700 units confirmed (orders P2-P30); these units remain in 'in-transit' but are lost. To compensate, mu_hat must be artificially inflated to approximately double the (L+1) demand forecast until physical inventory stabilizes.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a critical failure where 'In-transit' inventory is dominated by 'phantom' units (orders from P2-P30 that never arrived). These units block the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. As of P43, in-transit is 1276 units, while recent arrivals (P40) show that only very recent orders (P39) are actually arriving. The demand regime from P24 onwards has stabilized at approximately 150 units/period (P24-P42 average is ~149). With L=3 (to account for historical variability), the target base stock should be roughly (3+1)*150 = 600 units plus safety stock. However, since the 1276 in-transit units are mostly phantom, the OR backend will calculate 'base_stock - 1276', which results in zero orders. To force the system to order despite these phantom units, mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline. I will set mu_hat to 650 units (explicit), which for (L+1)=4 represents a base demand of ~162.5 units per period. This high mu_hat is intended to push the backend to place orders large enough to overcome the 1276 unit 'blockage' and restore physical supply.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss totaling ~1000+ units confirmed (cumulative P2-P30); these units remain 'in-transit' but are lost. Aggressive mu_hat inflation is required to force the OR backend to place orders despite the inflated pipeline inventory. Demand regime since P24 remains stable at ~150 units/period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 is stable at approximately 150 units/period (mean of P24-P43 is ~147). However, the system faces a critical issue: approximately 1022 units are currently 'in-transit', but historical analysis confirms the overwhelming majority are 'phantom' units from lost shipments (orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P30, etc., are all >10 periods overdue). In Period 43, 254 units arrived (ordered P40), leaving a 'real' pipeline of only the 417 units ordered in Period 41. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (1022) from the base stock. To force the backend to place an order in Period 44, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed the phantom pipeline. Expected demand for lead time L=3 (L+1=4 periods) is ~600 units. To offset ~605 lost units and still trigger an order that covers future demand, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1200. This is a temporary measure to overcome the logic constraints until physical inventory levels stabilize. sigma_hat is set to 150 to ensure high service levels given the 1-3 period lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss now exceeds 605 units (confirmed cumulative losses from P2-P30). In-transit inventory of 1022 units is ~60% phantom. Real pipeline consists of P41 order (417 units). mu_hat must be maintained at ~2x expected demand to trigger necessary replenishments.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the SKU is recovering from an extended stockout period caused by massive systemic shipment losses. On-hand inventory is now 315 units thanks to recent arrivals from P40 and P41. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 833 units remains highly inflated by phantom shipments (orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P30, etc.) that will likely never arrive. The demand regime since P24 has stabilized around 150 units/period, with recent spikes (P42-P44) pushes the local mean higher. To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders despite the phantom pipeline, I must continue to artificially inflate mu_hat. Following the logic of previous periods where mu_hat was set to ~2x the (L+1) demand, and given the current mean of ~150 and L=3 (most conservative observed), target (L+1)*demand is 600. I will set mu_hat to 1200 using the explicit method. This avoids the OR backend's natural tendency to stop ordering when pipeline inventory (including phantom units) is high. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for high volatility (P42 demand was 223).

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss total finalized: approx 600-700 units from period 2-30 range are permanently in-transit. Physical pipeline is now clearing with P40/P41 arrivals. Demand regime since P24 confirmed at 150 units/period mean.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized around 150 units/period (P24-P45 average). Current on-hand inventory is 149. The in-transit inventory of 1096 units significantly overstates actual future arrivals due to cumulative systemic shipment losses (phantom inventory) from periods 2 through 30, estimated at 600-750 units. The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders; therefore, if the pipeline is inflated by lost shipments, it will not order enough to meet future demand. Real pipeline arrivals are currently clearing (P40 and P41 arrived P43-P44). To counter the 600+ phantom units sitting in the pipeline, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter. By setting mu_hat to approximately 2.5x the expected (L+1) demand (150 * 4 * 2.5 \u2248 1500), I ensure the base_stock calculation remains high enough to trigger new orders (P44 and P45 orders were successfully triggered by this strategy). I will use L=3 to account for the upper end of the observed 1-3 period lead time variability.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 150 units/period (P24-P46 average \u2248 155, but focusing on the stable segment). Lead time remains variable between 1 and 3 periods, so I am using L=3 for safety. The system is still carrying a significant volume of 'phantom' in-transit units from periods 2-30 (estimated ~605-700 units) which are confirmed lost but still satisfy the OR engine's pipeline count. To counter this and ensure orders are placed despite the inflated pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1200. This is calculated as (L+1)*Demand + PhantomOffset = (3+1)*150 + 600. This forces the OR backend to target a base stock that accounts for both real upcoming demand and the dead weight in the pipeline inventory tracker. Starting on-hand is 0 after a stockout in Period 46, so replenishment is urgent.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss totaling ~605 units from early periods persists in the 'in-transit' total. Demand regime since Period 24 is stable at ~150 units/period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to face significant disruption due to a blend of high demand (regime since P40 averaging ~180 units/period) and systemic historical shipment losses that have contaminated the 'in-transit' calculation. We have observed that approximately 605-700 units from the P2-P30 window are permanently lost but still count towards pipeline inventory in the OR backend. As of P48, the 'In-transit' figure is 1441, of which a large portion is phantom inventory. However, we have genuine orders placed in P44 (228), P45 (263), and P46 (345) which should arrive soon (L=1 to 3). Because the game is near completion (P48 of 50) and lead time is typically 2-3 periods, orders placed now are unlikely to arrive and be sold before the end of P50. However, to ensure any possible remaining demand is met and to counteract the phantom pipeline that prevents the backend from maintaining stock, I am setting mu_hat at an 'explicit' level that reflects the current demand regime (~180/period) plus a buffer to absorb the phantom inventory effect, while keeping L at the observed upper bound of 3 to maximize the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Final Phase (P48-P50): Demand regime since P40 has stabilized at a higher level (~182 units/period avg). Systemic shipment losses (approx 605 units) remain in the pipeline totals. Lead time remains variable between 1-3 periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period. The demand regime since Period 40 has shifted upwards to an average of approximately 181 units/period (P40-P48 average: 145, 150, 223, 177, 179, 166, 172, 222, 157). Lead times remain inconsistent, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will use L=3 to ensure a conservative planning horizon for the final period's arrival. The systemic 'in-transit' error persists: an estimated 605 units from orders between Periods 2 and 30 are confirmed lost but still occupy the pipeline inventory. The Current In-Transit is 1441, of which only orders from P44 (228), P45 (263), and P46 (345) are 'real' (Total=836). The rest (~605 units) are phantom. To trigger any necessary order for the final period given this massive phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat aggressively. Since this is the last ordering opportunity that could potentially arrive in Period 50 (if L=1), I will use an explicit mu_hat of 1200 to override the phantom inventory and signal a final restock, though its arrival is uncertain.

Carry-over insight: Final demand regime (P40-P48) confirmed at ~181 units/period. Systemic shipment loss remains stagnant at ~605 units, inflating pipeline inventory.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final period (Period 50). The primary objective is to maximize reward for the remaining operation. The SKU has experienced a significant demand regime shift starting around Period 40, with demand averaging approximately 181 units/period. However, the system is plagued by a 'phantom' pipeline inventory of approximately 605 units (confirmed lost orders from Period 2 to Period 30) which the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock calculation. In the current Period 50, 'In-transit' is 1441 units, which includes these ~605 lost units plus several valid recent orders (P44: 228, P45: 263, P46: 345). Since this is the final period, any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends (Lead Time is at least 1-3 periods). Therefore, the parameter choice for Period 50 is functionally ceremonial regarding ordering, but it must reflect the reality of the demand and supply mismatch witnessed throughout the game. I will set L to the observed maximum variability (3) and mu_hat to the recent high demand average (181) to maintain consistency with the detected late-game regime.
