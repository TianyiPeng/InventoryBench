Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 5 periods (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) shows an upward trend with a mean of approximately 49.6. Since we have no inventory on hand and the promised lead time (L) is 2, the total lead-time-plus-review demand coverage needs to span 3 periods (L+1). Given there is no observation history yet and we are at the very beginning of the game, I will use the 'default' methods to establish a baseline based on all available historical data samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 71 units, but with a promised lead time of 2 periods, we expect these to arrive during Period 3 (visible in Period 4). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 71 units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 samples was [30, 49, 48, 65, 56], averaging 49.6. Period 1 actual demand was 50, which aligns perfectly with this mean. There is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 2 periods, nor that the demand regime has shifted. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the local average of the provided history and 'default' for lead time.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been P1: 50, P2: 91. The input demand data provided in the prompt (30, 49) appears to be overwritten by the 'Game History' (50, 91). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the orders from P1 (71 units) and P2 (66 units) are still in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the sequence, the P1 order (placed in P1) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival resolution and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of P4. Demand is showing an upward trend (50 to 91). I will use a recent_N approach to capture this recent increase in demand while setting L to default (2). The system needs to cover current and lead-time demand (L+1 = 3 periods).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The historical demand for chips(Regular) has been P1: 50, P2: 91, P3: 60 (mean = 67). Despite placing orders in P1 (71 units), P2 (66 units), and P3 (117 units), nothing has arrived yet ('arrived=0' in all conclude messages). Per the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from P1 was expected to arrive during P3 and be visible now. Its absence suggests either a variance in lead time or the start of a delay. Total in-transit is 254 units. Since we currently have 0 on-hand and have been losing sales entirely (sold=0), we need to maintain a robust order pipeline. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand volatility (mean 67, std ~21). For lead time, I'll stick to 'default' (2) for now as we only have one potential 'late' shipment from P1, which is not yet a 'sustained' pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3); Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). Period 2's order of 66 units is still in-transit (it has been 3 periods since the order). The promised lead time is 2, but the actual lead times are volatile (1 and 3). Demand over the first 5 periods has been [30, 49, 48, 65, 56] (Note: the 'conclude' demand messages in the prompt history show higher values like 91 and 60, but the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section provides the baseline samples which I will prioritize). The average demand is approximately 50 units. Starting on-hand is 138, and 66 units are in-transit. Given the lead time variability (average 2, but ranges 1-3) and the potential for the Period 2 order to be lost or delayed, I will use L=2 (default) but set mu_hat to cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. Mean demand is ~50, so mu_hat should be around 150. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu and sigma to capture the current demand regime.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 5 periods is [30, 49, 48, 65, 56] (based on the historical samples provided in the prompt, which differ from the noisy demand observed in 'conclude' messages, but provide the underlying trend). The mean demand is approximately 50 units. Promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times observed are 3 (for Period 1 order) and 1 (for Period 3 order), averaging 2. The Period 2 order (quantity 66) is still in transit (placed in P2, promised P4, currently P6 start). This suggests a possible delay or variability in lead time. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the observed average lead time of 2. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior and variability. On-hand (68) + In-transit (72) = 140, which covers nearly 3 periods of average demand (approx 150 units), keeping the inventory position safe but lean given the holding costs.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 6 (demand 70, sold 68). The in-transit pipeline is 165 units (orders from P2, P5, and P6). Regarding lead times: the P1 order arrived in P4 (lead_time=3), while the P3 order also arrived in P4 (lead_time=1). The P2 order (placed in P2) is still missing as of P6 conclude, meaning it has exceeded the promised lead time of 2 and the observed lead time of 3 for P1. This suggests instability in the supply chain or a potential lost shipment for P2. Demand has shown an upward trend: early periods (P1-P3) averaged ~67, while recent periods (P4-P6) averaged ~63 with back-to-back demands of 70. However, cumulative historical demand provided (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) combined with the game history (50, 91, 60, 50, 70, 70) suggests a mean around 60-65. Given the stockout and the uncertainty of the P2 shipment, I will use recent_N for both demand (N=5) and lead time (N=2) to capture the current volatility and the longer average lead time observed.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. Looking at the history, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has trended upwards: Period 1-3 average was ~67, but Periods 4-7 average is ~74, with a peak of 106 in Period 7. Regarding lead times, Promised L=2. However, observed lead times were 3 (Period 1 order) and 1 (Period 3 order), averaging 2. The Period 2 order (66 units) is currently 5 periods overdue based on promise, which is a significant delay/loss signal. Subsequent orders (P5, P6, P7) totaling 193 units are in-transit. Because demand is accelerating and we have zero on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the higher recent demand of ~74/period. Since the lead time average is 2 but variance is high, I will use L=2 (default) but increase sigma_hat by using a smaller recent window (N=3) to account for the increased volatility in both demand and delivery performance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability noted: P1 order took 3 periods, P2 order is overdue (5+ periods), P3 order took 1 period. Demand showing upward trend; avg demand increased from ~67 to ~74 over recent periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $225.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the on-hand inventory is 35 units with 159 units in-transit. Lead time is highly volatile: we've seen lead times of 1 period (P3, P7) and 3 periods (P1, P5), while the P2 (ordered 66) and P6 (ordered 93) shipments remain missing/overdue. The average lead time of concluded orders is (3+1+3+1)/4 = 2 periods, but the instability and missing orders pose a stockout risk. Demand history (50, 91, 60, 50, 70, 70, 106, 65) shows an average demand of approximately 70.25 units over 8 periods. Given the volatility in both demand and supply arrival, I will set L to 'calculate' to capture the average behavior and use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (N=5) to reflect the slightly higher recent activity (mean ~72), which provides a buffer against the inconsistent shipment arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability persists: alternating between 1 and 3 periods for successful arrivals. Shipments from P2 (66 units) and P6 (93 units) are significantly overdue/potentially lost, contributing to inconsistent in-transit levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 266 units in-transit. Historical lead times show extreme instability, alternating between 1 period and 3 periods, while orders from Period 2 (66 units) and Period 6 (93 units) are significantly overdue (8 and 4 periods since ordering, respectively) and likely lost. The in-transit total of 266 units includes these potentially lost 159 units, meaning the effective pipeline is likely only 107 units (from Period 9). Demand is trending upwards, with the last 5 periods averaging 79.8 units compared to the overall average of 72.2. To account for the unreliability of the pipeline and the rising demand, I am setting L to 3 (the observed upper bound of successful deliveries) and using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent demand surge for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will force the OR backend to target a higher base stock to compensate for the lost units currently cluttering the pipeline inventory calculation.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 2 (66 units) and Period 6 (93 units) are highly likely lost given they are 8 and 4 periods overdue respectively, while other orders have arrived within 1-3 periods. Effective pipeline is likely 159 units lower than system reported 'In-transit'.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a mean demand of approximately 69.7 units per period across all 10 periods, with more recent demand (last 5 periods) averaging 75.2 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 348 units in-transit, but historical analysis suggests that the Period 2 order (66 units) and Period 6 order (93 units) are highly likely lost, as they are 8 and 4 periods overdue respectively, while others arrive in 1-3 periods. This reduces the 'effective' pipeline from 348 to 189 (Period 9: 107 units, Period 10: 82 units). To compensate for the lost 159 units and prevent stockouts, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to signal a higher base stock requirement. I am using L=2 (promised) but adjusting mu_hat to (1+L)*E[D] + lost_units. Projected base stock = (1+2)*75 + 159 = 384. This ensures the backend orders enough to cover the gap between the reported in-transit and the actual expected arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 2 (66 units) and Period 6 (93 units) are confirmed lost (surpassing double the worst-case lead time with newer orders arriving). Effective pipeline is system reported 'In-transit' minus 159 units.

Analysis of arrival history shows that orders from Period 2 (66 units) and Period 6 (93 units) are significantly overdue (now 10 and 6 periods respectively) while subsequent orders from Period 5 and 7 arrived within 1-3 periods. Consistent with carry-over insights, these 159 units are likely lost. The system reports 417 units in-transit, but the 'Effective Pipeline' is only 258 units. To compensate for this 159-unit shortfall that the OR backend cannot see, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for a 3-period window (L=2) using the recent demand mean of ~70 units (3 * 70 = 210) plus a safety buffer, then add the 159 lost units to this target to force the backend to place a corrective order. Current demand fluctuates between 47 and 106, averaging 69.4 over the last 11 periods. I've set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (1 to 3 periods).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 77, and the system reports 258 units in-transit. However, based on the historical logs and Carry-over Insights, shipments from Period 2 (66 units) and Period 6 (93 units) are over 6 periods late and effectively lost. This means the real pipeline inventory is 258 - 159 = 99 units. This 99 contains orders from P11 (69) and P12 (30). To compensate for these lost units in the OR backend's single-SKU base stock calculation (which subtracts the full 258 in-transit), I must explicitly increase mu_hat and decrease L. By setting L to 1 (below the actual average) and increasing mu_hat, I force the base_stock calculation to be higher, effectively offsetting the phantom inventory the OR engine thinks we have. The average demand across the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 75.6. Given the lost shipments and the need to restore inventory levels, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 250 (roughly 3 periods of demand) to ensure a substantial order is triggered despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 following a stockout in Period 13 where demand (118) exceeded starting inventory (77). The system reports an 'In-transit' total of 258 units, which consists of orders from Period 2 (66), Period 11 (69), Period 12 (30), and Period 13 (0 units ordered, but Period 6's 93 units are also missing). As identified in Carry-Over Insights, orders from Period 2 (66 units) and Period 6 (93 units) are lost (total 159 units). Thus, the effective pipeline is only 99 units (Period 11: 69, Period 12: 30). Observed lead times are inconsistent (1, 2, or 3 periods). I will set L=3 (explicit) to account for the longest observed delay and ensure the base stock covers enough time. Demand is trending upward, with recent periods (P12 & P13) showing 112 and 118 respectively. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent high-demand regime while filtering out the lower early-game samples.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline remains significantly lower than system 'In-transit' due to the confirmed loss of Period 2 (66) and Period 6 (93) shipments. Recent demand (P12-P13) has spiked to over 110 units, compared to the previous average of ~74.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a demand surge (P12-P14 avg: 110.3) well above the previous regime (~74). The system reports 'In-transit' as 325, but 159 of these units (orders from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 166 units (325 - 159). These 166 units represent orders from P12 (30) and P14 (136). To stabilize inventory, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~110). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (actual L ranges from 1 to 3). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility of the recent period. These parameters will trigger a replenishment order that accounts for the lost shipments while aligning with the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 12: avg increased from ~74 to ~110 (+48%). Lead time remains volatile between 1-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 status: On-hand inventory is 0. System reports 457 units in-transit, but 159 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 298 units. Demand has shifted significantly upward starting at Period 12; the average for the last 4 periods (P12-P15) is 106.25, a 43% increase over the previous average of ~74. Lead times remain erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.5). To address the stockouts and higher demand, I am using mu_hat recent_N=4 to capture the new demand regime (approx 106 units/period). With L=3 (explicitly set to account for the observed maximum lead time and recent delays), the backend will target a base stock to cover (1+3) periods of demand. The OR engine's capped policy will subtract the system's in-transit (457) from this base stock; by overestimating demand via 'explicit' or using 'recent_N', I aim to force an order that compensates for the 'phantom' 159 units in the pipeline that will never arrive.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and persistent demand of approximately 100-110 units (the last 5 periods averaged 102.6). The current 'In-transit' of 457 units is artificially inflated by lost shipments from Period 2 (66 units) and Period 6 (93 units), totaling 159 phantom units. The true effective pipeline is 298 units (457 - 159). Since Period 12, demand has shifted upwards from ~74 to over 100, necessitating a mu_hat based on this recent regime (N=5). Lead times are erratic, oscillating between 1, 2, and 3 periods; I will use L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum observed lead time, preventing stockouts during longer delivery cycles. The backend cap and base stock calculation will now use these adjusted parameters to replenishment based on the true pipeline of 298 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $429.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: On-hand inventory is 23 units. The system reports 321 units in-transit, but based on historical tracking (Carry-over insights), 159 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost. The 'true' pipeline is therefore 162 units (the order from Period 15). Demand has undergone a regime shift since Period 12, with a recent mean of approximately 104 units (averaging P12-P17: 112, 118, 101, 94, 88, 113). Lead times remain highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being common for delayed shipments. To ensure sufficient stock under this higher demand regime and uncertain lead time, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent maximum lead time observed. I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to capture the higher demand level (~104 units/period). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=6 to reflect the current volatility. By using L=3 and recent demand, the OR backend's base-stock target will likely rise, prompting an order that offsets the ghost inventory from lost shipments and addresses the demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Demand regime since P12 remains stable at ~104 units/period. Ghost inventory (lost shipments) from P2 and P6 still accounts for 159 units of the system-reported 'In-transit' total.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 12 has stabilized at a higher level, averaging approximately 106 units per period (112, 118, 101, 94, 88, 113, 116). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 415 units, but this includes 159 units from Period 2 (66) and Period 6 (93) that were confirmed lost/highly overdue. Thus, the effective pipeline is only 256 units (415 - 159). To compensate for this 'ghost inventory' and prevent the OR backend's internal order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) from under-ordering, I will use an 'explicit' L to reflect the volatile arrival pattern (averaging 3 periods recently) and an 'explicit' mu_hat. The mu_hat is calculated to satisfy the backend logic: I want the target stock (base_stock) to cover (L+1) periods of demand, but I must also artificially increase mu_hat by the lost 159 units so that when the OR engine subtracts the full 415 in-transit units, it still places an order that covers our actual needs. Calculation: Recent Mean (106) * (3+1) = 424. Adjustment for lost units: 424 + 159 = 583. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to capture current volatility.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 12, with an average of approximately 108 units (P12-P19). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The system-reported 'In-transit' of 581 units includes 159 units from Period 2 (66) and Period 6 (93) that are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 422 units (581 - 159). Observed lead times have consistently ranged between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being a frequent occurrence for successful arrivals recently. To prevent stockouts in this high-demand, high-uncertainty environment, I will use an explicit lead time L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers sufficient future demand. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the stable high-demand regime since Period 12. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=8 to reflect current demand volatility. By setting L to 3, I am signaling the OR backend that the pipeline needs to support (L+1)=4 periods of demand, which helps offset the perceived but non-existent 'lost' inventory in the pipeline balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P12 remains stable at ~108 units/period. The 'In-transit' figure consistently overestimates the true pipeline by 159 units due to lost shipments from P2 and P6.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand has stabilized at a higher regime (~108 units/period) since Period 12. Lead times remain variable, typically between 2-3 periods (e.g., P14 took 3, P11 took 3, P12 took 3). Crucially, the system 'In-transit' of 581 units is inflated by 159 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P2 and P6), meaning the effective pipeline is actually 422 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To compensate for the 'ghost inventory' and the higher demand regime, I will use an explicit L of 3 (the upper end of the observed lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longer delays. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (Periods 12-20). By setting L to 3 explicitly, the OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will trigger a higher base stock requirement. While the backend still counts the 159 ghost units, the increased L and mu_hat help mitigate the resulting stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: No new patterns detected; previous insights regarding ghost inventory (159 units) and demand regime shift (~108 units/period) remain valid.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am managing a period of stockouts with 0 on-hand inventory. The system reports 581 units in-transit, but 159 of these (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 422 units. Since Period 12, the demand regime has shifted upward, with a mean of approximately 114 units/period (based on P12-P21). Period 21 saw a significant spike to 155 units. Given the volatile lead time (averaging ~2.4 periods for successful arrivals) and the current stockout, I must ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of this higher demand regime. To account for the 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) without over-ordering, I will use an 'explicit' L to signal the backend that the pipeline needs to be replenished more aggressively. Setting L = 3.5 (explicit) effectively increases the base stock (approx 513 units) so the OR engine orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' count. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher demand since Period 12.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (since Period 12) is consistently high, averaging approximately 114 units per period (last 5 periods: 116, 122, 111, 155, 117). The current 'In-transit' of 581 units includes 159 units from Period 2 and Period 6 that are confirmed lost (ghost inventory). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 422 units (581 - 159). With on-hand inventory at 0 and widespread stockouts (sold 0 for the last 4 periods), there is an urgent need to increase the base stock level to replenish the pipeline and satisfy the new higher demand regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=11, covering the high demand regime since P12) and increasing sigma_hat to account for recent volatility (P21 saw 155 units). L is set to 'calculate' to account for the observed variability between 1-3 periods, which helps the OR engine build a buffer for lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P12 onwards is now averaging ~114 units/period, showing slightly higher intensity than the previous estimate of ~108.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 24. We are facing a severe stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Since the demand regime shift at Period 12, the average demand is approximately 114 units/period (P12-P23 avg). Lead times are volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods. Most critically, previous 'Carry-over Insights' confirm that 159 units (from P2 and P6) are lost but still counted in the system's 'In-transit' figure of 581. This makes the effective pipeline only 422 units. To compensate for this 'ghost inventory' and the high demand (currently ~114 units), I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to manually bridge the gap. Specifically, to reach an effective base stock that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand plus the 159 units the OR engine incorrectly assumes it has, the mu_hat should target ((3+1) * 114) + 159 = 615 units. This ensures the OR backend places an order despite the inflated in-transit value. L is set to 3 to reflect the worst-case observed lead time, given recent instabilities.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 25. The demand regime shift at Period 12 is sustained, with average demand from P12-P24 being approximately 114 units/period, with a higher peak in P21 (155). I will use recent_N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect this regime. Regarding lead time, the system-reported 'In-transit' of 644 units is misleading due to 'ghost inventory'. P2 (66 units) and P6 (93 units) are definitively lost (over 18 periods overdue). This means 159 units of the 644 in-transit units do not exist. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 485 units. Additionally, the last confirmed arrival was in Period 17. Looking at recent history, orders from Period 15 (162 units), Period 18 (94 units), Period 19 (166 units), and Period 24 (63 units) are pending. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the phantom pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' L to shorten the look-ahead window and 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the base stock is calculated high enough to overcome the 159-unit deficit. Specifically, setting L=3 (the max observed functional lead time) and mu_hat to 620 units (covering 4 periods of ~114 demand + the 159 lost units: 114*4 + 159 = 615). Sigma is kept at recent_N to handle volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply chain disruption: No arrivals observed between Period 18 and Period 24 despite large orders in transit. Target inventory level must remain high to account for 159 units of lost 'ghost inventory' appearing in system 'In-transit' counts.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe disruption with no arrivals recorded since Period 17, and the on-hand inventory remains at 0. Currently, 648 units are listed as 'In-transit', but we must subtract the 159 units of 'ghost inventory' from Period 2 (66 units) and Period 6 (93 units), leaving an effective pipeline of 489 units. Since Period 12, demand has stabilized at a higher regime, averaging approximately 117 units per period (N=14). Given that multiple large orders (Period 15: 162, Period 18: 94, Period 19: 166) are significantly overdue, the 'explicit' lead time is increased to 6 to account for these delays and ensure the OR backend generates orders that compensate for the supply gap. mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 14 to capture the high-demand regime established since Period 12. These parameters aim to build a robust inventory position to recover from the stockout as soon as shipments resume.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain congestion: No arrivals observed for 8 consecutive periods (P18-P25), with effective pipeline now lagging behind historical Lead Time performance. Demand regime (P12-P25) stabilized at ~117 units/period.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe bottleneck, with no arrivals recorded for 9 consecutive periods (P18-P26), despite a reported 'In-transit' of 793 units. Of this total, 159 units (from P2 and P6) are long-confirmed lost ('ghost inventory'). The actual effective pipeline is roughly 634 units. Demand has shifted into a higher regime starting around Period 12, with recent samples averaging approximately 117 units per period. To account for the 'ghost inventory' which the OR backend incorrectly views as incoming units, I must artificially inflate the base stock level. By setting L to 'explicit' at 4 (representing the current observed delivery delay + buffer), and mu_hat using 'recent_N' (N=15, covering the high-demand regime since P12), I ensure the target inventory stays high enough to trigger replenishment despite the large (but partially phantom) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply chain bottleneck persists: 9 periods (P18-P26) without any arrivals. Demand regime (P12-P26) is stable at ~117 units/period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe bottleneck, with no arrivals recorded for 10 consecutive periods (P18-P27) and on-hand inventory remaining at 0. Historical arrivals showed lead times of 1-3 periods, but the current delay suggests a significant disruption. Additionally, 159 units in the system-reported 'In-transit' (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost and must be manually excluded from the effective pipeline. The demand regime from P12-P27 has stabilized around a mean of 117 units/period. To address this, I will set mu_hat using the last 16 samples (the duration of the current demand regime). For the lead time, the promised 2 periods is physically incorrect; however, the OR backend's inventory balancing depends on L. Given the massive backlog and extreme delay, setting L to an 'explicit' 6 periods (a conservative estimate reflecting the backlog) combined with an 'explicit' mu_hat helps the base-stock logic acknowledge a much higher target inventory level to overcome the 'ghost inventory' (159 units) and the prolonged arrival gap.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bottleneck extended: 10 consecutive periods (P18-P27) without arrivals. Demand regime since P12 remains stable at ~117 units/period. Effective pipeline calculation: System 'In-transit' - 159 ghost units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $530.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain bottleneck has partially broken with the arrival of 145 units from Period 26. However, orders from Period 15, 18, 19, 24, and 25 (totaling 491 units) are still in transit and significantly overdue, along with the 159 units from P2 and P6 confirmed as lost. Current on-hand is low (10 units). The demand regime remains stable at approximately 117 units/period since P12. Given the severe lead time instability and the massive backlog, I am setting an explicit lead time L=10 to reflect the actual delay seen during the bottleneck. To maintain a high service level while recognizing that the backend OR will subtract the system-reported in-transit (713) from the base stock, I am using an explicit mu_hat that accounts for the 'ghost' inventory. Effective Pipeline = 713 (system) - 159 (lost) = 554. I need the OR backend to target a pipeline that covers at least the next few periods. By setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 117 + 159, I 'neutralize' the 159 ghost units in the OR's internal math (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bottleneck broke in Period 28 with a lead time of 2 for a recent order (P26), but a large backlog of orders from P15-P25 remains undelivered. The system 'In-transit' of 713 still contains 159 ghost units from P2 and P6.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the environment is characterized by a massive backlog of undelivered orders and high demand. Total system-reported 'In-transit' is 873 units, but 159 units are confirmed lost 'ghost inventory' (Period 2 and Period 6 orders), making the effective pipeline 714 units. A significant supply chain bottleneck occurred from Period 18 to Period 27 (10 periods with no arrivals); although a recent order from Period 26 arrived in Period 28 (L=2), several large orders from Periods 15, 18, 19, 24, and 25 (totaling 485 units) are overdue and still pending. Demand since Period 12 remains high and stable, averaging ~117 units. To maintain safety stock while compensating for the 159 lost units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand (~351 units for L=2). Since the effective pipeline (714) currently exceeds the normal base stock, the OR engine's 'min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)' logic will result in small or zero orders if I use default settings. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at a level that ensures we capture the demand regime while acknowledging current stockouts. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=18, covering the high-demand regime) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain congestion continues: while a Period 26 order arrived (L=2), orders from P15 (162 units), P18 (94 units), P19 (166 units), P24 (63 units), and P25 (4 units) remain undelivered and seriously overdue. Effectively, 159 units (P2/P6) are lost, while 489 units are delayed/backlogged.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing extreme disruption. While recent orders from Period 26 and Period 28 arrived with a lead time of 2, a massive backlog of older orders remains undelivered. Specifically, 159 units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, and 489 units (from P15, P18, P19, P24, and P25) are severely overdue, having been bypassed by more recent arrivals. The system-reported 'In-transit' of 808 units is misleading: the 'effective' pipeline is likely only the most recent order (P29, 160 units) plus the extremely delayed backlog which may or may not arrive. Since on-hand is 0 and we are facing stockouts, I need to signal the OR backend to place a significant order. By setting an 'explicit' L of 3 and an 'explicit' mu_hat of 500 (representing 4 periods of demand at the current ~120/period rate plus a buffer), I aim to trigger an order despite the high 'In-transit' figure. The OR backend's cap is based on mu_hat, so increasing mu_hat is the primary lever to force an order through when the pipeline is 'clogged' with ghost/delayed inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bifurcation: Orders from P26 and P28 arrived (L=2), while a cumulative backlog of 489 units (P15-P25) remains undelivered and bypassed, in addition to the 159 units confirmed lost. Demand regime (P12-P30) is stable at ~120 units/period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing significant bifurcation and bypassing. While recent orders from P26 and P28 have arrived with a lead time (L) of 2 periods, a massive backlog of 648 units remains 'In-transit' but undelivered. This includes 159 units (P2, P6) confirmed lost for over 20 periods and 489 units (P15-P25) that are severely overdue and have been bypassed by newer shipments. The current system-reported 'In-transit' is 808 units, but the reliable pipeline is effectively much lower. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this 'ghost inventory', I must use parameters that compensate for the missing units. The demand regime from P12 onwards remains stable at approximately 120 units/period (mean of last 20 samples). I will use L=2 (reflecting the actual lead time of the most recent successful arrivals) and set mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for the 0 on-hand inventory while accounting for the unreliable pipeline status.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bifurcation persists: While P26 and P28 arrived with L=2, a backlog of 489 units (P15-P25) is now 6+ periods overdue and has been bypassed, joining the 159 units already confirmed lost. Total unreliable 'ghost inventory' in In-transit equals 648 units. Demand stabilized at ~120 units/period since Period 12.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show extreme instability and bifurcation. Recent orders (P26, P28) have arrived with L=2, while a large chunk of historical orders is significantly overdue and appears bypassed or lost. Specifically, 159 units (P2, P6) are confirmed lost, and an additional 489 units (from P15, P18, P19, P24, P25) are now over 7 periods overdue, totaling 648 units of 'ghost inventory' that the system 'In-transit' count (808 units) incorrectly includes. The effective pipeline is actually only 160 units (the order from P29). Demand since Period 12 has stabilized at a higher regime of approximately 120 units per period. I will set the lead time to an explicit '3' to provide a buffer against the recent high volatility, and use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current stable high-demand regime of ~120 units/period (N=20 covers from P12 onwards).

Carry-over insight: Total 'ghost inventory' (system In-transit but unlikely to arrive) is 648 units, consisting of 159 units (P2, P6) and 489 units (P15-P25). Demand regime from P12-P32 is stable at ~121 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 12 has stabilized at a significantly higher mean (approx. 121 units/period) compared to earlier periods. This sustained shift requires mu_hat to be based on more recent samples (N=22) to capture the current market behavior accurately. The supply chain displays a clear bifurcation: while recent orders (P26, P28) arrived with a lead time of 2, a significant amount of 'ghost inventory' (648 units) remains undelivered and seriously overdue (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). To ensure the OR engine actually orders units despite the high system-reported 'In-transit' of 808 units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Specifically, to force an order that covers (~121 units * (2+1) periods = 363 units) when the effective pipeline is only 160 units (808 - 648 = 160), I set mu_hat high enough to bridge the 488-unit gap created by the ghost inventory. Setting mu_hat to 1011 (363 + 648) effectively signals the OR engine that current pipeline coverage is insufficient due to the losses, while assuming a reliable lead time of 2 for fresh orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P12-P33 is stable at ~123 units/period (average of last 5 periods: 151). Total 'ghost inventory' (system In-transit but unlikely to arrive) remains 648 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) since Period 12 is stable but elevated, with recent periods (P29-P33) showing even higher peaks (avg ~150). I will use a mu_hat based on the last 23 periods (since the regime shift at P12) to capture this higher mean (~123). The sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect the increased volatility in recent demand. The supply chain is severely disrupted: while recent orders (P26, P28) arrived with a lead time of 2, a massive backlog of 648 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25) is now significantly overdue and effectively lost or bypassed. System 'In-transit' is 1049, but the effective pipeline is only 401 (1049 - 648). To compensate for this 648-unit 'ghost inventory' appearing in the OR backend's calculations, I must set the L parameter to 'explicit' at 2 (the current functional lead time) and significantly increase mu_hat to ensure the backend places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, calculating it as (1+L)*123 + 648 = 1017 to offset the ghost units and cover expected demand.

Carry-over insight: Total 'ghost inventory' (system In-transit but unlikely to arrive) remains 648 units (P2/P6: 159, P15-P25: 489). Demand regime since P12 remains elevated, with an average of ~123 units/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show extreme bifurcation. While recent orders from Period 26 and Period 28 arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, a massive backlog of 'ghost inventory' (648 units total) remains undelivered and seriously overdue from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, and 25. These 648 units represent approximately 61% of the system-reported 'In-transit' of 1057 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I must set the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters aggressively. Demand since the regime shift at Period 12 has averaged ~123 units, but the last 5 periods show an even higher intensity (~151 units). I will use explicit values to target a base stock that accounts for the ghost inventory and the elevated demand trend. With L=2 (promised/recent), I forecast demand for 3 periods (L+1) at approximately 150 units/period (450 total) and then add the 648 units of ghost inventory that the OR engine will erroneously subtract from the order, resulting in a target mu_hat of 1098. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility (30% of mu_hat).

Carry-over insight: Period 36: No new arrivals. Total 'ghost inventory' (system In-transit but unlikely to arrive) remains 648 units. Recent demand intensity (last 5 periods) has increased to ~151 units/period, while the regime since P12 averages ~123.

Daily Reward (R_t): $659.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we face a complex 'ghost inventory' situation. The system reports 1135 units in-transit, but based on history, 648 of these are highly likely lost or permanently bypassed (P2/P6: 159 units; P15-P25: 489 units). The effective pipeline is therefore only 487 units (1135 - 648). Recent demand (last 5 periods) has surged to an average of ~151 units, significantly higher than the long-term regime (~123). To maintain service levels against this higher demand and offset the ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent intensity. Lead time (L) is set to 2, as recent successful deliveries (P26, P28, P34) have consistently arrived in 2 periods. The OR backend will see a high in-transit number and attempt to order nothing; however, by providing a high mu_hat and sigma_hat, we ensure the base stock calculation targets the necessary physical inventory to bridge the gap created by the 648 ghost units.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensity has sustained at ~151 units/period over the last 5 periods (P32-P36). Total 'ghost inventory' remains 648 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25), which must be accounted for by maintaining a higher target base stock than the system-reported in-transit would otherwise suggest.

Daily Reward (R_t): $607.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P32-P37) has settled into a higher intensity regime, averaging approximately 158 units per period, compared to the previous ~123. The lead time for the most recent arrivals (P36 and P37) has been very short (L=1 and L=2), suggesting a temporary relief in the previous supply chain bottleneck, though 'ghost inventory' from historical losses remains a critical factor. The system-reported 'In-transit' of 808 units includes 648 units of 'ghost inventory' (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25) that are unlikely to arrive. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 160 units (P29 order). With 189 units on hand, the total effective inventory is 349. Given the high demand and the need to offset the OR engine's reliance on the inflated in-transit figure, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to provide a base stock that covers the new demand regime (approx 158 units/period) plus a buffer for the 648 units the OR engine thinks we have but we actually don't. The explicit mu_hat is calculated as (L+1)*158 + 648 = (2+1)*158 + 648 = 1122. This forces the engine to order to account for the missing stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 32: avg increased to ~158 units/period. Total ghost inventory remains 648 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we analyze the current state: On-hand inventory is 18, and system-reported In-transit is 981. Based on historical data, we have 'ghost inventory' amounting to 648 units (P2: 66, P6: 93, P15: 162, P18: 94, P19: 166, P24: 63, P25: 4) that are extremely overdue and unlikely to arrive. This makes the effective pipeline only 333 units (981 - 648). Demand has shifted significantly since Period 32, with an average of approximately 158 units per period (last 7 periods: 116, 179, 131, 144, 180, 199, 171). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover for the 648 missing units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3): (3 periods * 158 demand) + 648 ghost units = 1122. This forces the base stock high enough to account for the reliability issues in the pipeline. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to capture the higher volatility seen in this new demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $704.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 32 has stabilized at a higher level, averaging approximately 158 units per period compared to the previous ~120. Recent periods (P36-P39) show even higher intensity, with demand often exceeding 170 units. Lead times have become unpredictable; while P34-P35 arrived in 2 periods, P36 and P38 arrived in just 1 period. Most importantly, the system-reported 'In-transit' of 975 units includes 648 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost or bypassed orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, and P25) that are highly unlikely to arrive. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 327 units (975 - 648). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the new demand intensity (average ~158, max 199), I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this higher demand of ~160 units per period. I am choosing L=2 to be safe, despite recent 1-period arrivals, to account for potential variability. Setting mu_hat to 480 (3 periods * 160) and sigma_hat explicitly to 50 provides enough buffer to handle the recent volatility without overstaying inventory, especially given the stockouts in the P31-P35 window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P32 confirmed at ~158 units/period. The total 'ghost inventory' (system In-transit unlikely to arrive) remains 648 units (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 32, with the average demand over the last 9 periods (P32-P40) stabilizing at approximately 159 units per period (N=9 chosen to capture this high-intensity regime). Lead times have stabilized significantly in the recent window, with the last four arrivals (P34, P35, P36, P38, P39) showing lead times of 2, 2, 1, 1, and 1 periods respectively. I will use L=1 (explicit) to reflect the current responsive supply chain while maintaining a slightly higher mu_hat to account for 'ghost inventory'. Crucially, the system-reported 'In-transit' of 808 units includes 648 units of 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost: P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25) that will likely never arrive. To compensate for this 648-unit overestimation in the pipeline, the OR backend's target base stock must be pushed higher. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 159 + 648 = 966. This ensures that the effective order (base stock - pipeline) is not suppressed by the non-existent 648 units, effectively treating those units as if they were never ordered.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P32 is stable at ~159 units/period. Total 'ghost inventory' (system In-transit unlikely to arrive) remains 648 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). Lead time has recently improved to 1-2 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 32 at approximately 159 units per period (average of P32-P41 is 157.3, with recent periods consistently high). The system reported In-transit is currently 996 units. However, based on extensive history, 648 of these units are 'ghost inventory' from old, bypassed, or lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock, I must account for this by significantly increasing mu_hat to offset the 648 units the backend thinks are coming but aren't. Lead time has recently been 1-2 periods. I will set L to 2 (promised) and mu_hat to an explicit value that reflects (1+L) periods of demand plus the 648 units of ghost inventory: (1+2)*159 + 648 = 1125. This ensures the base stock calculation targets enough units to cover real demand while ignoring the fictitious pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to 30 based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P32 stable at ~159 units/period. Ghost inventory (unlikely to arrive) remains 648 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25), requiring mu_hat adjustments to ensure physical stock coverage.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 32 remains stabilized at an elevated average of approximately 159 units per period (the most recent 5-period average is ~172, but the overall regime average from P32-P42 is ~159). There is still a significant discrepancy between the system's 'In-transit' count (1151 units) and the effective pipeline. Specifically, 648 units of 'ghost inventory' from historical orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25) are highly unlikely to arrive but still occupy space in the system's logic. To compensate, I set mu_hat explicitly to account for the true demand over the lead time (L=2, so 3 periods of demand) plus an offset to clear the ghost inventory from the calculation: Base Stock = (1+L)*159 + 648 = 477 + 648 = 1125. By setting mu_hat to 1125 and L to the promised 2 periods, the OR backend's base stock calculation (mu_hat) effectively offsets the 648 invalid units in the pipeline, ensuring that the remaining physical order quantity covers the actual projected demand for the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is set to a recent window of 11 periods to reflect the volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 32 (P32-P43) has stabilized at an average of approximately 161 units per period (last 5 periods average: 171). We are currently in a stockout (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure of 1165 units is highly inflated by 'ghost inventory' from historical supply chain disruptions. Specifically, 648 units are confirmed or highly likely lost: Period 2 (66), Period 6 (93), Period 15 (162), Period 18 (94), Period 19 (166), Period 24 (63), and Period 25 (4). The effective pipeline is therefore 1165 - 648 = 517 units (orders from P29, P41, P42, P43). Recent lead times have shown recovery to 1-2 periods (P34: L=2, P35: L=2, P36: L=1, P38: L=1, P39: L=1). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the recent average lead time of approx 2. I set mu_hat to 'explicit' at 1080 units to force the OR backend's target base stock higher to compensate for the 648 lost units in the pipeline calculation (Base Stock = mu_hat + safety_stock; we need Base Stock - 517 effective units to trigger a sufficient order, whereas the system sees Base Stock - 1165 units. Adding 648 to the expected demand across (L+1) periods effectively neutralizes the ghost inventory. (160 * 3) + 648 = 1128). I'll use 1100 as a slightly conservative hedge against holding costs while ensuring arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P32 is stable at ~161 units/period. Total 'ghost inventory' (system In-transit but unlikely to arrive) remains 648 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). Lead time has stabilized recently between 1-2 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 32 has stabilized at approximately 165 units per period, with recent observations (P36-P44) showing higher intensity (avg ~174). I am using recent_N=13 to capture the post-P31 regime shift while accounting for high volatility. Lead time recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so I will continue using the explicit 'calculate' method to reflect this variability. Crucially, the system-reported 'In-transit' of 977 units contains 648 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, and P25) that are extremely unlikely to arrive. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite this bloated pipeline, I set mu_hat explicitly high. Specifically, the base stock needs to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 648-unit gap; at L=2 (promised), base stock should be ~1143. By setting mu_hat = 1143 (which is (3) * 381), I ensure the backend targets enough physical stock to satisfy actual demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P32 is stable at ~165 units/period, but recently (P36-44) averaging ~174. Total ghost inventory remains 648 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25), significantly inflating the system's in-transit count.

Daily Reward (R_t): $704.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher intensity regime since Period 32, with the average demand over the last 10 periods being approximately 173 units. The most recent period (P45) saw demand of 201 units. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging around 2.25 periods for recent arrivals. We continue to account for the 'ghost inventory' of 648 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25) which are significantly overdue and likely lost but still included in the system's 'In-transit' count of 1008. The effective in-transit is therefore approximately 360 units. To maintain service levels in this high-demand, high-variability environment, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to reflect a lead-time-adjusted forecast of 175 units/period over (L+1) periods, while using recent_N for sigma_hat to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P32 is now averaging ~173 units/period (last 5 periods avg ~185). Ghost inventory (unlikely to arrive) remains 648 units. Effective pipeline is much lower than system-reported In-transit.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a higher intensity regime since Period 32, with the average demand over the last 15 periods (P32-P46) being approximately 166 units, and the last 5 periods (P42-P46) averaging ~177 units. The system-reported In-transit of 1008 units is heavily inflated by 648 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, and P25) which are significantly overdue and likely lost or indefinitely bypassed. The effective pipeline is therefore 1008 - 648 = 360 units. Lead times for successful arrivals have stabilized between 1 and 3 periods recently (P41: 3, P42: 3, P43: 2). To ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient order to cover the demand at the current high regime while the system believes 'ghost' stock is coming, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~180 units per period over (L+1) periods (where L=2), adjusted to offset the 648-unit overestimation in the pipeline. This targets a base stock that prioritizes physical availability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P32 is stable at ~166 units/period (last 5 periods avg ~177). Ghost inventory (unlikely to arrive) remains 648 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 32. Analyzing the last 15 periods (P33-P47), the average demand is approximately 166 units per period, while the last 5 periods (P43-P47) average 177 units. I will prioritize the more recent trend to ensure sufficient stock. The lead time (L) has recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; I will use L=2 (the promise) as the base for parameters. The 'In-transit' figure of 1218 units is heavily inflated by 648 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, and P25) that are extremely unlikely to arrive. To compensate for this in the OR backend's capped policy, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean demand of 177 and L=2: (1+L)*mu = 3*177 = 531. To offset the 648 lost units that the system thinks are coming, I must set mu_hat to approximately (531 + 648) = 1179. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the high 'In-transit' count. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility of the current regime.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 is the penultimate period. The primary goal is to maximize profit while accounting for the system's inflated 'In-transit' figure. System 'In-transit' is 1218, but 'ghost inventory' (orders unlikely to arrive from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25) totals 648 units. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 570 units. Demand has shifted into a higher regime starting around Period 32, with the average demand over the last 15 periods (P34-P48) being approximately 172 units. Recent demand (last 3 periods) is even higher at ~200. I will set mu_hat using the last 17 periods (N=17, starting P32) to capture this higher regime (~172 * (1+L)). To overcome the OR engine's reliance on the inflated in-transit figure, I am using an 'explicit' L of 5. This forces a much higher base stock calculation (covering 6 periods of demand), which should compensate for the 648 ghost units and trigger a large enough final order to satisfy demand in Period 50.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P32 is confirmed at ~172 units/period, with recent 5-period average rising to ~186. Ghost inventory (unlikely to arrive) remains 648 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we face 0 on-hand inventory and a system-reported 'In-transit' of 1218 units. However, consistent history confirms that a significant portion of this pipeline is 'ghost inventory' that will never arrive: 159 units (from P2/P6) and 489 units (from P15-P25), totalling 648 units of unreliable stock. The effective pipeline is actually 570 units (1218 - 648). Demand has shifted significantly; the regime since P32 averages ~172 units/period, with the most recent 5 periods (P45-P49) averaging 188.6 units, indicating a late-stage surge. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1-3 periods. To ensure survival and maximize reward in the final period, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover the recent high demand (189 units/period) across the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (so 3 periods total). I subtract the effective pipeline (570) from the target base stock. By setting mu_hat to 1218 (effective pipeline) + needed stock, I force the OR engine to recognize it needs more physical units on-hand despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Final period analysis: Effective pipeline is System In-Transit (1218) minus Ghost Inventory (648) = 570. Demand has peaked at ~189 units/period in the final 5 periods.
