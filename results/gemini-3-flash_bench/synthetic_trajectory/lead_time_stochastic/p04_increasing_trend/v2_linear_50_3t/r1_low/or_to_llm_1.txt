The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows values of 30, 49, 48, 65, and 56 (mean: 49.6, std dev: 12.8). The OR recommendation suggests ordering 71 units based on a base-stock policy that targets a specific service level (Profit: $1.0 vs Holding: $1.0 gives a critical fractile of 0.5, which usually results in targeting the mean demand plus a minimal safety buffer). Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, an order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 4. The current pipeline must cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. Since we have zero inventory currently, we are guaranteed to stock out in Period 1 (and likely Period 2 and 3) because the lead time is >= 1.

Strategy: The pipeline (140) covers nearly 3 periods of average demand (50). The OR recommendation is very low (7 units) because it calculates that the current pipeline (140) is sufficient to cover the base stock level (estimated mean demand over 3 periods + safety stock). Since lead time is 2, the next arrival (P1's order) should materialize this period. If I order significantly more now, I risk high holding costs ($1/unit) once the initial large orders arrive.

Demand Outlook: Demand samples are {30, 49, 48, 65, 56}. The mean is ~50. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 units, likely because the pipeline (134) + on-hand (33) = 167 units appears sufficient to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 150 units). However, the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, meaning the critical fractile is 0.5 (very low safety stock).

The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it includes the 'In-transit' items (229) in its pipeline calculation. However, if the Period 6 order (30) is lost (similar to Period 2), the effective pipeline is lower. More importantly, the current stockout (on-hand=0) means we are losing sales immediately. Strategy: Despite the high in-transit number, the immediate stockout and the unreliability of arrivals necessitate a small order to bridge the gap and account for potential losses in the pipeline.

Furthermore, the Period 15 order (125 units) is now overdue (scheduled lead time 2, actual current age 4 periods), making it highly suspicious and likely lost.

The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P13-P20) is approximately 100 units/period (compared to the early baseline of ~50). This shift is sustained and needs a higher base stock. \n3.

In-transit is 744, but Subtracting 394 ghost units leaves a real pipeline of 350 units (specifically orders from P20, P21, P22, P23, P24). However, arrivals for P20, P21, and P22 were already recorded in P23's conclusion. Wait, checking history: P23 conclude showed arrivals for P20, P21, P22. This means the 'In-transit' figure of 744 includes the lost orders and orders placed in P23 and P24. Let's recalculate pipeline: In-transit (744) - Ghost (394) = 350. These 350 units are the orders from P20-P24 (125 each). But P20, P21, P22 already arrived.

Demand Analysis: A sustained regime shift occurred around Period 13. The early average was ~50, but the average demand over the last 13 periods is ~107 units, with the last 5 periods averaging ~128 units. Current demand is stabilized at approximately 115-125 units per period.\n3. Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand inventory is 94. The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 744 units.

These 350 units consist of orders from P24 (125), P25 (125), and the pending decision for P26.\n4. OR Recommendation Breakdown: The OR recommends 0 units. This is because the OR algorithm treats the 744 units in transit as valid, which overestimates the safety net by nearly 400 units, and it uses early low-demand periods (P1-P12) in its mean calculation, underestimating the current 115+ unit regime.\n5.

However, historical analysis proves that at least 394 units in that pipeline (orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) are permanently lost ('ghost inventory'). Additionally, demand has stepped up again: while Period 23 saw stability around 115, the last four periods (P24-P27) have averaged ~147 units. The supply chain remains volatile with lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods and frequent losses.

Furthermore, order P24 (125) and P25 (125) are now 6 and 5 periods old respectively (standard lead time ~2-3), suggesting they may also be lost. If we subtract the confirmed lost 394 units, the 'real' pipeline is 600. If P24 and P25 are also lost, the reliable pipeline is only 350 units (P29, P30, and the current P31 order).\n\nOR Recommendation Analysis: The OR baseline suggests 0 units because it counts the massive (but largely lost) 994-unit pipeline against its base stock.

Summing these: 69+30+125+45+125+125+125+125 = 769 units of 'Ghost Inventory'. Real pipeline = 1294 - 769 = 525 units. These real units are the orders from P30(125), P33(150), P34(150), plus P35's decision. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand regime is stable at ~140-145 units/period. P34 demand was slightly lower (108), but the 5-period average is ~133. 4. **OR Recommendation Critique**: OR recommends 0 because it sees a massive pipeline of 1294 units against historical demand mean. It fails to account for the ~769 lost units. 5. **Final Strategy**: To cover ~140 units/period over a 3-period window (L+1), we need ~420 units in the real pipeline/on-hand. Current real pipeline (P30, P33, P34) is 125 + 150 + 150 = 425 units. While this technically covers the window, P34 ended at 0 on-hand, and we face a high stockout risk if any further delays occur or if P30 is also lost. I will order 150 units to maintain a consistent flow and offset the impact of the verified high loss rate (approx 25%).",

We have 2 periods remaining until the game ends at Period 50 (Orders placed in P46 arrive in P48/P49; orders in P47 arrive P49/P50).

The orders from P44 (225 units) and P45 (225 units) are expected to arrive in P47 and P48 respectively.

With only 100 units ordered in Period 47 (likely arriving Period 49 or 50) and 225 units ordered in Periods 44/45 (one of which should have arrived in P46/47 but didn't, suggesting they might be delayed or lost), we are facing a stockout in the final stretch. \n3. **Final Strategy**: We are at Period 48 of 50. Orders placed now will arrive in Period 50 (if lead time is 2) or after the game ends (if lead time is 3). Since we have 0 on-hand and need to cover demand for Periods 48, 49, and 50 (~180 units each), and our pipeline is unreliable, we must order to cover the final period's demand.

Demand Analysis: The current demand regime is stable at approximately 180 units per period (average last 10 periods: 173). Strategy: Period 49 is the penultimate period (Game ends at Period 50).
