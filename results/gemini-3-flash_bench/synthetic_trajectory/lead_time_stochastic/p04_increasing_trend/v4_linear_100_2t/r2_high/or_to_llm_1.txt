Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to build inventory immediately. Given the lead time of 2, the order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 3 (viewable in Period 4).

Thus, the current in-transit (393 units) is expected to start arriving next period.\n2. Inventory & Demand: Current on-hand is 0. Demand for the last two periods was 132 and 100, resulting in significant lost sales. Historical demand data provided (P1-P5) shows a wide range (0 to 170). The mean of the provided P1-P5 data is approximately 92.4.\n3. OR Baseline Analysis: The OR recommends 58 units. OR's calculation for base stock (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302) using L=2 (Review+Lead = 3 periods) targets a coverage for 3 periods of demand. With 393 units in the pipeline and a mean demand around 92.4, the pipeline already covers over 4 periods of average demand (393 / 92.4 \u2248 4.25).\n4. Adjustment: Since the pipeline (393) is significantly higher than the expected demand over the lead time (approximately 277 units for 3 periods) and exceeds the OR's implied base stock level, adding more inventory now would only increase future holding costs once the shipments arrive.

Inventory Position: On-hand is 34. In-transit is 246 (P2 order of 196 + P4 order of 50). Total Pipeline = 280.

The historical average is approximately 110 units/period. The OR recommendation of 214 units is based on a promised lead time of 2. Calculating target stock for L=3: (L+1) * Mean = 4 * 110 = 440 units. Current Inventory Position (OH 34 + IT 246) = 280. Gap = 160 units.

The OR recommendation of 46 units is too conservative given the stockout and the risk that the P2 order is lost. To cover 3 periods of demand (current L=2-3) at ~106/period, we need ~318 units.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand since Period 4 has been: 221, 70, 72, 6, 127. While volatile, the mean over the last 5 periods is ~99. 4. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it counts the lost P2 order (196 units) in the pipeline. Removing the 196 lost units from the pipeline shows we have roughly 3-4 periods of stock (367 units / 100 mean demand). Given the lead time can be up to 3 periods, we are currently safe. However, to maintain a buffer against the observed lead-time volatility and the potential for demand spikes, a small order is prudent to prevent the zero-order from Period 8 from causing a future gap.",

Since 939 > 840, we are currently slightly over-provisioned due to the recent demand drop in P24-P25. The OR recommends 0 because it sees 996 units in transit and a 2-period lead time.

Lead Time Analysis: Lead times are volatile, averaging 3 periods (P23 took 2 periods, while previous orders took 3 or 1). Effective Pipeline Inference: Total In-transit is 1046. Removing cumulative lost units (Period 2: 196 and Period 6: 100) leaves 750 units in the effective pipeline. These represent orders from P24 (100), P25 (100), P26 (50).

Adjusting the effective pipeline further: 800 units - (P17: 100 + P18: 150 + P19: 100) = 450 units. \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P20-P28) has been volatile but high, with a mean around 215 units per period.

My current total In-transit is 2446 units, but according to the Carry-Over Insights, at least 1196 units are lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, P31). Subtracting these from the pipeline leaves an effective pipeline of 1250 units. While this sounds large, the recent demand regime (since P20) has shifted to an average of approximately 210-230 units per period, with high volatility. The on-hand inventory is 133, and demand over the next 3 periods (average lead time) is expected to be around 630-690 units. The orders from P41, P42, and P43 total 750 units and are within the 1-3 period arrival window. However, given the extreme historical loss rate and the proximity to the end of the game (Period 50), I need to ensure I don't stock out during the final periods while avoiding excessive holding costs. The OR agent likely sees the 2446 units and assumes no more orders are needed. By adjusting for the 1196 lost units, a more realistic replenishment is required to cover the remaining 6 periods.

With 219 on-hand and 1200 in effective transit, we have 1419 units available to cover the remaining 6 periods of the game (P45-P50). At a mean demand of ~200, we need ~1200 total units.

However, my 'Carry-over Insights' track a cumulative total of 1196 units as lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, P31). Effective In-transit = 2046 - 1196 = 850 units. These 850 units represent orders from P44 (200) and P45 (150), plus 500 units from older orders that are still likely in the 3-period window. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Significant demand volatility is present. The recent 5-period average (P41-P45) is approximately 160 units, but the broader regime since P20 is ~230 units. Period 45 demand was 292. 4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because its internal pipeline calculation (which doesn't understand 'lost' units) sees 2046 units coming. My adjusted effective inventory (On-hand 427 + Effective Pipeline 850 = 1277) covers roughly 5-6 periods of demand at the 230-unit rate.
