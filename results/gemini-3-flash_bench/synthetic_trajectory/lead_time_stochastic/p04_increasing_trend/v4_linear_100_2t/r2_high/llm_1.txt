The variability suggests a high safety stock requirement. Currently, the P2 order (100) is significantly overdue (ordered P2, now P8 START, gap=6 periods), which strongly suggests it is lost.

On-hand inventory is currently 0 after Period 41 demand (296) exceeded starting inventory (268). The reported 'In-transit' of 2400 units is heavily skewed by a long history of lost shipments.

Recent actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P38 arrived in 1, P39 arrived in 1). Given zero on-hand inventory and the unreliability of the pipeline, a substantial order is needed to satisfy immediate demand and rebuild safety stock for a target inventory position of roughly 600-700 units (3 periods of demand). Total reliable pipeline (P37, P40, P41) is 800 units.
