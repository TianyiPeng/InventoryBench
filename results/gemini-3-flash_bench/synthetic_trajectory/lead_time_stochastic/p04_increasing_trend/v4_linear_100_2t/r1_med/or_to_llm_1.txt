If lead time is actually 3+, we need to ensure we don't over-order once the 'glitch' clears, but we must also cover the immediate demand spike.

Since P2 is lost and P6 is highly questionable (5 periods out), the effective pipeline is likely only 145 units (P9). Demand is stable around 107 units/period.\n3.

Recent demand (last 5 periods excluding P37 zero) averages approximately 105 units, though the P15-P36 regime was much higher (~170-190). With the lead time volatile but averaging 2-3 periods, we need enough inventory to cover the lead time plus current period (L+1). Total functional stock (on-hand 340 + pipeline 250) = 590 units. At a demand rate of 110/period, this covers ~5 periods. However, given the extreme history of lost shipments and the moderate current on-hand balance, a small buffer order is prudent to ensure service levels if recent low demand is just a dip. The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the inflated 'In-transit' figure; I will override this to place a maintenance order of 100 units to offset potential future losses and stabilize the supply chain.",
