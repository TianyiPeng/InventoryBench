Historical data for the first 5 periods shows demand of [75, 90, 0, 170, 127], averaging approximately 92.4 units per period. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I need to place an order to cover the lead time (promised 2 periods) plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods). Using the historical average of ~93 as a baseline, total demand for 3 periods is approximately 279 units. I will order 280 units to establish a baseline inventory pipeline, accounting for the lead time and preventing stockouts in the early periods.",

The 280 units already in-transit should cover roughly 3 periods of demand (P2, P3, P4) based on an average of ~80-100 units/period. However, since the current on-hand is 0 and the first order won't arrive until P3 (at the earliest), we will experience stockouts in P2. To maintain a steady pipeline and account for the (L+1) = 3 period horizon (P2, P3, P4), the 280 units in-transit are sufficient for now. I will not place a new order this period to avoid excessive holding costs once the initial large shipment arrives, as the holding cost ($1.0) is equal to the profit ($1.0), making overstocking very expensive.",

The mean appears to be roughly 105-115 units/period. c) Lead Time Inference: The 'Period 4 conclude' message shows P1 arrived in 3 periods and P3 arrived in 1 period.

Recent demand has fluctuated wildly between 0 and 688, with a recent 5-period average (P37-P41) of approximately 112 units, significantly lower than the P33-P36 spike. The reported 'In-transit' inventory of 2170 units contains approximately 1,360 units from confirmed/highly-likely lost orders (P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P26, P29, P30, P31-partial). Effectively, the viable 'In-transit' pipeline is about 810 units (2170 - 1360). On-hand inventory is 339. Total viable supply (On-hand 339 + Viable In-transit 810) is 1149 units. Given the lead time is volatile (1-3 periods) and the game is approaching its end (Period 42 of 50), the current coverage for expected demand is high (approx. 7-10 periods at the current mean).

Historical analysis indicates that the 'In-transit' figure of 3,620 units is heavily inflated by lost orders. Based on Period 43 and 45 insights, 2,010 units (from P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P26, P29, P30, and P37) are confirmed lost. Looking at the subsequent orders, P44 (450 units), P45 (600 units), and P46 (600 units) total 1,650 units. If we subtract the 2,010 known phantom units from the 3,620 total, we get an 'active' pipeline of 1,610 units, which aligns closely with the P44-P46 orders. Specifically, the P44 order (450 units) is now at its 5th period since ordering\u2014exceeding the observed max lead time of 3\u2014and has not arrived. Given the game concludes in P50, and our on-hand inventory is 0, we are at extreme risk of stockout for the final periods. However, placing a new order now (Period 49) with a minimum 1-period lead time means the units would arrive in Period 50, providing no benefit for Period 49 demand and only potential help for Period 50. Since the game ends after Period 50 and we already have a massive (though potentially compromised) pipeline of 1,650 recent units that theoretically should have arrived by now, additional ordering is likely to only increase holding costs if they arrive late, or be useless if they don't arrive before the game ends. I will hold at 0 to avoid unnecessary holding costs on a pipeline that is already sufficient if it actually delivers.",

The reported 'In-transit' of 3,620 units is misleading due to massive historical losses. I calculate 'phantom' units (confirmed/likely lost) as: P15(50)+P17(200)+P18(350)+P19(210)+P25(100)+P26(150)+P29(150)+P30(150)+P37(650)+P44(450) = 2,460 units.

Demand has most recently spiked to 338 in P49, following a 0 in P47 and 148 in P48, indicating extreme volatility. With lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods (for orders that actually arrive), I must protect against both the high upper-bound of demand (approx 350-400) and the ongoing risk of shipment loss. Since this is the final period (P50), ordering now will not impact the total reward (orders arrive after the game ends due to the minimum 1-period arrival delay and the observation delay); however, standard policy under stockout is to place an order to cover the next expected demand cycle. As P50 is the terminal period, the action reflects a final adjustment, although it will not be fulfilled within the scoring window.",
