Strategy: The OR recommends 11 units based on a base-stock policy that assumes the pipeline is arriving as scheduled and demand is stable. Since the P1 shipment is late/lost and demand is accelerating, relying on the OR's low recommendation is risky. I will increase the order quantity to 150 to account for potential lost stock and the observed trend of increasing demand (avg ~120, trend > 150).

P2 (ordered 100 units) is confirmed lost. P6 (ordered 85 units) is currently 3 periods overdue (if L=3) and has likely also been lost, as the subsequent orders (P7, P8) have already arrived. Inventory/Demand Analysis: On-hand inventory is 147 units. In-transit consists of P6 (85 units, likely lost) and P9 (120 units, ordered last period). Recent demand (P7-P9) averages ~91 units/period. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 units, likely because it includes the P6 85-unit shipment in its pipeline calculations. Since P6 is almost certainly lost (P7 and P8 arrived after it was placed), our reliable inventory is 147 (on-hand) + 120 (P9 in-transit) = 267 units. This covers ~2.9 periods of demand at current rates. Given the volatility in actual lead times (1-3 periods) and the evidence of lost shipments, I will place a conservative order of 60 units to maintain a safety buffer against the high holding cost ($1.0) while ensuring we don't stock out if P9 is delayed to an L=3 arrival.",

Given the high loss rate previously identified (P2 and P6 orders lost), and the fact that no shipment arrived in Period 10, there is a risk of a stockout. 3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been stable, averaging around 100 units (P7-P10: 79, 110, 84, 104). 4.

Adjustment: To protect against the high variability and possible loss/delay of the P9 and P10 orders, I will override the OR recommendation. 120 units (roughly 1.2 periods of demand) ensures we maintain a buffer if the lead time drifts back to 3 periods or if one of the in-transit shipments is lost.

Looking deeper, P6 (85) and P2 (100) were tagged as lost, but the system still lists 425 in transit.

In-transit consists of orders from Period 15 (0 units), Period 16 (0 left after 145 arrived? No, Period 16 order of 145 arrived in Period 17), and Period 17 (145 units). Wait, history shows Period 16 order (145) arrived in P17 (lead_time=1). In-transit is listed as 330 units, which likely includes the P17 order (145) and the P18 order placed now. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Significant demand spike observed (P15: 135, P16: 183, P17: 212). The mean demand over the last 3 periods is ~177, while the overall history is much lower (~100). 4. **OR Recommendation**: OR suggests 0, but it is likely confused by the in-transit amount versus its internal demand model. 5. **Strategy**: To cover 4 periods with 177 demand/period, I need ~708 units in the pipeline. Current stock (13) + In-transit (330) = 343. Deficit is 365. However, ordering 365 is risky if the demand spike is a short-term anomaly or if the 'In-transit' figure contains delayed ghost units. Given the high demand trend, I will order a significant amount to prevent further stockouts while being slightly more conservative than the full deficit to account for holding costs ($1/unit).

Inventory & Pipeline Analysis: Current on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P16-P19) has spiked significantly, averaging ~196 units over the last 4 periods (183, 212, 220, 166).

While some orders arrive faster (1-2 periods), a 3-period lead time is the safest planning horizon. Orders from P18, P19, and P20 have not yet appeared in 'conclude' messages, which is consistent with a 3-period lead time (P18's order is expected to arrive in P21's resolution and show up in P22's conclude, but P21's conclude shows 0 arrivals, suggesting a delay or loss).\n\n2. **Inventory & Demand Analysis**: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand shifted significantly at P15 from ~100 to ~160-220 units, though the most recent period (P21) saw a dip to 100. In-transit inventory is high (940 units), including orders from P17 (145), P18 (200), P19 (200), P20 (210), and P21 (0). However, the P17 and P18 orders are now overdue based on the 3-period lead time (P17 ordered P17, should have arrived P20; P18 ordered P18, should have arrived P21).\n\n3. **OR Recommendation Rejection**: The OR recommends 0, likely because the pipeline (940) far exceeds its calculated base stock level. However, given the evidence of lost shipments (P2, P6) and the current overdue status of P17 and P18, there is a high risk of stockout if these orders are lost. \n\n4. **Strategy**: I will place a hedge order. While the pipeline is theoretically large, the 0 on-hand status and overdue arrivals indicate a supply chain break.

Demand Analysis: Demand has transitioned into a higher regime starting around P15, averaging approximately 160-180 units per period, with high volatility (standard deviation > 60). Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 1330 units, which appears high; however, the 'In-transit' figure on this platform often includes orders from early periods that have been confirmed lost (P17, P18, P19 total 545 units).

However, with only 81 units on-hand and an adjusted pipeline of 785 units spread over the next 2-3 periods, a 0 order creates a high risk of stockouts during high-demand swings (e.g., periods with 200+ demand).

The zero demand in P37 is likely a reporting anomaly or a massive 'rest' day after the spike. Averaging the last 5 periods (including P37) gives 271 units/period. The pipeline (In-transit) shows 1740 units. However, looking at the history, orders from P17-P19, P24-P25, and P29-P30 (approx 870 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost based on subsequent arrivals.

{
  "rationale": "Leads-time analysis: The actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, with significant historical shipment losses (P17-19, P24-25, P29-30, and likely others). Inventory Analysis: We are currently stock-out (ending inventory 0 at P43 conclude). The 'In-transit' figure of 2540 is heavily inflated by lost shipments; a realistic pipeline estimate for units that will actually arrive includes orders from P41 (250), P42 (250), and P43 (300). Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been highly volatile, with a massive spike in P33/P35 and a recent high of 352 units in P43. Using a recent 5-period average (excluding the 352 outlier partially) puts demand around 150-200, though P43 suggests another potential surge. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically driven by the inflated pipeline (2540 units), which ignores confirmed losses. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1) at a forecasted demand of ~250 units/period (considering the P43 spike), we need ~750 units. With ~800 units actually in the reliable pipeline (P41-43), we are technically covered for the immediate 3-period window, but given the 50-60% failure rate in the supply chain, at least half of that pipeline is likely to be lost. I will order 300 units to ensure continuity in the face of shipping losses and high demand volatility as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).",

These shipments have not arrived and are essentially ghosts in the system. Realistically, we are waiting on orders from Period 42 (250 units), Period 43 (300 units), and Period 44 (300 units). Based on the 3-period lead time, P42 should arrive in P45, P43 in P46, and P44 in P47. Current demand has stabilized in a higher regime (~350 units in the last two periods).

My analysis focuses on the 'Active Pipeline' (orders placed within the last 4 periods) and recent demand. Current on-hand inventory is 308 units. The active pipeline consists of P44 (300 units), P45 (350 units), and the current order. Recent demand has stabilized into a high regime, averaging ~300 units over the last 3 periods (352, 349, 242). With an actual lead time fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, I need to ensure coverage for approximately 3 periods of demand (~900 units). Current inventory (308) + P44 (300) + P45 (350) = 958 units. While this covers the immediate future, we are approaching the final periods (46-50). To avoid stockouts in the final stretch, particularly if P44 or P45 are lost (which happens ~50-60% of the time in this environment), I will place a moderate order to maintain the flow.

Lead Time & Pipeline: The actual lead time has stabilized at 2-3 periods. Orders from P44 (300) and P45 (350) are in transit. P44 (ordered 3 periods ago) is expected to arrive during P47. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 because it sees a massive 'In-transit' figure (2740 units). However, history proves the vast majority of this (specifically orders prior to P44) is lost. Adjusted Pipeline calculation: Only P44 (300), P45 (350), and P46 (350) are likely valid, totaling 1000 units. Strategy: With the game ending at P50, and a 3-period lead time, P47 is the last order likely to arrive (expected P50). We have 131 units on hand + 300 expected this period (P44). Expected demand for P47-P50 (4 periods) at ~210/period is 840 units. Valid pipeline (P44-P46) is 1000 units.

The pipeline contains several active orders: Period 44 (300 units, overdue), Period 45 (350 units), and Period 46 (350 units). Even if we account for the historical ~50-60% loss rate, at least one of these large shipments is highly likely to arrive in P48, P49, or P50. Specifically, P44 is at T+4 and P45 is at T+3, which matches our observed arrival window. Given that there are only 3 periods of demand left (including this one), and we have 131 units on hand plus over 1000 units in the immediate pipeline, we are significantly overstocked relative to the remaining time.
