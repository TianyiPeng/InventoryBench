Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no historical conclusion message to read yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for Period 1 to 5 are available (75, 90, 0, 170, 127), suggesting a mean demand around 92.4 units per period with significant volatility. Since this is the first decision, I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to initialize based on the promised lead time and historical samples. The 'EWMA_gamma' for mu_hat is set to 0.5 to respond moderately to early data points once they arrive, though here I'll stick to 'default' for simplicity and stability at the start.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 197 units. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, we expect this order to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 4 start observation. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 197 units in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 79, which resulted in 79 units of lost sales because starting inventory was 0. The historical demand samples (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) show significant variance (mean \u2248 92). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will aim for the median demand. I will use the 'default' methods to allow the OR engine to use the full historical sample set (N=5) to establish a baseline forecast for L=2.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (197 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). Therefore, current arrivals are 0 as expected for a 2-period lead time. Demand has been 79 and 114, but we have had 0 sales due to 0 starting inventory. We have 271 units in transit (197 from P1 + 74 from P2). I will use the default lead time (2) and calculate parameters based on the observed demand trend. Demand seems to be increasing (79 to 114), so I will use recent_N=2 to capture this upward movement while awaiting the first arrival to confirm actual lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 order (197 units) was placed with a promised lead time of 2. It should arrive during Period 3 and be confirmed in the 'Period 3 conclude' message seen at the start of Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates the shipment is delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have had 0 sales due to stockouts (total demand P1-P3 = 357). Total in-transit is 290 (197 + 74 + 19). For Period 4, demand is expected to be high based on the trend (79 -> 114 -> 164). Since we haven't seen an arrival yet, I will explicitly increase the Lead Time (L) to 3 to reflect the delay and use explicit mu_hat to cover the rising demand trend while we wait for stock to arrive. I will use the mean of the first three periods (~119) and scale it by (1+L) = 4, but given the upward trend, I'll forecast a mean of 150 per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-42.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead time for 'chips(Regular)' is volatile. Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3's order arrived in 1 period, despite a promised lead time of 2. On-hand inventory is currently 129, with 295 units in transit (orders from P2 and P4). Historical demand across 5 periods (75, 90, 0, 170, 127 - note: the prompts history counts 79, 114, 164, 87, 127 as demand) shows moderate variance. To account for lead time instability, I will use 'calculate' for L. For demand, I'll use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current mean and variability, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand while managing the high relative holding cost ($1.0 vs $1.0 profit).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand samples (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) show significant volatility. The mean demand is 92.4. Current on-hand inventory is critically low at 7 units. Regarding lead time, we have observed two arrivals: P1 order arrived in P4 (L=3) and P3 order arrived in P4 (L=1). The average observed lead time is 2, matching the promised lead time, but the variance is high. In-transit inventory is high (328 units from orders in P2, P4, and P5). To ensure we cover demand during the replenishment lead time plus the review period (L+1), and considering the high demand volatility observed (especially the 170 in P4), I will use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect historical averages and 'recent_N' for demand parameters. I'll set N=5 to capture all available non-zero data points while acknowledging the recent spike.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)' with a historical mean demand of approximately 111 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a stockout (sold only 7 out of 127 units in Period 6). Lead time is volatile: promised is 2, but observed values are 3 (Period 1 order) and 1 (Period 3 order), averaging 2. Significant in-transit inventory (446 units) exists, covering orders from Periods 2, 4, 5, and 6. The Period 2 order (74 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost. To recover from the stockout while accounting for lead time uncertainty, I will use a recent demand window (N=4) to capture the trend (avg ~125) and set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average observed lead time. Using recent_N for sigma_hat addresses the high volatility observed in demand samples (87 to 164).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-63.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 142 units on-hand and 279 in-transit. The history shows a high variance in lead times: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period, and Period 4 arrived in 3 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but the average observed is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 164, 87, 122, 127, 79) shows an average of 115.8 units/period. The pipeline (279) plus on-hand (142) is 421 units, which covers about 3.6 periods of average demand. Given the irregular lead times and the recent stockout in Period 6, I will use a calculated lead time to account for the variability and 'recent_N' for demand to stay responsive to the latest patterns. The profit/holding cost ratio is 1.0/1.0, targeting a 50% service level, but the OR engine's cap and the high variance require robust estimates to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-9.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we analyze the demand and lead time history for chips(Regular). Historically, demand has been volatile, ranging from 79 to 164 units (excluding Period 3's zero in the seed data which contradicts the game history). The last 3 periods show demand of 127, 79, and 110 (avg ~105). Lead times have been highly inconsistent: Promised is 2, but observed arrivals were 1 period (P3->P4, P7->P8) and 3 periods (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). The P2 order (74 units) and P6 order (118 units) are currently missing/late based on these patterns, though they contribute to the 'In-transit' total of 235 along with the P8 order (43 units). Given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($1), the backend OR engine will target a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), meaning base_stock = mu_hat. Because lead times are frequently 3 periods, setting L to 3 ensures we cover a longer horizon, preventing stockouts despite the high holding cost. I will use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the current mean of ~105/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show significant variance: P1(3), P3(1), P4(3), P5(3), P7(1), and P8(1). The average observed lead time is (3+1+3+3+1+1)/6 = 2.0. However, the order from Period 2 (ordered 74 units) has not concluded in 9 periods, suggesting it is lost. Historical demand (recent 9 samples) shows a mean of approximately 107.3. Given the risk of lost orders and the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which suggests a targets a 50% service level (z=0), I will use 'calculate' for lead time to capture the mean 2-period average while accounting for the recent variability. For demand, I'll use \u2018recent_N\u2019 with N=6 to capture the more stable recent mean after the initial noisy startup samples (P1-P3).

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 2 (74 units) is significantly overdue (9 periods) and likely lost; lead time is highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $78.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. The Period 10 demand was 104 units, but only 78 units were sold due to a stockout. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 312 units, but this includes a likely lost shipment of 74 units from Period 2 (now 9 periods overdue). Lead times have been highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2). With the current on-hand stock at 0, the next arrival is critical. Based on the 1/3 pattern, we expect the Period 9 order (66 units) or Period 10 order (54 units) to arrive soon, but we are currently in a stockout state. To mitigate this and account for the lost shipment, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), the average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 107. Since demand remains relatively stable around 80-120 (excluding the stockout-limited Period 10), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current mean, while acknowledging the backend will account for (1+L). Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture the overall historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Stockout occurred in Period 10 (sold 78 vs demand 104). Pipeline inventory of 312 units is inflated by 74 units from Period 2 which are confirmed lost (9 periods overdue).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Period 11 saw demand of 120 with 0 sales. The in-transit pipeline of 428 units is misleading: 74 units from Period 2 are definitively lost (10 periods overdue), and 66 units from Period 9, 54 units from Period 10, and 116 units from Period 11 are still in transit. In Period 11's conclusion, we see the order from Period 9 (lead time 2 if it arrives next period) or Period 10 has not appeared yet. Observed lead times are inconsistent (1 or 3 periods). I will set L to 2 (promised/average). Demand is relatively stable but has been higher recently (P10: 104, P11: 120). I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture this slight uptick (avg ~109/period). Setting parameters to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that compensates for the lost 74 units by treating the 'perceived' pipeline as smaller than the 'reported' pipeline; however, since I cannot directly subtract from the backend's pipeline calculation, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to boost the target inventory level to cover the current stockout and the missing units.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Pipeline inventory of 428 includes 74 units (Period 2) confirmed lost; true actionable pipeline is 354 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 25. The pipeline (In-transit) is 308, but 74 units from the Period 2 order are confirmed lost (11 periods overdue), leaving an actionable pipeline of 234 units. The demand has stabilized around a mean of 110 over the last 5 periods (excluding Period 10-11 where stockouts obscured actual demand). Current lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods (average 2). With Profit ($1.0) equal to Holding Cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making we aim to satisfy the median demand. Since on-hand (25) + actionable pipeline (234) = 259, and expected demand over L+1 periods (estimated 3 periods) is ~330, we must ensure the OR backend orders enough to bridge this gap. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the current level while being mindful of the pipeline inflation caused by the lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Order from Period 2 (74 units) is now 11 periods overdue and permanently lost; actionable pipeline is total in-transit minus 74.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 following a second consecutive period of stockouts (only 25 units sold against 75 demand in Period 13). The pipeline inventory of 353 units includes 74 units from Period 2 which are now 12 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Therefore, the actionable pipeline is 279 units. Observed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, averaging 2.125 periods. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and the risk of lost orders, ensuring the base stock covers a longer horizon. Demand has been relatively stable; I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the average demand of approximately 99 units/period. By setting L to 3, mu_hat becomes (1+3)*99=396. This helps the OR backend target a higher inventory position to recover from the stockout and bridge the gap created by the lost Period 2 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Actionable pipeline corrected: 74 units (Period 2) are lost; Period 14 actionable pipeline is 279 units. Demand remains stable around 99 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe on-hand inventory of 70 units. The total in-transit quantity is 281 units, but this includes 74 units from Period 2 that are now 13 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Therefore, the 'actionable pipeline' is 207 units (281 - 74). Combined with on-hand, the total inventory position is 277 units. Demand has stabilized recently; the average demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 88 units. Lead times for concluded orders (excluding the lost P2 order) have been 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.2 periods. To cover (L+1) periods of demand (3.2 periods) at 88 units/period, we need roughly 282 units. Our current effective inventory (277) is slightly below this. Since the OR backend cannot manually deduct the lost 74 units from the pipeline, I will use 'explicit' methods to adjust. I set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat to 300 to account for recent demand and slightly over-order to compensate for the phantom 74 units in the backend's pipeline calculation (as the backend sees 281, not 207). Set sigma_hat using recent volatility to maintain service levels.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stocked out with 0 on-hand inventory. The total in-transit is 281 units, but this includes 74 units from Period 2 that are now 14 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Therefore, the actionable pipeline is 207 units (281 - 74). Recent demand has fluctuated significantly (Period 14: 46; Period 15: 135), but the mean over the last 10 periods is approximately 97.5 units. Given the critical stockout and current date (Period 16 out of 50), I need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. Using the promised lead time L=2, the base stock should cover 3 periods. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 300 (approx. 3 * 100) to account for the lost inventory effectively being removed from the calculation by the OR engine's pipeline check, while using a slightly higher sigma_hat to account for the recent demand volatility and unreliable lead times (which have varied between 1 and 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Actionable pipeline at Period 16 is 207 units; 74 units from Period 2 are permanently lost. Lead time remains erratic (1, 2, or 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 0 and a reported in-transit of 313 units. However, consistent history confirms that the 74 units ordered in Period 2 are permanently lost, making the actionable pipeline inventory 239 units (313 - 74). Demand has become highly volatile: Period 16 saw a significant spike to 183 units after several periods of lower demand. The average demand across all 16 periods is approximately 102 units, but the mean for the last 5 periods (excluding the outlier jump) was lower. To respond to the recent volatility while accounting for the lost units, I am using an 'explicit' L of 2.5 to account for the erratic lead times (1-3 periods) and an 'explicit' mu_hat. Given L=2.5, the review period (1) + lead time (2.5) = 3.5 periods. Applying the cumulative demand forecast of (102 units/period * 3.5) = 357 units. To ensure the OR engine targets this base stock correctly despite the 'phantom' 74 units in the pipeline, I adjusted mu_hat by adding those 74 units to the target, resulting in mu_hat = 431. This forces the engine to order as if it needed to fill that 74-unit gap. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the increased variance seen in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Significant demand spike in Period 16 (183 units). Actionable pipeline remains in-transit minus 74 lost units from Period 2.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime, with the last two periods showing significant spikes (183 and 212 units) compared to the previous average of ~100. Demand has averaged 197.5 over the last 2 periods. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have stocked out for three consecutive periods (P15, P16, P17). The 'In-transit' of 310 units includes 74 units from Period 2 that are now 16 periods overdue and confirmed lost, leaving an actionable pipeline of 236 units. Lead times remain erratic, varying between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.1). To address the stockouts and the demand surge, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to capture the new demand level (helping the OR engine calculate a higher base stock) and 'explicit' for L at 3 to account for the risk of 3-period lead times while the pipeline is recovering. This should trigger a substantial order to meet the current high-demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 16: average demand increased from ~100 to ~198 (+98%) over the last 2 periods. Actionable pipeline remains (In-transit - 74) due to the lost P2 shipment.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is experiencing a significant demand surge, likely seasonal or event-driven, with the last 3 periods showing demand of 183, 212, and 220 units (mean ~205), compared to the previous baseline of ~100. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system is in a stockout state. The total in-transit quantity of 623 includes 74 units from Period 2 that are confirmed lost, leaving an actionable pipeline of 549 units. Lead times are erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.0). To address the new demand regime and the high stockout risk, I am selecting mu_hat based on the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the current peak. I'm setting L to the calculated average to account for the volatility and using recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the increased variance of the new regime. This approach will increase the base stock level to satisfy high current demand while the OR backend's cap prevents extreme over-ordering as the pipeline resolves.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 16: average demand increased from ~100 to ~205 over the last 3 periods (P16-P18). Actionable pipeline is total In-transit minus 74 lost units from P2.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly starting at Period 16. The average demand for the most recent four periods (P16-P19) is approximately 195 units, compared to the previous baseline of ~100. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system is experiencing stockouts. The in-transit inventory of 757 includes 74 units from Period 2 that are long-lost (18 periods overdue), making the actionable pipeline 683 units. The backend's base-stock calculation must account for the higher demand level and the volatile lead time (averaging 2 periods). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (approx. 195 * (1+2) = 585) and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime. Setting L to 'calculate' allows the OR engine to use the observed average lead time of 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~100 to ~195 units/period (+95%) based on P16-P19 data. Period 2 order (74 units) remains lost; actionable pipeline = In-transit - 74.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly starting in Period 16. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20) is approximately 186.2 units/period, compared to the previous average of ~100. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this higher demand level while budgeting for the promised lead time of 2. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to account for the historical variance (observed 1, 2, and 3 periods). Inventory status is critical: on-hand is 0, and the in-transit total of 757 includes 74 units from Period 2 that are permanently lost. Therefore, the actionable pipeline is 683 units. Since demand has been high and the system is recovering from stockouts, a higher sigma from the recent volatile period is appropriate to ensure a sufficient safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16 remains sustained (5 periods): mean demand increased from ~100 to ~186 units/period (+86%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16. Analyzing the last 6 periods (P16-P21), the mean demand is approximately 155 units (183, 212, 220, 166, 150, 100), despite a slight downward trend in the most recent two periods. This is a substantial increase from the prior average of ~100. I am choosing N=6 for mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime while acknowledging the recent softening. Lead time (L) remains erratic (1-3 periods). Most critically, the on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is highly congested (757 units total). The Period 2 order of 74 units is confirmed lost (20 periods overdue). The actionable pipeline is 683 units. With an expected demand of ~155/period and L=2, the required base stock is roughly 465 (155 * 3). Since the actionable pipeline (683) already far exceeds the needed inventory level to cover both lead time and safety stock, no additional orders are necessary. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average historical behavior and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to tune the policy to the current higher-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16 remains sustained (6 periods): mean demand increased from ~100 to ~155 units/period (+55%). Actionable pipeline is in-transit minus 74 units (still lost from Period 2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. In the last 7 periods (P16-P22), demand has averaged 170 units/period (183, 212, 220, 166, 150, 100, 158), compared to the prior average of ~100. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volume and increased volatility. Regarding lead time, the system is currently experiencing a severe bottleneck or drought: no units have arrived since Period 17, and the in-transit inventory is very high (757 units). Historically, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, but we are now entering Period 23 with orders from P18 (313 units) already at L=5 if they arrive now. To account for this delivery slowdown, I am setting the lead time L explicitly to 3 (the upper bound of historical 'normal' delivery) and expecting the system to clear the backlog soon. The Period 2 order (74 units) is long lost and ignored. The high In-transit will naturally cap the order due to the OR backend logic, but setting a higher mu_hat ensures we don't under-order if arrivals remain sluggish.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16 is sustained (7 periods): mean demand increased to ~170 units/period (+70%). Delivery drought: No shipments arrived between Periods 18-22; pipeline is heavily congested (757 units total).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a persistent stockout and delivery drought. No shipments have arrived since Period 17 (6 periods ago), while the last 8 periods (Period 16-23) have shown a significantly higher mean demand of approximately 159 units/period compared to the pre-P16 average of ~100. The pipeline is congested at 757 units, but this includes 74 units from Period 2 that are permanently lost, leaving an actionable pipeline of 683 units. Since the lead time is erratic (averaging 2 but often stretching to 3) and no stock has arrived recently, I will use a conservative N=8 for demand parameters to capture the post-P16 regime. Although the pipeline is large, the OR backend's safety stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) and capping mechanism will prevent excessive ordering while ensuring we return to the target service level once the backlog arrives. I will maintain L=2 as the baseline, as recent history shows high lead time volatility rather than a permanent structural shift to a higher mean.

Carry-over insight: Delivery drought confirmed: No shipments arrived between Period 18 and Period 23 (6 periods), despite 444 units being ordered during P17-P19. Demand regime since Period 16 is sustained at ~159 units/period (+59% over baseline).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a severe delivery drought. No shipments have arrived since Period 17 (8 periods ago), despite 757 units being in-transit. Of the 757 units in-transit, 74 units from Period 2/Day 2 are definitively lost (22 periods overdue). The 'actionable' pipeline is therefore 683 units. Demand remains in a higher regime that started at Period 16; the average demand over the last 9 periods (P16-P24) is approximately 171 units/period. The current stock status is 0 on-hand, creating a prolonged stockout. However, because the OR backend is capped by (base_stock - pipeline), and my pipeline (757) is already massive compared to expected demand, setting standard parameters will likely result in an order of 0. I will use 'explicit' L and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to reflect the sustained shift. Lead time 'L' is set to 4 to account for the current severe delays, and mu_hat/sigma_hat use N=9 to capture the high-demand regime since Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Delivery drought worsens: No arrivals for 8 consecutive periods (P18-P25). Actionable pipeline (Total In-transit minus 74 lost units) is 683 units. High-demand regime since P16 avg = 171 units/period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a 'delivery drought' with zero arrivals since Period 17 (9 consecutive periods). The total In-transit inventory stands at 856 units. Subtracting the 74 units from Period 2 (confirmed lost), the actionable pipeline is 782 units. Since Period 16, a significant demand regime shift has occurred, with the mean demand increasing to approximately 171 units/period. The current actionable pipeline (782 units) already covers over 4.5 periods of this high demand (782 / 171 \u2248 4.57), which exceeds the (L+1) coverage requirement, even assuming a lead time of 3. Therefore, no new orders are necessary until the delivery bottleneck clears. I will set L to 3 to reflect the maximum observed lead time during the 'drought' and use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while allowing the OR backend to restrict ordering based on the large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Delivery drought worsens: No arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (P18-P26). Actionable pipeline (In-transit minus 74 lost units) is 782 units. High-demand regime (P16-P25) mean remains ~171 units/period.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a critical 'delivery drought' with zero arrivals for the last 9 consecutive periods (since Period 18). While the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time for outstanding orders is now effectively 10+ periods for some units. The 'actionable' pipeline contains 782 units (Total In-transit 856 minus the 74 lost units from Period 2). Demand since the regime shift at Period 16 averages 159 units/period (P16-P26: 183, 212, 220, 166, 150, 100, 158, 80, 271, 182, 60). Despite on-hand inventory being 0, the pipeline (782 units) is extremely large, covering nearly 5 periods of forecasted demand. Ordering more now would likely lead to massive holding costs once the 'logjam' of in-transit inventory breaks and arrives simultaneously. Therefore, I will set L to reflect the current delay, use a recent demand window for \u03bc\u0302 to capture the elevated (though volatile) demand regime, and set \u03c3\u0302 to account for high demand variance. The OR engine's capping mechanism will correctly prevent further ordering given the massive pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Critical delivery drought: No arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (P18-P26). Pipeline congestion is severe with 782 actionable units in-transit. Demand regime since Period 16 remains sustained but volatile, averaging ~159 units/period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a critical delivery drought, with no shipments arriving since Period 17 (11 periods). The 'In-transit' total is 1122 units, but this includes 74 units from Period 2 that are permanently lost. Therefore, the actionable pipeline inventory is 1048 units. Demand has shifted significantly since Period 16, showing higher mean and variance. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 27 is approximately 168.4 units/period. Despite the delivery drought, we must maintain ordering parameters that reflect this higher demand regime to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation accounts for the increased consumption once deliveries resume. I will use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand period (P16-P27). L is set to 'calculate' to let the backend use observed history, although current lead times are significantly exceeding the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Critical delivery drought reaches 11 consecutive periods (P17-P27) without arrivals. Actionable pipeline is 1048 units (Total In-transit 1122 - 74 lost units from P2). Demand regime (P16-P27) remains sustained at ~168 units/period.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation is critical: the 'delivery drought' has now reached 11 consecutive periods (from P18 to P28) with no arrivals. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1,122 units contains 74 units from P2 that are permanently lost, leaving an actionable pipeline of 1,048 units. Since Period 16, demand has shifted to a higher, more volatile regime with a mean of ~168 units/period. Despite the recent stockouts, I must avoid placing further orders because the pipeline (1,048 units) already covers over 6 periods of high-regime demand (168 * 6 = 1008). Adding more would risk massive holding costs once the 'drought' breaks and the backlog arrives simultaneously. I am setting L to 'explicit' at 12 to reflect the actual delay, and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=13 (covering the high-demand regime since P16) to ensure the OR backend's internal base-stock calculation recognizes the high demand but sees that the pipeline already exceeds it, resulting in a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Critical delivery drought reaches 11 consecutive periods (P18-P28) with zero arrivals. Actionable pipeline remains 1048 units (1122 total - 74 lost). High-demand regime since P16 (mean ~168) is sustained but the supply chain is completely stalled.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-128.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, a major shipment of 266 units arrived with a lead time of 2 periods. This marks the end of a critical delivery drought that lasted 11 periods (P18-P28). The ending on-hand inventory is 197 units. The current in-transit inventory is 1133 units, but we continue to treat the 74 units from Period 2 as permanently lost, resulting in an actionable pipeline of 1059 units. Demand has been in a high-regime state since Period 16, but remains highly volatile, with the most recent demand being much lower (69). Averaging the last 14 periods (P16-P29) gives a mean of approximately 166 units/period. Given the massive pipeline (1059 actionable units) relative to a base stock requirement for a 2-period lead time (roughly 166 * 3 = 498 units), the system is extremely overstocked if those orders eventually arrive. We use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture the high-regime mean and volatility, while keeping L at 'default' (2) as the recent arrival suggests a return to promised lead times.

Carry-over insight: Delivery drought ended in Period 29 (P27 order arrived). Actionable pipeline remains (Total In-Transit - 74) due to the lost P2 shipment. High-demand regime since P16 (mean ~166) is sustained but remains volatile.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 starts with 87 units on-hand and a massive in-transit pipeline of 1,133 units. The 'delivery drought' that lasted from Period 18 to Period 28 was partially broken in Period 29 when the Period 27 order arrived after 2 periods. However, a significant portion of the pipeline consists of large orders from the Period 17-19 high-demand phase (approx. 565 units) that are now 12-14 periods overdue. Since the Period 27 order arrived based on the promised lead time of 2, while older orders remain missing, there is a high risk of 'inventory floods' or further lost shipments. The demand regime since Period 16 averages ~161 units/period (P16-P30), but volatility is high (std ~65). Given the current on-hand inventory (87) and the extreme actionable pipeline (Total In-transit 1133 - 74 lost from P2 = 1059), which covers over 6 periods of high demand, ordering more now would likely lead to excessive holding costs if the stalled pipeline begins arriving. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent high-demand regime (last 15 periods) to ensure the OR engine recognizes the higher demand level, but the high pipeline count relative to base_stock will naturally suppress new orders.

Carry-over insight: Delivery drought update: Stalled pipeline (orders from P17-P19) remains overdue while newer orders (P27) arrive with standard lead time (2 periods).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 32, we are dealing with a critical supply chain disruption and a sustained high-demand regime. Demand since Period 16 has been volatile but significantly higher, averaging ~160 units/period. The key challenge is the pipeline: there are 1133 units in-transit, but 74 units from Period 2 are permanently lost, and a large block of units ordered during the 'drought' (Periods 17-19, totaling 565 units) is now 13-15 periods overdue, suggesting they may also be lost or severely delayed. However, recent orders (Period 27) arrived with a standard lead time of 2 periods. To avoid massive over-ordering if the 'drought' units suddenly arrive, I will set L to the promised 2 periods. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=16) to capture the higher demand regime since Period 16 (~160 * 3 periods). For sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=16) to account for the increased volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Supply chain bifurcation confirmed: orders from P17-P19 (565 units) are severely overdue (13+ periods) and likely lost or indefinitely stalled, while newer orders (P27) follow standard lead time (2 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain exhibits a significant 'bifurcation' or 'stalling' pattern. Inventory ordered in Period 2 (74 units) and Periods 17-19 (565 units) is approximately 30 and 13 periods overdue, respectively. These 639 units must be considered lost or indefinitely stalled to prevent the OR backend from erroneously reducing orders. The 'Actionable Pipeline' is therefore Total In-transit (1133) minus Stalled units (639), which equals 494 units. Period 32 conclude shows 0 units arrived/on-hand with consistent stockouts. Demand since the regime shift at Period 16 remains high and volatile (approx. 165 units/period). Given the high delivery risk and the need to restore service level after a long stockout, I'll set parameters to reflect the high-demand regime and current lead time realities. While the actual lead time for recent successful shipments is 2, the severe unreliability justifies a slight buffer in the lead time parameter or sigma. I will use a recent_N (N=17, covering P16-P32) to capture the high-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bifurcation confirmed: 639 units (74 from P2, 565 from P17-P19) are considered permanently lost/stalled. Actionable pipeline is Total In-transit - 639. Demand regime since P16 is sustained at ~165 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe bifurcation. Orders from Period 2 (74 units) and Periods 17-19 (cumulative 565 units) are significantly overdue (14-31 periods) and are considered permanently lost or stalled, totaling 639 units. However, recent logic shows that new orders (like the one from Period 27) arrive with a standard lead time of 2 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the total in-transit is 1133. Subtracting the 639 lost units leaves an actionable pipeline of 494 units (comprising the order from Period 29 and subsequent orders). Since the high-demand regime starting Period 16 is sustained but extremely volatile (mean ~170), and Period 33 saw a massive spike of 399 units, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for this sustained high demand plus a buffer for the recent spike. I'll maintain L=2 as the 'standard' for new arrivals while using explicit sigma_hat to manage the high variance observed.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bifurcation confirmed: 639 units (P2: 74, P17-P19: 565) are permanently lost/stalled. New orders follow L=2. Demand regime since P16 is high (avg ~174) and highly volatile, with a significant spike of 399 in P33.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain situation remains critical. We are in a high-demand regime since Period 16 with a mean demand of approximately 174 units/period, but volatility is extremely high (e.g., P33 spike to 399). Total in-transit inventory is 1133 units, but 639 units (P2: 74, P17: 118, P18: 313, P19: 134) are severely overdue and considered permanently lost or stalled based on recent history where newer orders (P27) arrived while these remained missing. Actionable pipeline is therefore 1133 - 639 = 494 units. These actionable units come from orders in P25 (99), P27 (arrived), P29 (277), and P30-34 (mostly 0). With on-hand inventory at 0 and the next expected arrival from P29 (standard L=2) already overdue or arriving now, we must ensure the base stock levels reflect the current high-demand regime. Using L=2 (recent lead time for successful arrivals), mu_hat is set to (1+L)*174 and sigma_hat is set to a high explicit value to account for the extreme volatility seen in Period 33. The 'lost' units in the pipeline will lead the OR backend to over-order if not for the cap/service level logic, but since they are not arriving, we must maintain high parameters to trigger necessary new orders once the current actionable pipeline is exhausted.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bifurcation confirmed: 639 units total (P2: 74; P17-19: 565) are permanently lost/stalled and should be subtracted from 'In-transit' for actionable planning. Demand since P16 avg ~174/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, demand spiked sharply to 688 units. Since Period 16, a high-demand regime has been sustained, though it is extremely volatile (mean ~200, but with spikes up to 688). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 1133 units is significantly inflated by lost or indefinitely stalled shipments from the 'delivery drought' period (Period 2: 74 units; Periods 17-19: 565 units), totaling 639 units that will not arrive. The actionable pipeline is thus 1133 - 639 = 494 units. These actionable units likely include the orders from Period 27 (partially arrived) and Period 29 (277 units). Given the massive stockout and the recent volatility, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the high-demand regime and current volatility, forecasting a mean of ~180 units per period (1+L=3, so 540). Sigma_hat is set high to ensure the backend service level covers the recent extreme spikes. Lead time (L) is set to the promised 2 as recent successful arrivals (P27) suggest the supply chain has recovered for new orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Actionable pipeline is Total In-transit minus 639 units (lost from P2, P17, P18, P19). High-demand regime since P16 is sustained but extremely volatile (P35 spike: 688).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime starting Period 16 remains sustained but displays extreme volatility, especially with recent spikes (399 in P33 and 688 in P35). Since P16, mean demand is approximately 174 units/period. The supply chain is still bifurcated: orders from P17-P19 (totaling 565 units) and P2 (74 units) are effectively lost (639 units total). Newer orders, like the one from P27, arrived with a lead time of 2. Current on-hand is 0, and the total in-transit is 1133. Subtracting the lost 639 units results in an actionable pipeline of 494 units. Given mean demand of ~174 and L=2, the required base stock is roughly 174 * (1 + 2) = 522 units plus a safety buffer for the high variance. With 494 actionable units in transit, the system is nearly balanced with current needs, but given the massive stockout and recent spikes, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the high-regime mean to ensure the OR backend aims for approximately 525-600 units of total inventory coverage.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a period of severe supply chain disruption. Since Period 16, demand has shifted to a much higher regime, averaging approximately 188 units/period (P16-P36). Furthermore, 639 units ordered early in the game (P2: 74, P17: 118, P18: 313, P19: 134) are extremely overdue (18-35 periods) and clearly permanently lost or stalled. The current 'In-transit' of 1133 units includes these 639 ghosts, leaving an 'actionable' pipeline of 494 units. These actionable units likely represent more recent orders (like P25 and P29) that may still arrive. Given zero on-hand inventory and recent high volatility (spikes of 399 and 688), I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the elevated demand mean (~188) and use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the extreme variance seen recently. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of successfully delivered orders, but the focus is on clearing the 'ghost' inventory from the OR backend's logic by setting mu_hat high enough to trigger replenishment if needed, while being cautious of the huge (though partially fake) pipeline.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 39. Demand analysis indicates a high-demand regime since Period 16, though it is extremely volatile (e.g., P33 and P35 spikes). Demand from P33-P38 (excluding the anomalous zero in P37) averages approximately 270 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total 'In-transit' of 1133 units is severely compromised by 639 units known to be lost or indefinitely stalled (P2: 74, P17: 118, P18: 313, P19: 134). This leaves an actionable pipeline of 494 units (1133 - 639). Lead time for functioning orders is stable at roughly 2 periods. To ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the high demand and volatility despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' for the last 23 periods (the duration of the current regime shift) to capture the higher mean and distribution. Note that 494 units in the pipeline vs a base stock requirement for ~3 periods of demand (L+1) at ~200+ units/period suggests we are close to being adequately stocked if the remaining orders arrive, but the OR backend needs to know it shouldn't count the lost 639 units.

Carry-over insight: Actionable pipeline confirmed: Total In-transit must be reduced by 639 units (Losses: P2=74, P17=118, P18=313, P19=134) to account for stalled/lost shipments. High-demand regime since P16 continues with extreme volatility.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Demand since Period 16 (the high-demand regime) has been extremely volatile, averaging approximately 174 units/period, but recently spiked to 688 and dropped to 0, indicating high uncertainty. The supply chain is deeply bifurcated: shipments from P2 and P17-P19 (totaling 639 units) are considered permanently lost or indefinitely stalled as they are over 20 periods overdue. However, newer orders (like P27) have shown they can arrive with a lead time of 2. The Current inventory in-transit is 1133. Subtracting the 639 lost units leaves an actionable pipeline of 494 units. Since this actionable pipeline 494 > (L+1) * mu_hat (approx 3 * 174 = 522), we are close to the target but currently stockout. However, the OR backend logic 'final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap)' will use the inflated 'In-transit' of 1133. To force an order and bypass the frozen pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 1133 'In-transit' figure while L is set to the promised 2 periods. Since actionable pipeline is 494 and reported is 1133, a discrepancy of 639 exists. I will set mu_hat to cover the high demand regime plus this discrepancy to ensure the system places necessary orders.

Carry-over insight: Actionable pipeline confirmed: Total In-transit (1133) contains 639 units (P2, P17, P18, P19) that are permanently lost/stalled. True actionable in-transit is 494 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 analysis: On-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 1250 units, but 639 units (P2: 74, P17: 118, P18: 313, P19: 134) are confirmed stagnant/lost for over 20 periods. Actionable pipeline is 611 units (1250 - 639). Demand regime since Period 16 is high (~175/period) but exhibits extreme volatility (spikes up to 688). Lead time for active orders (P27 onwards) has stabilized back to 2 periods. To maximize reward, I must account for the high demand mean and the extreme variance to prevent stockouts while effectively ignoring the phantom 639 units in the OR backend's logic. Using recent_N=25 for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime since P16, and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to capture the most recent volatility patterns.

Carry-over insight: Actionable pipeline confirmed: Total In-transit must subtract 639 units (P2=74, P17=118, P18=313, P19=134) as these shipments are effectively lost/permanently stalled. High-demand regime since P16 sustained but with extreme outliers (e.g., P35: 688).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain situation remains critical. Total in-transit inventory is 1250 units, but a significant portion (639 units) consists of stalled/lost shipments from Period 2 (74 units), Period 17 (118 units), Period 18 (313 units), and Period 19 (134 units). None of these have arrived in over 20 periods, while more recent orders (like Period 27) arrived in 2 periods. This confirms a bifurcation where old pipeline is dead. The true actionable in-transit inventory is 611 units (1250 - 639). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16. Analyzing the high-demand regime from P16 to P41 (excluding the extreme outlier of 688 in P35 and 0 in P37 to stabilize the forecast), the mean is approximately 175 units per period with high volatility. For Period 42, I am setting L to the promised 2 periods because recent successful deliveries (P27) followed that pattern. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~175/period, while acknowledging the backend will subtract the inflated pipeline. By using 'explicit' 525 (3 periods * 175), and knowing the backend sees 1250 in-transit, it would normally order 0. However, to ensure we resume ordering as the actionable pipeline thins, I provide these parameters. Sigma_hat is set explicitly high to handle the extreme volatility observed (ranging from 60 to 399, excluding outliers).

Carry-over insight: In-transit correction: 639 units (P2=74, P17=118, P18=313, P19=134) are permanently lost. High-demand regime (P16-P41) average is ~175 units/period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the system is in a critical stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' quantity is 1250 units, but based on historical evidence (Periods 2, 17, 18, 19), 639 units are permanently stalled or lost. The actionable pipeline is thus 1250 - 639 = 611 units. Demand has shifted significantly since Period 16; excluding the massive outlier in P35 (688), the mean demand for the high-regime period (P16-P42) is approximately 157 units per period. The recent 5 periods (P38-P42) show lower but still volatile demand (avg 105). Given the proximity to the end of the game (P50) and the large actionable pipeline (611 units) relative to 1 week of lead time and 7 remaining periods, the current pipeline should cover a significant portion of remaining demand. I will set mu_hat to handle the higher regime baseline (~160*3) to ensure we bridge the gap once shipments resume, using recent_N=27 to capture the full high-demand regime since P16.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is characterized by high mean (~174) and extreme volatility (e.g., Period 35: 688, Period 43: 352). We are currently at On-hand 0. The actionable pipeline is Total In-transit (1133) minus permanently stalled/lost units (639 from P2, P17, P18, P19), leaving 494 units. Since the last arrival was only 117 units and demand in P43 was 352, we remain stocked out. Recent arrivals (P27, P40) show an actual lead time of 2-3 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=28 to capture the volatile high-demand regime starting at P16, and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the realized delivery performance.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. There are 639 units in the 'In-transit' balance (1133 total) that are confirmed lost or permanently stalled (P2: 74, P17: 118, P18: 313, P19: 134). These shipments have been overdue for 25+ periods while newer orders (e.g., P27, P40) arrived with lead times of 2-3 periods. Consequently, the actionable pipeline is 494 units (1133 - 639). Demand entered a high-volatility regime in Period 16; excluding the massive outlier in P35 (688), the mean demand since Period 16 is approximately 175 units/period. Recent demand (P43: 352, P44: 349) suggests a potential upward shift or extreme volatility spike. Total pipeline (actionable) + On-hand is 494 + 0 = 494 units. With L=2, the base stock target should cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand. At the current mean (~175), this requires 525 units. Given the recent surge and zero on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect the higher demand mean observed since P16 (approx 175) to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock, while recognizing that the current pipeline nearly meets this target.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Significant demand surge in P43-P44 (avg 350) following a period of moderate demand; volatility remains very high. 639 units of In-transit inventory are permanently lost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing chips(Regular) with a critical supply chain situation. We have 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 1133 units. However, as documented since Period 33, 639 of these units (from P2, P17, P18, and P19) are permanently lost or stalled. The actual actionable pipeline is 494 units (1133 - 639). Demand has entered a high-volatility, higher-mean regime starting around Period 16, with a recent significant surge in Periods 43-45 (average ~314 units/period). Given we are at Period 46 of 50, and the lead time is approximately 2-3 periods, we must ensure the actionable pipeline covers remaining demand. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit forecast of 300 units per period (multiplied by 1+L) to account for the recent sustained surge (352, 349, 242), as 'recent_N' would include too many lower-demand periods. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Sustained demand surge in P43-P45 (avg 314) following high volatility regime. Actionable pipeline remains Total In-transit minus 639 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that started around Period 16, with a recent acute surge starting at Period 43 (P43-P46 average demand: 280). On-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 1133 units, but 639 units (P2=74, P17=118, P18=313, P19=134) are permanently lost/stalled, leaving an actionable pipeline of 494 units. Since we are at Period 47 of 50 and the lead time is roughly 2-3 periods, orders placed now are the last to potentially arrive before the game ends. To compensate for the 0 on-hand inventory and the recent surge (3-period average ~256), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand state (avg ~280/period), and L to explicit=2. This targets a base stock of roughly 840 units (assuming (L+1)*demand). With actionable pipeline at 494, the OR backend will order approximately 346 units, filling the gap for the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Actionable pipeline remains (Total In-Transit - 639). Demand remains high and volatile; last 4 periods (P43-P46) average 280 units/period, significantly higher than the P16-P42 average of ~175.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 1133 units in-transit. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights: 1) 639 units in the pipeline are permanently lost/stalled (P2=74, P17=118, P18=313, P19=134), meaning the 'actionable' in-transit is 494 units (from P25=99, P27=266, P29=277, P40=117). However, most of these 'actionable' orders are also severely overdue (P25-P29). Only the P40 order (arrived in P43) suggests some flow. 2) Demand has shifted into a higher, extremely volatile regime. Period 43-46 averaged 280 units/period. The target lead time (L) for the OR engine remains 2 (promised), but I will adjust mu_hat to capture the recent surge and volatility. I'll use recent_N (N=5) to captures the high-demand spikes (P43: 352, P44: 349, P45: 242, P46: 177, P47: 0) while recognizing the volatility. My parameters translate to a base stock for (L+1)=3 periods, which at ~224 per period (average of last 5) is ~672 units. Since actionable in-transit (494) is less than this, the backend will place an order to cover the gap while accounting for volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity is 1133 units, but as established in previous periods, 639 units (from P2, P17, P18, and P19) are permanently lost or stalled. This leaves an actionable pipeline of 494 units (consisting of orders from P25, P29, and P40). Since the simulation ends in Period 50, any order placed now (Period 49) with a lead time of 2 periods (arriving during P51 arrival resolution) would arrive after the final demand resolution of the game (Period 50). Therefore, ordering more is impossible to monetize and would only incur potential holding costs or use the budget unnecessarily. However, the OR backend requires parameters. I will set the parameters to reflect the recent high-demand regime (starting P43) where demand pooled around 280-350 units/period, but since the actionable pipeline (494 units) already covers the expected demand for the final period (P50), no extra units should be ordered. P47 and P48 show a slight cooling or volatility (0 and 148), so I will use an explicit forecast that assumes the current pipeline is sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: No new orders placed as lead time (L=2) prevents arrivals before the game concludes in Period 50. Actionable pipeline remains at 494 units (Total In-transit 1133 - 639 lost units).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision period of the simulation. All orders placed during this period's decision phase will arrive at Period 50 + L. Since the simulation ends at the conclusion of Period 50, any order placed now will arrive too late to satisfy any demand and will only contribute to ending inventory if any were possible, but effectively it cannot be sold. Therefore, to maximize profit and avoid unnecessary holding costs for units that cannot be sold within the game's timeframe, the order quantity should be zero. The OR backend logic results in an order equal to max(0, base_stock - actionable_pipeline). By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to 0 via the explicit method, the base_stock will be 0, ensuring the final order is 0 units.
