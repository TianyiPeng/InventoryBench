Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows an upward trend (103, 81, 107, 127, 160). The average demand over these 5 samples is 115.6. Given the growth trend, especially the jump in the last two periods (127 and 160), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent context. The promised lead time is 2, and the OR engine uses the (1+L) logic, so it will forecast for a 3-period window (current period + 2 periods of lead time). Target service level q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish the pipeline inventory immediately.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, an order of 165 units was placed. Per the game mechanics, with L=2, an order placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude (read at the start of Period 4). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' in the Period 1 conclude is expected. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 165 units in-transit. Demand in P1 was 118, which is slightly higher than the provided historical samples (mean ~115). Since we are only at Period 2 and the sample size is small, I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (including the P1 observation of 118) to capture the most recent behavior while acknowledging the small sample set. I will maintain L at the promised value of 2 to ensure the OR backend calculates the base stock for a 3-period window (L+1).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period_3. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) was [103, 81, 107, 127, 160], while the demand recorded during the first two game periods was 118 and 88. The mean demand across all 7 data points is approximately 112. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. No units have arrived yet, which is consistent with L=2 (Period 1's order is expected to arrive in Period 3's arrival phase and will be visible in the Period 4 start message). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 332 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since demand appears relatively stable with a slight upward trend in later samples, I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand forecasting to capture potential growth while keeping the lead time at its default promised value.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 165 units, which should have arrived during Period 3's resolution and been visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message (read at the start of Period 4). However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates the shipment from Period 1 is delayed or lost. Since the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 436 units (sum of orders from P1, P2, P3: 165+167+104=436), no stock has physically reached the shelves yet (sold=0 for all periods). Historical demand for the first 5 samples is slightly higher on average (115.6) than the demand seen in the first 3 game periods (118, 88, 108; avg=104.6). Given the missing shipment, I will explicitly set L=3 to account for the delay witnessed (P1 order did not arrive in P3). I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the lower game-start demand vs the pre-game samples, while adjusting L to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for longer lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1231.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two orders arrived: the Period 1 order (L=3) and the Period 3 order (L=1). The promised lead time is 2, and the average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. Demand history for the first five periods is [118, 88, 108, 75, 160]. Note that 'sold' was 0 for Periods 1-3 because no inventory was on-hand. The recent demand (Period 5) spiked to 160, while the previous four periods averaged ~97. Given the variance in both lead time (1 to 3 periods) and demand (75 to 160), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full sample set for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the sample size is small and reflects the observed volatility. L will be set to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of the observed lead times (which is currently 2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1706.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead-time history. Demand over the first 5 periods has been 118, 88, 108, 75, and 95 (mean \u2248 96.8). The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals show significant variance: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, and Period 3 arrived in 1 period, while Period 2 (ordered in P2) is currently overdue (it should have arrived in P4 or P5). Period 2's 167 units are still 'In-transit', making the current pipeline (353 units) seemingly healthy, but the reliability of the supplier is low. Given the start-up phase and fluctuating lead times, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed performance. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent history, as the demand appears relatively stable around the mean of 97. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat as well to account for current volatility. The OR backend will target a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1881.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 353 units in-transit. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 101 units per period (samples: 118, 88, 108, 75, 95, 122). The lead time is volatile: we observed a 3-period lead time for the P1 order and a 1-period lead time for the P3 order, averaging 2 periods which matches the promised lead time. However, the P2 order (167 units) is still missing after 5 periods (placed P2, now P7), suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. My strategy is to set L to 2 (default) as the average is currently 2, but I will use a larger N for the demand forecast to smooth out the noise and ensure the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) targets a base stock level that covers (L+1) periods of demand. Given the stockout in P6 and the missing P2 shipment, the OR engine needs to re-evaluate the pipeline; since 353 units are in-transit (P2, P4, P5), if P2 is indeed lost, the system will trigger a new order to fill the gap.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. P2 order (167 units) is overdue (5 periods passed), potentially lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $627.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The demand for chips(Regular) shows a recent upward trend (P7 demand was 167), but the average across the last 5 periods (P3-P7: 108, 75, 95, 122, 167) is approximately 113. Lead time is volatile: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, P4 took 3 periods. Crucially, the P2 order (167 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost, as later orders (P3 and P4) have already arrived. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 322 in-transit (P5: 153, P7: 2, and the likely lost P2: 167). If we discount the lost P2 order, the 'true' pipeline is only 155. To compensate for the lost units and higher recent demand, I am using L=2 (promised) but calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the volume increase. The 'explicit' L=2 is chosen because calculating the average lead time including the lost P2 would artificially inflate L and cause the OR backend to undershoot orders for current needs.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (167 units) confirmed lost (6 periods since order, subsequent orders arrived). Demand showing upward trend: P7 demand (167) is +47% above the 5-period average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2945.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Recent demand (P7: 167, P8: 214) is significantly higher than the initial average (~100), indicating a clear upward trend or shift to a higher demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this (averaging P6: 122, P7: 167, P8: 214). Lead times are highly volatile: P1 (3), P3 (1), P4 (3), P5 (3), P7 (1). The average observed lead time is 2.2 periods. Because of this volatility and the lost shipment in Period 2 (which the OR backend does not know is lost), I will set L explicitly to 2.5 to increase the safety stock buffer and account for the high pipeline risk. I am setting sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to focus on the increased volatility observed during this demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 7-8 average (190.5) is 84% higher than Period 1-5 average (103.4). Lead time volatility persists between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2223.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are facing an inventory stockout (starting on-hand: 0) following three consecutive periods of stockouts due to a significant demand regime shift. Demand since Period 7 has averaged 193.3 units (167, 214, 199), which is roughly double the historical mean (~103). Lead times are highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P4/P5/P7/P8 observed arrivals support this). The P2 order (167 units) is definitively lost. We have 411 units in-transit (orders from P9 and likely P10), but given the stockout and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), we must set parameters that aggressively capture the new high-demand regime and buffer against the 3-period lead time risk. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the high-demand periods (7, 8, 9) and use 'explicit' for L to account for the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods to ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains high: Periods 7-9 average demand is 193.3. Lead time volatility continues with confirmed 3-period arrivals twice in history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly upward since Period 7. While the initial average (P1-P5) was ~103, the recent demand (P7-P10) averages ~176, despite P10's slight dip (125). We are currently at zero on-hand inventory and have faced stockouts for the last five periods due to high demand and lead time volatility. Historical lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.2). The order from Period 2 (167 units) is confirmed lost. Currently, 644 units are in transit (orders from P9 and P10). Given the critical stockout situation and the demonstrated demand regime, I will set L to 3 (the conservative upper bound of observed lead times) to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the high-demand regime (Periods 7-10), which averages ~176 units per period. This results in a mu_hat of approx 704 (176 * (1+3)). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) due to a demand regime shift and recent delivery delays. Historically, actual lead times oscillate between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.2 periods), while the promised lead time is 2. Demand significantly increased around Period 7; the average demand from Period 7 to 11 is approximately 178.8 units, compared to the initial average of 103.4. The 'In-transit' balance of 835 units includes orders from Period 9 (244), Period 10 (233), Period 11 (191), and the new order from Period 12. Since orders from Period 9 and 10 are still pending (at periods 3 and 2 of their transit respectively), I will set L to 3 to account for the observed upper bound of lead time volatility. For demand, I choose N=5 to capture the recent high-demand regime (Periods 7-11) to ensure the base stock captures the current consumption rate of ~179 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high level: Period 7-11 average demand is 178.8 (+73% vs initial baseline). Lead time remains volatile between 1-3 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU chips(Regular) has 264 units on-hand and 358 in-transit. A review of the demand history (Periods 7-12) confirms a sustained regime shift with demand averaging approximately 184.5 units per period. The lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Recent arrivals: P9 took 3 periods, P10 took 2, P8 took 1). Because the system uses a capped base-stock policy, I will set 'L' to 3 to ensure the inventory target accounts for the observed upper bound of lead time, preventing stockouts during longer delivery windows. For demand forecast (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 7-12). For volatility (sigma_hat), N=6 is also used to reflect the increased variance observed since Period 7. This configuration aims to maintain sufficient buffer for a 3-period lead time at the current higher demand level while preventing over-ordering due to the high on-hand and pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 7-12 average demand is 184.5 (vs initial ~103). Lead time volatility confirmed between 1-3 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has clearly shifted upward since Period 7. The average demand from Period 7 to Period 13 is approximately 189 units per period, compared to the initial baseline of ~103. Lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.16 observed). Currently, we have 49 units on-hand and 586 units in-transit (orders from P11, P13). In-transit inventory is high because two major orders (P11 for 191 units and P13 for 228 units) are still pending. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed lead time average. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the high-demand regime (Periods 7-13). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to account for the increased volatility in this new regime. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the sustained higher demand and lead time uncertainty while considering the large pipeline already in motion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3800.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has clearly shifted upward since Period 7. The initial baseline (Periods 1-6) averaged 101 units, while the recent regime (Periods 7-14) averages 190.5 units. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture this higher mean for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Regarding lead time, the promised value is 2, but actual observed lead times are volatile: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3 (average approx 2.22). Given that 3 periods is a frequent occurrence and we have an 'In-transit' balance of 557 units against a small 'On-hand' balance of 38 units, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average, which accounts for the frequent delays to 3 periods. This approach maintains sufficient pipeline inventory to meet the elevated demand while managing the risk of stockouts during 3-period lead time events.

Daily Reward (R_t): $722.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 15 where demand (158) exceeded available stock (38). Demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 7; the average demand from Period 7 to 15 is 187 units. Lead times continue to be highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a recent trend toward 3 periods (Period 11 order arrived in P14). The Period 13 order (228 units) is expected to arrive in Period 16 (L=3), which will resolve the current stockout. To maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.95), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (Period 7-15) to capture the current regime's mean (approx 187) and high variance. L is set to 3 to reflect the current maximum observed lead time and ensure the base stock covers the full risk window.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P7-P15) stable with average demand ~187 units (+80% vs early baseline). Lead time remains volatile but frequently hits 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3672.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 7. The average demand from Period 7 to Period 16 is approximately 187.9 units, which is a significant increase from the initial baseline (~103). Lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the most frequent outcome for recent orders (P9, P11, P13). To mitigate the risk of stockouts during these longer lead times, I am explicitly setting L to 3. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and volatility. Current on-hand inventory is low (33), but the in-transit pipeline is very large (622 units), covering nearly 3.3 periods of average demand. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine if the pipeline is sufficient or if a small buffer order is needed to reach the base stock target.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-regime pattern starting around Period 7. The average demand from Period 7 to Period 17 is approximately 184 units, which is a significant increase from the initial baseline of ~103. Recent demand (Periods 12-17) remains consistent with this average (avg: 196). Lead time continues to exhibit high volatility, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being a frequent occurrence (observed in P11, P13, P14 orders). To account for this lead time uncertainty and the high demand, I am setting L to 3 (the observed maximum) to ensure the system targets enough inventory to cover the longest likely delay. I will use the last 11 samples (since the P7 regime shift) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which focuses the OR backend on the current high-demand environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1729.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly around Period 7 and has remained stable at a higher level since. Over the last 12 periods (P7-P18), the average demand is approximately 189 units per period. The most recent demand (P18) was 250, though the preceding periods (P14-P17) hovered near 185-200. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=12 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime. Lead time (L) remains highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Average=2.33 based on history). Setting L to 2 (promised) is too risky given the frequency of 3-period arrivals; however, 'calculate' (unweighted average) is more adaptive to the specific observed history of outcomes. The current inventory position is precarious with 0 on-hand, and while 755 units are in-transit, the lead time instability has led to stockouts in periods 15 and 18. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=12) targets the volatility of the current regime to ensure the OR backend increases safety stocks appropriately for the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~189 units/period (P7-P18 average). Lead time volatility continues with a mode of 3 periods (observed 7 times) vs a promised 2.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and high demand. The demand regime has shifted and stabilized at a significantly higher level (~189 units/period) starting from Period 7. The most recent demand (P19) was 215. The average of the last 13 periods (P7-P19) is approximately 190.9 units. Lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the most frequent outcome (observed 7 times). To protect against stockouts given the zero inventory and lead time uncertainty, I am setting the lead time L to 3 (the observed mode/maximum) and using N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the much lower initial samples (P1-P6). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient for a 4-period window (L+1) at the current high demand levels.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted from ~103 to ~189 units starting around Period 7, but Period 20 shows a significant spike to 324 (+71% above the previous high average), suggesting a potential new demand shock or seasonal peak. On-hand inventory is depleted (0), and stockouts have occurred for the last two periods. The pipeline is very full (884 units), including orders from Period 15, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Historical lead times frequently hit 3 periods, and the orders from Period 17 and 18 are now 'overdue' relative to the promised 2 periods but common for this system. Using explicit L=3 to account for the frequent delays. mu_hat is set using recent_N=14 to capture the high-demand regime while incorporating the recent spike, and sigma_hat is set to 150 (explicit) to account for the massive variance increase seen in Period 20, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher safety stock to recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike at Period 20: demand reached 324 units, which is 71% above the Period 7-19 average of 189. Lead time mode remains 3 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation (on-hand: 0) with a massive pipeline (1065 units). The demand has shifted into a significantly higher regime, spiking to 324 and 283 in the last two periods (Period 20-21). The average demand from Period 7-21 is approximately 201 units, but the last two periods average 303.5, suggesting a further upward shift or a seasonal peak. Lead time is highly volatile; although promised at 2, it frequently hits 3 periods, and the current delay (no arrivals since Period 17) suggests we are either seeing a string of 3+ period lead times or lost shipments. For Period 22, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to reflect the observed mode and current delay. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the recent spike (average ~274) while maintaining the statistical variance from the overall high-demand regime (Period 7-21) by using N=15 for sigma_hat. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent surge and the high variability in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand spike: Periods 20-21 average 303.5 units (+60% vs Period 7-19 average of 189). Pipeline congestion or lead-time extension: No arrivals since Period 17 (4 periods), despite orders placed in P18, P19, and P20.

A significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 20, with current demand averaging 309.7 units (Periods 20-22), an increase of ~64% over the previous stable mean of 189. Concurrently, there is a major breakdown in lead-time reliability. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time is frequently 3, and critically, no orders have arrived since Period 17 (a 5-period gap). This indicates that orders from P18, P19, and P20 are all overdue if lead time were 3. To compensate for the higher sustained demand and the demonstrated lead-time extension, I am setting L to 3 and mu_hat to an explicit value of 1238.8 (calculated as (1+3) * 309.7) to reflect the new demand level across the observed lead-time duration. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the increased volatility of this new high-demand spike period.

Carry-over insight: Critical lead-time failure: No arrivals documented for 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22) despite a pipeline of 1256 units. Demand spike confirmed sustained for 3 periods at ~310 units/period (Periods 20-22).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The critical lead-time failure and pipeline congestion previously observed have resolved in Period 23, with three consecutive orders (P20, P21, P22) arriving simultaneously. This confirms a volatile lead time (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), though the recent cluster arrival has bolstered the ending inventory to 111. Demand remains in a significant high-growth regime, with the last four periods (P20-P23) averaging 314.5 units per period, a substantial jump from the previous stable average of 189. I am setting L to 3 to account for the frequent observed delays and to ensure sufficient safety-stock coverage for the current demand spike. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new ~315 units/period regime (Total mu_hat = (1+3)*314.5 = 1258). sigma_hat is also calculated based on this recent high-volatility window to protect against potential stockouts during the ongoing demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: avg demand increased from ~189 to ~315 (+66%). Lead-time congestion resolved in P23 with a bulk arrival, confirming lead-times still range from 1 to 3 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 20, moving from an average of ~189 units to ~309 units (average of Periods 20-24: 324, 283, 322, 329, 286). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a large in-transit pipeline of 1217 units, primarily driven by several pending orders and a large order of 342 units placed in Period 24. While the lead-time congestion briefly cleared in Period 23, arrivals remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods with a historical mode of 3. To maintain a sufficient service level for the new demand plateau (average ~310) while accounting for lead-time variability, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of the observed lead-time volatility and ensure the base stock calculation covers the actual replenishment cycle.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 20, moving from an average of ~189 units/period to ~315 units/period. Over the last 6 periods (P20-P25), the average demand is 308.2 units. Despite high demand, the system is currently at zero on-hand inventory due to high volatility and stockouts. Lead times continue to be highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a 3-period lead time occurring frequently. Since we are in a stockout situation with 0 units on hand and 1250 units in transit (which includes orders from P17-P19 that are likely lost or severely delayed, plus recent high-volume orders), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For lead time (L), I will set it to 3 via 'explicit' to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and provide a buffer against the recent history of delays and losses, ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock level sufficient for a 4-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 confirmed: avg demand increased from ~189 to ~308 (+63%). Lead-time median shifted toward 3 periods (observed 8 times).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 20, with an average demand of approximately 312.8 units over the last 7 periods (P20-P26). On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units) due to high demand and persistent lead-time variability. Observed lead times frequently fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode of 3, making the promised lead time of 2 periods an unreliable baseline for service levels. To capture the current high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 (covering Periods 20-26). I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect the recent volatility. For lead time, I am explicitly setting L=3 to account for the frequent delays and the 'pipeline congestion' followed by bulk arrivals seen recently, ensuring the base stock level covers enough demand to prevent stockouts during the actual median/mode delay.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally at Period 20, moving from an average of ~189 units to ~328 units (Periods 20-27). Specifically, the last two periods (26 and 27) show a further spike to 351 and 379 units respectively, suggesting a potential trend or higher volatility in this peak regime. Lead times remain highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode of 3 being the safest planning assumption to avoid stockouts. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have a deep pipeline of 1349 units. Since the OR backend uses L to calculate base stock (base_stock = (1+L)*mean + z*sqrt(1+L)*std), I will set L=3 to ensure the inventory target covers the current lead-time reality. mu_hat will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the demand since Period 20, and sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher volatility within this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 20-27 stabilized at average ~328 units (+73% vs previous regime). Recent demand (P26-P27) suggests a secondary peak or trend above 350 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a secondary growth phase within the high-demand regime that started at Period 20. While the average since Period 20 is ~328 units, the last three periods (P26-P28) have shown demand levels of 351, 379, and 394 respectively, indicating a clear upward trend nearing 400 units/period. The current ending inventory is 0, and despite a large pipeline of 1337 units, recent history shows significant lead-time volatility (1-3 periods) and frequent stockouts. To prevent further lost sales during this peak, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent spike (avg ~375). I will set L to 3 periods explicitly to cushion against the observed frequent maximum lead time and the current stockout state, ensuring the OR backend targets a larger base stock to cover the pipeline delay.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand peak confirmed: Period 26-28 average demand is 374.7 units (+14% vs the Period 20-25 average of 328.8). Lead time remains highly volatile (1-3 periods) with 3 periods being the most frequent realistic constraint.

Daily Reward (R_t): $627.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has entered a second, even higher demand regime. Following the first shift at Period 20 (to ~308 units), a new spike started around Period 26. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P26-P29) is 381.5 units, significantly higher than the P20-P25 average. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) despite a massive pipeline of 1589 units. This suggests the OR backend's default capping or base-stock logic isn't responding fast enough to the recent surge. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this 380+ units/period regime. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods, mode of 3); I will use 'explicit' value 3 for L to ensure the OR logic calculates a sufficiently high base stock to cover the 3-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=4 periods of demand). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to reflect the increased volatility associated with higher demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand peak confirmed: Period 26-29 average demand is 381.5 units (+16% vs the Period 20-25 average of 328.8). Lead time volatility persists with a practical constraint of 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1026.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a second significant growth phase. Starting at Period 20, average demand rose to ~310, and since Period 26, it has escalated further, with the last five periods (P26-P30) averaging 396.6 units, peaking at 457 in Period 30. This represents a sustained upward trend that necessitates a higher mu_hat. Regarding lead time, while the promised lead time is 2 periods, history shows a range of 1 to 3 periods, with 2 periods being the most frequent recent observation (P26, P27, P28 all arrived with L=2). However, given the zero on-hand inventory and the recent demand surge, I will maintain L=3 as the 'practical' lead time for safety stock calculations to prevent stockouts during this volatile high-growth phase. My mu_hat targeting reflects the most recent 5-period regime (~400 units/period) to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to cover the trend.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge (secondary peak) confirmed: Period 26-30 average demand is 396.6 units, a 21% increase over the Period 20-25 average (328.8). Recent demand shows a steep positive gradient (457 in P30).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a sustained high-demand regime that began at Period 20, with a secondary upward surge starting around Period 26. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P27-P31) is approximately 407 units, significant growth compared to the Period 20-25 average of ~312. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and lead times remain volatile between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the safest conservative estimate for 'L' to prevent stockouts during this surge. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed upper bound of lead-time variability. Demand mu_hat will be set using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this secondary peak (Periods 26-31 average ~405), ensuring the base stock level reflects the current steep demand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand surge confirmed: Period 26-31 average demand is 404.2 units (+29% vs the Period 20-25 average of 312.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2014.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a second significant growth phase. Starting from Period 26, demand has accelerated, with the average demand over the last 7 periods (P26-P32) reaching 413 units, and the most recent period hitting a peak of 507. This represents a substantial increase over the already high baseline seen between Periods 20-25 (~310 units). Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the most prudent conservative estimate for the OR engine's 'L' to ensure sufficient safety stock. The on-hand inventory is currently depleted (0 units), and although there is a large in-transit pipeline (1609 units), several orders from Periods 24 (342 units) and earlier (P18, P19, P20 orders) are effectively lost or significantly delayed, necessitating high mu_hat and sigma_hat to trigger replenishment that accounts for these gaps. I am setting mu_hat to cover 4 periods (L=3 + 1) at the most recent demand average level and using sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in this peak growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand peak stabilized: Period 26-32 average demand is 413 units (+33% vs the Period 20-25 average of 310 units). Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods), requiring a conservative 3-period planning horizon.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a steep growth phase, reaching over 500 units in the last two periods (P32: 507, P33: 518). The secondary demand peak identified in Period 26 has not stabilized but transitioned into a continuous upward trend. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is 457.2 units, a significant increase from the Period 26-28 average of 374.7. Lead time remains erratic but shows a strong mode of 3 periods when the system is under pressure. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the rapid demand acceleration, I am setting L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient horizon (L+1 = 4 periods). I will use the recent_N method (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-growth regime while ignoring the lower historical averages.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand escalation confirmed: Demand has crossed the 500-unit threshold (P32-P33), with the P29-P33 average (457.2) being 22% higher than the P26-P28 average (374.7). Lead time planning must assume 3 periods during high-volume surges.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a third high-growth regime. Period 32-34 demand suggests a mean shift toward ~500 units per period (P32-34 average = 505.7). This is a 22% increase over the P26-31 average of 414 units. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 2012 units in-transit. Lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1-3 periods. To prevent stockouts during this surge, I am setting L to 3 (the practical worst-case observed) and mu_hat to a recent_N of 5 to capture the acceleration past 450 units. While 2012 units are in-transit, the OR engine's cap and the high demand forecast will ensure we maintain a buffer against the 3-period lead time risk and consistent 500+ unit demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: Average demand increased to ~506 units (+22% vs Period 26-31 average). Third distinct growth phase confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a third demand growth phase (starting at Period 32), with average demand now approximately 506 units per period. The most recent demand at Period 35 reached 591, indicating that demand continues to escalate. The lead time remains highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods. To avoid stockouts in this high-growth environment, I am setting L to 3 to ensure the OR engine covers a 4-period horizon (L+1). For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=4 (Periods 32-35) to capture the current mean of ~527 units per period, ensuring the base stock level (1+L) * mu_hat reflects this new regime. Sigma_hat is also set using the same N=4 to account for the increased volatility accompanying this demand volume. Although on-hand is zero and in-transit is high (2056 units), the pipeline must be maintained to match the higher period-over-period demand requirements.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: Average demand increased to ~527 units (Periods 32-35), marking a 30% increase over the previous regime. Lead time mode stabilizes at 3 periods during high-volume surges.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a third growth phase starting at Period 32. The average demand from Period 32 to 36 is approximately 531 units (507, 518, 492, 591, 549). This is a significant increase from the previous regime (P26-P31) which averaged ~404 units. Lead time remains volatile between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode of 2-3 periods. To prevent frequent stockouts observed in the history, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the upper end of the observed lead-time range. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~531 per period). sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility in this new regime. On-hand remains 0, and although in-transit is high (2066), the OR backend will compute the necessary order based on the new 4-period horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime since Period 32: Five-period average is 531.4 units (+31% vs. Period 26-31 average of 404).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a third growth phase starting Period 32, with the average demand for the last 6 periods reaching approximately 539 units. The most recent demand (Period 37) was 576. Lead times remain volatile, ranging between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the safest planning horizon during high-volume periods to avoid stockouts. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a massive pipeline of 2015 units. However, recent arrivals have been inconsistent (orders from P34, P35, and P36 arrived, but P33 is noticeably absent or late). To maintain the necessary inventory buffer while accounting for the recent demand surge to >500 units, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 samples (capturing the latest regime) and anchor lead time (L) to 3 to handle the 1-3 period variability. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the higher mean and the delivery uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32 confirmed: Average demand has risen to 538.8 units (Periods 32-37), a 35% increase over the Period 26-31 average. Lead time volatility persists with a required planning horizon of 3 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a clear upward trajectory with multiple regime shifts. A new shift occurred around Period 32, with the average demand for the last seven periods (P32-P38) rising to 552.4 units, and the most recent demand hitting 614 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this latest high-demand phase. Although the promised lead time is 2, historical data shows a mode of 3 periods during high-volume periods, and actual lead times vary between 1 and 3. I will explicitly set L=3 to ensure the inventory policy covers the likely 3-period fulfillment cycle and current high demand, mitigating the risk of stockouts during this growth phase. The 'In-transit' quantity of 2015 units is large, but given the current demand of ~600/period and a 3-period lead time, the pipeline is necessary to support future sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32 confirmed: Average demand has risen to 552.4 units (Periods 32-38), representing a 37% increase over the Period 26-31 average of 404 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered its third growth phase, starting around Period 32. Analyzing the current regime (Periods 32-39), the average demand has risen significantly to approximately 564 units (Sum: 507, 518, 492, 591, 549, 576, 614, 648 = 4515 / 8 periods, including the current period's lag). The most recent three periods (P37-P39) show an even higher average of 612 units, suggesting a potential ongoing upward trend. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a substantial 'in-transit' pipeline of 2350 units. While the promised lead time is 2, historical data confirms volatility between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the safest planning horizon during high-volume periods to avoid stockouts. To align the OR backend with this high-demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the Period 32 shift, and set L to 'explicit' at 3 periods to account for the observed volatility and prevent secondary stockouts while the large pipeline arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32 confirmed: Average demand has risen to ~564 units (Periods 32-39), reflecting a 40% increase over the Period 26-31 average of 404 units. Recent trend (P37-P39) exceeds 600 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6365.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered its fourth distinct growth phase starting at Period 32, with the most recent three periods (P38-P40) averaging 637 units. This represents a significant upward trend from the Period 32-37 average of 539. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and while there is a substantial in-transit pipeline (2094 units), the mismatch between recent demand (>600) and previous order sizes has led to consistent stockouts. Lead time remains erratic but has shown recent 1 and 2-period arrivals (P39 arrived in P40, P36 arrived in P37). I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to allow for the observed volatility and ensure a sufficient base stock buffer. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 (covering the start of the major shift at Period 32) to capture the current high-demand regime (~574 units/period) while acknowledging the very recent surge toward 650. This strategy aims to aggressively rebuild stock levels to meet the 600+ unit demand and minimize lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32 remains in escalation: Average demand for P32-P40 is 573.8 units. However, a sub-regime starting at P38 shows demand consistently above 600 units (P38-P40 average: 637).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a fourth distinct growth phase. While the P32-P40 average was 573.8, the most recent four periods (P38-P41) show demand levels of 614, 648, 649, and 755 respectively, with an average of 666.5. This indicates a steep upward trend that standard averaging will lag. Specifically, the P41 demand of 755 is 31% higher than the P32-P40 average. Lead time remains erratic, but since Period 30, we have observed actual lead times of 1, 2, and 3 periods; using L=2 (promised) with a conservative demand forecast is preferred to avoid over-ordering during transit congestion. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this latest surge while setting L=2 (effectively planning for 3 periods of demand: current + 2 lead periods).

Carry-over insight: New demand sub-regime confirmed starting Period 38: 4-period average is 666.5 units, with P41 reaching a record 755 units (+31% vs. P32-P40 average).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a steep upward demand regime shift. A new sub-regime identified at Period 38 shows demand consistently exceeding 600 units, with the last two periods (P41-P42) averaging 748 units. This is a significant increase from the Period 32-40 average of 574. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this most recent surge while remaining responsive to the current peak. Lead time remains volatile; although the promised lead time is 2, the 'mode' of successful arrivals often hits 3, and the system is currently experiencing a stockout due to arrival gaps (no arrivals in P41-P42). To protect against lost sales in this high-growth phase, I will explicitly set L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient pipeline, as the default OR logic (L=2) would underestimate the required inventory to bridge the 3rd period of delivery risk.

Carry-over insight: New demand sub-regime confirmed starting Period 38: 5-period average (P38-P42) is 681.4 units, with the most recent two periods exceeding 740 units. Lead-time planning horizon must be maintained at 3 periods to mitigate stockouts during volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1501.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-growth demand phase. The sub-regime starting at Period 38 has shown average demand of 706.8 units (P38: 614, P39: 648, P40: 649, P41: 755, P42: 741, P43: 774). The most recent three periods (P41-P43) have all exceeded 740 units, averaging 756 units. Lead time remains volatile, with the most recent arrival (P40 order arriving in P43) confirming a 3-period lead time. Given the high stockout risk (on-hand is 0) and the upward demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 6 periods (P38-P43) to capture this latest sub-regime's mean. I will set L to 3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the frequent 3-period lead time observed during high-volume periods, providing a safer buffer against pipeline delays.

Carry-over insight: New demand sub-regime confirmed starting Period 38: 6-period average is 706.8 units. The last three periods (P41-P43) average 756 units (+7% vs the P38-P43 average). High-volume lead times continue to hit the 3-period ceiling.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7353.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand escalation phase. Demand has shifted from a stabilized ~570 (P32-P40) to a new sub-regime starting at Period 38, with Period 44 reaching a record 845 units. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P38-P44) is 726 units, but the most recent 4-period average is 778.75 units. This indicates a consistent upward trend. Lead times remain highly volatile, with the last two arrivals (orders from P40 and P41) taking 3 periods. To prevent stockouts in this high-growth environment, I am setting L to 3 (the observed operational ceiling) and using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (P38-P44) while remaining responsive to the most recent spikes. This balance aims to satisfy the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: New demand sub-regime confirmed starting Period 38: 7-period average (P38-P44) is 726.5 units. The last four periods (P41-P44) average 778.8 units, showing continued escalation toward 850 units. Lead times for high-volume orders have consistently hit 3 periods recently (P40 and P41 orders).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 50. The demand for chips(Regular) is in a significant, ongoing escalation. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P41-P45) is 806.8 units, while the last three periods (P43-P45) average 846 units. Period 45 hit a high of 919 units. Lead times have mostly settled between 2 and 3 periods during this high-volume stage (P40 and P41 were 3 periods, P43 was 2 periods). To prevent stockouts, I am setting L to 3 periods to ensure the pipeline covers a wider window. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (P41-P45) to capture the 800+ units/period reality, as the older high-demand regime of ~560 units is no longer relevant. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility (standard deviation ~70 units) during this surge. Our pipeline is currently 2696 units, and on-hand is 0. Using these parameters will signal the OR backend to maintain a base stock that covers the next (L+1=4) periods of 800+ demand.

Carry-over insight: New demand super-regime confirmed starting Period 43: 3-period average is 846 units (+16% vs P38-P42 avg). Absolute peak of 919 reached in P45. Lead times for large orders have stabilized at a 2-3 period range.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a 'super-regime' of escalating demand that began around Period 43, with the last two periods (P45-P46) exceeding 900 units. The 3-period average (P44-P46) is approximately 898 units. Lead times for high-volume orders continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with recent arrivals from P40, P41, and P43 confirming a practical planning horizon of 3 periods (L=2 promised + 1 extra for safety) is necessary to avoid stockouts. The inventory position is currently zero with large orders in the pipeline. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P43-P46) to capture the 850-950 unit demand level, and L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the operational lead-time reality during this surge. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility in this high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand super-regime confirmed starting Period 43: Mean demand has shifted to ~898 units (P44-P46), with peak demand at 930. Lead-time requirements for replenishment during this phase remain at a 3-period horizon despite a 2-period promise.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb rapidly, reaching 986 units in Period 47. We are currently in a 'super-regime' that began around Period 43, with the last four periods (P44-P47) averaging 920 units. This is a significant increase from the previous sub-regime (P38-P42) which averaged ~680 units. Lead times for these high-volume orders are consistently hitting the 3-period horizon (observed in P43 and P44 conclusions), although the promised lead time is 2. My target for mu_hat must reflect this latest surge to prevent stockouts, especially as we have 0 on-hand inventory. I will use a restricted window (recent_N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific peak regime. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the consistent congestion observed during high-demand surges, ensuring the base-stock calculation covers enough periods to bridge the arrival gap. The pipeline is currently 3707 units, which is quite high, but given the 3-period lead time and demand approaching 1000/period, this inventory is necessary to cover forthcoming customer needs.

Carry-over insight: Demand super-regime starting P44: Average demand shifted to ~920 units (+35% vs. P38-P43 average). Peak demand reached 986 in P47. Lead times for large volumes are stable at 3 periods despite a 2-period promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a state of hyper-growth (super-regime). The most recent demand (Period 48) reached 1036 units, continuing an upward trend where the 3-period average (P46-P48) is 984 units and the 5-period average (P44-P48) is 943.2 units. Given this explosive growth, I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most current volume while acknowledging the rapid period-over-period increase. The lead time L is set to 'explicit' value 3, as historical data and recent 'Carry-Over Insights' confirm that while the promise is 2 periods, high-volume orders often take 3 periods to conclude (e.g., P40 and P41 orders). sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased volatility associated with these higher demand levels. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers (3+1)=4 periods of demand, aimed at mitigating the current frequent stockouts caused by demand exceeding previous forecasts and pipeline delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand super-regime continues to escalate: Period 48 demand reached 1036 (+12% vs P44-P46 average), bringing the 5-period average (P44-P48) to 943.2 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a phase of aggressive escalation. Period 49 demand reached 1104 units, marking the highest recorded value and confirming that the super-regime starting around Period 44 (mean ~943) is still trending upward. The last three periods (P47-P49) average 1042 units, a 43% increase over the previous sub-regime (P38-P42 avg ~681). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a massive pipeline of 4011 units. Despite a promised lead time of 2, actual lead times for high volumes typically hit 3 periods. However, no units have arrived for 4 consecutive periods (P46-P49), leading to a critical stockout. To recover and cover the next 3 periods (L+1), mu_hat must be set explicitly to reflect the recent peak and positive trend. I will set mu_hat based on an expected demand of 1100 per period over a 3-period horizon (L=2 + 1), totaling 3300. Sigma_hat is increased to 180 to account for high volatility during this surge and mitigate the effects of erratic lead times.

Carry-over insight: Super-regime escalation confirmed: Demand averaged 1042 units over P47-P49 (+43% vs P38-P42). Lead time congestion: No arrivals for 4 consecutive periods (P46-P49), confirming L=3 planning horizon is mandatory.
