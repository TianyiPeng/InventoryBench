The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first five periods (provided in the context) shows 103, 81, 107, 127, and 160 units respectively. This averages approximately 115 units per period with an upward trend. To ensure availability, I need to cover demand for the current period plus the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). Given the average of 115 and the recent peak of 160, I will forecast a requirements window of approximately 380 units (115 * 3 plus safety stock for the trend).

Historical demand for the first 5 samples averaged ~115, but actual Period 1 demand was 123. Given the Lead Time (L=2), my Period 2 decision needs to cover demand for Period 3 (when the first order arrives) and Period 4 (to bridge the gap for the next order). Total pipeline requirement = Expected Demand * (L + 1) + Safety Stock. Averaging the historical samples (115) and Period 1 (123), I'll estimate demand at ~120 units. Required coverage (L+1 = 3 periods) is ~360 units. I already have 380 units in-transit. However, because I have 0 on-hand in Period 2, I will definitely lose sales in Period 2.
