Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 115.6 units (103, 81, 107, 127, 160), with a clear upward trend in the last few periods. Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, I am already behind. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover demand for the lead time duration (L+1 = 3 periods) plus a safety buffer for the increasing trend, I need enough stock to satisfy demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. Average demand is ~116; assuming the trend continues, Periods 1-3 could average 140-150. Target pipeline = 150 * 3 = 450 units.

To manage inventory over the next 3 periods (L+1 = 3), I estimate total demand to be roughly 360-400 units. Currently, there are 450 units in transit, which should cover the next few periods once they arrive. However, since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the first arrival won't happen until Period 3, I am already facing stockouts.

P4 order (150 units) is expected to arrive during P7 (based on 3-period lead time).
