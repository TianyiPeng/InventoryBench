The current 'In-transit' of 364 includes these lost units. Functional Pipeline = 364 - 161 - 73 = 130 units (representing orders from P9 and P10). 2. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand over the last 5 periods is ~138 units (80, 143, 122, 97, 149, 182), which is higher than the initial history (~115). Current on-hand is 0, so we have immediate stockout risk. 3. **OR Recommendation Adjustment**: The OR recommends 84 units based on a mathematical model that doesn't account for lost shipments. It believes pipeline is 364, but actual functional pipeline is only 130. To reach the OR's target inventory level (base stock), we must compensate for the 234 lost units. However, we must balance this against the supply cap to avoid over-ordering if the supplier is struggling.

Recent demand (P9-P11) has averaged ~158 units, showing a slight upward trend. \n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically derived from the total in-transit (514) being much higher than the base stock level.

The OR recommendation of 0 is likely driven by the calculation including the lost 234 units in the pipeline and not adapting to the recent demand regime shift.\n4. **Order Calculation**: Expected demand for (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods) is 163 * 3 = 489.

The functional pipeline of 450 units is insufficient to cover this demand shift and the 'lost' inventory gap. 5.

There is also inherent volatility, as seen in the Period 16 order arriving in just 1 period. \n2. **Inventory Position**: On-hand inventory is 102. In-transit inventory is 534 units. However, we must reconcile the pipeline: 161 (P2 - lost), 73 (P6 - lost), 150 (P15), 150 (P17). The confirmed lost shipments (234 units) must be subtracted. Adjusted In-transit = 534 - 161 - 73 = 300 units (representing orders from P15 and P17). Total functional inventory = 102 (on-hand) + 300 (reliable pipeline) = 402 units.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: A regime shift is confirmed. Demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) averaged ~199 units per period. Using a 3-period lead time (L=3), we need to cover demand for Period 18, 19, 20, and 21 (L+1 periods). Total coverage needed = 199 * 4 = 796 units.\n4. **OR Baseline Adjustment**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it doesn't account for the lost shipments (it thinks internal pipeline is 534) and uses an outdated mean demand. \n5. **Action**: Coverage Gap = 796 (Needed) - 402 (Functional) = 394 units.

This means 384 units of the 954 'In-transit' are non-existent, leaving active pipeline at 570 units (Orders from P17, P18, P19).\n2. **Demand Analysis**: A significant demand regime shift is occurring. Recent demand (P18: 245, P19: 301) shows a sharp upward trend compared to the P14-P17 average of ~200. I estimate the current demand at 250-300 units per period.\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0. With a 3-period lead time, I must cover 4 periods of demand (current + L). At ~275 units/period, target inventory is 1100. Effective pipeline is 570 units (P17: 150, P18: 210, P19: 210). \n4. **Order Justification**: The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the unadjusted pipeline of 954 and historical demand averages (which are lagging). By discounting lost orders, the adjusted pipeline (570) is insufficient. To reach a target of 1100, a gap of ~530 units exists.

The OR recommendation is 0 because it assumes a 2-period lead time and views the gross in-transit (1734) as sufficient to cover any demand.

Lead Time & Pipeline: While the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time is highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods or resulting in lost shipments. 3. Pipeline Audit: The 'In-transit' figure of 1644 units is misleading due to substantial losses. Specifically, orders from P2 (161), P6 (73), P15 (150), P18 (210), and P19 (210) are long overdue and effectively lost, totaling 804 units. Subtracting these from the 1644 in-transit units, and excluding the pending P27 order, the functional pipeline is 1644 - 804 = 840 units (comprising P24, P25, P26 orders). 4. Inventory Balancing: Our target inventory to cover L+1 (3 periods) at a demand rate of ~350 units is 1050 units. The functional pipeline (840 units) is insufficient.

Accounting for confirmed losses (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19), the functional pipeline is 2044 - 150 - 210 - 210 = 1474 units. The OR recommending 0 is due to the uncapped pipeline calculation (2044 units) appearing to cover all future base stock needs. However, with functional inventory at 1474 and demand at ~380/period, the coverage is roughly 3.8 periods.

Functional pipeline is actually around 1180 units (P29, P30, P33, and some earlier residuals). The OR recommendation is 0 because its 'uncapped' pipeline logic assumes all 2354 units are coming, which is false due to the supplier's ~20-25% loss rate and volatility. To maintain a service level consistent with a 500-unit demand regime and a 2-3 period lead time, the target inventory (Base Stock) should be ~1500-1800 units. Adding 400 units helps offset the massive stockouts and accounts for the high probability of further shipment losses.",
