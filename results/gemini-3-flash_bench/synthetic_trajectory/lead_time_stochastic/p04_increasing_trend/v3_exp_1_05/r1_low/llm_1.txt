The demand appears to be trending upward in the sample data (from 81 to 160). The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 1+2=3 and be available for demand in Period 4. To cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods: P1, P2, P3), and accounting for the 0 on-hand inventory, I need to place an order immediately. Given the increasing trend and the variability, I will forecast a demand of ~130 units per period. Target pipeline (L+1) = 130 * 3 = 390 units. Total inventory needed = 390. Current On-hand + In-transit = 0. Therefore, I will order 390 units to establish the pipeline and meet upcoming demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3.",

However, I must be cautious of holding costs ($1/unit). Given the large in-transit arrivals expected soon (P11 and P12 orders), a more moderate order of 190 units will reinforce the pipeline without risking excessive overstocking if multiple orders arrive simultaneously.",

Orders from P46 (950 units), P47 (1000 units), and P48 (1000 units) are all candidates for arrival in Period 50. Even with the ~50% shipment loss rate, the high volume in-transit (roughly 3000 units from the last three periods) makes it highly probable that at least 1000 units will arrive to cover the final period's demand.
