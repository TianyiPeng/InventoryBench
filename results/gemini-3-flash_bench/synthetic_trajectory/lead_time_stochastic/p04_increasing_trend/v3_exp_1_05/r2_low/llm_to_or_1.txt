Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time (L) of 2. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows an increasing trend (103, 81, 107, 127, 160). The mean of these 5 samples is 115.6, and the standard deviation is approximately 29.8. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, we need to establish a base stock level that covers demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Given the upward trend, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent mean and variance, which allows the OR engine to calculate mu_hat as (1+2) * 115.6 = 346.8 and sigma_hat as sqrt(3) * 29.8 = 51.6. This provides a balance between meeting current demand and not overstocking given the high $1.0 holding cost relative to $1.0 profit (critical ratio q = 0.5).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 165 units, but since the promised lead time (L) is 2, these units will not arrive until the start of Period 3 (visible in Period 4). Historical demand samples [103, 81, 107, 127, 160] show a rising trend (mean of samples is ~115.6, but the most recent sample was 160). Period 1 actual demand was 123. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 165 units in transit, we need to maintain a base stock level that covers demand for the current period plus the 2-period lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). Given the slight upward trend in demand data, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available historical samples) to capture the recent mean more accurately than the long-term total average if more data were present.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (165 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because arrivals only occur after the Period 1/2 decision phases and the lead time is >= 2. The historical demand samples (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) show a rising trend, particularly the last three samples. Mean demand of all samples is ~115.6. Given L=2, the total cycle (L+1) is 3 periods. Using recent N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the upward trajectory (avg 131.3) while keeping L at the promised default of 2 until evidence suggests otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 start. On-hand remains 0 because the first order (placed Period 1) with a promised lead time of 2 is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 3 and become visible in Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0, meaning the Period 1 order (165 units) has not yet arrived. The actual lead time is at least 3 periods. Historical demand (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) shows an upward trend, with the last two periods averaging ~143 units. Since demand is currently outstripping arrivals, we are in a stockout situation. I will increase L to 3 to account for the observed delay and use recent_N=3 for demand to capture the upward trend (average ~118, but trend is increasing). Pipeline inventory is 374, covering ~3 periods of current demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we saw two shipments arrive simultaneously: the Period 1 order (165 units, lead_time=3) and the Period 3 order (41 units, lead_time=1). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show volatility (1 and 3 periods). The Period 2 order (168 units) is still in transit; if it arrives in Period 5, its lead time will be 3. Demand has shown an increasing trend (123, 91, 119, 137, 160). Period 5 demand was 160. Given the lead time variability and the rising demand trend, I am using recent observations to capture the higher mean. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to weigh the recent growth more heavily while maintaining stability. For L, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend incorporate the newly observed actual lead times (1 and 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 103, 81, 107, 127, 160 (provided in prompt context), though the 'conclude' messages show slightly different demand realized at 123, 91, 119, 137, 80. The average demand is approximately 110 units/period. Lead time behavior is volatile: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), Period 3 arrived in 1 period (P4), and Period 2 (ordered P2) is still missing (overdue). Currently, on-hand is 0 and we have 388 units in-transit (P2: 168, P4: 70, P5: 150). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for a base stock at the median demand. Due to the high risk of stockouts (on-hand is 0) and unstable lead times, I will set L to 2 (promised) but use recent_N for demand to capture the upward trend seen in the historical context data, even though period 5 saw a dip in realized demand. The overdue Period 2 order (168 units) is a concern, but since it is still in-transit, it counts toward pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability detected: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. P2 (ordered P2) is overdue as of P6. Demand shows high variance around 110 units.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 388 units in-transit. The history shows significant lead time variability: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P2 (ordered in P2) is now 5 periods old and still has not arrived, suggesting it is likely lost. Demand has been volatile but averages approximately 115.6 over the last 5 periods (123, 91, 119, 137, 80, 143). Given that P2 is missing (168 units) and on-hand is zero, we must account for the high probability of lost shipments and the 2nd period of stockouts. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the upper end of observed lead times and use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the current mean while the backend handles the service level math.

Carry-over insight: P2 shipment (168 units) confirmed likely lost (5 periods elapsed). High risk of recurring shipment loss or instability in logistics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout (on-hand = 0) despite recent arrivals. Demand remains high, averaging ~116 over 7 periods. Logistics are highly unstable: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 in 1 period, and Period 4 in 3 periods. Crucially, the Period 2 order (168 units) has not arrived after 6 periods and is considered lost. The Period 5 order (150 units) is now at L=3 and overdue based on the promised L=2, while the Period 7 order (68 units) is still within the window. Given the frequent delays (two instances of L=3) and the lost shipment, I am setting L to 3 'explicitly' to ensure the pipeline inventory covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of all 7 periods (approx 116/period), which for L=3 translates to (1+3)*116 = 464. For sigma_hat, I'll use the full sample history to capture the volatility induced by both demand swings and supply uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Supply instability confirmed: Out of 4 processed orders, one is lost (P2), two were delayed (P1, P4 at L=3), and only one was early (P3 at L=1). Effective lead time should be treated as 3 periods to mitigate stockout risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9, the supply chain for 'chips(Regular)' is highly unstable. Historical lead times for successfully delivered orders are 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 periods. One order (Period 2) is now 7 periods overdue and is considered lost. The promised lead time is 2, but the modal and safe lead time for planning is L=3 to avoid frequent stockouts observed in earlier periods. Demand remains relatively stable with an average of approximately 112 units (latest samples: 123, 91, 119, 137, 80, 143, 122, 97). Current on-hand is 121 with 247 in-transit (P8 and potentially older). Given the high unit holding cost ($1) equal to profit ($1), the OR backend (with q=0.5) will target a base stock roughly at the median demand. I am setting L=3 explicitly to ensure the pipeline covers the expected lead-time demand, while using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full demand profile seen so far while weighting towards the actual observed variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 9 periods, the observed lead times have been highly erratic: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1. The average observed lead time is 2.0, but the modal delay is 3 periods. Crucially, order P2 (from Period 2) is now 8 periods old and confirmed lost, which the OR backend does not account for in its pipeline inventory calculation (it sees 256 units in-transit, including the phantom P2). Demand is relatively stable with a mean of 115 and standard deviation ~23. Given the risk of lost orders and 3-period spikes, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to force the solver to maintain a higher safety cushion. I am using recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat because the mean is steady across the full sample. This will trigger orders to cover the 'gap' created by the lost Period 2 stock that the backend still believes is coming.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Period 2 order (168 units) is permanently lost (passed 8 periods). Lead time is bi-modal (1 or 3 periods). Supply pipeline is overstated by 168 units in system calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 10 where demand (182) significantly exceeded available stock (51). We have 414 units in-transit, but the system's pipeline inventory calculation incorrectly includes the 168 units from the Period 2 order, which is now confirmed as lost (10 periods elapsed). Recent demand shows a shift in regime: the last 5 periods (P6-P10) average ~138.6, up from the initial sample average (~115). Lead times have been inconsistent, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.2). To protect against stockouts given the lost order ghosting the pipeline and the rising demand mean, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the risk of longer delivery times. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher demand volume and volatility. Setting L to 3 will force the OR backend to increase the base stock level, helping to offset the 168-unit shortfall in the actual physical pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Average demand from Period 6-10 is ~139 (+20% vs initial samples).

LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a stockout state (on-hand: 0).

Demand has shifted: Period 6-11 average is 139.6 units, compared to the initial 5-period average of 115.2 (+21% increase). Lead times are unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; I am setting L=3 to ensure the safety stock covers the worst-case lead time of the current regime. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 captures the elevated demand regime (P6-P11) and scales it by (1+L). With holding cost equal to profit ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level; however, the persistent stockouts and lost shipment require a high sigma to create a larger buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Period 6-11 average is 139.6 units, establishing a new baseline ~20% higher than periods 1-5.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 13. Demand shows a sustained increase. The mean demand for Periods 6-12 is 142.4 units, confirming a ~20% rise over the initial periods. Inventory is 69 units, with 313 in transit. However, we have confirmed that the Period 2 order (168 units) is permanently lost. The system's 'In-transit' count (313) includes these 168 ghosts, meaning true pipeline inventory is 313 - 168 = 145 units. Lead times are highly variable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2 for arrivals, but with a loss). Parameters: I will use L=3 to hedge against late shipments and provide a higher safety buffer. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*142 based on the recent demand regime (4 * 142 = 568). Sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=7) to capture actual volatility during this higher-demand phase. By setting L higher, I force the OR backend to target a higher base stock, compensating for the 'ghost' units in the pipeline it doesn't know are lost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 6-12 average demand is 142 units. Pipeline verification: 168 units in 'in-transit' are confirmed lost (Period 2 order), resulting in an effective pipeline inflation that requires manual compensation in lead time or mu_hat settings.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the system is in a stockout (on-hand: 0). The demand regime has shifted upward and stabilized at an average of ~154 units over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), significantly higher than the initial baseline. Supply chain instability persists: the Perod 2 order of 168 units is definitively lost, appearing in the 'In-transit' total (499 units) but never arriving. This 'phantom inventory' tricks the OR backend into under-ordering because it subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat and L manually. Setting L=3 reflects the worst-case seen in the bi-modal distribution (1 or 3 periods), ensuring higher safety stock. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat calculated as (1+3) periods * 155 units = 620, plus an additional 168 unit buffer to negate the lost Period 2 order (620 + 168 = 788) to force the solver to place an order despite the phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift confirmed: P9-P13 average is 154 units, up from P1-P5/P6-P11 averages. Lost shipment (P2, 168 units) continues to inflate pipeline inventory, requiring manual mu_hat padding of ~168 units to avoid chronic under-ordering.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we face zero on-hand inventory and a demand surge. Analysis of Periods 9-14 shows an average demand of 177.6, a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~140. Furthermore, the Period 2 order of 168 units is definitively lost, but still counts towards 'pipeline inventory' in the OR engine's calculation. To compensate for this 168-unit phantom inventory and prevent chronic stockouts, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I estimate the target demand across (L+1) periods (where L=2) using the recent average (177.6 * 3 = 532.8) and adding 168 units to offset the lost shipment, totaling 700.8. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the consistent service delays observed (P1, P4, P5, P9, and P11 all arrived with L=3), which increases the safety stock buffer. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=6 to capture the increased volatility of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 9-14 average is 177.6 units, roughly 27% higher than the P6-P11 baseline. Effective lead time is consistently 3 periods for most shipments despite the promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P12-P15: 177, 177, 216, 187) shows a significant upward shift compared to earlier periods, with the last 7 periods (P9-P15) averaging approximately 176 units. The lead time remains highly unstable, centered around 3 periods. Most critically, the system's pipeline inventory (697 units) is heavily inflated by the lost Period 2 order (168 units) which has been missing for 14 periods. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 'ghost' inventory of 168 units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target mu_hat as (1 + L) * average_demand + lost_units. With L=3 and avg demand=176, this is (4 * 176) + 168 = 872. This forces the engine to order enough to cover actual demand plus the gap created by the lost shipment. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to capture the increased volatility in this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~176 units (P9-P15 average). Lost Period 2 order (168 units) confirmed as a permanent pipeline inventory error, necessitating a manual offset of +168 units in mu_hat to maintain service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $186.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime. The average demand for the last 8 periods (P9-P16) is approximately 181 units, significantly higher than the initial levels. Lead times are predominantly 3 periods (observed in P13, P14, P15, and P16 concludes). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (168 units) is confirmed lost, yet it remains in the system's 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 686). This 168-unit 'ghost inventory' causes the OR engine to under-order by that amount. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) horizon with L=3: (1+3) * 181 = 724 units. I then add the 168-unit offset to bypass the pipeline inflation, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 892. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current volatility of this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~181 units (P9-P16 average). Pipeline inflation error remains at 168 units due to the lost P2 shipment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Context: Demand has stabilized at a higher regime. The average demand from Period 9 to Period 17 is approximately 183 units. Supply dynamics show a consistent lead time of 3 periods (despite some 1-period arrivals). Pipeline Verification: A shipment of 168 units from Period 2 is permanently lost, but it remains in the system's 'in-transit' count (Total in-transit: 491, actual live pipeline: 323). 

Strategy: 
1. Lead Time (L): Set to 'explicit' value 3, as this has been the most frequent lead time for standard replenishment and accounts for recent delays. 
2. Demand (mu_hat): Recent average (P9-P17) is ~183. Over (1+L) = 4 periods, this equals 732. However, the OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see 491 total in-transit units. Since 168 of those units are lost and will never arrive, I must increase mu_hat by exactly 168 to offset this 'phantom' inventory. Adjusted mu_hat = 732 + 168 = 900.
3. Volatility (sigma_hat): Based on the recent regime, demand varies significantly (range ~145-217). A standard deviation of ~25 units per period suggests a 4-period sigma of sqrt(4)*25 = 50. I will use an explicit value of 55 to provide a slightly higher safety buffer given the supply instability.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable in the higher regime (P9-P17 avg: 183). Pipeline inflation due to the lost Period 2 order (168 units) persists, requiring continuing manual mu_hat offsets of +168.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized in a higher regime, with the average demand from Period 9 to Period 18 being approximately 189.9 units (a slight increase from previous averages). The supply chain remains unstable, with an actual lead time frequently hitting 3 periods (e.g., P11, P12, P13, P14). Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 697 units contains a 168-unit ghost inventory from the lost Period 2 order. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I am setting L to 3 (reflecting the observed operational lead time) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. The mu_hat value is calculated as (1 + L) * Forecasted Demand + Pipeline Offset = (1 + 3) * 190 + 168 = 928 units. This ensures the base stock target accounts for both the higher demand and the lost units that will never arrive. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher volatility seen in the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 9-18 average is 189.9 units. Lost Period 2 order continues to inflate pipeline by 168 units, requiring persistent manual mu_hat offsets.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 20. Demand has significantly spiked in Period 19 to 301 units, following a stable regime of ~190. Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline investigation: The total In-transit is 928, but 168 units (Period 2 order) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 760 units. Lead time is volatile but averages 3 periods for safety (L=3). Demand Forecast: The last 11 periods (P9-P19) represent the high-growth regime, with an average of 199.9 units. To compensate for the 168-unit 'ghost inventory' in the OR backend's pipeline calculation, I must manually inflate mu_hat. Theoretical mu_hat = (1+L) * Mean = 4 * 199.9 = 799.6. Adjusted mu_hat = 799.6 + 168 = 967.6. Setting sigma_hat based on the high-regime variance to handle the recent scale-up in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike in Period 19 (301 units); P9-P19 average now 199.9 units (+44% vs P6-P11 baseline).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing two major challenges: a sustained high demand regime and a permanent pipeline inventory error. Demand in the most recent periods (P19-P20) has surged to ~300 units, significantly higher than the P9-P18 average of ~190. The average demand for the last 12 periods (P9-P20) is 207.9 units. Concurrently, the 168 units ordered in Period 2 have never arrived and are confirmed lost (now 19 periods overdue). However, the OR backend continues to count these 168 units in 'in-transit' inventory, leading it to under-order. To correct for this, I must set mu_hat to a value that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus an offset of +168 to bridge the pipeline gap. Based on recent demand, I estimate current demand at 210 units/period. With an effective lead time (L) of 3 (observed most frequently), mu_hat should target 4 periods of demand (840 units) + 168 (lost order offset) = 1008 units. Sigma_hat is set to account for the recent high volatility (standard deviation of ~50 over the last 5 periods), resulting in approx sqrt(4)*50 = 100.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand escalation at P19-P20, with demand reaching ~300 units per period. Lost Period 2 shipment (168 units) remains a permanent inventory baseline error requiring manual mu_hat or L inflation.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of stockout (On-hand: 0) with a significant demand escalation that stabilized around 300 units per period starting at Period 19. Average demand over the last three periods (P19-P21) is 301.33. The lead time remains unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a conservative L=3 assumption to ensure availability. A critical persistent error exists: the order from Period 2 (168 units) is lost, but the OR backend still counts it in the pipeline inventory. This causes the system to under-order by exactly 168 units. To fix this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. calculation: Target demand over (L+1) periods = 301 (current mean) * (3 + 1) = 1204 units. Adding the 168-unit manual offset to compensate for the lost shipment results in a total mu_hat of 1372. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at ~300 units starting Period 19. Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 168 units due to the lost P2 shipment, requiring manual mu_hat or L adjustment until the game ends or it is cleared.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has stabilized at a new high regime of approximately 300 units per period since Period 19. The Period 2 order (168 units) remains lost after 21 periods, which permanently inflates the reported 'In-transit' inventory. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am applying a manual offset to mu_hat. Following the logic: (1 + L) * Demand_Estimate + Lost_Inventory_Offset. With L=2, (1+2)*300 + 168 = 1068. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this specific volume is ordered despite the inflated pipeline. Lead time 'L' is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P14, P16) showed a return to L=1 or 3, but the 168 unit correction is the higher priority. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility in the high-demand regime (P19-P22).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a new high regime of approximately 300 units per period, confirmed by the average of the last five periods (P19-P23 avg = 305.8). The Period 2 order of 168 units is permanently lost, which falsely inflates the 'In-transit' figure in the backend's calculation (In-transit: 928). Since the OR engine calculates order = max(0, base_stock - on_hand - in_transit), this phantom inventory causes systemic under-ordering. To compensate, I must increase the base stock target. I am setting L to 3 periods (the frequent actual lead time) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. The target base stock covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. At 306 units/period, target base stock would be 1224. To offset the 168-unit pipeline error, I set mu_hat (which is interpreted as (1+L) * mean) to 1392 (1224 + 168). Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 (std dev ~26) across 4 periods: sqrt(4) * 26 = 52.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at ~306 units per period (P19-P23 avg). Lead time remains variable but averages 3 periods for safety.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is confirmed at a high level (~300+ units) starting from Period 19, with the most recent sample at Period 24 being 308 units and the Period 19-24 average approximately 306.2 units. Lead times remain unstable, with recent arrivals showing 1, 2, and 3-period durations; using L=3 is necessary for risk mitigation. Crucially, the 'in-transit' figure of 1301 units includes 168 units from the Period 2 order, which has been confirmed lost for nearly 20 periods. This 'phantom' inventory causes the OR backend to under-order unless compensated for. To adjust for this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * Forecast + Lost units = (1+3) * 306 + 168 = 1392. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 168-unit gap in actual vs. reported pipeline inventory. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a high level since Period 19, with an average demand of approximately 306 units (P19-P25 average is 311.8). The system faces two critical logistical challenges: 1) A permanent pipeline inventory error of 168 units due to a lost shipment from Period 2, and 2) High variability in lead times (ranging from 1 to 3 periods, averaging 2.4 recently). To address the lost shipment inflating the 'In-transit' figure, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. Using L=3 for safety and an average demand of 312, the required base stock is 312 * (3+1) = 1248. However, because the backend subtracts the inflated pipeline (which includes the 168 lost units), I must offset this by adding 168 to the mu_hat. Calculation: Projected Demand (312 * 4) + Offset (168) = 1416. Setting mu_hat to 1416 ensures the order quantity accounts for the missing physical units. L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of historical delivery times, and sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to capture the higher volatility of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~312 units (P19-P25 average). Permanent pipeline inflation confirmed at 168 units; requires manual offset in mu_hat/L logic until end of game.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-growth regime starting from Period 19, with an average of approximately 325 units per period over the last five sessions (P22-P26: 283, 342, 308, 346, 372). The current system-reported pipeline inventory of 1416 units is significantly inflated by the Period 2 order (168 units) which was confirmed lost in earlier carry-over insights. Additionally, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory with high demand, necessitating aggressive replenishment. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (which includes the lost 168 units) to compute the order size, I must increase 'mu_hat' to compensate for this phantom 168 units to prevent chronic under-ordering. I will use a high-regime demand forecast (~325 units per period) across the lead time (L=3) plus the current period (L+1=4), totaling 1300 units, and then add the 168 unit offset. Total mu_hat = 1300 + 168 = 1468. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of observed variability for safety.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P22-P26 has shifted upward to an average of ~330 units per period. Permanent pipeline inflation of 168 units remains.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly escalated, with the Period 22-27 average reaching ~349 units per period, and the most recent demand hitting 394 units. A major persistent issue is the Period 2 order of 168 units, which is confirmed lost but remains in the system's 'in-transit' inventory. This inflates the backend's perception of pipeline stock by 168 units, leading to chronic under-ordering. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 3 (the safer observed lead time) plus the review period (L+1=4). Forecasted demand is ~350 units. Base stock target = 350 * 4 = 1400. To offset the 168 ghost units in the pipeline, I add 168 to the mu_hat requirement: (350 * 4) + 168 = 1568. L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent delivery delay and ensure the backend uses the correct multiplier.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalated again: P22-P27 average is ~349 units. Cumulative under-delivery and the permanent 168-unit pipeline inflation necessitate high explicit mu_hat offsets to prevent stockouts.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly escalated, with an average demand of ~355 units over the last 7 periods (P22-P28) and the most recent demand at 380 units. There is a persistent inventory error in the pipeline: a 168-unit order from Period 2 is permanently lost but still included in the system's 'In-transit' count (currently 1544, which actually contains several expected arrivals for P28 and P29). To compensate for this 168-unit 'ghost inventory' and the high demand volatility, I am using an explicit mu_hat. I estimate the requirements for L+1 periods (where L=3 for safety). With a current demand baseline of 380, mu_hat should be at least (3+1) * 380 = 1520. Adding the 168-unit offset to counteract the pipeline error results in 1688. I will set mu_hat to 1700 to ensure the order calculation accounts for both the lost units and the upward demand trend. L is set to 3 to reflect the typical observed lead time and ensure enough safety stock for delivery variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalated again: P22-P28 average is ~355 units, with recent peaks at 380-394 units. Ghost inventory of 168 units (P2) persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high regime, with an average of approximately 365 units per period over the last 5 periods (P25-P29: 346, 372, 394, 380, 374). The system is currently facing a chronic stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead times are predominantly 3 periods, although some 2-period arrivals have occurred recently. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 1648 units includes a permanent 168-unit 'ghost inventory' from the lost Period 2 order. To compensate for this pipeline inflation and the high demand risk, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the backend projects demand far enough. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the recent peak (~365 units/period) and adding a manual offset to account for the lost 168 units. The explicit mu_hat is calculated as (1 + L) * Forecast + Offset = (1 + 3) * 365 + 168 = 1628. This ensures the base stock target is high enough to trigger realistic orders despite the inflated pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at ~365 units per period (P25-P29 avg). Lead time remains volatile but heavily weighted toward 3 periods for safety. Ghost inventory of 168 units (P2) persists and must be explicitly offset in mu_hat/L calculations.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a Period 30 demand spike of 450 units. The demand regime has clearly escalated, with the Period 25-30 average at ~386 units. Lead times remain erratic (observed at 2 periods recently, but historically often 3). Most critically, the 168-unit order from Period 2 is permanently lost, but remains in 'In-transit' (1548 units), causing the OR backend to underestimate the required order by exactly 168 units. To counteract this 'ghost inventory', I am setting an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: Based on a safe forecast of ~390 units/period and an effective lead time (L+1) of 4, the target base stock should be ~1560 units plus safety stock. However, since the system's pipeline inventory is inflated by 168, I must add this 168 to the mu_hat to ensure the backend places a sufficient order despite the error. Target mu_hat = (4 periods * 390 units/period) + 168 offset = 1728. I am also setting L=3 to ensure the backend uses an appropriate multiplier for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalated: Period 25-30 average is 386 units per period. Ghost inventory error of 168 units (P2) is permanent and requires continuous manual mu_hat inflation of +168 to maintain correct ordering levels.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime, with the average demand from Period 25 to 31 being approximately 410 units (recent peaks of 450 and 444). I will use a mu_hat based on an explicit value to account for this recent escalation. Furthermore, the pipeline inventory is currently being reported as 1728 units, but 168 units from the Period 2 order are confirmed lost, meaning the 'true' pipeline is 1560 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full reported pipeline (including the ghost inventory) from the target base stock, I must inflate the mu_hat by 168 units to offset this error. Calculating the base demand forecast: (1 + L) * 410, where L=3 for safety. Base mu_hat = (4) * 410 = 1640. Adding the 168-unit ghost inventory offset results in a final mu_hat of 1808. Sigma_hat is set somewhat high to account for the ongoing volatility in both demand and delivery times.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalated further: Period 25-31 average demand is 410 units. Permanent pipeline error of 168 units (P2) persists and requires constant mu_hat compensation of +168.

The average over P29-P32 is 449 units, with the most recent sample at 528. I will set the per-period demand forecast to 500 to account for this momentum. To determine mu_hat, I use the logic (1+L) * forecast. With an effective lead time (L) of 3 periods to buffer against frequent volatility/delays observed in the history, mu_hat = (1+3) * 500 = 2000. Additionally, I must compensate for the 'ghost inventory' of 168 units (Period 2 order) which remains in the system's pipeline inventory count but will never arrive. To neutralize this, I add 168 to the mu_hat, totaling 2168. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility associated with this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth confirmed: P29-P32 average is 449 units, peaking at 528 in P32 (+20% in 4 periods). Ghost inventory of 168 units (P2) remains a permanent baseline error requiring manual mu_hat inflation.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a phase of hyper-growth. Recent demand has surged from ~400 units around Period 30 to 528 and 534 units in Periods 32 and 33 respectively. The 4-period moving average (P30-P33) is 489 units. A ghost inventory of 168 units from a lost Period 2 shipment remains in the system's pipeline calculation, which would cause under-ordering if not addressed. To compensate for this and the rapid demand growth, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the base requirement as (1 + Lead Time) * Expected Demand. With L=2 and a conservative growth forecast of 550 units/period, the need is 3 * 550 = 1650. Adding the 168-unit ghost inventory offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 1818. I am maintaining L at the promised 2, though actual arrivals are volatile, as the explicit mu_hat padding provides a safety buffer. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth confirmed: P32-P33 averaged 531 units (+20% vs P29-P31). Ghost inventory persists at 168 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a hyper-growth phase, with recent demand in Periods 32-34 averaging 535 units and peaking at 543 units. The 168-unit order from Period 2 is permanently lost, but it remains in the system's pipeline calculation, creating a persistent 'ghost inventory' that causes the OR engine to under-order. To correct for this, I must explicitly inflate the mu_hat parameter. Using an effective lead time (L) of 3 periods (to account for historical variability despite recent 1-2 period arrivals) and a target base stock that covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand, the required base stock is approximately 543 * 4 = 2172. However, because the system subtracts the 2088 units already in-transit (including the 168-unit ghost), I must adjust mu_hat to ensure the OR engine places a large enough order to meet the current demand trajectory. I will set L=3 and use an explicit mu_hat of 2500 (calculated as 550 * (1+3) + 168 ghost offset + buffer) to force the necessary replenishment and account for the pipeline error.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth confirmed: P32-P34 average is ~535 units. Permanent pipeline inventory error of 168 units (P2) continues to necessitate manual inflation of ordering parameters.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a hyper-growth phase, with the average demand over the last four periods (P32-P35) reaching approximately 531 units per period. The pipeline inventory is significantly inflated by the permanent loss of the Period 2 order (168 units), which the OR backend continues to count as 'in-transit'. This ghost inventory causes the system to under-order unless manually neutralized. To account for this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Theoretical demand for (1+L) periods where L=3 is (1+3) * 531 = 2124. To offset the 168-unit ghost inventory and protect against recent peaks (e.g., 543 units), I am setting mu_hat to 2300 (2124 + 168 + safety margin). L is set to an 'explicit' value of 3 based on the historical pattern of delays and to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient time horizon given current zero-stock conditions and high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth confirmed: P32-P35 average is ~531 units. Permanent pipeline inventory error of 168 units (P2) continues to necessitate manual inflation of ordering parameters to prevent chronic stockouts.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a hyper-growth regime, with an average demand of approximately 535 units over the last five periods (P32-P36). Current on-hand inventory is 0. There is a critical systemic issue regarding the Period 2 order of 168 units, which is permanently lost but still included in the 'In-transit' pipeline by the OR backend. This 168-unit 'ghost inventory' causes the system to under-order. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required target stock based on the current regime (L=3, demand=535), which is (1+3)*535 = 2140 units. I then add the 168 units of ghost inventory to this target to ensure the OR engine's 'inventory position' (which includes the ghost units) triggers the correct physical order size. This results in an explicit mu_hat of 2308. I set L to 3 to account for the frequent logistics delays observed historically, and \u03c3\u0302 is set to a recent window to capture the current volatility of this high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $412.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a hyper-growth phase, with Period 37 reaching 626 units. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P35-P37) is approximately 571 units, showing a sustained upward shift from the previous regime (~531 units). Lead times remain highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will set L to 3 to ensure sufficient safety stock. Crucially, the 'ghost inventory' of 168 units from the lost Period 2 order still inflates the pipeline in the OR backend. To compensate for this and prevent under-ordering during this demand surge, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock covering (L+1) = 4 periods of demand at the current 571-unit rate (2284 units) and add 168 units to offset the ghost inventory, resulting in a mu_hat of 2452. This ensures the OR engine places orders based on real inventory needs.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth accelerated: Period 35-37 average is ~571 units (+7% vs P32-P35 baseline). Period 37 demand peaked at 626 units. High supply volatility continues (P35 arrived in 2 periods, but P33/P34 are still in-transit).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience hyper-growth and extreme supply volatility. Demand has ascended from ~531 (P32-P35) to ~600+ units in recent periods (P37: 626, P38: 637). The average of the last 4 periods (P35-P38) is 587.25 units. There is a persistent pipeline inventory error of 168 units (lost P2 order) which artificially inflates the 'In-transit' count, leading the OR backend to under-order unless compensated. Additionally, supply is unreliable: while P35 arrived in 2 periods, orders from P33 and P34 (along with many others) remain outstanding. The current 'In-transit' of 2452 includes the 'ghost' 168 units and several potentially lost or severely delayed shipments. To maintain service levels in this hyper-growth phase and reconcile the 168-unit ghost inventory plus demand acceleration, I am setting L to 3 (safety) and mu_hat to an explicit value. Calculation for mu_hat: (Expected Demand * (1+L)) + Ghost Offset = (630 * 4) + 168 = 2688. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to reflect high demand volatility and protection against frequent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth confirmed: P37-P38 demand averaged 631 units (+18% vs P35-P36 baseline). Pipeline error of 168 units (P2) persists alongside significant backlog in older orders (P33, P34).

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its sharp hyper-growth trajectory, with the average demand over the last three periods (P37-P39) reaching 647.3 units, significantly higher than previous baselines. There is a persistent 'ghost inventory' of 168 units from a lost Period 2 order that the OR backend incorrectly counts as in-transit, which structurally causes under-ordering unless compensated. Additionally, supply remains inconsistent; while the P38 order arrived in 1 period, orders from P33 and P34 (totaling 540 units) are now 6-7 periods old and must be treated as likely lost or severely delayed. To combat chronic stockouts and the pipeline inflation error, I am setting mu_hat using an explicit value. The calculation covers (1+L) periods, where effective L is 2. (1+2) * 647.3 = 1941.9. Adding the 168-unit ghost inventory offset and a buffer for the potentially lost P33/P34 orders (540 units) to ensure the system places a large enough order to reach the required base stock, I set mu_hat to 2650. L is set to explicit 2 to reflect the promised time while maintaining logic stability, and sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for high volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth confirmed: P37-P39 average is 647.3 units (+21% vs P32-P35 baseline). Orders from Period 33 (540 units) and Period 34 are now 6+ periods overdue and likely lost, further compounding the permanent 168-unit pipeline error from Period 2.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive hyper-growth phase, with Period 40 demand hitting 694 units. The average for the last three periods (P38-P40) is 670 units, but the trend is clearly upward. Supply chain reliability has worsened; while P38 and P39 arrived quickly (L=1), Period 33 (540 units) and Period 34 (0 ordered, but following high demand) remain unfulfilled and are now 6-7 periods overdue, suggesting they are lost. This adds to the existing permanent pipeline error of 168 units from Period 2. Total ghost inventory in the 'in-transit' figure is now estimated at 708 units (168 + 540). To compensate for this massive pipeline inflation and the continuing demand growth, I am using an explicit mu_hat. I estimate forward demand at 750 units per period. For a target lead time of 3 (safety against volatility), the required coverage is (1+3)*750 = 3000 units. To offset the 708 units of ghost inventory that the OR engine counts but will never arrive, I set mu_hat to 3708. Setting L to 3 ensures the backend uses a 4-period window for stock calculations.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: Period 33 order (540 units) is now 7 periods overdue and classified as a lost shipment, joining the Period 2 loss (168 units). Total permanent pipeline inflation is now 708 units. Demand hyper-growth remains active, with the latest observation at 694 units per period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe supply chain crisis combined with hyper-growth in demand. Current demand has reached ~734 units (P41), and the P37-P41 average is ~674 units. Two major orders are now confirmed lost: P2 (168 units) and P33 (540 units), totaling 708 units of 'ghost' inventory that the OR backend incorrectly believes is in-transit. To compensate for this 708-unit deficit and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I am using an explicit mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock by calculating demand for the lead time plus review period (L+1). With an effective lead time of 3 periods, I need to cover 4 periods of demand. At the current rate of 734 units, this is 2,936 units. Adding the 708-unit ghost inventory offset results in a mu_hat of 3,644. I set L to 3 to reflect the consistent delivery delays and volatility. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to manage the high variance and prevent stockouts during this hyper-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: Period 33 order (540 units) is now 8 periods overdue and lost. Total permanent pipeline inflation (ghost inventory) is 708 units (P2 + P33). Demand reached 734 units in P41, maintaining hyper-growth trajectory.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing extreme demand growth and severe supply instability. Demand is currently in a hyper-growth phase with the last three periods (P40-P42) averaging ~716 units. The supply chain has effectively collapsed regarding specific older orders: P2 (168 units) and P33 (540 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 708 units of 'ghost inventory' that inflate the system's in-transit count without ever arriving. Because the OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, these 708 units must be added back via mu_hat to ensure the backend actually places orders. For Period 43, I am using an explicit mu_hat based on (1+L) * average daily demand + 708 units compensation. Using L=3 for safety given recent volatility, mu_hat = (1+3)*716 + 708 = 3572. Sigma_hat is set explicitly high to handle the hyper-growth variance.

Carry-over insight: Total permanent pipeline inflation (ghost inventory) is confirmed at 708 units (P2: 168, P33: 540). Demand regime for P40-P42 has reached ~716 units per period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its hyper-growth trajectory, with Period 43 demand reaching a new peak of 791 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P41-P43) is approximately 748 units. Logistics instability remains extreme; orders from Period 33 (540 units) and Period 2 (168 units) are confirmed lost, creating a permanent 'ghost inventory' of 708 units that inflates the pipeline total and prevents the OR backend from ordering enough. To compensate, I am applying an explicit mu_hat adjustment. The target base stock must cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=3 and a forecast of ~750 units/period, the target inventory is 3000 units. However, because the system thinks there are 708 units in-transit that don't exist, it will under-order by that amount. I set mu_hat to 3708 (3000 + 708) to force the backend to place an order that results in a true 3000-unit pipeline. I set L to 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of arrival times and maintain safety stock against volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth confirmed: P41-P43 average demand is 748 units. Total permanent pipeline inflation (ghost inventory) remains 708 units (P2: 168, P33: 540).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its hyper-growth trajectory, with the latest demand at Period 44 reaching 873 units. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P42-P44) is approximately 794 units. We are now in Period 45 of 50, and demand shows no sign of decelerating. To capture this hyper-growth, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method at 3200 (calculated as (1+L)*E[D] = (1+3)*800). The lead time remains volatile, but a safety estimate of 3 periods is maintaining better coverage given the risk of stockouts. Most importantly, the pipeline inventory of 2698 unis is significantly inflated by 708 units of 'ghost inventory' (Period 2: 168 units and Period 33: 540 units), which are confirmed lost. By setting mu_hat explicitly high (3200), I effectively offset this 708-unit error and account for the recent demand surge to 800+ units. This should trigger an order that maintains the necessary service level for the final periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth confirmed: P42-P44 average demand is ~794 units. Total ghost inventory (permanent pipeline error) remains 708 units (P2: 168, P33: 540).

Daily Reward (R_t): $357.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its hyper-growth trajectory, with the last observed demand reaching 907 units in Period 45. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P43-P45) is approximately 857 units. The supply chain remains highly stressed with significant permanent pipeline inflation. We have confirmed 'ghost inventory' of 708 units (Period 2: 168, Period 33: 540) that will never arrive. The OR backend's 'cap' and base stock logic will subtract the total in-transit (2843 units) from the calculated base stock. To ensure we actually place an order to cover the next (L+1) periods of demand, we must manually inflate mu_hat to offset these 708 ghost units. Given the hyper-growth, I am setting mu_hat using an explicit value. Calculation: (Expected Demand per period * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory. With average demand at 857 and L assumed at 3 (for safety), mu_hat = (857 * 4) + 708 = 4136. sigma_hat is set to recent levels to account for high volatility during growth. L is set to explicit 3 to reflect the consistent 3-period delay observed in recent successful arrivals (P40, P41, P42).

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth persists: P43-P45 average is 857 units. Current total ghost inventory is 708 units (P2: 168, P33: 540).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its hyper-growth trajectory, with the Period 46 demand hitting a new peak of 968 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P44-P46) is approximately 916 units, compared to the P41-P43 average of 748 units, representing a 22% increase in a very short window. Supply chain issues persist: the 'In-transit' figure of 4014 units is significantly inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (168 units) and Period 33 (540 units), totaling 708 units of 'ghost inventory'. Furthermore, actual lead times are averaging 3 periods despite the 2-period promise. To ensure the base-stock calculation accounts for both the hyper-growth and the 708-unit pipeline deficit, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 4400. This is calculated as: Forecasted demand for (L+1=4) periods [(4 * 920) = 3680] + standard offset for lost pipeline inventory (708) \u2248 4388, rounded to 4400. Sigma_hat is increased to 400 to account for recent high volatility and the risks associated with the steep demand curve as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth persists: P44-P46 average is 916 units. Total ghost inventory (permanent pipeline error) remains 708 units (P2: 168, P33: 540).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing hyper-growth demand, which has accelerated significantly in the last five periods (P43-P47). The average demand of the last three periods (P45-P47) is approximately 944 units (907, 968, 957). Recent lead times have stabilized around 3 periods (P40-P42 all arrived at L=3). A critical issue remains: the 'In-transit' figure is heavily inflated by lost shipments. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (168 units) and Period 33 (540 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 708 units of 'ghost inventory'. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock, this ghost inventory causes the system to under-order by 708 units every period. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost_Inventory. With L=3, (1+3) * 944 + 708 = 4484 units. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 10% of the mu_hat value to account for the high demand volatility and growth trend. This approach ensures the inventory pipeline is replenished despite the reporting error.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth persists: P45-P47 average is 944 units. Total ghost inventory (permanent pipeline error) remains 708 units (P2: 168, P33: 540).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 is the penultimate period. Demand remains in a hyper-growth phase with the last three periods (P46-P48) averaging ~989 units (968, 957, 1043). Total ghost inventory is confirmed at 708 units (P2: 168, P33: 540) which inflates the pipeline and prevents the OR engine from ordering enough. Given the promised lead time L=2, an order placed now in P49 would arrive in P51 (after the game ends). Therefore, the priority is to ensure any remaining in-transit units cover the demand for P49 and P50. However, the system's stock-up logic is still active. I will set mu_hat to the current demand level (~990) and inflate it by the ghost inventory (708) to trigger an order if the internal logic perceives a gap. Since this is the end-of-game transition and lead time is variable (averaging 3), I will set L to 3 and mu_hat to an explicit value of 4668 (which represents (1+3)*990 + 708 ghost offset) to ensure any available 'real' stock in transit is utilized and to counteract the pipeline error for the final demand cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth continues: P46-P48 average is ~989 units. Total ghost inventory (permanent pipeline error) remains 708 units (P2: 168, P33: 540).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a hyper-growth phase, with Period 49 demand hitting 1097 units. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P47-P49) is approximately 1032 units, representating a significant upward trend compared to the P44-P46 average of 916. Supply chain reliability remains a major issue. We have 708 units of 'ghost inventory' (P2: 168 and P33: 540) that have not arrived for 48 and 17 periods respectively, which the OR engine incorrectly counts as available pipeline. Furthermore, recent arrivals (P43, P44, P45) show a consistent lead time of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. To compensate for the 708-unit pipeline inflation and the trajectory of demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 4800, which covers 4 periods (L+1 with L=3) of expected forward demand (~1050 * 4 = 4200) plus the 708-unit offset to trigger a meaningful order despite the ghost inventory. L is set to 3 to reflect the observed reality. sigma_hat is set to 300 to account for high demand volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth persists: P47-P49 average is ~1032 units (+12% vs previous 3-period block). Total ghost inventory (permanent pipeline error) remains 708 units (P2: 168, P33: 540). Effective lead time stabilized at 3 periods for recent successful deliveries.
