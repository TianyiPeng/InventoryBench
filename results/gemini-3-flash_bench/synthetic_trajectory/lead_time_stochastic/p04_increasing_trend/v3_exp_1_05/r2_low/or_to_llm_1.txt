The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 decision phase. To prevent stockouts during this window, we must cover demand for the current period plus the lead time (1 + 2 = 3 periods total). Historical demand for the first 5 periods shows an average of 115.6 units (103, 81, 107, 127, 160). The OR recommendation of 165 units is based on this historical data and a base-stock policy. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical fractile is 0.5, suggesting a target service level of 50%. However, the OR recommendation is capped. Since we starting from 0 inventory and need to cover the next 3 periods of demand (estimated at ~347 units total), and the order placed today won't arrive until Period 3, we are guaranteed a stockout in Periods 1 and 2 unless there was previous inventory (which there isn't).

However, looking at the (L+1) horizon (Periods 3, 4, 5), we need roughly 345 units (3 * 115). We have 335 in flight.

The current 'In-transit' of 385 covers roughly 3.3 periods of average demand. \n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because the pipeline (385) exceeds the calculated base-stock level (approx. 300-350). However, given the lead-time delay (P1 order hasn't arrived by P4), there is a risk of a stockout if more orders are lost or if lead time has permanently shifted to 4+ periods.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been 143, 122, 97 (averaging ~120), against an overall historical average of ~112. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it includes the lost P2 order (170) in its pipeline calculation. If we exclude P2, our active inventory (On-hand 108 + Pipeline 250 = 358) must cover demand for L+1 periods. With an average L of ~2-3, we need to cover ~4 periods of demand (~480 units).

In-transit consists of P2 (170 - lost), P6 (100 - likely lost/delayed), P9 (120 - expected arriving in P10 or P11). Given that P2 and P6 are likely non-deliverable, the 'effective' pipeline is likely only the 120 units from P9.\n3. Demand Analysis: Demand is stable but relatively high (avg ~115). Last period's demand was 149. \n4. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it likely assumes all 390 in-transit units (including the lost 170 and 100) are coming. If those 270 units never arrive, we face a stockout soon. Total stock (109 on-hand + 120 effective in-transit) = 229 units. At an average demand of 115, this covers exactly 2 periods (L+1 coverage).

The mean for the last 3 periods (P19-P21) is 301.3 units, compared to the initial mean of ~115. 4. **OR Baseline Evaluation**: The OR recommendation is 0. This is because the mathematical base-stock level is being compared against the raw 'In-transit' figure of 1760. Since the OR doesn't filter out lost shipments or react quickly to the recent demand surge (300+ units/period), its logic concludes the pipeline is flooded. 5. **Final Strategy**: We need to ensure we have enough stock to meet demand over the next 3-4 periods (Review + Lead Time). At 300 units/period, we need ~1200 units in the effective pipeline. Our effective pipeline is currently ~1280 units (P17-P21).

However, the supplier is still prone to losses.\n2. **Demand Analysis**: A clear regime shift is observed. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has climbed from ~375 in Period 28 to a sustained ~530+ units over the last three periods (P32: 528, P33: 534, P34: 543).

P29 and P30 are now 5-6 periods old, putting them at high risk of loss (as recent successful arrivals have L=1 or 2). Treating P29 and P30 as likely lost further reduces effective pipeline to 850 units (P33 and P34).\n4. **OR Recommendation Override**: The OR recommendation of 0 is ignored because it uses a raw pipeline of 3390 against a historical mean that doesn't reflect the recent surge to 540 units/period. \n5. **Strategy**: To cover demand over the 1-2 period lead time plus the current period (Review + L = 3 periods), I need roughly 540 * 3 = 1620 units.

Although the effective pipeline (1,950) technically covers 3.5 periods of demand, current stockouts (starting on-hand 0 at P37) and the arrival pattern (P34 arrived at P36, but P35 is still pending) suggest we must continue ordering to bridge the gap caused by the recent supply chain volatility.

Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 237 units. The total 'In-transit' shown by the system is 3,840.

Let's re-verify: P37 ordered 750, P38 ordered 100. Effective pipeline is 850 units. \n4. Strategy: Total inventory (on-hand 237 + effective pipeline 850) is 1,087 units. This covers roughly 1.7 periods of demand at the current 630/period rate. Since lead time is now 1-2 periods, we need to order to maintain a safety buffer for a 3-period coverage (L+1 + safety).

The current demand regime is estimated at roughly 1,000-1,100 units per period. Regarding the supply chain, while the total in-transit quantity is high (7,140 units), historical 'Carry-over Insights' indicate that 3,740 of these units (orders from P2 through P37) are confirmed or highly likely to be lost. This brings the effective pipeline down to 3,400 units (orders from P44 to P49). Specifically, the pipeline consists of 750 (P44), 750 (P45), 500 (P46), 1000 (P47), 200 (P48), and 200 (P49). Based on the most recent arrivals (P44 and P45 orders arrived in P44 and P45 respectively), the actual lead time (L) is currently around 3 periods. To cover the next 4 periods (L+1 + safety buffer) at a demand of ~1,050/period, we need a target stock levels of ~4,200. With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 3,400, there is a deficit of 800 units. The OR recommendation of 0 is ignored because it counts the ~3,740 lost units as valid inventory and fails to account for the massive demand surge. I will order 800 units to restore the inventory position against the current demand level.",
