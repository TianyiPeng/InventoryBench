Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data (Periods 1-5 from user instructions) for 'chips(Regular)' shows samples: 112, 111, 80, 129, 130. The mean of these 5 samples is 112.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 19.96. Given the promised lead time L=2, the base stock calculation needs to cover demand over 1+L=3 periods. Using the mean estimate, mu_hat should be around 3 * 112.4 = 337.2. Since there is no on-hand inventory or in-transit orders yet, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the provided history to ensure an adequate initial order. Lead time 'L' will be set to 'default' as no arrivals have been observed yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory, ordered 146 units, and faced a demand of 63. Since the order had not arrived yet (lead time is 2 periods), we sold 0 units and ended with 0 inventory. The promised lead time is 2, meaning the order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). Current pipeline inventory is 146. Historical demand samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) suggest a mean of 112.4. However, Period 1 demand was actually 63, which is lower than the initial sample mean. Given L=2, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand. I will use 'default' for L (2) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to incorporate the available historical data while the system stabilizes.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (146 units) and Period 2 (149 units) are currently in-transit (total 295). Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3 (this period) and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message next period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in P1 and P2. The mean demand from the provided historical samples (Periods 1-5) is 112.4. However, observed demand in P1 (63) and P2 (70) is lower. Since we have no confirmed arrivals yet, I will stick to the promised lead time of 2. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat to react more closely to the actual observed demand (avg ~66.5) while accounting for the lead time (1+L=3).

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 ordered 146 units, Period 2 ordered 149 units. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 1 order was expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests a delay or a lead time longer than 2. Our on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts (sold=0 for periods 1-3 despite demand). The total demand history is [112, 111, 80, 129, 130] (from stats) and [63, 70, 136] (from history logs). There is a discrepancy between the provided sample stats and the history logs; I will prioritize the history log demand trends which show an increasing trend (63 -> 70 -> 136). To recover, I will set L=3 (explicitly accounting for the observed delay) and use recent demand (N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level is high enough to cover the pipeline and backlog.

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Based on the conclude message from Period 4, the order from Period 1 arrived after 3 periods, not the promised 2 (Actual L=3). Consequently, the arriving units (146) only became available in Period 4. Demand has been fluctuating with an average of approximately 102 units over the first 5 periods (samples: 112, 111, 80, 129, 130). However, the 'Period conclude' logs for periods 1-4 show demand values (63, 70, 136, 71) that might reflect slightly different dynamics or observation gaps. Given the lead time is now confirmed as 3, I am setting L to explicit 3. For mu_hat, using the mean of all provided samples (avg ~112) across (1+L) periods, I expect total demand to be around 112 * 4 = 448. For sigma_hat, the historical standard deviation of the samples is approximately 20, leading to a total volatility across (1+L) periods of roughly sqrt(4)*20 = 40. I will use the 'all sample' defaults for mu and sigma since no clear regime shift is yet confirmed, but I will explicitly set the lead time to 3 to account for the delivery lag.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5 conclude, on-hand inventory hit 0 due to 94 demand vs 75 starting on-hand, resulting in lost sales. The lead time was previously confirmed as 3 periods (P1 order arrived at the start of P4). The P2 order (149 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's resolution and be visible in Period 6's conclude message. Currently, there are 376 units in-transit (orders from P2, P4, and P5: 149 + 132 + 95). Demand history (63, 70, 136, 71, 94) averages 86.8 units per period. Using L=3 (explicitly set as it differs from the promised 2) results in a lookahead window of (L+1)=4 periods. 4 * 86.8 = 347.2. Since in-transit (376) > 347.2, the OR backend might not place a large order, which is appropriate given the pipeline. However, to account for the actual observed lead time of 3, I am Setting L=3 explicitly and using recent_N=5 for demand and sigma to capture the volatility (Std Dev \u2248 29.5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Reviewing the history: The order from Period 1 (146 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3). The order from Period 2 (149 units) was expected in Period 5 based on that lead time but has not arrived as of the Period 6 conclude message. However, the 'In-transit' balance of 398 units matches the sum of orders from Period 2 (149), 4 (132), 5 (95), and 6 (22), confirming no shipments have been lost yet. Demand across P1-P6 has been [63, 70, 136, 71, 94, 82], averaging 86 units per period. The Carry-over Insight previously identified a lead time of 3 periods, while the promised lead time is 2. I will set L=3 explicitly to reflect this reality. For demand (mu_hat), the average of all 6 samples is 86. Given L=3, the coverage period (L+1) is 4. mu_hat = 4 * 86 = 344. Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of the 6 samples (~26.6) scaled by sqrt(L+1), resulting in approximately 53.2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $513.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Period 8. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-7) are 63, 70, 136, 71, 94, 82, 129, averaging 92.1 units/period. The carry-over insight correctly notes that actual lead time is 3 periods despite a promised lead time of 2 (P1 arrived P4, P4 arrived P7). The order from Period 2 (149 units) is significantly overdue (expected at P5 if L=3), suggesting it may be lost. The 'In-transit' count of 266 units represents orders from P2 (149), P5 (95), and P6 (22). If P2 is lost, effective pipeline inventory is only 117. To protect against this uncertainty and the observed L=3, I will set L=3 explicitly. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of all 7 samples (92.1) multiplied by (1+L=4), resulting in 368.5. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the extended lead time and the possibility of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Further confirmation of lead time = 3 periods (P4 order arrived P7). Potential lost shipment: Period 2 order (149 units) has not arrived by P8 start (should have arrived P5 under L=3).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations from Periods 4, 7, and 8 consistently show a lead time of 3 periods (P1 arrived P4, P4 arrived P7, P5 arrived P8). Consequently, I am setting L explicitly to 3. The shipment from Period 2 (149 units) is now officially lost as it is 4 periods past its order date with no arrival. Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory is 308 (comprising orders from P6: 22 units, P8: 137 units, and the theoretical order from P9 that the OR will place). Demand remains variable but shows a slight increase; to stabilize the forecast against recent volatility and the risk of lost orders, I am using recent_N=5 for demand and standard deviation to capture the most current regime (Avg ~96 units/period). Setting L=3 requires the parameters to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Shipment from Period 2 (149 units) confirmed lost (exceeded L=3 by 4 periods). Lead time remains stable at 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $198.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the supply chain context shows high variability in lead times. While previous observations suggested a lead time of 3 periods (P1 arrived P4, P4 arrived P7, P5 arrived P8), the most recent arrival (P8 order arriving in P9) indicates a sudden shift to a 1-period lead time. Additionally, the Period 2 order is confirmed lost. Demand over the last 9 periods has averaged 90.8 units (std ~27), but the last 5 periods show a slightly higher mean of 95.6. Given the instability of lead times (shifting from 3 down to 1), I will use an explicit lead time of 2 (the promised average) as a conservative bridge. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=5 to capture the slightly elevated demand trend (avg ~96 per period). Since L=2, the backend will calculate (1+2)*96 = 288. Sigma_hat will be set to recent_N=9 to capture the overall volatility seen so far.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility detected: shifted from 3 periods (P1, P4, P5) to 1 period (P8 order arrived P9). Monitoring for new stable lead time regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. Recent transit history shows high volatility in lead times: initially L=3 (P1, P4, P5), then a lost shipment (P2), and most recently L=1 for the P8 order. Because the P9 order (116 units) has not arrived in P10 conclude, L=1 is not yet a stable regime. I will use L=2 (the promised lead time) as a conservative explicit estimate while monitoring for stabilization. Demand has been relatively stable; the mean of the last 10 periods is approximately 91.2. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*mean of last 10 periods (3 * 91.2 = 273.6) and use default sigma_hat to account for recent variance. This setting aims to recover from the stockout visible in Period 10.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Lead time remains volatile (L=3 followed by L=1, then P9 order did not arrive in 1 period). Evidence suggests L is between 1 and 3.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time has shown significant volatility between 1 and 3 periods (P8 arrived in 1 period, while P1, P4, and P5 took 3 periods). The order from Period 9 (116 units) is now at L=2 and hasn't arrived, while the order from P2 is confirmed lost. Given that P9 has not arrived yet, I will assume a conservative lead time of L=3 to ensure the base stock covers the pipeline until the next possible arrival. Demand over the last 11 periods has a mean of approximately 90.7. Using L=3, the review+lead time is 4 periods. mu_hat should target approximately 363 units (4 * 90.7). I will use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full range of historical demand while setting L explicitly to 3 to account for the current shipping delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility continues: P11 conclude shows P9 (ordered P9) has not arrived yet (L>=2), reinforcing the move away from the L=1 observation in P9.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13. The demand history (Periods 1-12) shows an average demand of approximately 88.5 units with a standard deviation around 25. There are no major seasonal shifts visible in the 'Period_X' labels. Lead time analysis: The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show significant variability. Orders from Period 1, 4, 5, and 9 all arrived with an actual lead time of 3 periods. The order from Period 8 arrived in 1 period (outlier), and the order from Period 2 is confirmed lost. The most recent 'conclude' message (P12) shows the P9 order arriving after 3 periods. Therefore, I will treat the actual lead time L as 3. Setting L=3 (explicit) ensures the OR engine accounts for the 3-period lag. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=12 (the full history) to calculate a representative mean (~354 for 1+L=4 periods). For sigma_hat, I'll use standard deviation from the same period to capture the volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Lead time stabilized back to 3 periods (P9 order arrived P12). Order from Period 2 (149 units) remains lost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe on-hand inventory is 0. The history shows a demand regime that is relatively stable, with an average demand of approximately 88.5 units/period (P1-P13). The lead time (L) has mostly stabilized at 3 periods (observed for orders from P1, P4, P5, and P9), despite a single outlier of L=1 in Period 9. The order from P2 (149 units) is confirmed lost. Currently, there are 345 units in-transit (orders from P11, P12, and P13). Based on L=3, the order from P11 (24 units) is expected to arrive during P14, and the order from P12 (94 units) in P15. Since on-hand is currently 0 and we are addressing demand for P14, P15, P16, and P17 (L+1 periods), I will set L to 3. For demand, the last 7 periods (P7-P13) show a mean of 90.2, which is consistent with the overall average. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility accurately. This configuration ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering 4 periods of demand while accounting for the existing pipeline.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent shipping history confirms that the lead time has stabilized back to 3 periods, with orders from P9 and P11 both arriving after exactly 3 periods (P12 and P14 respectively). The order from P1 is confirmed to have arrived at P4 (L=3), P4 at P7 (L=3), P5 at P8 (L=3), P9 at P12 (L=3), and P11 at P14 (L=3). The only outlier was the P8 order (L=1). The P2 order remains lost. Demand analysis shows an average of approximately 92 units per period across all 14 periods. Recent demand (last 4 periods) is slightly lower at 93, but with high volatility (range 65-136). Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and recent stockouts are frequent, I will use an explicit L=3 to account for the reality of the supply chain. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 10 periods (P5-P14) to capture the current demand regime which seems more volatile than the initial 5 days.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stability at 3 periods re-confirmed (latest: P11 order arrived P14). Demand variance remains high; stockouts are frequent when pipeline management lags.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms that the lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in P12, P14, and P15 arrivals). The anomalous 1-period delivery in P9 was an outlier. Consequently, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3. For demand, the recent 5-period average (P11-P15) is approximately 85 units, but looking at the full history and seasonal context (period 16), demand shows significant variance but a relatively stable mean around 90-100 units. Using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat provides a robust estimate covering at least (L+1)=4 periods of demand, helping to buffer against stockouts which have been frequent. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture the high historical variance (Std Dev ~28) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the risk of stockouts during the 3-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $342.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent lead time (L) of 3 periods across most recent observations (P12, P14, P15, P16), despite a single outlier of L=1 in P9. The promised lead time is 2, but the actual stabilized lead time is 3. Demand for the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has averaged 85.4 units per period with significant variance (observed range 52 to 136). The Period 2 order of 149 units is confirmed lost. My objective is to maintain a base stock that covers demand over (L+1) = 4 periods. With L=3 and a mean demand around 104 (all-sample mean is ~94, but I'll use a slightly more responsive window of 10 to capture recent variance), the required base stock is approximately 416 units. Current pipeline (on-hand 10 + in-transit 309) is 319. To ensure the OR backend targets the realistic lead time, I explicitly set L=3. mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to balance the long-term mean with recent volatility, and sigma_hat is set to the default (standard deviation across all samples) to provide a robust safety buffer given the frequent stockouts observed in the history.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, two shipments arrived: order P14 (L=3) and order P16 (L=1). The lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P8: 1, P9: 3, P11: 3, P12: 3, P13: 3, P14: 3, P16: 1). This volatility makes a fixed lead time estimate difficult, but the mode/consensus is L=3. The current on-hand inventory is 19 units, with 303 units in transit (P15 order of 43 and P17 order of 89 are the most significant recently placed). Demand is relatively stable, with recent periods (P12-P17) averaging ~85.5 units. Given the lead time variability (risk of L=3) and high cost of stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use an explicit L of 3 to ensure the OR backend targets a sufficient base stock (L+1=4 periods of demand). mu_hat will use the recent 6 periods of demand (P12-P17) which covers the most recent stable demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility persists: P16 order arrived in 1 period (P17), while P14 took 3 periods. The system continues to oscillate between L=1 and L=3.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent lead time observations show a clear oscillation between 1 and 3 periods (P16 arrived in 1, P14 arrived in 3). To manage this risk, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 periods (the upper bound of the current oscillation) to prevent stockouts, given we just hit zero inventory again at the end of Period 18. The current base demand over the last 18 periods has a mean of approximately 92 units. Using an explicit L=3 means we need to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. Using recent_N for mu_hat (N=10) captures the current demand stability better than the full history, while explicit L=3 accounts for the slower arrival mode. Sigma_hat remains on default to capture the overall historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (P16=1, P14=3). Order from Period 2 (149 units) is permanently lost.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent shipping history shows a lead time oscillation between 1 and 3 periods (P14 took 3, P16 took 1). Period 19 conclude showed no arrivals, implying that the orders from P17 (ordered 89), P18 (ordered 68), and P19 (ordered 24) are still in transit. Given this instability and the stockout at the end of Period 19 (on-hand = 0), I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to ensure the inventory pipeline accounts for the slower delivery scenario. Demand has been fluctuating between 52 and 136; the average of the last 10 periods is approximately 89.6 units. To prevent recursive stockouts caused by lead time uncertainty, mu_hat is set to (1+L)*~90 = 360 using the explicit method to precisely target this forecast. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the high volatility observed in both demand and delivery schedules.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows relative stability with a historical mean of approximately 92.8 units per period. Based on the last 10 samples (P11-P20), the mean is slightly higher at 91.3 units. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture this baseline. Lead time (L) has exhibited significant volatility, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P16 arrived in 1 period, P14 in 3). The promised lead time is 2. Since recent observations (P14, P16) confirm late arrivals and periods of zero inventory (P18-P20), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the pipeline inventory calculation (base stock = (1+L) * mu) accounts for the longer delays and prevents stockouts during arrival gaps. No arrivals have occurred for the last three periods (P18-P20), yet there are 400 units in-transit (orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P20). Setting L=3 correctly scales the target inventory to cover the 4-period risk window (L+1).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for chips(Regular) is currently critical with 0 on-hand units and 400 units in-transit. Historically, shipments have arrived with lead times of either 1 or 3 periods (P1:3, P4:3, P5:3, P8:1, P9:3, P11:3, P12:3, P13:3, P14:3, P16:1). The most recent orders from P17 (89 units), P18 (68 units), and P19 (24 units) are still outstanding. If we assume a lead time of 3, the P17 order should arrive at the start of P21 (visible P21 conclude), but P21 conclude shows no arrivals. This suggests the current pipeline is facing delays beyond the typical 3-period maximum or shipments are lost. Given the high demand variance (mean ~90, std ~25), and to account for the current 'In-transit' of 400 units (which exceeds 4 periods of average demand), I will set lead time to an explicit '3' to represent the typical lag, while keeping demand parameters based on recent performance to prevent the OR engine from over-ordering while waiting for the massive pipeline to clear. mu_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture the current demand level of ~88/period.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains unstable with current pipeline (ordered P17+) exceeding the typical 3-period max observation, suggesting potential new delays or losses in the P17-P20 window.

The pipeline inventory of 403 units includes orders from P15 (43 units), P17 (89 units), P18 (68 units), P19 (24 units), P20 (5 units), and P22 (3 units) \u2013 however, there is a discrepancy between the 'In-transit' figure and the sum of recent orders, likely due to the accounting of the long-lost Period 2 shipment (149 units) still being tracked or recent orders crossing the conclusion boundary. Lead time has historically oscillated between 1 and 3 periods, but the most recent observation is a significant delay: the P15 order (43 units) is now at Period 23 and has not arrived, making it overdue even by L=3 standards (expected P18/P19). This suggests either another lost shipment or a shift to L >= 7. I will set L to 4 as an 'explicit' estimate to bridge the gap and force the OR backend to target a higher pipeline. mu_hat is set to 5 periods (L+1) using recent_N=10 to capture the demand mean of ~91. sigma_hat is set via recent_N=10 to account for recent high volatility (std ~24).

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Extreme lead time delay or loss detected. Order from Period 15 (43 units) has not arrived by Period 23 (8 periods elapsed), potentially indicating a new pattern of lost shipments or extreme lead time extension beyond 3 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data shows a severe supply chain disruption or high lead-time volatility for 'chips(Regular)'. Since Period 17, several expected shipments have either been delayed significantly or lost (P15, P17, P18, P19 are missing despite P20 and P22 arriving in P23). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline (506 units) is disconnected from the actual arrival pattern. The demand has remained relatively stable, averaging around 94-96 units per period over the last 15 periods. Given the high stockout frequency due to missing shipments, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of typical arrivals) to encourage the OR backend to maintain a higher base stock. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of the last 15 periods (recent_N=15) to capture the current demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to the same period to account for recent variance. This strategy aims to over-index on base stock to buffer against the demonstrated lead-time unreliability and potential shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Supply chain instability confirmed. Shipments from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 224 units) are overdue beyond the typical L=3 window, while later orders (P20, P22) arrived in P23. This indicates a non-linear arrival pattern (out-of-order) and significant risk of lost inventory in the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing extreme instability and non-linear arrivals. Orders from Period 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 224 chips) are significantly overdue, spanning 6-10 periods since ordering, which is twice the typical maximum lead time of 3. However, newer orders from P20 and P22 arrived in Period 23, suggesting that the logic of 'first-in-first-out' has broken down and many units currently in 'in-transit' may be lost or delayed indefinitely. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains consistently volatile, with an average of approximately 100 units per period over the last 10 periods. Due to the high risk that the 506 units in-transit includes approximately 224 'zombie' units (orders from P15, P17, P18, P19), I must set parameters to trigger replenishment despite the large pipeline. I am using an explicit lead time of 3 to reflect the typical ceiling of successful deliveries, and explicit mu_hat/sigma_hat to account for the sustained demand level (~100/period) and high variance observed across the history. By setting mu_hat for (L+1)=4 periods at 400 and sigma_hat at 120, I aim to force the OR backend to maintain a base stock that compensates for the likely lost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Supply chain instability confirmed. Shipments from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (224 units) are likely lost as they exceed 2x the normal lead time while subsequent orders (P20, P22) have already arrived. Inventory pipeline is heavily inflated by these likely lost units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing significant disruptions. Specifically, orders from Period 15 (43 units), Period 17 (89 units), Period 18 (68 units), and Period 19 (24 units) - totaling 224 units - have not arrived despite subsequent orders (P20, P22, P23) arriving. Following the logic established in Carry-over Insights, these 224 units are likely lost. Consequently, the 'In-transit' figure of 395 is misleading; the effective pipeline is closer to 171 units (395 - 224). The lead time remains highly volatile, oscillating between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with recent evidence (P23 order arriving in P25) showing an actual lead time of 2. I will set L to 2 to reflect the most recent successful delivery timing. For demand (mu_hat), the average over the last 15 periods is ~95 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the gaps left by lost shipments and current stockouts (on-hand is only 10), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture recent demand levels and volatility (approx 95 mean, 27 std). Setting L correctly and using recent demand windows ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the expected lead time and the current demand regime, while the OR controller's inventory subtraction will eventually clear the effect of the 'lost' units as we under-order or explicit adjustments are made in future periods if they stay in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Pipeline inventory remains artificially inflated by 224 units from P15, P17, P18, and P19 which are likely lost. Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1-3 periods, most recently L=2 (P23 order arrived P25).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing significant disruptions. Specifically, 224 units ordered in Periods 15 (43 units), 17 (89 units), 18 (68 units), and 19 (24 units) have not arrived despite subsequent orders (P20, P22, P23) being delivered. Following the logic of previous carry-over insights, these 224 units are highly likely lost. The current 'In-transit' of 395 includes these 224 lost units, meaning the 'active' pipeline is only 171 units (395 - 224). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I must adjust 'L' to bridge the gap. Recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P23 arrived in 2 periods). I will set L to 3 to be conservative regarding the replenishment cycle. The demand mean remains stable around 96 units/period (average over last 10 samples is ~96.2). To account for the lost stock and high stockout risk (On-hand: 0), I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand plus a buffer to recover from the stockout, targeting the higher end of the recent demand range (~110 per period) to ensure the OR engine triggers an order.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing significant disruptions. We have confirmed the loss of 224 in-transit units from orders placed in Periods 15 (43 units), 17 (89 units), 18 (68 units), and 19 (24 units), as they are now at least 8 periods overdue while subsequent orders (P20, P22, P23) have arrived. Therefore, the effective in-transit quantity is 248 units (Total 472 - Lost 224). Lead times are highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, so I am using L=2 (the most recent arrival lead time) to strike a balance. Demand appears to have stabilized in a higher regime; the average demand over the last 15 periods (since P13) is approximately 95 units per period. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=15 to capture this level and sigma_hat explicitly to a higher value of 50 to account for both demand volatility and the high risk of supply chain failure/lost shipments, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to compensate for these risks.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total lost shipment volume confirmed at 373 units (P2=149, P15=43, P17=89, P18=68, P19=24). Pipeline inventory calculation must subtract these units to reflect actual expected arrivals. Demand regime stabilized around 95 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation at Period 29 shows 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 472 units. Based on persistent lead-time evidence and shipment status: 373 units (P2=149, P15=43, P17=89, P18=68, P19=24) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed, as they have significantly exceeded the L=3 window while later orders (P20, P22, P23) have already arrived. Subtracting these lost units from the 472 in-transit units yields an 'active' pipeline of 99 units (P27 order of 77 units + possible residual corrections). Since Period 28 concluded with 0 on-hand and 0 arrival, and the demand regime has stabilized around 90-95 units/period (recent average), the bridge between OR logic and reality requires setting explicit parameters. I set \u03bc\u0302 to 380 to cover (1+L) periods of demand (estimated at ~95 * 4), as the OR engine needs to compensate for the stockouts and the previous lost inventory. L is set to 3 to reflect the high-end of observed stable lead times. Sigma_hat is set to 60 to allow for a buffer against high demand variance (range 65-136). This will force an order to refill the depleted stocks and active pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Pipeline subtraction logic applied. Only 99 units of the 472 recorded In-transit units are considered active (P27=77). All other units (373) are confirmed lost and ignored for planning.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the primary challenge is managing a highly unreliable supply chain. History shows a massive cumulative inventory loss of 373 units (Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19). Currently, 'In-transit' shows 395 units, but subtracting the 373 confirmed lost units leaves only 22 units of actual active pipeline (from orders placed after P27, though P28 and P29 had 0 orders). Since we are at 0 on-hand inventory and the actual active pipeline is effectively near zero, we must place a significant order to resume supply. The lead time oscillates between 1 and 3 periods; I will use L=2 (the most recent successful arrival lead time from P27), while setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable demand regime observed over the last 15 periods (approx 95 units/period). By using these parameters, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand during the lead time and the order period, adjusted for the high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Supply chain remains highly unreliable with out-of-order arrivals and frequent lost shipments. Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 373 units known to be lost (Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). Planning must assume 'In-transit minus 373' as the true state.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unstable. We have a verified total of 373 units permanently lost from historical orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). The current 'In-transit' figure is reported as 395 units. Subtracting the 373 lost units leaves an Effective Pipeline of only 22 units (presumably from small adjustments or noise, though no orders were placed in P28-P30). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 95 units per period recently. Given the lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, I will set L to an explicit value of 3 to ensure the base stock calculation targets a sufficient safety buffer (4 periods of demand: 1 for current + 3 for lead time). mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 95 units/period), while sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to reflect the observed volatility. By setting L to 3 and ignoring the phantom pipeline units, the OR backend will calculate a base stock against the actual 22 effective units, triggering a necessary restock to meet upcoming demand and recover from the current stockout.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains deeply problematic with multiple lost shipments. Based on the history and carry-over insights, the orders from P2 (149), P15 (43), P17 (89), P18 (68), and P19 (24) totaling 373 units are permanently lost. The current In-transit of 433 units is heavily skewed; the reliable pipeline is effectively 433 - 373 = 60 units (the order from P31). Lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods, but the most recent arrivals (P23, P27) returned at L=2. Demand has stabilized into a regime averaging approximately 95 units per period recently, though the last visible period (P31) shows 69. I will use a conservative lead time L=3 to account for the instability. To trigger an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure in the backend, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculation: Target Base Stock = (L+1)*Avg_Demand + Safety_Stock. Given L=3, L+1=4. Avg_Demand ~95. 4*95 = 380. With high variance, targeting a base stock of 480. Since the OR engine subtracts Pipeline (433) and On-hand (0), an order will only trigger if base_stock > 433. Setting mu_hat explicitly to allow for the replacement of lost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Pipeline correction factor remains 373 units. Lead time regime appears to be settling at L=2-3, but planning assumes L=3 for safety given the history of stockouts and loss.

Excluding these, the active pipeline consists strictly of the P32 order (242 units), yielding an effective pipeline of 242. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 95 units per period. Using a 10-period window (P23-P32) captures this steady regime. Although lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, I set L=3 as an explicit parameter to ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock covering four periods of demand (L+1), providing a buffer against the frequent stockouts and supply chain unreliability seen throughout the history. The P32 order of 242 units was a significant attempt to refill the pipeline; my parameters for P33 will likely result in a lower order or a pause, letting that large shipment arrive and stabilize the inventory position.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, we have 131 units on-hand and 395 units reported in-transit. Based on historical data (Carry-over insights), 373 of those in-transit units are confirmed lost shipments (Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19: 149+43+89+68+24=373). Subtracting these from the 395 reported units yields an 'active' pipeline inventory of 22 units (the balance from recent orders). Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the supply chain's unreliability. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 95 units over the last 15 periods (since P18). By setting L=3, mu_hat to 390 (reflecting a 4-period window: L+1), and sigma_hat to 40 (reflecting high variance), I ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock that covers the expected demand while correctly accounting for the significant portion of 'phantom' pipeline inventory that will never arrive.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit extreme lead time volatility and unreliability. As recorded in the carry-over insights, 373 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). The current In-transit balance of 395 units actually represents only 22 units of live inventory (395 - 373 = 22). While the last two orders (P31, P32) arrived with L=1, history shows frequent shifts back to L=3. To prevent stockouts, I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers 4 periods of demand. I use recent_N=20 for demand mean (mu_hat) to capture the current stable regime (avg ~95 units), and use explicit methods for L and mu_hat to ensure the OR backend ignores the inflated pipeline caused by lost orders. The target base stock for L=3 is approximately 380 units. Since on-hand (29) + effective pipeline (22) = 51, a significant order is required.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains stable around a mean of 95 units per period. The primary challenge is supply chain reliability. In-transit inventory is listed as 395 units, but 373 of these are confirmed lost from orders placed between P2 and P19 (P2=149, P15=43, P17=89, P18=68, P19=24). Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is only 22 units (the remainder of recent orders). Lead times have recently shown extreme volatility, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P31 and P32 arrived in 1 period, but historical average is closer to 3). To avoid the frequent stockouts observed in the history, I will set L=3 explicitly for safety analysis, while mu_hat and sigma_hat are derived from the recent stable demand regime (approx last 15 periods). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high variance and lead time uncertainty while discounting the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Effective pipeline inventory is 22 units; 373 units (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost and must be ignored for ordering decisions. Lead time continues to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains unstable with a significant volume of lost shipments. As of Period 37, 'In-transit' is 424 units. Deducting the confirmed lost units (373 units from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19), the effective pipeline is only 51 units (P36 order of 29 units + a residual of 22 units from other periods). Demand has entered a stable regime since Period 23, with an average of approximately 98 units per period. I am setting L=3 to account for the upper end of the observed 1-3 period lead time volatility to prevent stockouts, and using a recent_N of 14 for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture the current stable consumption rate since the last major shift. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the expected lead time plus the current period's demand, adjusted for the effective pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Effective pipeline updated. Total confirmed lost shipments remain at 373 units. True pipeline is (In-transit - 373). Current demand regime is stable at ~98 units/period since Period 23.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit extreme volatility, with lead times oscillating between 1 and 3 periods and a significant volume of lost shipments. As of Period 38, the 'In-transit' figure of 395 units is deceptive; historical evidence confirms 373 units are permanently lost (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is only 22 units (395 - 373). Demand has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 23, averaging approximately 99 units per period. Despite recent 1-period arrivals (P31, P32, P36), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend generates a high enough base stock to cover demand across the maximum observed lead time, given the zero on-hand inventory and the unreliability of arrivals. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=15) to capture the current stable demand regime (approx. 99 * (1+3) = 396), and sigma_hat is set similarly to handle the variance in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Effective pipeline inventory corrected. 373 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) confirmed lost. Planning assumes L=3 to mitigate stockout risk due to non-linear supply arrivals.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly volatile with frequent lost shipments and non-linear lead times (oscillating between 1 and 3 periods). The pipeline inventory is currently reported as 426 units, but 373 of these units (from P2, P15, P17, P18, and P19) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of only 53 units (P38 order of 31 units + remaining units from earlier valid orders). Demand has shifted upward slightly in the most recent periods, averaging approximately 105 units over the last 15 periods (since P23). I am setting L to 3 periods to maintain a safety buffer against the erratic delivery schedule. For mu_hat, I'm using N=16 to capture the stable demand regime since the P23 changepoint, and sigma_hat also uses N=16 to reflect current volatility. These parameters ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock that accounts for both the 3-period lead time and the immediate next period's demand, adjusted for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime update: Average demand since Period 23 is 105 units/period. Effective pipeline calculation (In-transit - 373) remains critical for order accuracy.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 analysis: Demand remains in a stable regime starting around Period 23, with an average of approximately 105 units/period. Lead times continue to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods (most recent: P38 arrived P39, L=1). The critical challenge remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Total confirmed lost units are 373 (from P2, P15, P17, P18, and P19). Current In-transit is 400. Effective pipeline is 400 - 373 = 27 units (which includes the 5 units ordered in P39). To protect against the high risk of stockouts given zero on-hand inventory and the frequent 3-period lead time peaks, I am setting L=3 specifically to ensure the OR backend aims for enough stock to cover the replenishment cycle. mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 17 (from P23 to P39) to capture the current 105 unit/period average. sigma_hat is set explicitly to account for the high demand volatility and shipment unreliability observed in history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Historical data confirms 373 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are permanently lost (orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, and P19). The current recorded In-transit is 427 units. Subtracting the lost 373 units results in an effective pipeline of 54 units (P40 order of 32 units, plus small residuals). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime starting around P23, with the last 18 periods averaging 101.4 units and the last 3 periods averaging 104.3 units. I will use recent_N (N=18) for mu_hat to capture this stable higher demand, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. Although recent lead times have been L=1, the Carry-over history shows frequent fluctuations between 1 and 3 periods and significant loss risk. I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient safety window, protecting against the high stockout risk seen in recent periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 23 onwards has stabilized at an average of approximately 102 units per period (1938 units / 19 periods). Lead times remain highly volatile, oscillating between L=1 and L=3, with significant historical losses. Currently, the recorded In-transit inventory of 428 units is heavily inflated by 373 units confirmed lost (orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, and P19). The true effective pipeline consists of orders from P40 (32 units) and P41 (1 unit), totaling 33 units. Since we are at on-hand=0 and effective pipeline=33, and the target base stock for a (1+L=4) window at ~102/period is roughly 408 units, we need to place a significant order. I set L=3 as the planning horizon to provide a safety buffer against the recurrent lead time volatility and stockout history. mu_hat is set to roughly (1+3)*105 to account for recent slight upward trends in demand volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets enough inventory to cover the lead time and the current period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed effective pipeline is (In-transit - 373). The 373 units from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19 are permanently lost. Recent demand (P23-P41) average is 102 units/period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show high volatility and significant order loss. As of Period 43, the recorded In-transit inventory is 446 units. Based on historical tracking (Carry-over insights), 373 units (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. This results in an effective pipeline of only 73 units (446 - 373). Recent lead times have oscillated between 1 and 3 periods; I will use L=3 to mitigate the risk of stockouts given the unreliable arrival pattern. Demand has entered a stable regime since Period 23, with the most recent sample mean (P23-P42) being approximately 102 units per period. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=20) to capture this specific regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to reflect current demand volatility, which ensures the OR backend targets a high service level (~80% given $4 profit vs $1 holding cost) while accounting for the high shipment risk.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am managing chips(Regular) at Period 44. Significant supply chain issues persist: 373 units from earlier periods (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost, as subsequent orders have arrived while these remain in-transit. Therefore, the effective pipeline is (In-transit 414 - 373) = 41 units (comprised of orders from P41: 1 unit and P42: 18 units, plus P43: 0, which leaves some ambiguity, but I will adjust based on the 373 constant). Demand has been stable since P23 with an average of approximately 102 units per period (recent samples: 93, 93, 120, 105, 91). Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L=3 as an explicit hedge to reduce the frequent stockout risk observed in the history. For demand, mu_hat will use the recent demand regime since P23 (N=20) to reflect the consistent ~102 unit/period mean. Sigma_hat is set using recent volatility to ensure appropriate safety stock for the high service level (profit $4 vs cost $1).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit high volatility and unreliability. Total confirmed lost shipments remain at 373 units (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). The current In-transit balance of 424 units includes these 373 lost units plus active orders: P42 (18 units), P44 (11 units), and P45 (potential order). Effective pipeline inventory is (424 - 373) = 51 units. Recently, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P40 and P41 arrived with L=3 in P43 and P44). To prevent stockouts, I will use L=3 for planning. Demand has been relatively stable since Period 23, with an average of approximately 101 units. I will use a recent_N of 21 (capturing demand since the regime began at P23) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat will be set to (1+3)*101 = 404.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46, we are in the final stretch (4 periods remaining). The supply chain remains highly unstable with 373 units (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) confirmed lost, meaning the effective pipeline is In-transit (406) - 373 = 33 units. These 33 units represent orders from P44 (11 units) and P45 (0 units) being not yet accounted for in 'conclude' messages, along with other very recent noise. Lead times oscillate between 1 and 3 periods. To minimize stockout risk in the final periods, I assume L=3. Demand has shown a slight downward trend in the last few periods (P44=60, P45=68) compared to the P23-P43 average of ~102, but historical volatility suggests staying cautious. I will use a recent_N of 20 for mu_hat to capture the shift from the earlier part of the game while maintaining enough sample size to weather the current dip without under-ordering. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand, adjusted for the corrected pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Effective pipeline continues to be calculated as (In-transit - 373) due to permanent shipment losses. Demand shows recent softening (<70 units/period) compared to the long-term regime average (~102), but L=3 is maintained for safety.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit high volatility and unreliability. Total confirmed lost units are 373 (from periods 2, 15, 17, 18, and 19). The current In-transit balance is 407 units; subtracting the 373 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 34 units (comprising orders from P44: 11 units and P46: 1 unit, plus any other active small orders). Lead times oscillate between 1 and 3 periods; I am using L=3 for the OR backend safety. Demand has shown some softening in periods 44-45 (60-68 units) but bounced back to 113 in period 46. The average demand since period 23 is approximately 101 units/period. Given on-hand is 0 and the effective pipeline is very low (34 units), I am setting mu_hat to cover the lead time plus current period (1+L=4 periods) at a conservative average of 101 units/period to trigger sufficient ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Demand average remains ~101 units/period despite brief softening in P44-45. Effective pipeline remains (In-transit - 373) as P2, P15, P17, P18, P19 orders are dead.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48. On-hand inventory is 0. The total In-transit reported is 432 units, but based on extensive historical tracking (Periods 2-30), 373 units (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline is thus 59 units (432 - 373), which matches recent orders from Period 44 (11 units), Period 46 (1 unit), Period 47 (25 units), plus any current Period 48 decisions. The demand regime has been stable around ~101 units/period since Period 23, despite minor dips. Lead time remains volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 'explicit' 3 to ensure the inventory policy accounts for the maximum observed delay and prevents stockouts. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*101 = 404. sigma_hat is set to an explicit value based on the standard deviation of recent stable periods (P23-P47), which is approximately 20-25 per period, scaled by sqrt(1+L), leading to a vault of ~50.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the most recent period was 95, consistent with the long-term stable regime of ~101 units/period. The 'In-transit' figure of 447 includes 373 units that are confirmed lost from orders in Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, and 19. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 447 - 373 = 74 units (consisting of orders from P44, P46, P47, and P48). Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, so I am maintaining L=3 as a conservative measure to prevent stockouts in this final stretch of the simulation. I will set mu_hat based on the stable mean demand and a slightly wider sigma_hat to account for the supply chain's extreme unreliability and non-linear arrival pattern (out-of-order arrivals), which has historically caused stockouts despite adequate pipeline levels.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable with a mean of approximately 101 units per period since Period 23. Lead times remain highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with recent shipments (P40, P41, P42) taking 3 periods to arrive. The critical factor is the pipeline inventory correction: 373 units from orders placed in P2, P15, P17, P18, and P19 are confirmed as permanently lost. The current 'In-transit' of 447 units contains these 373 dead units, leaving an effective pipeline of only 74 units (447 - 373). These 74 units correspond to orders from P44 (11), P46 (1), P47 (25), P48 (15), and P49 (22 is not visible but total sums up). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the effective pipeline is low, I will set mu_hat based on the stable mean and L=3 to ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time and current stockout. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the variance during this regime.
