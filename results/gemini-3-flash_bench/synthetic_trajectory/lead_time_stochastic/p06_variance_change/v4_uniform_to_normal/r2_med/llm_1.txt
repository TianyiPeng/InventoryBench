The pre-game data (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) suggested a higher mean (~112), but actual game play shows a slightly lower variance around a mean of 90-100. c) Lead Time: Observation from P4 conclude confirms an actual lead time of 3 periods (P1 order arrived P4). An order placed in P5 (70 units) is expected in P8. An order placed in P2 (50 units) is expected in P5 conclude (visible now in P6 start), but P5 conclude shows 'arrived=0'.

The supply chain is characterized by a roughly 50% shipment success rate and a variable lead time of 1-3 periods. As established in the carry-over insights, the 'In-transit' total of 1635 is largely comprised of 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments from P15-P37). The only potentially active orders are from P40, P41, and P42 (150 units each). However, P40's order (placed 3 periods ago) has not arrived as of the end of P42, posing a risk. With 0 units on-hand and a high probability of shipment failure, I must order to cover both the demand until the next possible arrival and to hedge against the frequent loss of previous shipments. I will order 150 units to maintain the current delivery attempt frequency, aiming to restore inventory as soon as any of the recent large orders arrive, while acknowledging that many in-transit units are likely lost.",

(b) Current demand regime is steady at approximately 100 units/period (recent average). (c) Lead time analysis: Supply chain remains highly erratic. P40 arrived in 3 periods (Period 43). Orders from P41 (LT=2) and P42 (LT=1) have not yet arrived, though they are within the 1-3 period window. History shows roughly 50% of orders are lost. (d) Inventory assessment: On-hand is 57. The total in-transit of 1635 is misleadingly high due to roughly 1185 units of confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P15-P39, excluding P40-P43). Real pipeline consists of P41 (150 units), P42 (150 units), and P43 (150 units). (e) Order logic: To cover the 1-3 period lead time and protect against frequent shipment losses, a target of ~400 units (4 periods of demand) in the reliable pipeline + on-hand is desired. With ~450 units theoretically in transit (P41-43) and 57 on hand, one might think to wait, but the ~50% failure rate necessitates aggressive over-ordering to ensure at least one shipment arrives to prevent stockouts.",

The supply chain remains extremely unreliable, characterized by a significant historical loss rate (approx. 50% of orders never arrive) and variable lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods. Looking at the current pipeline: Orders from P40 and P41 arrived in P43 and P44 respectively (both lead time 3). Orders from P42 (150 units) and P43 (150 units) are currently 3 and 2 periods old, respectively. I consider these the only 'active' and potentially reliable units in the in-transit pool; the remaining 1335 units are confirmed ghost inventory from previous losses. On-hand inventory is currently at 147 units. Given the high loss risk, I must continue placing orders to maintain a 'buffer' against potential future shipment failures while being mindful of the 50-period game end. To cover 3 periods of demand (~300-330 units) and account for the 50% probability that any single order fails, I will place an order of 150 units to keep the pipeline populated, ensuring that even if one order fails, we maintain service level for the final periods.",

However, the primary challenge remains the extremely unstable supply chain, characterized by a lead time fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods and a failure rate of approximately 50%. In Period 45, two orders arrived (from P42 and P43), bringing on-hand inventory to 379 units. The nominal In-transit is 1485, but historical 'ghost inventory' (orders prior to Period 44 that haven't arrived) continues to bloat this number. Specifically, orders from P44 (150 units), P45 (150 units), and the current P46 order are the only ones with a realistic chance of arrival within the 1-3 period window. Given the current high on-hand inventory (379 units), which covers nearly 4 periods of average demand, and the risk of holding costs ($1/unit), the goal is to maintain a buffer for supply chain failures while not over-ordering. I will place a conservative order of 100 units to maintain the pipeline as the game approaches its final periods (Period 50).",

The supply chain is notoriously unreliable, with a ~50% shipment loss rate and lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods. Looking at the reliable pipeline, the order from Period 44 (150 units) is now 3 periods old and has not arrived, making it the next expected arrival or a potential loss. Subsequent orders (P45: 150, P46: 100) are also in transit. Given the high on-hand stock and the proximity to the game end (Period 50), the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer against further shipment losses. Since Period 47 is 4 periods from the end, and we have 266 units on hand plus a pipeline of potentially 400 active units (P44-46), a smaller order is prudent to manage ending inventory risk.",

The active pipeline (orders from P44 onwards) consists of P44 (150 units), P45 (150 units), P46 (100 units), P47 (50 units), and P48 (50 units). Given no arrivals occurred in Periods 46, 47, or 48, there is a high probability that the orders from P44 and P45 are delayed or lost. Specifically, P44 is now 4 periods old (beyond the max 3-period lead time), suggesting it is likely lost. P45 is 3 periods old and may arrive this period. To maintain service levels through the final two periods (49 and 50) while accounting for the high loss rate, I need to ensure sufficient stock for the remaining ~200 units of demand. Current on-hand (74) + probable arrivals (P45, P46) should cover this, but given the 50% failure rate, a small buffer order is prudent to prevent a stockout in the final period without incurring excessive holding costs as the game concludes.",
