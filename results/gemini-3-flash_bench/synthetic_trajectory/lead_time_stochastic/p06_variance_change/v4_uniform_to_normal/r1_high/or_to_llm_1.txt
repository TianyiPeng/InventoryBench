Order placed in Period 1 will arrive during Period 3 (available for sale in Period 3, visible in Period 4 decision). I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3.\n3. Demand Analysis: Historical samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) average 112.4. There is no specific calendar/seasonal data provided for 'Period_1', so I will rely on the mean and variability. \n4. Lead-Time Demand (L+1): With L=2, I need to cover (2+1)=3 periods of demand. Projected demand = 112.4 * 3 = 337.2 units.\n5. OR Analysis: The OR algorithm suggests 146 units. This is based on its 'capped' logic which likely limits the order size to prevent over-stocking in a single period, effectively smoothing the replenishment. Since I have zero stock and zero pipeline, a higher order is necessary to reach safety levels, but the OR recommendation is already providing a buffer above the single-period mean (~112).\n6. Strategy: I will follow the OR recommendation of 146 units. While it seems low for a 3-period horizon, the capped OR policy is designed to build inventory steadily without overreacting to early volatility. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs profit of $19.0, stockouts are expensive, but I will trust the OR's initial statistical baseline until I observe the actual lead time.",

However, since we have 0 current on-hand and have sold 0 units due to stockouts, we are losing significant profit ($19/unit). 5. Action: While the pipeline is theoretically high, the lack of arrivals despite the promised 2-period lead time is concerning.

To cover 3 periods of demand (~315 units) while accounting for the current stockout and the high failure rate of orders, we need a consistent supply. The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically driven by the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 1,378, which includes the 778+ lost units.

Orders placed in periods P44, P45, P46, and P47 (120 units each) should begin arriving in P48 and P49, given the observed lead times of 1-3 periods. Because the total number of periods is 50, and we are at Period 48, any order placed now (in P48) would arrive at the earliest in Period 49 (L=1) or Period 50 (L=2) to satisfy the final demand. The functional pipeline (600 units) is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 3 periods of demand (~315 units) and existing orders will likely satisfy P48 and P49.
