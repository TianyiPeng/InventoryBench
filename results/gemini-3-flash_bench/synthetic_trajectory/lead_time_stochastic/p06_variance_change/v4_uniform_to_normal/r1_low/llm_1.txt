The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 4. I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, I must order enough to satisfy the expected demand across this lead-time window plus a buffer for safety stock. Average demand is ~112 units/period. Over 3 periods, expected demand is 336 units. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), I will aim for a lean inventory but ensure I don't stock out in the opening periods.",

Historical demand (P1-P5) for chips(Regular) shows values of 112, 111, 80, 129, and 130, averaging approximately 112 units per period. Since the lead time is 2, I need to cover demand for P2, P3, and P4. Total demand for 3 periods is roughly 336 units (112 * 3). Currently, 340 units are in transit. However, because the P1 order won't arrive until P3 (to be used in P4), I will experience stockouts in P2 and P3 regardless of my current action. To ensure I have stock for P5 and beyond (considering the 2-period lead time for an order placed now in P2), I need to maintain the pipeline.

Recent periods P1 (demand=112) and P2 (demand=109) support this baseline.\n\nLead Time Analysis: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order placed in P1 (340 units) is expected to arrive during P3 resolution and will be visible in P4 start. Order placed in P2 (120 units) is expected to arrive in P4 resolution. \n\nInventory Assessment: Current on-hand is 0. Customers are currently experiencing stockouts (sold=0 in P1 and P2). In-transit balance is 460 (340 from P1 + 120 from P2). \n\nForecasting & Pipeline: Assuming a mean demand of ~115 units, demand for P3, P4, and P5 (L+1 periods) totals ~345 units. The pipeline (460) currently covers this expected demand and provides a buffer for the stockouts already incurred. \n\nFinal Logic: I have 460 units arriving over the next two periods. P1's 340 units arriving this period (P3) will satisfy remaining P3 demand and leave ~225 units for P4. P2's 120 units arriving in P4 will bring the total available for P5 onwards to ~230 units. Adding another order now targets a 3-period coverage window (P4, P5, P6).

Evidence of arrival would appear in the P3 conclude message, but P3 conclude shows arrived=0. However, the timing definition states that an order with L=2 placed in P1 arrives during P3's resolution and is visible in the P3 conclude message.

P12 order (150 units) is at L=1 and should arrive in P13, P14, or P15 (since it didn't arrive in P13, it will likely be P14 or P15). P13 order (80 units) is recently placed. Total in-transit is 510 units, but if we deduct the suspected lost orders (P2: 120 and P6: 40), the 'live' in-transit is 350 (P11: 120, P12: 150, P13: 80). Expected demand for the protection interval (L+1 = 4 periods) is ~480 units. On-hand (62) + live in-transit (350) = 412 units. To cover a 4-period window and hedge against lead time volatility, I need to bring total inventory position closer to 500-550 units. Therefore, I will order 120 units to maintain a continuous flow and build a small safety buffer against further shipment losses.",

Period 24's order (100) is now at L=4 (end of P27), making it highly likely to be lost. If P24 is lost, the reliable pipeline drops to 300.

Historically, orders that do not arrive within 3 periods (L > 3) are 100% likely to be lost. Analyzing the pipeline: Order P40 (120 units) and P41 (100 units) are the only active 'healthy' orders. The order from P37 (150 units) is now 4 periods old and classified as lost. Total effective pipeline (on-hand 115 + P40 in-transit 120 + P41 in-transit 100) is 335 units. To cover approximately 3 periods of demand (current + 2 periods lead time) at 100 units/period plus a small safety buffer for supply volatility, I aim for an inventory position around 350-400.

Valid pipeline: P40 (120), P41 (100), P42 (100). Total reliable supply = 16 (on-hand) + 320 (valid pipeline) = 336 units. With an average demand of 100, this covers roughly 3.3 periods. Since L varies between 1-3 periods, I need to ensure coverage for Period 43, 44, and 45. Expected demand over three periods is 300.

Our inventory position shows 4 units on-hand and a massive in-transit pipeline of 1840 units, though historical data confirms a significant portion of these are lost. Specifically, we have confirmed that any order with a lead time > 3 periods never arrives. Current active pipeline includes orders from P44 (L=3), P45 (L=2), and P46 (L=1). The P44 order (100 units) must arrive in P47 to be usable; if it doesn't, it is lost per the L>3 rule. The orders from P45 (200 units) and P46 (120 units) are within the valid 1-3 period arrival window. Total expected incoming (non-lost) inventory is P44(100) + P45(200) + P46(120) = 420 units. Total remaining demand is roughly 105 * 4 = 420 units. Since on-hand is only 4 units and we face a serious stockout risk if the P44 order is lost or if we rely solely on arrivals that might take 3 periods, a moderate order is necessary to bridge the gap while avoiding high holding costs at the game's end.

Pipeline Analysis: Based on the 'L > 3 = Lost' rule established in the carry-over insights, the order from Period 45 (200 units, currently L=3) must arrive in the Period 49 arrival resolution phase to be useful.

Since this is Period 49 of 50, any order placed now (Period 49) would only arrive in Period 50 if the actual lead time is 0 or 1. Historically, lead times of 1 (e.g., P31, P32, P36, P38, P39) are common. To hedge against the possibility that current in-transit orders (P45-P48) fail to arrive or have already been lost, and to ensure we can meet demand in the final period (P50), a small order is placed. However, because the game ends at Period 50, any excess inventory at the end of Period 50 will incur a holding cost of $1.0/unit with no future sales to offset it.
