Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historically, the demand for chips(Regular) over the last 5 periods has been [112, 111, 80, 129, 130], yielding a mean of 112.4 and a standard deviation of 20.37. Since we have no specific calendar date or product category details to suggest an immediate shift, I will use all 5 historical samples to set the baseline for Period 1. The OR backend uses (1+L) for both mu and sigma calculation. With L=2, the coverage target is (2+1)=3 periods. Mean demand (112.4 * 3 = 337.2) and standard deviation (sqrt(3) * 20.37 = 35.28) will define the initial base stock. We start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, so the OR engine will place an order to reach this level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (146 units) is in-transit and, according to the lead time definition, is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase, meaning it will first be visible and available for sale in Period 4 (after Period 3's conclude message). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have missed demand in Period 1 (112 units) due to starting with 0 inventory. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows Period 1: 112, Period 2: 111, Period 3: 80, Period 4: 129, Period 5: 130. Averaging these 5 periods gives a mean of 112.4. Since we have no reason to suspect a regime shift yet, I will use the 'default' method which utilizes all available samples. Setting L to 'default' (2) implies the OR engine will target a base stock covering (1+2)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. From the history, we have placed two orders: 146 units in Period 1 and 143 units in Period 2 (Total In-Transit: 289). The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during the Period 3 arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. Thus, the current on-hand inventory of 0 is expected. Demand for the first two periods was 112 and 109, which aligns closely with the provided historical samples (112, 111). I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the initial baseline mean of ~112. Since no orders have concluded yet, I will use the 'default' lead time of 2. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to account for the initial variability seen in the first few samples.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (146 units) was expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution and become visible in Period 3's conclude message. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. Consequently, on-hand inventory remains 0, and all demand (356 units total over three periods) has been lost. In-transit inventory is 336 (orders from P1, P2, P3: 146+143+47). Demand history shows ~110-135 units/period. Until a shipment actually arrives, I will extend the lead time estimate to 3 to account for the delay seen with the P1 order and use the mean of the available 5 demand samples (avg ~112) to set expectations for the OR backend.

Daily Profit: $145.00, Daily Holding Cost: $48.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first results of the supply chain. Demand has been relatively stable but slightly increasing: 112, 109, 135, 145 (mean ~125). Lead times are unstable: Period 1's order took 3 periods (promised 2), while Period 3's order arrived in just 1 period. Currently, we have 48 on-hand and 286 in-transit (orders from P2 and P4). Given the holding cost vs profit ratio (1:1), the target service level is 50%, suggesting a lean inventory approach. However, the lead-time variability (1 to 3 periods) poses a risk of stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for demand to capture the recent upward trend and 'calculate' for lead time to average the observed variance. This balances the need to cover expected demand over the lead time while acknowledging the jitter in arrivals.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). History shows significant lead time variability: Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods (L=3), while Period 3 order arrived in 1 period (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. The most recent order (Period 5) has not arrived yet. Since L varies, I will use 'calculate' for L to average observed performance. For demand (mu_hat), the last 5 periods show a mean of ~113.4 units/period [(112+109+135+145+66)/5]. However, demand dropped to 66 in Period 5. Given the high volatility and stockouts in P1-P3 (where sold=0 due to 0 inventory), I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full sample variance and mean across all 5 periods (mean ~113.4, std ~30.9). This ensures the OR backend uses all available data to set a base stock that accounts for the observed variability in both supply and demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. Current On-hand inventory is 0. History shows a major stockout because arrivals have been inconsistent. Promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), giving an average of 2. For Period 6's conclude, demand was 144, but sales were 0 due to 0 inventory. Historical demand samples: 112, 109, 135, 145, 66, 144. The mean demand is approx 118.5 units. Total In-transit is 452 units (from orders in P2, P4, P5, P6). Since P1 (ordered P1, arrived P4) took 3 periods, the P2 order (143 units) is overdue or expected this period. To stabilize, I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to account for the variance. For mu_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent higher demand volatility (excluding the anomaly in P5). For sigma_hat, I'll use 'default' to ensure a safety buffer given the stockout history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that lead times are volatile: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P4 arrived in 3 periods, suggesting an average lead time closer to 2.33 periods rather than the promised 2. Demand is relatively stable but high variance, with recent samples (P4-P7) averaging 120.75 compared to the earlier samples. We have 15 units on-hand and 347 in-transit (orders from P2, P5, P6, P7). The P2 order (143 units) is significantly overdue (7 periods since order), suggesting it may be lost. If P2 is lost, our effective pipeline is 204 units (ordered P5-P7). Given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we target the median of demand over the lead time. Because of the high risk of stockouts seen in history and the uncertainty of the P2 shipment, I will use 'calculate' for lead time to capture the actual average and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture recent volatility while smoothing the low demand outlier in Period 5.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: Mean actual lead time is 2.33 periods (Range 1-3). Potential lost shipment: Period 2 order (143 units) has not arrived after 7 periods.

Daily Profit: $97.00, Daily Holding Cost: $111.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the order from Period 2 (143 units) is effectively lost as it has surpassed the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods by 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 287, but calculating based on known history, this includes: Period 6 (11 units), Period 8 (133 units), and the lost Period 2 (143 units). Therefore, my effective pipeline is only 144 units. To compensate the OR backend which sees 287 in-transit, I will set 'L' to 'explicit' at 3 (the upper bound of observed reliable delivery) and 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the lost 143 units. The demand mean over the last 8 periods is ~117 units. For L=3, the target base stock (calculated as (1+L)*mean + safety) would normally be around 468 + safety. By providing an explicit mu_hat higher than actual demand, I force the order logic to ignore the 'ghost' inventory from Period 2. mu_hat target = [(1+L) * mean] + lost_units = [4 * 117] + 143 = 611. Sigma is set to recent_N=8 to capture volatility.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (143 units) confirmed lost after 7 periods; effective pipeline excludes these units. Actual lead time mean shifted to 2.33 with high variance (1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-8.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 10. Reviewing the history: The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times are [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1], averaging 2.0 periods, though highly volatile. The Period 2 order (143 units) is confirmed lost, as it has not arrived for 8 periods. The 'In-transit' figure is 351, which likely consists of the lost P2 order (143), the P6 order (11), the P9 order (197), and potentially P7 (though history shows P7 arrived in P8). Checking: P6 (11) + P9 (197) + Lost P2 (143) = 351. This matches the system's 'In-transit' exactly. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit) to subtract from the base stock target, the presence of the 143 lost units will cause the system to under-order by 143 units. To compensate, I will use the 'explicit' method for L to provide a slightly higher safety buffer for lead-time volatility and set mu_hat explicitly to account for the pipeline deficit. Average demand over 9 periods is (112+109+135+145+66+144+128+97+118)/9 = 117. As the loss of 143 units is a one-time pipeline 'hole', I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*Mean + Lost_Units to force the OR backend to refill the gap. L=2, Mean=117, Lost=143 -> mu_hat = 3*117 + 143 = 494.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand across periods 1-10 averages 111.9 units per period. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this baseline. Lead time is highly volatile (observed: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1), with an average of 2.0 periods. However, the Period 2 order (143 units) is confirmed lost, leaving a gap in the supply chain. The current pipeline inventory (368) includes the Period 9 order (197) and Period 10 order (17). I will set L=2 (calculate method) to align with observed averages while acknowledging the high variance. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 10 periods to stabilize forecasts after early volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 115 units per period. The pipeline inventory is currently 368 units (sum of orders from P6: 11, P9: 197, P10: 17, and P11: 0, plus potentially the lost P2 order if the system still counts it). However, using the conclude messages, we see that the P4 order arrived, P5 arrived, P7 arrived, and P8 arrived. Orders from P6 (11 units), P9 (197 units), and P10 (17 units) are still in transit. The P2 order (143 units) is confirmed lost. The actual lead time (L) has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.33. To protect against this volatility and the current 0 on-hand inventory, I will set L to 2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering, but increase mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the recent high demand (avg ~110-120). Setting L=2 in the OR backend effectively asks it to cover (2+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility with no clear seasonal trend, averaging 106 units over the last 12 periods. The lead time situation remains unstable; while the promised lead time is 2, the actual observed lead times are 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, and 2 periods (mean 2.125). Importantly, the Period 2 order (143 units) is confirmed lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 196 units is misleading. The effective pipeline is 196 - 143 = 53 units (consisting of the Period 11 order of 0, Period 12 order of 42, and potentially parts of older orders if they haven't converged). However, looking at the history: P10 arrived in P12, P9 arrived in P12. The only remaining active in-transit should be P12's 42 units. To compensate for the lost shipment and lead-time volatility (max observed 3), I will set L to 3. I will use the mean of the last 7 samples (average ~90) for mu_hat to capture the recent lower demand trend while maintaining a safe buffer given high holding costs and lost sales risks. Setting L=3 and using recent demand (N=7) helps the OR backend correctly estimate the base stock needed to cover the prolonged arrival window.

Carry-over insight: Refined lead time profile: Mean 2.125, Range 1-3. Effective pipeline adjustment required due to lost P2 shipment (143 units). Recent demand (P6-P12) avg 91.1 vs overall avg 106.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe a sustained demand regime shift. Since Period 6, demand has averaged approximately 95 units (P6-P13), contrasting with the earlier average of 122 units (P1-P5). This represents a roughly 22% drop. I will use recent_N (N=8) for demand parameters to reflect this lower regime. Regarding logistics, the Period 2 order (143 units) is officially lost, as 12 periods have passed since it was placed. This means the 'In-transit' figure of 309 contains 143 phantom units that will never arrive. The actual pipeline is 166 units (P12 order: 42, P13 order: 113, and likely a very late P6 order: 11). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.125. However, the OR engine lacks awareness of the lost shipment. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering (thinking the 143 units will arrive), I will set L to 'explicit' at 3.0. This increases the base stock target, effectively compensating for the pipeline gap created by the lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 6: Mean decreased from ~122 to ~95 (-22%). N=8 is now used for forecasting. Period 2 order (143 units) is permanently lost; pipeline must be adjusted by using a higher L or manual offset.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 15. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand shifted around Period 6 from ~122 to ~95. The last 9 periods (P6-P14) have an average demand of 98.2. I will use N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains volatile (Mean ~2, Range 1-3). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (143 units) is lost, but it's still counted in the 'In-transit' figure of 432. The OR backend uses the formula: final order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline). Since the pipeline includes 143 phantom units that will never arrive, the backend will under-order by exactly 143 units unless I adjust. To compensate, I will set L to 'explicit' value of 4 (instead of the mean of ~2). Increasing L raises the target base_stock (which is based on (1+L)), adding enough units to the target to offset the 143-unit hole in the pipeline without requiring an manual internal bypass. This ensures we don't stock out due to the lost shipment while the backend still thinks it's coming.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system faces a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. The Period 2 order (143 units) is confirmed lost, effectively reducing the functional pipeline from the reported 499 units to 356 units (499 - 143). The backend OR engine, unaware of this loss, subtracts the full 499 from the target base stock, leading to under-ordering. To correct this, I am setting L to 3.0 (explicit) to reflect the recent maximum observed lead time and to widen the safety window. The demand regime shift identified at Period 6 (mean ~95) remains stable; I will use N=10 (covering P6-P15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the forecast captures this lower volume period while providing enough buffer to recover from the stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 17. The demand regime shifted around Period 6 from a mean of ~122 to ~94.2. I am using N=11 (Periods 6-16) to calculate the current demand forecast. Current on-hand inventory is 7. The recorded 'In-transit' of 386 includes the lost Period 2 order (143 units), which significantly skews the OR backend's order logic. To compensate for the 143 phantom units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. My target base stock is (L+1) * mean + z*sigma. Using mean=94.2, L=2.1 (from history), and z=0 (since profit=holding cost, q=0.5, z=0), the target base stock is (3.1 * 94.2) \u2248 292. However, because the backend subtracts the pipeline (386 units), it will place no orders unless the target base stock is > 386. To force an order that covers current demand despite the 143 lost units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. Adjusted base stock goal = 292 + 143 = 435. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=11) to capture the current volatility.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift at Period 6 is well-established, with the mean dropping from ~122 to ~97 over the last 12 periods (P6-P17). I will use recent_N=12 to capture this lower volume accurately. The lead time continues to be volatile and biased towards 3 periods (Recent observed: 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3). The average observed lead time is approximately 2.4. I choose an explicit L=2.4 to account for this drift and to help clear the phantom pipeline units from the lost Period 2 shipment. Total on-hand (47) and in-transit (305) includes 143 units from the lost P2 order, meaning the effective pipeline is only 162 units. By using L=2.4 and recent demand samples, the OR algorithm will aim for a base stock levels that covers approximately 3.4 periods of demand (~330 units), which reconciles the deficit caused by the lost shipment.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' quantity is reported as 309, but based on the Carry-Over Insights, 143 units from the Period 2 order are permanently lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 166 units (309 - 143). The demand regime shift identified at Period 6 persists; the mean demand since Period 6 (excluding stockouts where demand was higher than recorded sales) is approximately 95 units per period. Using N=13 for mu_hat (covering the regime from P6 to P18) ensures we capture this lower demand level. Observed lead times provide a mean of approximately 2.33 periods (Range 1-3). Since the OR backend uses a base stock policy (L+1) * mean, setting L to an explicit value of 3 accounts for the higher lead time volatility and protects against stockouts seen in P11, P14, P15, and P18. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*Mean = (1+3)*95 = 380. sigma_hat is set to roughly sqrt(4)*std, which with a std of ~25 results in 50.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is depleted (on-hand: 0). The in-transit pipeline (380 units) includes 143 units from the Period 2 order, which is confirmed lost as it is now 18 periods overdue. This creates a phantom inventory problem for the OR backend. To compensate, I will use an 'explicit' lead time L=4. Although the observed mean lead time is ~2.3, setting L higher (closer to 4) forces the OR backend to target a higher inventory level, effectively offsetting the 143 units of dead pipeline without needing an 'explicit' order quantity. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 6. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (P6 to P19) to capture this mean (approx 98.4/period) while ignoring the early higher-demand periods. For volatility, N=14 will also be used to reflect the current regime's standard deviation. This strategy aims to replenish stock quickly to cover upcoming demand while correcting for the lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Lost Period 2 order (143 units) persists in 'In-transit' count; parameters must be adjusted to ignore these units in the pipeline. Demand regime (P6-P19) stable at mean ~98.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 6 with a mean of approximately 98 units per period. Based on the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, implying we should aim for the median demand. A critical factor is the 'ghost' inventory: the Period 2 order of 143 units is permanently lost but still included in the system's in-transit count (520 total units). To compensate for these phantom units without the OR engine knowing, I must artificially inflate the perceived target inventory. By increasing the Lead Time (L) parameter to 4 (actual average is ~2.3), the backend's base stock calculation (mu_hat) will cover more periods of demand, effectively neutralizing the 143-unit deficit in the pipeline. I am using recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift demand stability from Period 6 onwards.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable with a mean of approximately 98 units per period (N=16 since Period 6). The primary operational challenge is the phantom 'In-transit' inventory: 143 units from the Period 2 order are confirmed lost, and several recent orders (P19=71, P20=140) are still within the volatile lead time window (mean ~2.1 periods, max 3). Current in-transit is 520 units; subtracting the 143 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 377 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the phantom inventory, I will explicitly set L = 3. This increases the base stock target (covers 4 periods of demand instead of 3). With mu_hat (1+L) * 98 = 392 and sigma_hat at ~50 (sqrt(4) * 25), the backend will see the effective pipeline of 377 as lower than the target, triggering replenishment. On-hand is zero, so rapid arrival is critical.

Recent arrivals (Periods 12-17) show an actual lead time mean of approximately 3.0 periods, which is longer than the promised 2. To account for the lost stock and the longer arrival delay, I am setting L to 3. The demand regime from Period 6 onwards has stabilized at a mean of ~98. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=17 (P6 to P22) to capture this mean accurately. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=17) to reflect the current volatility (std ~22-25 range). By setting L=3, the OR backend's target base stock (calculated as (1+L)*demand) will increase to cover 4 periods (392 units), which, when matched against the inflated 'In-transit' count (520), prevents the engine from under-ordering due to the phantom 143 units while bridging the gap created by the current stockout.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in a stable lower regime established around Period 6 (mean ~97). I am using recent_N (N=18) to capture demand statistics since that shift. The target critical fractile is 0.5 (Profit=1, Holding=1), but the inventory position is heavily distorted by the lost Period 2 order of 143 units which remains in 'In-transit' as a ghost value. Current On-hand is 46, and In-transit is 380. The 380 includes the lost 143 units (P2) and several potentially overdue/delayed units from recent periods (P15 order of 109, P17 order of 42, P18 order of 4, P19 order of 71). To compensate for the 143 phantom units in the backend's calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate the mu_hat. Expected lead time is consistently 3 periods based on recent history (P20 arrived at P23). Setting L to explicit 3 to ensure the backend covers the appropriate lead time + review window (4 periods total). Expected demand over 4 periods is ~388 plus 143 units to offset the lost P2 order, totaling ~531.

Carry-over insight: In-transit mismatch confirmed: 143 units from Period 2 are permanently lost but still count towards pipeline inventory in the OR backend. Explicit mu_hat or L must be used to offset this 143-unit deficit.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 6 to a lower mean; the average demand from Period 6 to Period 24 is approximately 98.4 units per period. The primary issue remains the 143 units ordered in Period 2 which are permanently lost but still included in the backend 'In-transit' (pipeline) calculation (In-transit: 485 includes these 143 units). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to covering expected demand for (L+1) periods (where L=2), plus an offset of 143 units to negate the impact of the lost shipment: (1+2) * 98.4 + 143 \u2248 438. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed average (approx 2.4 periods). Sigma_hat uses the standard deviation of the recent regime (last 18 periods, approx 21.5) scaled for L=2: sqrt(3) * 21.5 \u2248 37.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a mean of approximately 98 (P6-P25). However, a critical supply chain issue persists: 143 units ordered in Period 2 are permanently lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (485 units). The backend logic 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' overestimates available units by 143, leading to consistent stockouts (on-hand is 0, ending inventory has been 0 for the last two periods). To correct this, I must artificially inflate the base_stock by 143 units. Target Base Stock = (1 + L) * mu_hat + z * sigma_hat. Using recent demand mean ~99 and L=3 (most common actual lead time), base_stock without correction \u2248 4 * 99 = 396. Adding 143 units to offset the 'ghost' inventory gives a target mu_hat value. Calculating explicitly: Target Base Stock = (4 * 99) + 143 = 539. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 539 and L to 3. This forces the system to order despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 539 units in-transit. Crucially, this total includes a 143-unit order from Period 2 that has never arrived (25 periods late) and is effectively lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (539) from the target base stock, it will under-order by 143 units unless compensated. Demand has been stable since Period 6 with a mean of ~96.5. To offset the 143-unit 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the target mu_hat for an L=2 (3 periods of coverage) as 96.5 * 3 = 289.5, and then ADD the 143-unit deficit to this value: 289.5 + 143 = 432.5. This forces the backend to order the units actually needed. I set L=3 to reflect the high frequency of 3-period lead times (recent orders P13, P14, P20 all took 3 periods), though the backend formula uses L+1 for base stock, the explicit mu_hat override is our primary tool for pipeline correction.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 539 units. However, we have a confirmed lost shipment of 143 units from Period 2 that has never arrived and is unlikely to arrive. This artificially inflates the pipeline inventory viewed by the OR backend. To compensate, I must set mu_hat to a value that accounts for this 143-unit deficit plus the expected demand for the (L+1) period (roughly 3 periods). Demand since Period 6 has stabilized around a mean of 98.7 units. With an average lead time drifting towards 2.5-3 periods, I will set L=3. The expected demand over L+1 (4 periods) is approximately 395 units. To offset the 143 lost units in the pipeline, I use mu_hat = 395 + 143 = 538. Sigma_hat is calculated for 4 periods based on a per-period standard deviation of ~19 (sqrt(4) * 19 = 38).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 485 units currently reported as 'In-transit'. However, 143 units from the Period 2 order are confirmed lost (not arrived after 26 periods) but still counted in the OR backend's pipeline inventory. This results in a persistent 143-unit deficit. The current in-transit (excluding the lost shipment) consists of orders from P24 (105 units) and potentially unprocessed logic from P25-P28. Demand has been stable since Period 6 with a mean of approximately 98 units per period. Lead times are volatile, averaging 2.33 periods (Range 1-3). To compensate for the 143-unit ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock based on (L+1) periods of demand plus the 143-unit offset. With L=2.33 (rounded to 2 for OR logic), target demand coverage for L+1 (3 periods) is 98 * 3 = 294. Adding the 143-unit offset results in a mu_hat of 437. This forces the backend to increase the order size to account for the lost stock it thinks we still have.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for Period 30 is critical: On-hand is 0, and we have experienced a significant stockout recently. The persistent 'In-transit' count of 485 units is misleading because it includes 143 units from Period 2 that are permanently lost. The actual pipeline contains only 342 valid units (485 - 143). Based on the Carry-Over Insights, the demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 6 at a mean of ~98, but the last 5 periods (P25-P29) show a slight uptick to an average of ~114 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover for the lost 143 units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. This mu_hat is calculated to cover the expected demand for the lead time (L=2) and the current review period (Total 3 periods), plus an offset of 143 units to negate the 'phantom' pipeline stock. Calculation: (Avg Demand 105 * 3) + 143 = 458. This effectively forces the system to treat the pipeline as if the lost units don't exist. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=15) to capture recent volatility without excessive sensitivity to outliers.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' count of 485 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 143 units from the Period 2 order are permanently lost but still included in the backend Pipeline Inventory (which is On-hand + In-transit). This creates a critical deficit that must be addressed to force the OR backend to order sufficient stock. The demand mean from Period 6 to Period 30 is approximately 98.6 units. To protect against the stockout risk caused by the 143-unit phantom inventory and the high lead-time volatility (range 1-3 periods, mean ~2.4), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory Pos = (L+1)*Forecast + SS. With L=3 (to be conservative) and mean=100, we need ~400 units. To offset the -143 unit real pipeline deficit, I will set mu_hat to 550 (approx 400 + 150 offset) to trigger an immediate replenishment order. sigma_hat is set to 50 (sqrt(4)*std of ~25) to maintain a healthy safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: In-transit ghost units (143 from P2) continue to suppress ordering; manual mu_hat inflation is required until stock levels stabilize.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 550 units reported as in-transit. However, 143 units from the Period 2 order are permanently lost, making the effective pipeline 407 units. The OR backend uses the reported 550 units, which leads it to believe we have more stock coming than we actually do, resulting in under-ordering and stockouts. Recent demand (P6-P31) has stabilized around a mean of 98.7. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 'ghost' inventory of 143 units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) period coverage (L=2, so 3 periods), which is approximately 98.7 * 3 = 296 units. To offset the 143-unit pipeline deficit, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately 143 units. Setting mu_hat to 440 (approx 297 + 143) provides sufficient base stock to trigger an order that fills the gap created by the lost shipment.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a critical inventory deficit due to a combination of high demand volatility and a 'ghost' in-transit shipment. Specifically, 143 units ordered in Period 2 are permanently lost but still occupy pipeline capacity in the OR backend's logic (In-transit: 485 units includes these 143 lost units). Recent demand (Periods 25-32) has reverted to a higher mean of ~110 units/period after a lower-demand phase. Lead times remain unstable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. To force the OR backend to order despite the inflated 'ghost' pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I estimate target inventory (Base Stock) to cover 4 periods (L=3 + 1) at a mean of 110 units (440 units), then add 143 units to negate the lost shipment's impact on the pipeline calculation. Total target mu_hat = 440 + 143 = 583. This will trigger a replenishment order to restore on-hand inventory which is currently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean for Periods 25-32 has increased to ~110 units, up from the ~95 units observed in the Period 6-24 regime. Ghost units (143 from P2) remain in the pipeline count, requiring sustained mu_hat inflation.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 583 units, but 143 of these (from Period 2) are confirmed permanently lost. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit count from the calculated base stock. To compensate for this 143-unit 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive, I must manually inflate the mu_hat parameter. The current demand regime (Periods 25-33) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 109 units (118, 85, 121, 124, 122, 94, 102, 114, 101). The promised lead time is 2, and the average observed lead time remains slightly above 2. My target base stock calculation: (1 + L) * mu + offset. With L=2 and mu=109, the base stock would be 3 * 109 = 327. Adding the 143 offset results in 470. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat [Value: 470] and sigma_hat [Value: 30, based on recent volatility] to force the OR engine to place an order that overcomes the pipeline deficit and addresses the current 0 on-hand inventory.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a critical stock-out environment with 0 on-hand inventory. Two factors drive this: 1) The 'ghost' inventory of 143 units from Period 2 that are permanently lost but still reflect in the 'In-transit' count (583 units total in-transit), causing the OR backend to under-order. 2) A demand regime shift around Period 25, where demand increased from a mean of ~98 to ~110. To compensate for the 143 units of fake pipeline inventory, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter. Using the current regime (P25-P34), the mean demand is ~109. With a lead time L of 2, the standard mu_hat would be (1+2)*109 = 327. Adding the 143-unit offset to neutralize the ghost units results in a required mu_hat of 470. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 470 and use a recent_N sigma_hat (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 583 units, which includes 143 ghost units from Period 2 that are permanently lost. Additionally, orders from P15 (109), P17 (42), P18 (4), P19 (71), P24 (105), P33 (98), and potentially P11 (0) are being reconciled. Historical lead times show high variance (1-3 periods, mean ~2.1 periods), and several older orders (P15 onwards) seem potentially lost or extremely delayed, suggesting a significant lead-time drift or system failure. On-hand inventory is 0 and has been consistently low/zero for several periods. Demand remains stable around 100-110 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the (inflated) pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' methods to ensure an order is triggered. To recover from the current zero-stock situation and offset the 143-unit ghost inventory plus at least 200 units of likely lost shipments (P15-P24), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the pipeline deficit. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the realized upper bound of arrival times.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability persists: multiple orders between P15 and P24 (totaling approx 330 units) are now highly suspect as lost, compounding the P2 (143 unit) loss. Total ghost pipeline inventory is likely ~470+ units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe inventory crisis due to 'ghost' in-transit units. Currently, 'In-transit' displays 843 units, yet On-hand is 0 and many orders are significantly overdue. Specifically, orders from P2 (143 units), P15 (109 units), P17 (42 units), P18 (4 units), P19 (71 units), and P24 (105 units) are long overdue and likely lost. This totals roughly 474 units that the OR backend incorrectly counts as 'in-transit', preventing it from placing necessary new orders. Furthermore, demand has shifted upwards recently (P25-P36 avg: 107) compared to the previous regime (avg: 98). To override the backend's suppression of orders caused by the 474 ghost units, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat to artificially inflate the base stock requirement. A target base stock to cover L+1 (3) periods of demand plus a safety margin would be approx 110 * 3 + 100 = 430. To force an order while the backend subtracts 843 ghost units, I must set mu_hat high enough that [mu_hat - 843] results in a meaningful order. I set mu_hat to 1200 to ensure the backend triggers an order to replenish the zero on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed 'ghost' pipeline units increased to ~474 (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Demand regime (P25-P36) stabilized at mean ~107 (+9% vs previous regime).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38, we have an on-hand inventory of 170 units, but a significantly inflated 'In-transit' count of 930 units. Based on historical data, approximately 474 units are confirmed 'ghost' units from lost shipments (Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 24) that the OR backend erroneously includes in its pipeline calculation. If left uncorrected, these ghost units will prevent the system from placing necessary orders, leading to stockouts. The current demand regime (Periods 33-37) is stable at a mean of 99 units. Since the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine the order quantity, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target level by the 474 ghost units to offset the deficit. mu_hat is set to (1 + L) * mean_demand + ghost_units = (1 + 2) * 99 + 474 = 771 units. Sigma is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 'In-transit' inventory of 930 units. However, my 'Carry-over Insight' analysis confirms that at least 474 units are permanently lost (ghost units from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Consequently, the OR backend perceives a healthy pipeline of ~930 units (on-hand 77 + in-transit 930 = 1007), whereas the 'real' pipeline is only ~456 units. This discrepancy prevents the base-stock policy from placing necessary orders. To force an order and maintain stock levels, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate demand to 1000 units. This serves as a mathematical offset: by telling the OR backend that demand is much higher, I counter-act the ghost inventory that is suppressing the order calculation. This value (1000) is calculated to ensure the backend sees a requirement that exceeds the ghost-heavy pipeline. For lead time (L), I am using 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (mean ~2.1 periods), and for sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=14 (P25-P38) to capture the current volatility of the stable ~100 unit demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost units in pipeline confirmed at ~474 units. This creates a persistent 474-unit deficit in the OR backend's inventory calculation. Order triggering now requires significant mu_hat inflation until ghost units are cleared or offset.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we face a critical inventory situation: on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 39 demand exceeded available stock. The 'In-transit' count is 930 units, but our analysis confirms that approximately 474 of these units are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) that will never arrive. The true pipeline is about 456 units (930 total - 474 ghost). Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~107 units (P25-P39). The OR backend uses the full 930 in-transit units in its calculation (base_stock - pipeline), so to trigger the necessary order for the upcoming periods (given a volatile lead time of 1-3 periods), we must inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset the 474-unit deficit. Calculation: Target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods is roughly 107 * 3 = 321. With the backend seeing 930 in-transit, we need to set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 930' provides a sufficient safety level. We use an explicit mu_hat of 1200 to counteract the ghost pipeline and ensure the order cap allows for replenishing the 170-unit deficit plus current demand.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P25-P40) is stable with a mean of approximately 105 units. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline units. Total in-transit units are reported at 1200, which includes the 474 units confirmed lost (Period 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24). Additionally, orders from P33 (98 units), P37 (347 units), and P40 (270 units) are currently in-transit. P33 is now 7 periods late and is likely lost, bringing the total ghost inventory to 572 units. The OR backend subtracts the full 1200 in-transit from the base stock calculation, significantly under-ordering unless mu_hat is inflated. To compensate for the 572-unit deficit over a standard (L+1)=3 period lookback, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (105 * 3) + (1.645 * 15 * sqrt(3)) \u2248 315 + 43 = 358. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 1200 'in-transit' units, mu_hat must be set to cover the target stock plus the ghost units. Total adjusted mu_hat = 358 + 572 = 930. This ensures the OR logic (Order = mu_hat - pipeline) generates a real order to reach the desired on-hand target.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost pipeline units increased to ~572 (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and now P33). Demand regime remains stable at ~105 units. Large orders from P37 and P40 are the only viable units in the current pipeline.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently plagued by a massive discrepancy between the reported 'In-transit' count (1200 units) and actual viable shipments. As of Period 41, the ghost units (lost shipments that never arrived but still count towards the OR pipeline) sum to approximately 572 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P33). This is confirmed because their promised lead time (2) has passed by a significant margin (some by over 30 periods). In Period 42, on-hand inventory is 0. The 1200 'In-transit' units primarily consist of these 572 ghost units plus large orders from P37 (347 units), P40 (270 units), and P36 (already arrived). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1200 from its target stock, it will not place an order unless mu_hat is massively inflated. Demand has stabilized at roughly 100 units per period. To trigger recruitment of actual stock and overcome the 572-unit deficit while accounting for a target base stock of ~400 (roughly 4 periods of demand), mu_hat is set explicitly to 1000. This ensures the backend sees (1000 - 1200) as still needing a cap-limited order, preventing stockouts caused by accounting ghosts.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost pipeline units confirmed at ~572 (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P33). These orders have exceeded promised lead time by 5-35 periods. Manual mu_hat inflation is required to force the OR backend to ignore these units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the SKU chips(Regular) has 0 on-hand inventory and 1200 units in-transit. However, historical analysis of the 'In-transit' count reveals a critical structural issue: a total of 572 units are permanently lost shipments that still count towards the pipeline (ghost units). These include orders from P2 (143), P15 (109), P17 (42), P18 (4), P19 (71), P24 (105), and P33 (98). The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 1200 - 572 = 628 units (primarily the P37, P40, and any subsequent recent orders). Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 105 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' count, I will use an explicit mu_hat value. A standard target for a 3-period lead time window (L+1=4) would be ~420 units. To bypass the 572 ghost units, mu_hat is set to 1500, forcing the order generation logic to account for the deficit and replenish on-hand stock, which has been depleted for 3 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44. Reviewing the history, the 'ghost' pipeline units (lost orders that the OR backend still counts) have reached a total of 572 units. These include orders from P2 (143), P15 (109), P17 (42), P18 (4), P19 (71), P24 (105), and P33 (98). These orders are all significantly past the observed lead time range (1-3 periods). Because the OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline' from the target base stock, it will fail to place new orders unless we artificially inflate the demand parameter (mu_hat). The current demand regime is stable at approximately 105 units per period. With a lead time L=2 (implied 3 periods coverage: current + 2 lead), base stock should be ~315 units plus a safety buffer. However, with 572 ghost units in the way, the backend thinks we have double our required stock. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to cover the actual demand plus the specific deficit. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 920 (approx 350 for target base stock + 570 to offset ghost units) to ensure the system maintains a healthy on-hand balance as we approach the final periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The OR backend remains hindered by a cumulative 572-unit 'ghost' pipeline (orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P33 that never arrived). With an current 'In-transit' count of 1230, the true actionable pipeline is only 658 units (1230 - 572). The current on-hand inventory is 56. Demand is stable in a regime starting at P25 with a mean of approximately 101 units. To prevent stockouts caused by the backend underestimating the need due to these ghost units, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to cover 4 periods (L=3 + 1) at 101 units/period plus a safety buffer, then add the 572 units to offset the pipeline error. Target mu_hat = (101 * 4) + 572 = 976. This will force the backend to place an order that restores the actual physical inventory to sufficient levels despite the inflated in-transit data.

Daily Profit: $99.00, Daily Holding Cost: $257.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-158.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The focus remains on managing the significant inventory deficit created by 'ghost' units in the pipeline. These are orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P33) totaling 572 units that have never arrived and are long past their lead times, yet they still count toward the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation. Demand has stabilized in a regime starting around Period 37 with a mean of ~100 units. To maintain on-hand inventory and offset the 572-unit ghost pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat significantly. The current on-hand inventory is 257, and the in-transit is 930 (which includes the 572 ghost units). Subtracting ghosts, the true in-transit is 358 units. To ensure the backend places orders despite the inflated in-transit count, I will set mu_hat to a value that covers the expected demand over (L+1) periods PLUS the ghost units deficit. Using L=3, demand for 4 periods is ~400 units. Adding the 572 ghost units results in a target mu_hat of approximately 972. This forces the base stock calculation high enough to trigger new orders as lead times fluctuate.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost pipeline units confirmed at ~572 (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P33). These units are effectively lost but suppress automated ordering unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset the deficit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-19.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a mean of approximately 105 units (based on the last 20+ periods). However, the critical issue is the 'ghost' pipeline inventory totaling 572 units from periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 33. These units are effectively lost or permanently delayed but still subtracted from the base stock calculation by the OR backend. With a current on-hand inventory of 138 and a reported 'In-transit' of 930, the OR backend believes there are 1,068 units available to meet demand, which is far above any reasonable base stock level. To force an order and maintain stock levels for the final 3 periods, I must use 'mu_hat' inflation. The required base stock to cover L+1 periods (approx 3 periods) at 105 units/period is ~315 units. To overcome the 572-unit pipeline distortion, I set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired base stock and the ghost units (315 + 572 = 887). This ensures the backend triggers an order despite the false inventory counts. Lead time L is set to 2 (promised) to capture the standard delivery window for the remaining periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 48, the system reports 39 units on-hand and 930 units in-transit. However, historical analysis confirms a massive accumulation of 'ghost' inventory\u2014orders that are effectively lost but still count towards the pipeline in the OR backend. These include Period 2 (143), Period 15 (109), Period 17 (42), Period 18 (4), Period 19 (71), Period 24 (105), and Period 33 (98), totaling 572 units. The 'true' pipeline is approximately 358 units (including the P37 order of 347 which has been delayed significantly - 11 periods since ordering). Demand is stable around 105 units. To force an order despite the 572 ghost units, mu_hat must be inflated. The base stock calculation is (1+L)*mu. With L=2, the backend uses 3*mu. To offset a 572-unit deficit, mu_hat needs to be inflated by 572/3 = 190.6 additional units per period. Average demand 105 + 191 = 296. Setting mu_hat to (1+2)*296 = 888. This will counteract the ghost pipeline and ensure sufficient stock for the final 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. The game ends after Period 50's demand resolution. Any order placed now in Period 49 with the promised lead time of 2 periods will arrive during Period 51's arrival phase, which is after the game ends. Therefore, no new orders should be placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is approximately 105 units/period. There is a massive 'In-transit' balance of 930 units. Based on historical data, approximately 572 units are 'ghost' units (lost shipments from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 33). The remaining ~358 units in the pipeline are likely from more recent orders; however, since no order can arrive in time to satisfy Period 49 or Period 50 demand, the optimal strategy for the final periods is to set parameters that prevent new ordering to maximize profit and minimize ending inventory holding costs. Setting mu_hat to 0 effectively stops the OR backend from placing further orders.

Carry-over insight: End-of-game phase reached (Period 49): Lead time (2) exceeds remaining periods, so new orders cannot arrive before the game concludes.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final period of the game. Based on the rules, any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends, as the promised lead time is 2 periods and the arrival resolution for an order placed in Period 50 would occur after Period 50's demand phase. My objective is to prevent unnecessary holding costs. The Current Status shows On-hand: 0 and In-transit: 930 units. While the In-transit count is heavily inflated by 'ghost units' (approximately 572 units confirmed lost in history), there are still significant valid units in transit from Period 37 onwards. Regardless of inventory status, no new order can arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence the final reward. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure no new order is placed.
