None have arrived yet, meaning we have missed demand for 3 consecutive periods.\n3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand is roughly 110-135 units per period. Average demand is ~119. \n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation is only 9 units because it sees a massive pipeline (336 units) relative to a base stock calculation based on a lead time of 2. However, since the P1 order is overdue, we are currently stocked out. If the P1 order (146 units) arrives this period (P4), it will be fully consumed by P4 demand (~120). If it doesn't arrive, we continue to lose sales. \n5. Adjustment: I will increase the order beyond OR's 9 units to 110 units. While the pipeline is technically large (336), the delay suggests we cannot rely on the 'promised' timing.

The order from Period 2 (143 units) is confirmed lost. 2. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand inventory is 103 units.

Demand Analysis: Demand has fluctuated between 66 and 145, with a recent average around 117. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely due to the large in-transit pipeline (418 units) relative to recent demand. However, given the high risk of lost shipments (P2 was lost) and lead-time volatility, relying solely on the pipeline is risky. The 418 units in-transit includes the P6 order (150 units) which has now reached lead_time=3; if it doesn't arrive in the next period's conclusion, it is likely lost. Excluding the potentially lost P6 order, the pipeline is 268 units. With 103 on-hand, total coverage is 371. At an average demand of ~120, this covers roughly 3 periods.

Genuine pipeline is approximately 193 units (from Periods 9 and 10), though Period 10's order isn't visible in the history yet, the in-transit field shows 343 which equals Period 6 (150) + Period 9 (50) + Period 10 (?). Actually, looking at the history: In-transit of 343 = Period 6 (150) + Period 9 (50) + Period 10 unknown. Wait, the current status 'In-transit: 343' represents shipments not yet arrived.

Current realistic total = 100 (on-hand) + 235 (pipeline) = 335. 5.

The 'In-transit' display shows 758 units, but historical analysis from 'Carry-over Insights' confirms that 648 of these units are effectively lost (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, and P19). Consequently, the actual reliable pipeline consists only of orders from P24 (50 units) and P25 (60 units), totaling 110 units. Total effective inventory (on-hand + reliable pipeline) is 176 + 110 = 286 units. Given the lead time (L) is effectively 2-3 periods, we must cover demand for approximately 3-4 periods (L+1). Recent average demand has stabilized near 100 units per period. Therefore, we need a base stock level of approximately 400 units (100 units * 4 periods). With 286 units effectively available, a deficit of 114 units exists. The OR recommendation of 0 is ignored as it likely calculates based on the full 758-unit phantom pipeline.
