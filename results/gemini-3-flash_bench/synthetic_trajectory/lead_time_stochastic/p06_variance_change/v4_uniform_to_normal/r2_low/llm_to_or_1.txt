Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available (112, 111, 80, 129, 130), averaging 112.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 19.9. Given Lead Time (L) = 2, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods to maintain service levels. Since this is the initial period with a relatively stable (though slightly fluctuating) demand history, using the available 5-period average is a sound starting point. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time to allow the backend to track actual delivery performance over time, and 'recent_N' for demand parameters using all 5 available historical samples to establish a baseline forecast.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order of 146 units placed in Period 1 is in-transit and should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (making it visible in the Period 4 start observation). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and the demand of 63 in Period 1 was lost. Demand history provided in the background (Periods 1-5: 112, 111, 80, 129, 130) suggests a mean demand around 112 units per period, which differs slightly from the Period 1 simulation demand of 63. Given the service level balance (Profit=1, Holding=1, q=0.5), the target base stock should cover the median demand over the lead time plus current period (1+L = 3 periods). Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the available historical distribution while acknowledging the start-of-game volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2. Orders placed in P1 (146 units) and P2 (152 units) are currently in-transit (total 298 units). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in the P3 conclude message (at the start of P4). Therefore, the current on-hand inventory of 0 is expected. Demand in P1 (63) and P2 (70) was lost because on-hand was 0. The historical demand data (provided in the prompt) shows P1-P5 demand as [112, 111, 80, 129, 130]. However, the 'Game History' section reports actual demand for P1 and P2 as 63 and 70 respectively. I will prioritize the 'Game History' values for the periods we have completed. Mean demand for P1-P2 is 66.5. With L=2, mu_hat should cover 3 periods of demand (1+L). Using the recent_N method with N=2 to focus on the observed game history demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order (146 units) was placed with a promised lead time of 2. According to the execution sequence, it should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This indicates a delay or deviation from the promised lead time. Combined with the 0 on-hand inventory and 298 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2), we are currently experiencing lost sales (0 sold vs demand). The demand samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) average 112.4 per period. The backend OR calculates base stock based on (1+L) periods. Given the evidence that the P1 order did not arrive by the end of P3, the actual lead time is at least 3. I will set L to 3 to ensure the pipeline covers more periods of demand. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the full recent demand history (average ~112), and for sigma_hat, I will use the default calculation. This conservative lead time adjustment helps the OR engine increase the base stock to compensate for the observed arrival delay.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for chips(Regular) exceeds promised 2 periods: Period 1 order (146 units) not arrived by end of Period 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-4.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, the Period 1 order finally arrived, revealing an actual lead time of 3 periods (rather than the promised 2). This confirms a supply chain delay. The demand over the first 5 periods has averaged 102.2 units, though it fluctuates significantly (from 63 up to 136). Given the inventory on-hand (75) and the pipeline (277), we need to set L=3 to reflect reality. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the average demand of approximately 102/period, which at L=3 results in a total mu_hat baseline of about 408 (102 * 4). Setting L=3 ensures the OR engine accounts for the longer pipeline needs, preventing premature stockouts while considering the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (a 50% service level target).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 4). Total demand average is ~102/period.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are out of stock (on-hand: 0). History shows the actual lead time is 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 4), compared to the promised 2. My primary goal is to adjust the 'L' parameter to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the extra period of lead time risk. Historical demand samples (63, 70, 136, 71, 94) average to approximately 86.8. However, the initial seeds provided (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) average 112.4. Combining these, the overall average is ~99.6. Since we just ran out of stock and the pipeline inventory is high (301 units, including orders from Periods 2, 4, and 5), the OR engine needs to see a realistic lead time. We will use L=3 and a recent demand window to reflect current consumption patterns.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual history confirms a lead time of 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 4). Current inventory is 0 with 348 units in transit. The in-transit pipeline includes orders from Period 2 (152 units), Period 4 (125 units), Period 5 (24 units), and Period 6 (47 units). Given the 3-period lead time, the Period 2 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at start of Period 6) but was not reported in Period 6's conclude message. However, Period 6 conclude shows 0 arrived, which is consistent with the 3-period delay for Period 2 (ordered P2, arrives P5, visible P6). Wait\u2014correction: Period 4 conclude showed P1 arrived (ordered P1, lead_time 3). Thus, P2 (ordered P2) should arrive in P5 (visible P6). Since Period 6 conclude showed arrived=0, and it has been 4 periods since P2 order, there is a risk of a lost shipment or further delay. Demand remains relatively stable with samples: 112, 111, 80, 129, 130, 63, 70, 136, 71, 94, 82. The mean demand is approx 98 units/period. I will set L to 3 to reflect the observed behavior and mu_hat to (1+3)*mean to ensure sufficient base stock, using recent_N=6 to capture the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Potential lost/late shipment for Period 2 order (152 units) - not arrived by end of Period 5 despite observed L=3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Analyzing the lead time history: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), and Period 4 order arrived in Period 7 (L=3). This confirms a consistent actual lead time of 3 periods, despite the promise of 2. Crucially, orders from Period 2 (152 units), Period 5 (24 units), and Period 6 (47 units) have not arrived. The Period 2 order is significantly overdue (5 periods since ordering), suggesting it is likely a lost shipment. Historical demand across 7 periods shows an average of ~92 units/period (total 645/7), but recent periods (3, 7) show spikes up to 136 and 129. To account for the confirmed L=3 and the lost P2 shipment, I am setting L to 3 explicitly. Demand (mu_hat) is projected using the recent 5 periods (avg ~102) over the L+1 window (102 * 4 = 408). Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to capture the high volatility (std ~28, sqrt(4)*28 = 56). Setting these parameters will force the OR backend to increase the base stock to compensate for the lost pipeline inventory and the extended lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Lead time consistently confirmed as 3 periods (P1->P4, P4->P7). Period 2 order (152 units) confirmed lost after 5 periods of non-arrival.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the actual lead time (L) is consistently observed as 3 periods (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8), whereas the promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 2 (152 units) is confirmed lost, as it has not arrived after 6 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and in-transit is 349 units (from P6: 47, P8: 150, and presumably a P9 order). Demand remains relatively stable around 100-110 per period. To account for the 3-period lead time, I am setting L=3 explicitly. For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N with N=5 (P4-P8 mean is ~96.4), which the backend will scale by (1+L=4) to cover the lead period plus current demand. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture historical variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-16.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data shows a significant shift in lead time behavior. While early orders (P1, P4, P5) had a lead time of 3 periods and P2 was lost, the most recent arrival (ordered P8, arrived P9 conclude) showed a lead time of 1 period. This suggests the logistics may have stabilized or accelerated. Demand has remained relatively stable, with the last 5 periods (P5-P9) averaging 95.6 units/period (94, 82, 129, 106, 67). I will set L to recent_N (N=2) to capture the shorter 1-period recent lead time while keeping the memory of the 3-period lead time to prevent stockouts if it fluctuates. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the recent average of ~96 per period. Sigma_hat is set to the same period to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility: Shifted from 3 periods (P1, P4, P5) to 1 period (observed P8 order arriving P9 conclude). Average demand over last 5 periods is ~96 units.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the inventory is depleted (on-hand: 0). Re-evaluating lead time: historical observations show three instances of L=3 (P1, P4, P5) and one recent instance of L=1 (P8 order arrived in P9 conclude). The P2 order (152 units) is confirmed lost, and the P6 order (47 units) is now 4 periods overdue, suggesting it is also lost. The pipeline inventory (236 units) consists of orders from P9 (37 units) and P10 (0 units, but note P9 order is still in-transit). The backend calculates base stock using q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which aligns with the demand mean. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to average the observed lead times (3, 3, 3, 1), resulting in an average L ~ 2.5. For demand (mu_hat), recent_N=5 captures the current regime (avg ~96). Sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: P6 order (47 units) confirmed lost after 4 periods of non-arrival despite recent L=1/3 variability.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12. Reviewing the lead-time history: P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), P4 arrived in P7 (L=3), P5 arrived in P8 (L=3), and P8 arrived in P9 (L=1). There is a pattern of lost shipments: P2 (ordered P2, never arrived) and P6 (ordered P6, never arrived). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 359 units in-transit (P9: 37 units, P11: 123, and P12 order yet to be placed). The lead time is volatile, appearing to shift between 1 and 3 periods. I will set L to 1 to match the most recent successful delivery, but use mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations based on the last 5 periods to capture the recent stable demand regime (avg ~86). Since profit/holding cost is equal ($1/$1), the backend's default service level (0.50) is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs for this high-volume SKU, though the pipeline is currently stuffed due to recent orders and high in-transit quantities.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Recent L=1 for P8 order). Demand regime has stabilized over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) with an average of ~96 units/period.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last five periods (P8-P12), averaging 83.6 units, but the broader history (P1-P12) shows a mean of approximately 88.5 units. Given the seasonality and previous demand data provided in the prompt (Avg ~112 units), I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 10 periods of internal history (~91 units) to stay conservative yet responsive. Lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P8 arrived in 1, but P9 arrived in 3). Although P11 order (123 units) which was ordered 2 periods ago hasn't arrived, a lead time of 3 is more realistic than the promised 2 based on historical evidence. I will use L=3 to account for this variability. Pipeline inventory is currently 322 (representing orders from P11, P12, and the lost P6/P2 units). Note: Since the backend subtracts pipeline inventory, and we have confirmed lost orders (P2, P6), the pipeline view is slightly inflated. Setting mu_hat explicitly allows me to ensure the order covers demand for L+1 periods despite the stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains inconsistent, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Latest: P9 arrived P12, L=3). Average demand for the last 10 periods (P3-P12) is 91 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 10 periods with an average around 91 units. Lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P8: L=1, P9: L=3). To ensure product availability while managing holding costs, I am using L=2 (the midpoint of the observed volatility) as the lead time baseline. I will set mu_hat using the last 10 samples (recent_N=10) to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 91 units/period). Sigma_hat will also be calculated based on the last 10 samples to reflect current volatility. Currently, there is an inventory shortage (on-hand is 0) despite 372 units being in-transit (P11=123, P13=50 units plus older potentially lost/late orders). The OR backend's capped policy will moderate the order size given the significant pipeline, protecting against over-ordering if multiple shipments arrive simultaneously.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit pipeline of 249 units. Examining the history, lead times for chips(Regular) are highly volatile, frequently alternating between 1 and 3 periods (observed lead times: 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3). Most recently, the P11 order arrived in P14 (L=3). Demand has stabilized; the average demand over the last 10 periods (P5-P14) is 93.9 units, and the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 93.2 units. Given the consistency of L=3 for most successful deliveries, I will explicitly set L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a 4-period window (L+1). For demand forecasting, the last 10 periods offer a stable regime, so I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use the last 10 periods to capture the current volatility while accounting for recent stockout-inducing peaks (like the 136 units in P14).

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility continues: L=3 remains the dominant actual lead time (5 out of 6 successful arrivals), though occasional L=1 occurs. Demand regime is stable around 93-94 units/period (P5-P14 avg: 93.9).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with 378 units in-transit. Historic lead times for chips(Regular) have shown significant volatility but predominantly land at 3 periods (6 out of 7 successful deliveries). The most recent arrival (P14 conclude) confirmed L=3. Period 2 and Period 6 orders are confirmed lost. Due to the high stockout frequency (on-hand 0 at start of Period 16), I am setting L to 3 to reflect the dominant actual delivery time. Demand over the last 11 periods (P5-P15) averages 90.5 units/period. I will use recent_N with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable regime while accounting for the recent variability. This configuration aims to raise the base stock level to cover the longer actual lead time and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable. Over the last 10 periods (P7-P16), the average demand is 90.8 units, which aligns with recent carry-over insights (~91-94 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 328 units in-transit (orders from P15 and P17). Lead time continues to be volatile but primarily settles at 3 periods (6 out of 7 successful deliveries arrived in 3 periods). Therefore, I am setting L=3 to account for the likely actual lead time. Using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the recent stable demand regime while filtering out the initial higher demand periods. This setting aims to recover from stockouts while being mindful of the $1 holding cost by not over-inflating the base stock beyond the observed L=3 window.

Carry-over insight: Lead time L=3 confirmed as the dominant mode (85% frequency in successful arrivals: 6/7). Demand regime remains stable with a 10-period average of 90.8 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18, we have zero on-hand inventory and 364 units in-transit. Based on the delivery history, the dominant actual lead time is 3 periods (observed in 6 out of 7 successful arrivals, including P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, and P13). Although L=1 occurred once at P8, for safety and back-end calculation, L=3 is the most reliable mode to prevent stockouts given the volatility. Total units in-transit (364) are from Period 15 (129), Period 17 (36), and a potential missing/slow shipment from Period 2 (152 units - now 16 periods old and confirmed lost in Carry-over) and likely the remainder from Period 17. Demand analysis: The average demand over the last 10 periods (P8-P17) is approximately 86.6 units, but over the last 15 periods it is ~92 units. Using recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat will capture the slightly lower recent demand (avg ~87) while adjusting for an (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 10 periods to reflect recent volatility. These parameters ensure the base stock is calculated for a 4-period window (L+1).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 0/unit. Recent history demonstrates a lead time (L) that frequently deviates from the promised 2 periods, with L=3 being the most consistent observed behavior (7 out of 8 successful deliveries had L=3). The order from Period 15 (129 units) is now 3 periods old and has not concluded in Period 18, but is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 19) based on the L=3 pattern. Demand over the last 15 periods (P4-P18) has averaged 90.9 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. In-transit inventory is high (364 units) due to large orders in P15, P17, and an earlier order that might be lost. I am setting L=3 to match recent observed lead-time reality. mu_hat is set to (1+L=4) * avg demand of the last 15 periods to provide a stable forecast, and sigma_hat is calculated similarly. This ensures the OR backend targets a pipeline covering 4 periods of demand.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 10 periods (P10-P19), averaging 85.8 units with moderate variance. The primary challenge is lead time instability and stockouts. Historical data confirms the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods (8 out of 9 successful arrivals), despite the promised 2 periods. Since the Period 15 order (129 units) has not arrived as of the end of Period 19 (making it 4 periods since ordering), it is likely late or lost. The current pipeline inventory includes orders from P15 (129), P17 (36), plus existing in-transit totals. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the pattern of stockouts, I am setting L=3 to match the dominant observed lead time. I will use the mean of the last 10 periods (85.8) to project demand over the (L+1) window, roughly 343 units. Setting mu_hat to 343 and using recent volatility for sigma_hat ensures the backend attempts to restore the base stock to cover this window, accounting for the 364 units already in-transit which likely includes the delayed Period 15 order.

Carry-over insight: Lead time L=3 remains the dominant mode with a high frequency of late/lost shipments (P2, P6, and potentially P15 confirmed). Demand remains stable with a 10-period average of 85.8 units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system is facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time analysis confirms that L=3 is the dominant mode (occurring in ~86% of successful arrivals). The 'In-transit' balance of 364 units consists of orders from P15 (129 units), P17 (36 units), and P21's new order. However, the order from P15 (placed in P15, expected in P18 if L=3) is now 3 periods late (it is now P21), suggesting it is highly likely lost, similar to shipments from P2 and P6. This leaves only the P17 order (36 units) as reliable pipeline inventory. Demand remains very stable; the last 10 periods (P11-P20) show an average of 84.4 units per period. I am setting L=3 to account for the consistent actual lead time, mu_hat based on the last 10 periods of stable demand (1+3)*84.4, and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods to capture recent volatility. By setting L to 3 (explicit), I am informing the backend that the replenishment cycle is longer than the promised 2 periods, which will help increase the base stock level to cover the gap caused by lost and delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Shipment from Period 15 (129 units) confirmed lost after 6 periods of non-arrival despite dominant L=3. Reliability of pipeline inventory remains low with roughly 30% of orders failing to arrive.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable demand regime but significant supply instability. Demand over the last 10 periods (P12-P21) averaged 88.7 units per period, while the last 5 periods (P17-P21) averaged 94.8. Given the consistently empty on-hand inventory, I will forecast using a slightly higher recent average of 95 units per period. The supply chain remains the primary risk: the dominant successful lead time is 3 periods (6 out of 7 most recent arrivals), yet orders from P2, P6, and P15 have been lost. Currently, inventory is 0 on-hand with 364 units in-transit. These units correspond to orders from P17 (36 units) and potentially subsequent orders not explicitly detailed in the history provided in this prompt but recorded in the 'In-transit' total. Setting L to 3 periods and mu_hat based on the last 10 samples (N=10) to cover the (L+1)=4 period risk window avoids over-ordering while accounting for the common delay. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture current demand volatility.

LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, the system reflects on-hand inventory of 0 and in-transit inventory of 364 units. However, based on the history and carry-over insights, the in-transit pipeline is highly unreliable. Specifically, the shipments from Period 17 (36 units, now 6 periods overdue) and potentially others are likely lost or severely delayed. Observations indicate that while the dominant lead time is 3 periods, roughly 30% of orders are lost entirely. The current in-transit figure of 364 includes these likely-lost units, which can cause the OR backend to under-order. To compensate for this 'ghost' inventory and the zero on-hand stock, I'm setting L=3 (the dominant actual lead time). Demand has remained stable, with a recent average (P13-P22) of approximately 93.7 units; therefore, I use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture this stability. Sigma_hat is also calculated using recent_N=10 to reflect the current demand volatility. By keeping parameters aligned with the actual (longer) lead time and stable demand, I aim to trigger an order to replenish the safety stock, acknowledging that the pipeline inventory is currently overstated by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: confirmed high loss rate for shipments (~30%). Period 17 order (36 units) likely lost after 6 periods. Cumulative demand remains stable at ~94 units/period (P13-P22).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a 10-period average of approximately 93.3 units (Periods 14-23). The primary challenge is the delivery reliability and lead time volatility. The dominant actual lead time is 3 periods, significantly longer than the promised 2 periods. Furthermore, there is a recurring pattern of lost shipments (approximately 30% loss rate), with orders from Period 2, Period 6, Period 15, and now Period 17 confirmed/highly likely lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the in-transit pipeline of 375 units includes many units from periods that are likely never to arrive (specifically, orders after Period 17 were non-existent until the small order in Period 23). To compensate for the 3-period lead time and the risk of stockouts due to lost shipments, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) and mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods using an explicit forecast of 94 units/period (total 376). This ensures the base stock target reflects the reality of the supply chain delays and losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: High shipment loss rate (~30%) persists; deliveries are highly unreliable. Pipeline inventory should be discounted mentally as orders older than 5 periods are likely lost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with a recent 10-period average (P15-P24) of approximately 106 units per period, though the broader historical mean is closer to 95. The main challenge remains supply reliability. The dominant lead time is 3 periods (observed in most successful deliveries), but there is a significant loss rate of approximately 30-40% (orders from P2, P6, P15, and P17 have effectively disappeared). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline shows 376 units. However, much of this pipeline is likely lost: P15 (129 units) and P17 (36 units) are far past the 3-period lead time and are confirmed lost. The remaining active pipeline likely consists of the orders from P23 (11 units) and P24 (1 unit), which are still within the expected delivery window but are insufficient to meet demand. I will set the lead time L to 3 (the dominant actual lead time). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=10 to capture the slightly higher recent demand average (~106) compared to the long-term average, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) period cycle. I'll use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent lead time observation from Period 23 (arriving Period 25 conclude) indicates an actual lead time of 2 periods, which matches the promised lead time. However, historical data shows a dominant lead time of 3 periods and a high shipment loss rate (~30%). Orders from Periods 15 and 17 are confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 375 is misleading because it includes many units from older, historically likely-lost orders (e.g., Period 15: 129 units, Period 17: 36 units). Only the orders from Period 24 (1 unit) and Period 25 (10 units) are realistically in the pipeline given the 2-3 period lead time. Since on-hand is 0 and reliable pipeline is only 11 units, a significiant order is needed. I will use L=2 (recent evidence) but increase the demand forecast significantly using 'explicit' to compensate for the lost-order risk and ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger a large replenishment. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P16-P25) is 101.4 units. I will set mu_hat based on (1+L)*102 and a high sigma to maintain service levels despite the unreliable supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Recent shipment (ordered P23) arrived in 2 periods (L=2), indicating a possible return to promised lead time from the previous L=3 mode. Shipment loss rate remains high (~30%) with orders older than 5 periods confirmed lost.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with a recent 10-period average (P17-P26) of approximately 101 units. Lead time remains the primary source of volatility. While the promised lead time is 2, the historical mode is 3. However, P23 arrived in 2 periods (L=2). More critically, the system suffers from a high loss rate (~30%). Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 375. Looking at the transit pipeline: P15 (129), P17 (36), P24 (1), P25 (10). Orders from P15 and P17 (165 units total) are significantly past the 3-period arrival window and are likely lost. The backend OR engine needs to order to cover the (L+1) horizon. By setting mu_hat to an explicit value (300) reflecting 3 periods of demand (~100/period) and L to an explicit 2, the base stock targets approximately 300 units. Since 165 units in-transit are likely lost, the 'true' pipeline is closer to 210. Using L=2 and mu_hat=300 (which covers three periods of demand) will prompt the backend to reconcile against the current pipeline and place a replenishment order to address the 0 on-hand status and the high turnover.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around 90-100 units/period (average over last 10 periods: 98.3). On-hand inventory is 0 and the current in-transit pipeline is 375, but historical evidence suggests severe supply chain unreliability with a loss rate of approximately 30%. Orders from P15 and P17 (165 units total) are confirmed lost based on the 5-6 period non-arrival rule. The most recent arrival (P23 arriving at P25) shows L=2, but historical performance suggests L=3 is the safer lead time estimate for setting base stock targets. I will set L=3 via 'explicit' to account for the dominant mode and order loss delays. For mu_hat, I'll use the 10-period average of 98.3 (rounded to ~393 for 1+L=4). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture recent volatility. Given the 0 on-hand inventory and the need to compensate for lost pipeline inventory, setting L and mu_hat explicitly ensures the OR backend attempts to reach a sufficient base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Recent supply arrivals (P23->P25) show L=2, though L=3 remains the historical mode. Order loss rate remains high (~30%), with orders from P15 and P17 now definitively considered lost.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around 90-100 units/period (average over last 10 periods \u2248 92). Supply reliability is the primary issue, with a ~30% loss rate and volatile lead times (historically 3 periods, recently observed at 2 periods). Currently, the system shows On-hand = 0 and In-transit = 393. However, the Carry-Over Insights and history indicate significant losses (P2, P6, P15, and P17 orders are confirmed or highly likely lost). By subtracting these known/likely losses (152+47+129+36 = 364 units), the effective pipeline inventory is only 29 units (orders from P23-P28), which is insufficient to cover the lead time (L=2) and current period demand (total 3 periods). I will set L=2 (recent arrivals), but maintain a higher \u03bc\u0302 to account for the need to rebuild inventory and offset previous losses. Setting N=10 for demand averaging to capture the stable regime while mitigating volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: High loss rate confirmed at ~30%; effectively, 364 units from the in-transit balance (P2, P6, P15, P17) should be considered non-existent for planning purposes.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is severely compromised by a ~30% order loss rate and chronic stockouts. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit balance of 393 units is misleading because it includes confirmed lost orders from P2 (152), P6 (47), P15 (129), and P17 (36), totaling 364 units. The 'real' pipeline is only 29 units (from P24, P25, and P28). Demand remains stable with a 10-period average of 91.2 units (P20-P29). While the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3, with 3 being the historical mode and 2 appearing recently. I will set L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the frequent delays. To compensate for the high stockout frequency and the 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I will use an explicit mu_hat to force a larger order that ignores the lost units. mu_hat target = (1+L) * mean_demand = 4 * 91 = 364. To offset the 364 units of lost inventory that the OR backend still thinks is in-transit, I will set mu_hat to 728 (364 projected demand + 364 lost units correction).

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Supply phantom inventory confirmed. 364 units in-transit (P2, P6, P15, P17) are definitively lost and must be manually offset in mu_hat calculations until they clear or are accounted for.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is highly unreliable, characterized by a ~30% order loss rate and a variable lead time (currently L=2 based on the most recent arrival, though historically L=3). As of Period 31, 'In-transit' inventory is reported as 587 units. However, systematic tracking confirms that 364 of these units are 'phantom inventory' from lost orders (Period 2: 152 units, Period 6: 47 units, Period 15: 129 units, Period 17: 36 units). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 223 units (587 - 364). To compensate for the backend's inability to recognize these losses, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3 periods of demand). Using a demand mean of ~92 units/period, the base stock should be ~276 units plus a safety buffer. However, because the backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline of 587 units, I must set mu_hat to a value that offsets this 364-unit discrepancy. Target base stock (~300) + Pipeline Correction (364) \u2248 664. This ensures the OR engine places an order to cover the immediate stockout (on-hand is 0) despite the high phantom inventory.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to present significant challenges with a high loss rate and fluctuating lead times. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' balance is 664 units, but carry-over insights definitively flag 364 units (from P2, P6, P15, and P17) as lost/phantom inventory. This leaves only 300 units in the 'true' pipeline (1 from P24, 10 from P25, 212 from P30, and 77 from P31). Demand remains stable; the average of the last 10 periods (P22-P31) is 99.1 units. The most recent successful arrivals (P23->P25 and P28->P30) both show a lead time of 2 periods, suggesting a stabilization at the promised lead time L=2. To account for the 364 units of phantom inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its inventory position (base_stock - pipeline), I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat to (1+L)*100 units (expected demand over lead time) PLUS 364 units to offset the phantom pipeline. This forces the OR engine to place orders despite the inflated in-transit figure. L is set to 2 to reflect recent successful delivery performance.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Phantom inventory reconciliation remains critical. 364 units in-transit (P2, P6, P15, P17) are confirmed lost and must be manually offset. Recent lead time has stabilized at 2 periods (P25 and P30 arrivals).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable, with a recent 10-period average (P23-P32) of 96.9 units. The primary challenge is the supply chain volatility and phantom inventory. Total In-transit is 587 units, but 364 of these are confirmed lost (P2: 152, P6: 47, P15: 129, P17: 36). The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 587 - 364 = 223 units. Lead times have recently shown improvement (L=2 for P28, L=1 for P31), suggesting a shift toward the promised 2 periods, though stability is not yet guaranteed. To compensate for the 364 units of 'phantom inventory' that the OR backend incorrectly counts as 'in-transit', I will explicitly set mu_hat to the expected demand over the (L+1) horizon PLUS the phantom amount. This forces the base stock formula (base_stock - pipeline) to trigger an order that fills the actual gap. With L=2 (horizon=3), and mean demand ~97/period, the standard mu_hat would be ~291. Adding the 364 units of phantom inventory yields a mu_hat of ~655.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain phantom inventory confirmed: 364 units from P2, P6, P15, and P17 are definitively lost. Lead time has recently fluctuated between 1-2 periods (last two arrivals).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted with a confirmed ~30% order loss rate. Specifically, 364 units (P2: 152, P6: 47, P15: 129, P17: 36) in the current 655-unit in-transit balance are definitively lost and will never arrive. This leaves 291 valid units in the pipeline (P24: 1, P25: 10, P30: 212, P33: 68). Recent actual lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods (P31 arrived in 1 period, P28 in 2 periods), prompting a shift in L from 3 back toward 2. Demand remains stable, with the last 10 periods (P24-P33) averaging 98.3 units. To account for the 'phantom inventory' (the 364 lost units), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 660. This covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~295 units) plus the 364-unit deficit created by the lost orders that the OR logic still thinks are coming. This ensures the OR engine places an order rather than waiting for ghost stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has stabilized at 1-2 periods (P28->P30: L=2, P31->P32: L=1). Demand average for P24-P33 is 98.3 units/period (+5% from previous stable regime).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 35. The supply chain is plagued by a significant loss rate (~30%) and 'phantom inventory'. Specifically, orders from P2 (152), P6 (47), P15 (129), and P17 (36) totaling 364 units are confirmed lost and still appear in the 'in-transit' count of 660. Effective in-transit is 660 - 364 = 296 units. Demand has shifted slightly upward, with an average of 98.3 units over the last 10 periods (P24-P33). Lead time has stabilized recently between 1 and 2 periods (L=2 for P28, L=1 for P31). Based on this stabilization, I am setting L to 2 to be conservative but responsive. To account for the 364 units of phantom inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, I must artificially inflate the target base stock (mu_hat) by this amount. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the high reported in-transit balance. Calculated mu_hat = (1 + L) * Avg_Demand + Lost_Units = (1 + 2) * 98.3 + 364 \u2248 294.9 + 364 = 658.9. Sigma_hat is set using recent volatility (N=10) to reflect current demand variance.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 660 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms a high loss rate (~30%). Specifically, 364 units from Periods 2, 6, 15, and 17 are definitively lost (phantom inventory). This leaves an actual reliable pipeline of 296 units (660 - 364). Demand has remained stable over the last 15 periods, averaging 95.8 units/period. Lead time has recently stabilized between 1 and 2 periods. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover for the lost 364 units (which it still believes are coming), I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 (i.e., covering 3 periods of demand: current + 2 lead): 3 * 96 = 288 units. However, because the backend subtracts the full 660 pipeline from its stock calculation, I must inflate mu_hat by the amount of the phantom inventory (364 units) to cancel out the error. Thus, mu_hat = 288 (service) + 364 (phantom offset) = 652.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Reliable pipeline inventory is 296 units; 364 units (P2, P6, P15, P17) remain as persistent phantom inventory that must be offset in mu_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently unreliable with two major issues: phantom inventory and lead time volatility. First, of the 655 units 'in-transit', 364 units (from P2, P6, P15, and P17) are confirmed lost based on the 5-period non-arrival threshold. The backend OR calculates orders based on 'base_stock - pipeline', but it treats all 655 units as likely to arrive. To compensate, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset the 364 phantom units. Second, recent lead times have stabilized between 1 and 2 periods (P31->P32: L=1, P34->P36: L=2). I will set L to 2 to be conservative. Demand remains stable; the average for the last 10 periods is 96 units/period. The target base stock for L=2 should cover 3 periods of demand (~288 units) plus safety stock. However, because the backend subtracts the full 655 in-transit units, I must set mu_hat high enough so that (mu_hat - 655) results in a meaningful replenishment order that accounts for the fact that only ~291 units are actually expected to arrive. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to force a large enough order to clear the current stockout and provide buffer for the 2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain phantom inventory confirmed: 364 units (P2: 152, P6: 47, P15: 129, P17: 36) are definitively lost and must be offset in parameter calculations until game end or clearance. Recent lead time has transitioned from L=3 to L=1-2.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 38. Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level, with a 10-period average (P28-P37) of 100.1 units/period, compared to the earlier regime of ~94. Lead time recently shows L=1 or L=2 (P31->P32: L=1, P34->P36: L=2), shifting away from the historical L=3 mode, though supply remains unreliable. The in-transit balance of 900 units contains 364 units of 'phantom inventory' from confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17). These 364 units will never arrive and must be offset to prevent the OR backend from under-ordering. I set L=2 (recent stable mode) and use mu_hat to handle the phantom inventory offset. Target base stock = (1+L) * mean. With L=2, we need (3 * 100.1) = 300.3 units. However, since the pipeline includes 364 units that don't exist, the OR engine (which sees 900 units in transit) will assume we are overstocked and order 0. To force an order, I adjust mu_hat to include the phantom units: adjusted mu_hat = (Actual needed base stock) + (Phantom Inventory) = 300 + 364 = 664. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility (P28-P37 std dev ~13, so sqrt(3)*13 \u2248 23).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P28-P37 average is 100.1 (+6% from P18-P27). Lead time is currently 1-2 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upwards, with the average demand for the last 11 periods (P28-P38) being approximately 100.8 units, compared to the previous stable regime. Lead time has been fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods recently. I will use L=2 to be safe. Crucially, the 'In-transit' balance of 900 units includes 364 units of 'phantom inventory' from Periods 2, 6, 15, and 17 that are definitively lost. To force the OR backend into ordering despite this inflated pipeline, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter. Base stock is calculated as (1+L)*mu. With L=2, mu_hat should normally be ~300. By adding the 364 lost units to this target, I arrive at a mu_hat of 664. I will use the explicit method for mu_hat and sigma_hat (based on recent volatility) to ensure the backend covers the required units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P28-P39) shows an average of ~100 units/period (P28: 88, P29: 95, P30: 97, P31: 69, P32: 97, P33: 111, P34: 102, P35: 96, P36: 112, P37: 110, P38: 117, P39: 91). Lead time has recently fluctuated between 1-2 periods (P31->P32 was 1, P34->P36 was 2). However, a significant supply chain issue persists: 364 units in 'In-transit' are phantom inventory from lost orders (P2: 152, P6: 47, P15: 129, P17: 36). Total In-transit is 900, but valid In-transit is only 536 units (900 - 364). To compensate for the OR backend's inability to see lost orders, mu_hat must be adjusted. Using L=2, expected demand over (L+1) periods is 300 units. Since 'valuable' pipeline (536) already exceeds this, the OR engine would naturally stop ordering. To maintain stock against potential L=3 occurrences and future demand, I'll set L to 2 and use explicit mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the ~100 unit mean and ~15 unit standard deviation, while mentally accounting for the 364-unit phantom offset.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments have created 364 units of phantom inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17). Actual usable In-transit is total in-transit minus 364.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 41. The demand regime has recently stabilized at approximately 100 units per period (P28-P40 average is ~99.2). Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1-3 periods, with a recent mode around 2 periods. The most critical issue is the 'phantom inventory': of the 900 units currently listed as 'In-transit', 364 units (from P2, P6, P15, and P17) are definitively lost but still occupy the pipeline balance in the OR backend's logic. This causes the OR engine to under-order. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the base stock requirements for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3 periods of demand) plus the 364 lost units. Target base stock = (3 * 100) + 364 = 664. Sigma_hat is set to account for the standard deviation of approximately 14 over the 3-period window (~24). This adjustment forces the backend to place orders despite the inflated pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Continued manual offset of 364 lost units (P2, P6, P15, P17) in mu_hat is necessary to bypass the OR backend's reliance on 'total in-transit' which includes these phantom units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant disruption. First, there is 'phantom inventory' totaling 364 units (from Periods 2, 6, 15, and 17) which are definitively lost but still contribute to the 'In-transit' balance seen by the OR backend. To prevent the backend from under-ordering, I must offset this by increasing mu_hat. Second, we are currently out of stock with 0 on-hand. There is a large order of 245 units from Period 37 which should arrive soon (L has fluctuated between 1-3, avg 2). Demand is in a higher regime, averaging approximately 100 units/period over the last 14 periods (P28-P41). Setting L=2 as the active estimate. To calculate mu_hat: Base demand for (L+1) periods = 100 * 3 = 300. Adding the 364 units of phantom inventory to ensure the backend places an order despite the inflated Pipeline Inventory gives a mu_hat of 664. Sigma_hat is set to 35 to account for the recent demand volatility (range 91-120).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by stable demand (avg ~101 units over last 15 periods) but a significant supply chain issue: 'Phantom Inventory'. There are 364 units (from periods 2, 6, 15, and 17) still listed in 'In-transit' that are definitively lost. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 900 units, but 364 are phantom, leaving 536 real units. Additionally, the backend OR logic calculates orders based on (base_stock - total_pipeline). To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to these 364 phantom units, I am inflating mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand (avg) = 101. Total periods covered by base stock (L+1) = 3. Expected normal mu_hat = 3 * 101 = 303. To offset the 364 lost units that the backend subtracts, I set mu_hat = 303 + 364 = 667. This ensures the OR logic accounts for the lost items. Lead time (L) is set to 2 as it represents the most recent stable arrival pattern (P28->P30, P34->P36), while sigma_hat is left at a standard level for this demand regime (~15 per period * sqrt(3) \u2248 26), slightly inflated for safety.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 of 50. The supply chain is characterized by a high loss rate (~30%) resulting in 364 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P2, P6, P15, and P17) which will never arrive. The OR backend uses 'Total In-Transit' in its base-stock calculation (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline - OnHand). Because the backend includes those 364 units in the pipeline, it will chronically under-order. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat by exactly 364 units to 'neutralize' this phantom inventory. Current demand is stable at ~100 units/period (P34-P43 avg = 101). Current on-hand is 0, and usable in-transit is 900 - 364 = 536 units. With L set to 2, the backend's target base stock (calculated as mu_hat + safety stock) needs to be high enough to trigger the necessary replenishment. Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*100 + 364 = 664. Sigma is set based on recent demand volatility (std dev ~13, so sqrt(3)*13 \u2248 23). This adjustment ensures the backend correctly identifies a stockout risk and orders to replenish the system.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 45 of 50. The current situation for chips(Regular) remains dominated by 'phantom inventory'. There are 364 units in-transit (from Periods 2, 6, 15, and 17) that are definitively lost. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (900 units) from the base stock to calculate the order. To compensate for the 364 lost units, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter. Lead time (L) has recently stabilized between 1 and 2 periods; I will set L to 1 to reflect the most optimistic recent performance, while planning for enough demand. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a slight upward shift to approximately 100 units/period. The calculation for mu_hat is: (1+L) * Mean + Phantom_Offset. With L=1 and Mean=100, mu_hat = (1+1)*100 + 364 = 564. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the 364-unit in-transit bloat. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the recent demand volatility observed (range of 60 to 120).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 50. The current situation is critical: On-hand inventory is 0, and there is a total in-transit balance of 900 units. However, as established in previous periods, 364 units (from P2, P6, P15, P17) are definitively lost 'phantom inventory'. Subtracting these, the real 'pipeline' is 536 units. Recent demand (P36-P45) has averaged 95.0 units per period. The supply chain has been extremely unreliable; the last arrival was in Period 36. Since P37, an order of 245 units has been outstanding for 9 periods, which is significantly beyond the recent L=1-2 or even the historical L=3. Given we only have 5 periods left, the goal is to trigger the OR backend to place an order that covers remaining demand without over-ordering, while accounting for the fact that the backend 'sees' 364 units that don't exist. To force an order when the backend believes pipeline (900) >= needed stock, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Targeted coverage is (L+1) * 95. Setting L=2 (promised), we need roughly 285 units. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - 900', and we want a base stock that results in an order to cover the remaining game (4 periods * 95 = 380), I will set mu_hat high enough to offset the 364 phantom units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock (380) + Phantom Units (364) = 744.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 900 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 364 units of this in-transit balance are 'phantom units' from lost orders in Periods 2, 6, 15, and 17. The actual usable pipeline is 536 units (900 - 364), consisting of orders from Periods 28, 30, 31, 33, 34, and 37. Specifically, the large orders from Period 30 (212 units) and Period 37 (245 units) have not arrived despite the recent lead time shifting between 1 and 3 periods. Given Period 30 was 17 periods ago and Period 37 was 10 periods ago, these are likely lost as well, but for now, I continue the protocol of offsetting the confirmed 364 units. Demand has slightly softened in the last 5 periods (P42-P46 avg ~85 vs P28-P37 avg ~100). I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand and sigma to capture the current regime while maintaining the explicit mu_hat offset. To force the OR backend to ignore the 364 phantom units, I adjust mu_hat: Targeted base stock (L=2) is approx (1+2)*95 = 285. Since OR engine sees 900 in transit, it will order 0 unless base_stock > 900. I set mu_hat explicitly to (Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory) to trigger a corrective order if necessary, though current usable pipeline (536) already exceeds the 3-period demand (approx 285). Thus, no new order is expected, which is appropriate given the massive (though potentially lost) pipeline.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. Demand for chips(Regular) has maintained a stable mean of approximately 100 units/period (P28-P47 average is 98.7). The critical issue remains the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Total In-transit is 900 units, but 364 units (from P2, P6, P15, and P17) are definitively lost. Additionally, the large order of 212 units from P30 and 245 units from P37 have not yet arrived. The P30 order is now 18 periods old and must be considered lost. The P37 order is 11 periods old; given our historical mode of L=3 and maximum observed L=3, this order is also likely lost or severely delayed. This means of the 900 units in-transit, 364 (confirmed lost) + 212 (P30 lost) + 245 (P37 lost) = 821 units are phantom inventory. Only 79 units (from P31-34) are potentially real, but they are also very old. With only 3 periods left (48, 49, 50) and lead times between 1-3 periods, any order placed now must arrive by P50. I will set L to the promised 2 periods and mu_hat to cover the remaining periods' demand while using an explicit value to significantly increase the target base stock. This 'over-ordering' via mu_hat is necessary because the OR backend subtracts the (mostly phantom) 900 in-transit units from the base stock. To trigger a real order of ~300 units (to cover P48, 49, 50), I set mu_hat to 1250 (Approx 900 phantom + 350 demand).

Carry-over insight: Period 48: P30 (212 units) and P37 (245 units) are now confirmed lost/phantom inventory. Total phantom inventory in pipeline is 821 units (364 + 212 + 245).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the second-to-last period of the game. On-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 1250 units. Significant 'phantom inventory' exists: 821 units correspond to orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P30, P37) that are confirmed lost/overdue and will not arrive. Thus, the effective usable pipeline is 1250 - 821 = 429 units. These 429 units belong to the order placed in Period 48. Given the game ends after Period 50 and the actual lead time has recently fluctuated between 1-2 periods (L=1 or L=2), the Period 48 order is likely to arrive during Period 49 or Period 50. Since base_stock = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap), and the OR backend uses 'total' in-transit (1250), it perceives we have a surplus. To account for the 821 units of phantom inventory and ensure an order is triggered to cover the final period's demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate demand at ~100 units/period. For Period 49 and 50 (L+1=2), total demand is ~200. To offset the backend subtracting 1250 instead of 429, I set mu_hat = 200 + 821 = 1021. This forces the backend to recognize the need for more stock despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Final reconciliation for end-of-game: Total phantom inventory in pipeline (orders confirmed lost/overdue) is 821 units (P2: 152, P6: 47, P15: 129, P17: 36, P30: 212, P37: 245). Period 48 order of 350 units is the only active valid shipment.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final decision period. The objective is to maximize reward, which involves satisfying demand while minimizing ending inventory. Currently, the system shows 1250 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 821 units are 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P30, P37). The only valid shipment is 350 units ordered in Period 48. Since the observed lead time has recently fluctuated between 1-2 periods, this shipment is expected to arrive during Period 49 or 50. With 0 on-hand inventory at the start of Period 50 and an expected demand of ~100 units, the 350-unit shipment (if it arrives) will more than cover Period 50's demand. Placing a new order (L=2) would only arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, I set L=2 and mu_hat to a very low value to ensure no new orders are placed, as they would only contribute to holding costs or arrive after the game ends. Sigma_hat is kept at a default recent window to maintain the backend's internal logic without triggering large safety stock orders.
