No units were sold because the initial on-hand inventory was 0. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning the Period 1 order (350 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be available for sale in Period 4 (visible in Period 3 conclude/Period 4 start). According to the execution sequence, I placed an order in Period 1, and now in Period 2, I have 0 on-hand and 350 in-transit. Since I need to cover demand for Period 2, Period 3, and Period 4 (L+1 periods) before the next possible arrival from an order placed now (which would arrive in Period 4), I must assess the pipeline. Historically, demand for Periods 1-5 was [112, 111, 80, 129, 130], averaging ~112. However, Period 1 actual demand was significantly lower at 63. I will stick to a conservative forecast of ~100 per period. Target inventory for 3 periods (P2, P3, P4) is ~300 units. Since 350 are already in transit and expected to arrive in Period 3, I am currently over-covered for the immediate window. However, to ensure I don't run out in Period 5 (when an order placed now would arrive), I should consider the total lead time pipeline. Order(P1) arrives P3 resolution. Order(P2) arrives P4 resolution. To cover P2, P3, P4, P5 (4 periods at 100/unit = 400 total), I have 350 in-transit. I will order 50 units to bring the total pipeline to 400.",

The supply chain is highly volatile, characterized by lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods and a significant order loss rate (roughly 20-25%). I am currently in a recovery phase following a major stockout between periods 19-22. On-hand inventory is 117 units. The In-transit pipeline (775 units) includes orders from P24 (80), P25 (80), P26 (90), and P27 (90). However, the in-transit figure also likely includes lost orders from P20-P22 (640 units ordered total, but 520 units arrived in P23, suggesting 120 units from that batch might be lost or delayed). Given the historical pattern of orders disappearing after 5-6 periods without arrival, and the current goal of maintaining a safety buffer to prevent another stockout while lead times vary, I will place a maintenance order of 90 units to track the 100-unit demand mean. No order is being placed to replenish the full 'lost' stock yet, as the current on-hand + pending P24-P27 orders (340 units) provide a sufficient buffer for the 3-period lead time horizon.",

To maintain a safety buffer and account for the high loss rate, I need to ensure that arrivals cover the next 3-4 periods of demand (~400 units). Given current stockout and the high risk of any single order failing, I will place a substantial order to replenish the pipeline and maximize availability for the final periods.",

The current valid pipeline consists of orders from P42 (250), P43 (200), and P44 (200). Order P42 is now at L=3 (the max typical lead time excluding losses) and should arrive in the current period (P45), becoming visible at the start of P46.

Given 382 units on hand and 5 periods remaining in the game (P46-P50), the total expected demand is approximately 500 units. Since 382 units are on hand and 350 units are in-transit (P44 & P45) which are likely to arrive within the next 1-3 periods, the current inventory + reliable pipeline (approx. 732 units) comfortably covers the 500 units of remaining demand.

Systemic order loss is approximately 30%. Orders older than 5 periods generally do not arrive. \n(d) Inventory Profile: On-hand is 172. In-transit includes P44 (200 units, age 4), P45 (150 units, age 3), and any order from P48. Given P44 and P45 are within the viable window, they are likely to arrive in Period 48 or 49. \n(e) Final Order Logic: We are at Period 48. With L=2, an order placed now would arrive in Period 50. Demand for the remaining periods (48, 49, 50) is ~300 total units. Current On-hand (172) + expected In-transit (P44: 200, P45: 150) equals 522 units.

Historically, the lead time varies between 1 and 3 periods, and there is a significant systemic order loss rate of approximately 30%. On-hand inventory is currently 77 units. Our objective is to maximize reward for the final two periods (49 and 50) while minimizing ending inventory costs at the end of Period 50. Since the current period is 49, any order placed now would arrive at the earliest in Period 50 (L=1) or too late (L>1, arrive after the game ends). Looking at the pipeline: We have 200 units from Period 44 (likely lost or arriving P49-P50) and 150 units from Period 45 (expected P46-P48, now overdue). In-transit shows 1395 units, but history suggests most of these (P2 to P37) are confirmed lost. Recent orders include P42 (arrived), P43 (arrived), P44 (200 units, 5 periods ago), and P45 (150 units, 4 periods ago). Given the high probability that at least one of these pending shipments (P44 or P45) arrives in Period 49 or Period 50, and our current stock of 77 units covers most of the expected Period 49 demand (~100), placing a new order is unnecessary and risky due to holding costs at the game's conclusion.

To maximize total reward in this final period (Period 50), I must account for the fact that any order placed now will not arrive until Period 51 or later (due to the minimum lead time), which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, the goal is to satisfy remaining demand using existing pipeline arrivals. However, since the prompt asks for an action for the current status of Period 50 and the game concludes after this period's resolution, placing a large order now is unnecessary as it would only incur potential costs or simply never arrive before the game ends.
