Since I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods (Period 1, 2, and 3), I will aim to cover at least 320-350 units. Because I have 0 inventory and a 2-period lead time, I need to place a substantial order immediately to meet demand starting from the moment these arrive (Period 3).

Order placed in P2 (50 units) is expected in P4 resolution. d) Inventory Assessment: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 400 (350 from P1 + 50 from P2).

The current on-hand inventory is critically low at 12 units. There is a massive in-transit pipeline of 640 units, but it includes potentially lost orders (P17: 120, P18: 90) and very recent orders (P25: 50, P26: 30, P27: 150).

Assessing the current pipeline: P29 (210 units) and P30 (200 units) are overdue (4 and 3 periods old), while the most recent deliveries (P31, P32) arrived with L=1. Given the recent L=1 performance, the units from P29 and P30 are increasingly likely to be lost or severely delayed.

The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has recently shifted higher, but the most recent observation (Period 46) saw an unusually low demand of 24 units. However, the average demand over the last 10 periods remains approximately 125 units, with a peak near 180. The inventory position is currently 249 units on-hand. Given the lead time volatility (averaging 2-3 periods recently) and the historical 30-40% loss rate on orders (confirmed by losses in P29, P30, P25, etc.), the pipeline must be assessed cautiously. Total in-transit is 1520, but much of this is aged or potentially unreliable. Specifically, orders from P44 (180), P45 (180), and P46 (100) are the primary reliable incoming stock for the remaining 4 periods. With only 4 periods left (47, 48, 49, 50), the total expected demand is approximately 500-600 units (125-150 avg * 4 periods). On-hand (249) + recent reliable in-transit (460) = 709 units, which is sufficient to cover the rest of the game even with potential losses. Because the game ends at Period 50, ending inventory has no salvage value and incurs holding costs. Over-ordering now would result in unnecessary holding costs in Periods 48-50. Therefore, I will place a minimal safety order of 50 units to insure against further immediate losses while primarily liquidating the existing high on-hand and reliable pipeline inventory.",
