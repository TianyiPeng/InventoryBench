  "rationale": "This is Period 1. I am managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the provided historical demand samples (Periods 1-5), the average demand is approximately 106.4 units per period (132, 74, 101, 90, 135). The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 (available for Period 4). Therefore, I need to cover demand for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 using my starting inventory and immediate orders. Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 0. Since I cannot stop Period 1 demand from being lost (it occurs after my decision but I have 0 stock), my goal is to stabilize inventory for Period 2 and beyond. To cover 3 periods of demand (approx 106 units/period) plus a safety stock to account for variance, I will target a pipeline of roughly 400-450 units. I will start by ordering 400 units to establish a baseline inventory in the coming periods.",

Therefore, current visible inventory is 0. Historical demand for Period 1 was 99 units (historical sample was 132), and the average demand across the 5 historical samples is ~106 units. My goal is to maintain a pipeline that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand to ensure availability once the first shipment arrives. Total expected demand for 3 periods (P2, P3, P4) is approximately 320 units (using ~106/period). Since there are already 400 units in-transit, the current pipeline is theoretically sufficient to cover demand through Period 4. However, considering the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a small buffer is prudent. I will place a conservative order to ensure availability in case the lead time is longer than promised or demand spikes, but I will not over-order until the first shipment arrives to confirm actual lead time.",

The simulated period demand (99, 63, 66) is slightly lower, averaging ~76 units. I will use a forecast of ~100 units/period to be safe. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order placed in P1 (400 units) should arrive during P3 resolution and be visible in P4 start. However, the P3 conclude message shows 0 arrivals. This suggests the lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Currently on-hand is 0 (all demand has been lost so far). In-transit is 450 (400 from P1, 50 from P2). e) Order logic: We need to cover demand for (L+1) periods. If L=3, we need to cover 4 periods (~400 units). Since 450 units are already in the pipeline, and we have zero on-hand but high holding costs ($1/unit), I will not place an additional order yet.

Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has recently trended higher, averaging ~150-180 units in the last four periods (P38-P41). Lead times oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a focus on very recent orders for pipeline calculations. Since the system officially marks shipments as lost after roughly 5-6 periods of no arrival, and recent successful arrivals were from P38, P39, and P40, I evaluate the current in-transit pipeline (1700 total) and subtract the historical losses confirmed in Carry-over Insights (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33 = 1400 units). The reliable in-transit units are from P37 (150), P40 (150), and P41 (150). However, P37 is now 5 periods old and likely lost. Therefore, the reliable pipeline is P40 (150) and P41 (150). With 0 on-hand and an expected demand of ~160/period, I need to cover at least 3 periods of demand (~480 units) to account for the 1-3 period lead time variability. Current reliable in-transit is 300. I will order 200 units to replenish the pipeline and buffer against the high loss rate.",

Based on recent history, an order is considered lost if it does not arrive within 4-5 periods. Currently, On-hand inventory is 0.

Reliable in-transit orders are P40 (150 units, now 3 periods old), P41 (150 units, 2 periods old), and P42 (200 units, 1 period old). P40 is at the threshold of becoming 'suspect' given it hasn't arrived in 2 periods (the promised lead time). Recent demand has shown a slight upward trend, averaging approximately 144 units over the last 5 periods (184, 156, 186, 90). To mitigate the high risk of stockouts caused by frequent 'black hole' losses, I will maintain a robust ordering strategy.

Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility but generally averages around 100-110 units per period. In Period 48, demand was 99.

However, the game concludes after Period 50, and any order placed now (Period 49) would only arrive in Period 50 if the lead time is 1 (or Period 49 if it were 0, but the history shows lead times are at least 1). Looking at the pipeline, orders from Period 44 (200), 45 (200), and 46 (150) are outstanding. Based on recent history (P43 arrived in 2 periods, P42 in 3 periods), these are likely to arrive in P49 or P50. Specifically, P44 (placed 5 periods ago) is likely lost, but P45 and P46 are due. With 83 on hand and P45 units likely arriving this period (unseen until P50 start), we are likely covered for P49 demand (~100).
