Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The Promised Lead Time (L) is 2. The initial inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Based on the historical demand samples provided (132, 74, 101, 90, 135), the mean demand per period is 106.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 25.4. Since there is no actual lead-time history yet, L will be set to 'default' (2). To cover the review period plus the lead time (1+L = 3 periods), mu_hat should target 3 * 106.4 = 319.2 and sigma_hat should target sqrt(3) * 25.4 = 44. Since we have sufficient initial samples (5), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most relevant baseline volatility and mean before any live observations accrue.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 151 units, which are currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, we expect this order to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start observation. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1 (130 units). Demand samples for Period 1 (132 originally in data, 130 in history) and historical data [132, 74, 101, 90, 135] suggest a mean around 106. Since we have no arrivals yet, we cannot infer a lead time change. I will use 'default' for L (promised = 2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' to incorporate all available historical samples (5 from context and 1 from history) to calculate the base stock requirements for the (L+1) horizon.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Historically, demand for Period 1 was 130 and Period 2 was 144 (actual realizations). The initial historical samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) average around 106. Recent demand is slightly higher than the historical mean. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (visible in Period 3 conclude/Period 4 start). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is 304 (orders from P1 and P2). Since L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' method for L to stick to the promised lead time of 2. I'll use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent slight increase in demand while still considering the historical context, setting the backend to calculate (1+2)*average(last 5).

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. No inventory has arrived yet. In Period 1, we ordered 151 units with a promised lead time of 2. Following the sequence, an order placed in Period 1 should arrive during the Arrival Resolution of Period 3 and become visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have missed demand for 3 consecutive periods (Total demand: 130 + 144 + 105 = 379). Historical demand samples are [132, 74, 101, 90, 135], while the game history demand shows [130, 144, 105]. The average demand is approximately 110-120. Setting L=3 (explicit) to account for the delay observed from the Period 1 order. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) for demand and volatility to capture the recent spread and ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead times are inconsistent. Order 1 took 3 periods, while Order 3 took 1 period. On average, the lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2, which matches the promised lead time L=2. However, the order from Period 2 (153 units) is still missing (it has been 3 periods since it was placed). Since Order 3 (placed later) arrived first, this suggests Order 2 might be lost or significantly delayed. Demand history (130, 144, 105, 110, 135) shows a mean of 124.8. With L=2, the backend needs to cover 3 periods of demand (1+L=3). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the full history of this relatively stable demand signal, and 'calculate' for L to let the backend use the observed average lead time. Sigma_hat will also use the last 5 samples to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $479.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Looking at history, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable with samples: 130, 144, 105, 110, 123 (mean ~122). The promised lead time is 2 periods. However, the 'conclude' messages show high variability: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods (Period 4), while Period 3's order arrived in 1 period (Period 4). This indicates lead time jitter or consolidation. As of Period 6, we have orders from Period 2 (153 units), Period 4 (123 units), and Period 5 (116 units) totaling 392 in-transit. Since we only have 13 units on-hand and demand is ~122, we are at risk of a stockout if an arrival doesn't occur this period. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed 1 and 3 period lead times (avg=2). For demand, I'll use the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current mean, which is slightly higher than the initial seed data. This configuration aims to maintain a high service level while the pipeline reconciles.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand across Periods 1-6 (130, 144, 105, 110, 123, 108) averages 120 units per period. Lead times have been highly variable: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (avg = 2). Period 2 order (153 units) is currently overdue (5 periods since order), suggesting a potential lost shipment. We have 503 units in-transit (Orders from P2, P4, P5, P6). Since the P2 order is significantly past the promised 2-period lead time and hasn't arrived, I will explicitly set the lead time to 3 to account for historical maximum delay and set mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the stable demand seen over the first 6 periods (N=6). The OR logic will subtract the pipeline (503) from the base stock. By setting mu_hat for (1+L)=4 periods of demand (~480), and considering the pipeline is already >500, the OR engine will likely order the minimum permitted or zero, which is appropriate given the high amount of inventory already in-transit and the risk of overstocking if the 'lost' P2 order suddenly arrives.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time for 'chips(Regular)' is unstable. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual lead times have been 3, 1, and 3 periods for orders placed in Periods 1, 3, and 4 respectively. The Period 2 order (153 units) is significantly overdue (6 periods since order), suggesting a lost shipment. Currently, Period 5 (116 units) and Period 6 (111 units) orders are in transit. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging 113.3 units over the last 7 periods (130, 144, 105, 110, 123, 108, 73). Given the lead time volatility and the likely loss of the Period 2 shipment, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delayed profile. I'll use all 7 historical samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to capture the full variance while centering on the expected demand for the (L+1) window.

Carry-over insight: Significant lead time volatility observed: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3. Shipment from Period 2 (153 units) appears lost (6 periods since placement).

Daily Reward (R_t): $486.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 38 units on-hand and 313 in-transit. Analysis of past arrivals confirms significant lead time instability: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1, P4 in 3, P5 in 3, and P7 in 1. This suggests an oscillating pattern between 1 and 3 periods, with an average closer to 2 but high variance. Crucially, the order from Period 2 (153 units) has still not arrived after 7 periods and is now definitively considered lost. This loss caused the stockout observed in Period 6. Inventory management must now ignore the P2 units in the pipeline. I will set L to 2 (promised/average) but increase the safety stock (sigma_hat) to account for the lead time variance. Demand remains relatively stable with a mean of ~114 (calculated over 8 samples). mu_hat will be set using recent_N=5 (avg ~110) to capture the current demand level, which helps bridge the gap created by the lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 2 (153 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Lead time alternates between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $348.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. The on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable, averaging ~113 units over the last 9 periods. The primary challenge is lead-time volatility: actual lead times have alternated between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1). Order P2 (153 units) is confirmed lost as 8 periods have passed. Order P6 (111 units) is currently 4 periods old and likely lost or significantly delayed, as other more recent orders (P7, P8) have already arrived. Current in-transit quantity is 270 (P6=111, P9=6, and likely P10 once placed). Given the 1 or 3 oscillation, assuming an average lead time of 2 (the promised value) is statistically reasonable but risky for stockouts. However, the OR backend's base-stock calculation uses (1+L). Setting L=2 (explicit) to ensure the backend projects demand over 3 periods (Period 10, 11, and 12). I will use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime which is stable but shows moderate variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is bimodal (1 or 3 periods). Shipment from Period 6 (111 units) is now 4 periods overdue and potentially lost, mirroring the Period 2 loss.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11 with 0 on-hand inventory and 374 units in-transit. Demand is relatively stable, averaging 114.7 units per period. However, shipment reliability is poor. Historical arrivals show a bimodal lead time of either 1 or 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P7: 1, P8: 1). Critically, shipments from Period 2 (153 units) and Period 6 (111 units) are highly likely lost, as they are 9 and 5 periods old respectively, far exceeding the observed max lead time of 3. These lost units represent 264 of the 374 'in-transit' units, meaning the effective pipeline inventory is only 110 units (from P9 and P10). To compensate for the loss of the P6 shipment and the expected lag of the P10 shipment (likely arriving P13), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples to reflect recent demand volatility, and maintaining the promised lead time of 2 as the baseline, while banking on the OR backend's inventory logic to trigger a replenishment for the gaps. I'm using recent_N (N=5) for demand parameters to capture the current mean (~107) and variance.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 6 (ordered 111 units) is now 5 periods old and confirmed lost, following the same pattern as the Period 2 loss.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and two confirmed lost shipments (Period 2 and Period 6). Lead times are bimodal, alternating between 1 and 3 periods. In-transit inventory (374 units) consists of orders from P9 (6), P10 (104), and P11 (0) plus potentially older units that haven't arrived. However, since P9 was placed 3 periods ago and hasn't arrived, and lead times are regularly 1 or 3, a 3-period lead time (L=3) is the most realistic and safe assumption for planning. Demand is stable around a mean of 111.9 (all periods) or 105.5 (last 5 periods). Given the frequent stockouts and lost shipments, I will use a conservative average of all demand samples (approx 112/period) and a lead time of 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers 4 periods of demand (L+1). This results in mu_hat = (1+3)*112 = 448.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally received orders from Period 9 (LT=3) and Period 10 (LT=2), confirming that shipments are still arriving despite previous losses and high volatility. However, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 12 where demand (136) exceeded supply (110). Historically, orders from Period 2 (153 units) and Period 6 (111 units) are confirmed lost, as they are now 11 and 7 periods past their order date respectively. The current pipeline inventory (374 units) consists of orders from Period 11 and Period 12. Lead times show a bimodal pattern of 1 or 3 periods (Average LT = 2.0). Demand remains relatively stable between 90-140 units. I will maintain L=2 and use the last 5 periods of demand (N=5) to capture the recent mean of 113. I am keeping \u03c3\u0302 at the default to ensure a sufficient safety buffer given the zero on-hand status and the history of lost orders.

Carry-over insight: Recurring confirmed loss pattern: Orders from P2 and P6 (spaced 4 periods apart) never arrived. Future orders must be monitored for a 4-period loss cycle.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand and significant lost sales over the last two periods. Historical analysis confirms a high-risk pattern regarding lead times and lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 and P6 (4 periods apart) were lost. We are now in P14 (another 4 periods since P10), and the P10 order did arrive in P12, but the P6 loss caused a massive stockout. Lead times are bimodal (1 or 3 periods) with some instances of 2. I will use an explicit L of 2 to balance the 1-3 swing. For demand, the average since P1 is approximately 111.7 units. Given the recent variability and stockouts, I'll use \u03bc\u0302 = 335 (calculated as (1+L) * 111.7 \u2248 3 * 111.7) to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for both the review period and lead time. \u03c3\u0302 is set to 40 (explicitly calculated as sqrt(3) * ~23 std dev) to cover the volatility. The primary goal is to refill the pipeline and recover from the on-hand exhaustion caused by the P6 loss.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed stockout for 2 periods due to cumulative effect of lost P6 shipment and demand volatility. Lead time remains unstable (range 1-3). No new loss confirmed this period, but pipeline remains shaky.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation (on-hand: 0) due to significant lead time volatility and lost shipments. Historical lead times have been bimodal, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with arrivals often clustering or missing entirely. Specifically, orders from Period 2 and Period 6 were lost. The order from Period 10 (104 units) and Period 9 (6 units) arrived in Period 12, but subsequent orders from Period 12 (110 units) and Period 13 (7 units) have not yet arrived. Given the promised lead time of 2 and an observed max of 3, the Period 12 order is now at L=3 and should arrive in the current resolution phase (Period 15). Demand remains stable with a mean around 110. To recover from the stockout and account for the high variance in lead time (ranging from 1 to 3), I am setting L to 3 (the observed upper bound) and using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=10) to capture current demand levels while ignoring early startup noise. This will increase the base stock level to cover the longer lead time and the current backlog risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 conclude shows that the order from Period 12 (110 units) arrived after 3 periods, keeping the on-hand inventory at 0 due to backlogged/lost demand. Currently, the SKU is in a persistent stockout state. The lead time has settled into a bimodal pattern of 1 or 3 periods (average 2.1 across observations). Crucially, we have identified a loss pattern where orders from P2, P6, and potentially P10 (though P10/P9 arrived late in P12) are at risk. In-transit inventory stands at 354 (orders from P13, P14, P15), but since P13 and P14 orders were very small (7 and 0), we actually only have one significant order (P15: 83 units) coming soon. With 'Recent_N' for demand, I will use N=10 to capture the recent mean of ~107 units. To overcome the stockout and the pipeline instability caused by previous losses (P2, P6), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation targets a 4-period window (L+1), effectively forcing a larger order to refill the empty pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline fragility confirmed: Despite 110 units arriving in P15, on-hand remains 0. High risk of stockout due to small orders in P13-P14 and previous shipment losses.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Period 16 demand dropped significantly to 41, which might be an outlier or a shift, but given previous demand levels (average ~104), I must maintain a robust forecast to recover. Lead times are highly volatile, occurring at 1, 2, or 3 periods; I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longest observed delay and covers the pipeline adequately. Shipments from P2 and P6 are confirmed lost, but no new losses are yet confirmed (though the P14 zero-order decision and small P13 order have weakened the current pipeline). To address the chronic stockouts and high volatility, I will use a recent window (N=10) for demand and variance to capture the current regime while being responsive to the stockout recovery needs. The OR backend will calculate a higher base stock because L=3, which helps compensate for the high risk of missing one of the bimodal delivery windows.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 24 units. Pipeline is 347, but this includes potentially lost or delayed shipments (Period 15's 83-unit order is currently in Period 3 of its lead time). Lead times are highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (bimodal), with significant confirmed losses (P2, P6). Demand is relatively stable but shows occasional dips (P16: 41, P17: 86). Given the risk of shipment loss every 4-5 periods and the volatility in arrival times, I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the longer end of the bimodal lead time. I'll use a recent window (N=10) for demand estimation to capture current levels (approx 102/period) while smoothing outliers like P16.

Carry-over insight: Recurring loss pattern: Shipments from P2, P6, and P11 (implied) are missing. This suggests a systemic loss risk approximately every 4-5 orders or periods. The lead time remains bimodal (1 or 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a stockout (On-hand: 0) as of the start of Period 19, following demand of 129 in Period 18. Historical analysis confirms a high-risk environment: shipments from P2, P6, and P11 are likely lost (missing many periods beyond the promised L=2). Lead times are bimodal and volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Recent observed: P16=1, P13=3, P12=3). Currently, 431 units are in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P18), but given the historical loss rate (~20-25% of orders), we cannot treat the entire pipeline as reliable inventory. I will set L=3 via 'explicit' to account for the frequent 3-period delays and provide the backend with a more conservative lead time for basestock calculation. Mean demand (mu_hat) is set using recent_N=10 to capture the current average demand (approx 105 units/period), and sigma_hat is set to 'default' to allow the backend to use the full history for volatility. This combination aims to restore on-hand inventory levels while providing a buffer against the observed shipment losses and lead time instability.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss pattern persists: Every 4-5 shipments, one is lost (P2, P6, P11 confirmed/highly likely). Lead time remains erratic, swinging between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to exhibit a bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) and a systemic shipment loss pattern approximately every 4-5 periods (P2, P6, P11 confirmed/likely lost). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced a stockout in Period 19. The 'In-transit' quantity of 449 includes orders from P15 (83), P18 (84), and P19 (18), plus potentially older shipments that may never arrive. Since we are at Period 20, the P15 order (ordered on P15, lead time 3) should have arrived during Period 18 and been visible in P19's conclude. Its absence suggests it is either delayed (LT > 3) or lost, consistent with the observed failure pattern. To recover from the stockout and account for the high probability of delivery failure and lead time volatility, I am setting the lead time parameter L to 3 (the upper bound of the bimodal distribution) to ensure the OR backend aims for enough stock to cover the longest regular delay. I am using recent demand (N=10) to capture the current mean of ~102 units/period. The pipeline inventory is heavily inflated by likely lost units, so the 'mu_hat' is set explicitly high to force new orders despite the 'In-transit' count, effectively compensating for the 'phantom' ghost inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Recurring shipment loss pattern confirmed: Orders from P2, P6, P11, and now likely P15 (approx. every 4-5 orders) fail to arrive. Lead time remains erratic, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a conservative L=3 assumption for safety.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with on-hand inventory at 0 and multiple stockout periods. Reviewing history, a systemic pattern of lost shipments appears every 4-5 periods (P2, P6, P11, and now P15 - which is 5 periods past placement with no arrival). This loss significantly reduces effective pipeline inventory. Lead times are bimodal and erratic (1 or 3 periods). For Period 21, I am using an explicit L=3 to ensure a higher baseline stock and account for the delayed arrival risk. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the current demand volatility (mean approx 106), as the long-term average includes early periods that may not reflect recent variance. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the observed high variance in the last 10 periods (std dev approx 35), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety buffer to mitigate the frequent stockouts caused by both lost shipments and demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss pattern verified: Orders approximately every 4-5 periods fail to arrive (P2, P6, P11, and P15 now confirmed/highly likely). Lead time remains erratic between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a conservative L=3 planning horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant challenges with on-hand inventory (currently 0) and a documented recurring pattern of lost shipments (P2, P6, P11, and P15). This pattern suggests that roughly every 4-5 periods, an order fails to arrive. Lead times remain highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods. To buffer against the high risk of stockouts seen in Periods 18-21 and the systemic shipment losses, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for a longer pipeline. For demand forecasting, the last 4 periods (P18-P21) show a significant uptick in variance and an increase in mean (avg ~124, with a peak of 192 in P21), suggesting a potential shift. I am selecting recent_N = 4 for mu_hat to capture this recent volatility and higher demand level, while keeping sigma_hat at default to leverage the full history's volatility for a robust safety stock, given the current state of zero units on hand.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Confirmed 4-period stockout (P18-P21) due to combined shipment loss (P15) and demand surge (P21). Systemic loss pattern (approx every 4-5 orders) is the primary driver of pipeline failure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently plagued by a recurring shipment loss pattern (orders from P2, P6, P11, P15, and potentially P20 are missing) and bimodal lead times (1 or 3 periods). We are currently in a severe stockout (on-hand = 0) with zero arrivals in the last 5 periods. The 550 units in-transit consist of orders from P18 (84), P19 (18), and P22 (101), along with likely-lost shipments. Specifically, the P18 order, if on a 3-period lead time, should have arrived by P21 conclude; its absence suggests it might be lost or the lead time is extending. However, we must order aggressively to break the stockout. I am setting L=3 to reflect the high-end of observed lead times. Demand has been volatile, with a significant spike in P21 (192), though recent periods average closer to 110. To recover from the zero-inventory state and account for potential future losses in the 4-5 period cycle, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and set L explicitly to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Potential loss of Period 18 shipment (84 units) as it has not arrived by P22 (lead time 4+ periods). This further confirms the systemic supply fragility every 4-5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $214.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent stockout (Periods 18-22) was caused by a combined demand surge in Period 21 (192 units) and the confirmed/predicted loss of shipments from Period 15 and Period 18. Historical data shows a systemic shipment loss pattern approximately every 4-5 orders (P2, P6, P11, P15, and now likely P18, as it is 5 periods overdue). On-hand inventory recovered slightly to 38 units in Period 23 due to the quick arrival (L=1) of the Period 22 order. However, given the bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) and the high frequency of lost shipments, I will set lead time to 3 to ensure a higher safety stock and account for supply instability. Demand mean and volatility are calculated using Recent_N=10 to capture the recent spike (P21) while smoothing out the lower demand periods (P19, P23).

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss pattern (approx every 4-5 periods/orders) reinforced: P18 shipment (84 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost, mirroring previous losses in P2, P6, P11, and P15.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a recent spike (Period 21: 192), though Period 24 recorded zero demand, likely an anomaly or data delay. The average demand across all non-stockout periods remains around 104 units. The primary challenge is the systemic supply failure; orders from Periods 2, 6, 11, 15, and now 18 are confirmed or highly likely lost, indicating a loss event approximately every 4-5 periods. Lead times for successful deliveries alternate between 1 and 3 periods. To buffer against the bimodal lead time and the recurring shipment losses, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to reflect the maximum observed successful lead time. mu_hat is set to (1+L=4) * 110 (recent mean) = 440, while sigma_hat is set conservatively to capture the high volatility caused by stockouts and supply disruptions.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss pattern (approx every 4-5 periods) confirmed: P18 shipment (84 units) is now 5 periods old and lost, joining P2, P6, P11, and P15. In-transit inventory counts must be discounted to account for these ghost units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to exhibit a severe cycle of shipment losses (P2, P6, P11, P15, and now P18 have never arrived). The lead time remains unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a conservative L=3 for the base stock calculation to cover extended delivery windows. Current on-hand inventory is 0 after a high demand of 155 in P25. The reported in-transit of 449 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P15: 83 units, P18: 84 units, plus the likely loss of the next in-cycle shipment). Effectively, the reliable pipeline is significantly lower. To recover from the current stockout and account for the high volatility and systemic supply failure, I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand (mu_hat) to capture recent volume shifts, and switch to explicit L=3 to ensure a higher safety cushion in the base stock calculation, which helps the OR backend compensate for the undependable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss pattern (approx. every 4-5 periods) confirmed: Period 18 shipment (84 units) is now 8 periods old and officially lost, joining P2, P6, P11, and P15. Pipeline inventory must be mentally discounted by approximately 170+ units (ghost shipments from P15 and P18).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility but no clear evidence of a sustained regime shift, with recent periods fluctuating between 0 and 155. I will continue using a long-term mean to avoid overreacting to zeros caused by stockouts or lead-time anomalies. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable, with a documented 'systemic loss pattern' affecting shipments approximately every 4-5 periods (P2, P6, P11, P15, P18). Current In-transit inventory (475 units) is heavily inflated by these 'ghost' units from P15 (83 units) and P18 (84 units), totaling 167 units that are likely lost. To compensate for this in the OR backend (which does not account for historical losses), I am setting L to 3 to reflect the high end of the 1-3 period lead-time range and using an explicit mu_hat. This mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * mean_demand * (1 + loss_rate). Mean demand is ~105. Loss rate is ~20% (5 losses in 26 periods). Thus (1+3) * 105 * 1.2 = 504. Setting sigma_hat to 160 to account for both demand spikes (e.g., P21: 192) and supply uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: No new patterns detected; previous insight regarding 167+ 'ghost' units in-transit from P15 and P18 remains valid.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a systemic loss of shipments, with approximately every 4-5 orders failing to arrive (confirmed losses for P2, P6, P11, P15, and P18). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 639 units 'in-transit' are deceptive: 167 of these are from P15 and P18 (long overdue and confirmed lost), and 83 units from P19/P20 are also suspect. The remaining valid pipeline includes P26 (26 units) and P27 (164 units). Since lead time is bimodal (1 or 3 periods), I am setting L to 3 to ensure a sufficient safety cushion during longer arrivals. For demand, I am using recent_N (N=7) to capture the higher volatility seen in the last several periods (demand ranging from 0 to 192), ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect this instability while the OR backend attempts to rebuild on-hand inventory given the pipeline 'ghost' units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state is critical: on-hand is 0, and current demand is consistently higher than supply. The systemic shipment loss pattern is a known factor\u2014orders from P2, P6, P11, P15, and P18 have failed to arrive. Looking at the 'In-transit' figure of 613 units, we must discount 83 (P15) and 84 (P18) as confirmed 'ghost' units, leaving a functional pipeline of 446 units. Lead times are bimodal (varying between 1 and 3 periods), so I use an explicit L=3 to ensure the OR backend builds a sufficient buffer for the longer realization. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows high volatility and several stockouts; I select recent_N=10 for mu_hat (approx 103 units per period) to capture this recent behavior without being skewed by the very low demand in P24-26. Sigma_hat is set to the default to account for the overall high demand variability seen across the history.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss pattern remains the primary risk: P15 (83 units) and P18 (84 units) are definitively lost, bringing the total lost shipments to five (P2, P6, P11, P15, P18). Pipelines must be discounted by 167 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30, the on-hand inventory is 123 units following the arrival of the Period 27 order. The systemic shipment loss pattern remains the defining characteristic of this supply chain, with five confirmed losses (P2, P6, P11, P15, P18). The current in-transit inventory of 449 units includes 167 'ghost' units from P15 (83) and P18 (84), meaning the actual reliable pipeline is 282 units. Lead times continue to be erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, but have stabilized at 2 periods for the most recent arrivals (P26, P27). Demand remains volatile with occasional spikes, necessitating a conservative inventory position. I am maintaining L=3 to account for the upper bound of the bimodal lead time distribution. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while smoothing out shorter-term noise. Because the backend OR logic cannot 'see' lost shipments, and those units remain in its internal 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using methods that will naturally keep the base stock target high enough to cover the gaps created by these ghost units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips remains volatile, with the most recent sample at Period 30 showing a significant spike (176 units), which resulted in a stockout (on-hand is 0). The pipeline inventory of 449 units includes two definitively lost shipments: Period 15 (83 units) and Period 18 (84 units), totaling 167 'ghost' units. Net effective in-transit is therefore 282 units. Lead times have mostly stabilized to 2 periods recently (Periods 25, 26, 27 orders), but the history shows a range of 1-3. To protect against the systemic supply fragility and recent demand spikes, I will use a conservative Lead Time (L=3) to buffer the OR backend. Forecast (mu_hat) is set using the last 10 periods to capture recent demand fluctuations, including the recent high of 176 and lows in the 20s-40s. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 10 periods to ensure the service level accounts for this high variance.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss pattern remains the primary risk: P15 (83 units) and P18 (84 units) are definitively lost, bringing total lost shipments to five (P2, P6, P11, P15, P18). Pipelines must be discounted by 167 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant backlog of lost shipments. Historically, orders from P2, P6, P11, P15, and P18 have failed to arrive, totaling 167 'ghost' units in the currently reported 'in-transit' figure of 465. To adjust for this, we must ensure our OR parameters account for a functional pipeline of only 298 units. Demand has remained volatile but broadly consistent with an average around 102 units/period (L+1 demand approx 408). Lead times are bimodal (1 or 3 periods), so we adopt a conservative L=3 to ensure the backend projects a sufficient base stock to cover the longest common delay. mu_hat is set via recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand levels (~102 * 4 = 408), and sigma_hat is set to 'default' to allow the backend to use the full historical variance to protect against the high stockout risk seen in recent periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 31-32) shows values of 101 and 135, aligning with the long-term mean of approximately 105-110. However, the supply pipeline is majorly compromised by a systemic loss pattern where every 4-5 shipments fail to arrive. Specifically, shipments from P2, P6, P11, P15, and P18 are confirmed lost, totaling 167 'ghost' units in the current 449 unit in-transit figure. To account for this, I must force the OR backend to order by inflating the demand requirement (mu_hat) or extending the lead time (L). Lead times have been bimodal (1 or 3 periods). Given the current stockout and the need to clear the 'ghost' inventory units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 to increase the base stock level. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (covering periods 28-32) to capture the recent volatility (avg ~88, but with large spikes). This combination aims to trigger an order that compensates for the lost pipeline while maintaining a safety buffer for the 1-3 period lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss pattern remains the primary risk: P2, P6, P11, P15, and P18 are definitively lost. Pipeline inventory must be mentally discounted by 167 units for all future calculations until those 'units' are aged out of the engine's logic.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 30-33: 176, 101, 135, 147) shows a significant increase, averaging approximately 140 units compared to the long-term average of ~100. I will adjust mu_hat using the last 4 samples to reflect this elevated demand state. Lead time remains erratic (1 to 3 periods); therefore, I maintain a conservative L=3 to account for potential delays and the persistent risk of shipment loss observed historically (P2, P6, P11, P15, P18). There are currently 520 units in-transit. Based on 'Carry-over insights', 167 of these (from P15 and P18) are permanently lost 'ghost' units, but notably, the backend OR engine still counts them in the pipeline. To force the engine to order more despite these ghosts, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory = (L+1) * Expected Demand + Safety Stock. With L=3, we need 4 periods of coverage. Expected demand (140 * 4) = 560. Accounting for the 167 ghost units that reduce 'effective' pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 727 (560 + 167) to ensure the backend generates a sufficient order to cover real demand while bypassing the phantom inventory.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to exhibit a high rate of shipment loss (P2, P6, P11, P15, P18) and bimodal lead times (1 or 3 periods). As of Period 35, the 'In-transit' quantity of 753 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' units from the five confirmed lost shipments (totaling 153+111+?+83+84 = approximately 431+ units, though the engine's 'In-transit' tracking is higher). My goal is to force the OR engine to order despite this high pipeline inventory. I will set L to 3 to account for the upper end of the bimodal lead time. For mu_hat, I'll use an explicit value (480) which represents (1+L=4) * an estimated demand of 120 per period, ensuring we aim for a base stock that covers the 0 on-hand status. For sigma_hat, I will use an explicit value of 80 to account for demand volatility (approx 40 units/period * sqrt(4)). These explicit values bypass the OR engine's reliance on the 'ghost' pipeline units to some extent by setting a high enough target stock level.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Pipeline inventory remains heavily decoupled from reality due to 5+ confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P11, P15, P18). Current in-transit (753) is likely ~60% ghost units. Demand avg remains ~110-140/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised by a systemic shipment loss pattern affecting approximately every 4-5 orders. Confirmed losses include P2 (153), P6 (111), P11 (0 - theoretically lost, though 0 units), P15 (83), and P18 (84). These 431 units remain in the OR engine's 'in-transit' calculation but will never arrive, causing it to severely under-order. Currently, on-hand is 0, and the demand is steady at ~110-140 units. To override the engine's overreliance on 'ghost' pipeline inventory, I am setting L=3 to account for the bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. This explicit value (600) is calculated as (L+1) * mean_demand (4 * 150) to ensure a robust base stock that ignores the phantom in-transit units. This forces the system to place an order despite the 753 units it thinks are coming.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss pattern (every 4-5 periods/orders) is confirmed as the primary driver of stockouts. Pipelines are currently inflated by ~431 units of 'ghost' inventory (P2, P6, P15, P18) that will never arrive. The OR backend's order logic is blinded by these units, necessitating frequent explicit overrides to force inventory into the system.

Daily Reward (R_t): $197.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we have 147 units on-hand after a partial recovery in Period 36. However, the system is severely compromised by a recurring shipment loss pattern (P2, P6, P11, P15, P18, and likely others). The reported 'In-transit' of 520 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost units' that will never arrive. Based on carry-over history, at least 167 units (P15, P18) are permanently lost, and recent gaps suggest other shipments have also failed. The OR backend subtracts the full 520 in-transit from the target base stock, leading to zero or insufficient ordering. Demand remains volatile but averages around 130 per period. To force the system to ignore the 'ghost' inventory and place necessary orders to prevent another stockout, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I'm targeting a total pipeline (On-hand + 'Real' In-transit) of approximately 4 periods of demand (L=3 + 1 for the current period) to handle the bimodal lead time (1-3 periods). 4 periods * 130 units/period = 520 units. To offset the 520 'ghost/total' units visible to the engine, I must set the base stock target higher. I'll set mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer that accounts for the fact that the majority of the current pipeline is non-existent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $588.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, on-hand inventory is 0 after a high demand of 192 in P37. The systemic shipment loss pattern (orders approx. every 4-5 periods being lost) remains the most critical factor. Based on history, shipments from P2, P6, P11, P15, and P18 were lost, totaling 431 units (153+111+0+83+84). The current 'In-transit' of 683 consists of P33 (71), P37 (163), and the 431 'ghost' units. Since P33 is now 5 periods overdue (lead time 5+), it is highly likely lost as well, increasing ghost units to 502. Subtracting 502 from 683 leaves a real pipeline of only 181 units. Current demand is elevated (~130-190 per period). To prevent further stockouts given the bimodal lead time (1-3 periods) and the high probability of the current P37/P38 orders being the next in the 'loss cycle', I am using 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to 600 (based on 150/period * 4 periods) to account for L+1 demand and effectively discount the ghost pipeline. sigma_hat is set high to ensure a robust safety stock against volatile demand and supply fragility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss pattern updated: P33 (71 units) is now 5 periods old and confirmed lost, joining P2, P6, P11, P15, and P18. Total ghost inventory in pipeline is now 502 units. The OR engine's pipeline awareness is significantly compromised.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from a 'blind pipeline' issue where the OR backend believes there are 727 units in-transit, while at least 502 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P11, P15, P18, P33). This leads the engine to under-order or not order at all. The actual demand remains volatile but averages approximately 110 units per period. In Period 38, demand was exceptionally low (6 units) following high demand in P37 (192 units). Current on-hand is 0. To force the engine to place an order despite the massive ghost pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that exceeds the perceived pipeline inventory minus the lost units. We need to maintain a base stock that accounts for (L+1) = 4 periods of demand (~440 units) plus a safety buffer. Since the backend subtracts the total in-transit (727) from the base_stock, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 1200 to ensure a substantial order is triggered to restock the empty shelf.

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from a systemic shipment loss pattern. Ghost inventory (confirmed lost shipments from Period 2, 6, 11, 15, 18, and 33) currently inflates the OR engine's pipeline inventory by approximately 573 units (P2: 153, P6: 111, P11: 0? [re-evaluating history shows P11 was an order of 0, but the 'pattern' of loss every 4-5 periods persists], P15: 83, P18: 84, P33: 71, plus likely others). Despite an 'In-transit' figure of 1082, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory and just missed demand again in Period 39. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this inflated pipeline, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat set significantly higher than the actual expected demand. The actual demand mean over the last 10 periods is ~113. With L set to 3 (due to bimodal 1-3 variability), the default mu_hat would be (1+3)*113 = 452. However, the 1082 pipeline units cause the base stock logic (which subtracts pipeline from target) to zero out any order. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 1600, I ensure the target level exceeds the 'ghost' pipeline and triggers a substantial restock. Sigma_hat is set to 300 to reflect the extreme volatility in arrival reliability rather than just demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss pattern updated: Total confirmed lost units now approximately 573 (P2, P6, P15, P18, P33). Calculated 'In-transit' is ~53% ghost units, blinding the standard logic. Explicit mu_hat overrides are required to maintain stock.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the on-hand inventory is 341 units. However, the systemic shipment loss pattern continues to be the primary concern. We have identified at least six lost shipments (P2, P6, P11, P15, P18, P33) totaling approximately 573 units. These 'ghost' units are permanently included in the OR engine's 'in-transit' calculation (currently 1330), which leads the backend to believe the pipeline is much fuller than it is. To compensate for this blind spot and prevent future stockouts when the current inventory depletes, I am maintaining an explicit mu_hat strategy. Given recent demand volatility (ranging from 6 to 192), a safe estimate for average demand remains around 110-140 per period. With a planning horizon (L+1) of 4 (assuming L=3 for safety), a target of 640-700 units is appropriate. I will set mu_hat explicitly to ensure the engine calculates a base stock that triggers orders despite the inflated pipeline. Setting L=3 (explicit) reflects the conservative end of the bimodal 1-3 lead time distribution.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss pattern updated: Confirmed lost shipments include P2, P6, P11, P15, P18, and P33. Estimated ghost inventory in pipeline is 573 units. This inflation of the in-transit field continues to risk under-ordering by the base OR logic.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant supply chain disruption due to a systemic loss of shipments, with confirmed losses at P2, P6, P11, P15, P18, and P33. This results in approximately 573 'ghost' units in the pipeline that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, leading to chronic under-ordering. Period 41 shows an on-hand inventory of 258 units and an in-transit inventory of 1330 units. However, after discounting for 573 ghost units, the functional pipeline is approximately 757 units. For Period 42, demand has been volatile, with recent samples showing a slight dip (83, 58, 81), but the overall mean remains around 110-140 per period. Given the erratic lead time (swinging between 1 and 3 periods), I maintain a conservative Lead Time (L) of 3. To overcome the OR engine's 'blindness' to lost units and prevent stockouts as the previous bulk orders (P39, P40) are consumed, I will use an explicit mu_hat. 140 (forecasted mean) * (1 + 3) = 560 units. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover demand while the inflated in-transit figure persists.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (approx. 573 units from P2, P6, P11, P15, P18, P33) which blinds the standard OR logic's base-stock calculation. Currently, on-hand inventory is 245 units with an official in-transit of 1330. However, adjusting for ghost units and the 647 units ordered in P40 (which should arrive shortly), my real pipeline is lower than the backend perceives. In Period 40, a large order (647) was placed to force inventory through the system. My current on-hand (245) is sufficient for about 2 periods of average demand (~110-120). Since I have massive orders P37(163), P39(399-delivered), and P40(647) in the pipeline, and the recent arrival pattern shows L=1 or L=2 (P39 arrived in 1, P34 arrived in 2), I will maintain the L estimate at 3 for safety but allow the backend to use recent metrics. To prevent the OR engine from zeroing out orders due to the 1330 'in-transit' units, I set mu_hat explicitly high to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the perceived pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss pattern updated: Confirmed lost shipments include P2, P6, P11, P15, P18, and P33. Estimated ghost inventory in pipeline is 573 units. This inflation of the in-transit field continues to risk under-ordering by the base OR logic.

Demand remains stable, with the most recent observation at 137 and a long-term average around 110-140. Given the high on-hand stock and the systemic issue where the in-transit pipeline (683 units) is inflated by approximately 573 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P11, P15, P18, P33), the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs. The current on-hand inventory (755) is sufficient to cover approximately 5.5 to 6 periods of demand at the current average rate. Therefore, no new orders are necessary this period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand to capture recent stability while maintaining a conservative lead time estimate of L=3 (explicit) to account for the erratic shipping performance (1-3 periods) seen in history.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the system shows 755 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 683. Historical tracking reveals that approximately 573 units are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P11, P15, P18, P33). Thus, the effective pipeline is closer to 110 units. Combined with the 755 on-hand, we have 865 units of reliable inventory. Given the current average demand (mean of last 20 periods \u2248 92 units), 865 units covers approximately 9+ periods of demand. This is well beyond the (L+1) planning horizon, even with a conservative lead time. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=20) to reflect the current demand regime, and L to 'calculate' to reflect the bimodal lead time (1-3 periods). Because on-hand is so high, the OR backend's capped base-stock policy will result in zero orders, which is the desired outcome to avoid excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we have an on-hand inventory of 592 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 683 units is heavily compromised by the systemic shipment loss pattern. Based on historical data, shipments from P2, P6, P11, P15, P18, and P33 (totaling 573 units) are definitively lost but still likely registered in the backend's pipeline inventory calculations. Subtracting these 'ghost' units leaves a realistic pipeline of approximately 110 units (683 - 573). Average demand remains around 110-140 units per period. With only 4 periods remaining and current inventory high (592 on-hand), the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs while ensuring we don't stock out if demand spikes at the end of the simulation. I will set L to 3 (the max observed lead time) to maintain a safety buffer, but keep mu_hat and sigma_hat at default levels to let the system normalize, as on-hand inventory is currently sufficient to cover expected demand for the remaining periods.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss pattern remains the primary risk: confirmed lost shipments include P2, P6, P11, P15, P18, and P33, totaling 573 units. This 'ghost' inventory inflates the in-transit field, potentially causing the OR engine to under-order in future cycles if on-hand levels drop.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the game (Period 47 of 50). The current on-hand inventory is 528 units, which is ample to cover the remaining 4 periods of demand, given the historical average demand of approximately 110-140 units per period. The pipeline inventory (683 units) is heavily inflated by 'ghost' units from historical systemic losses (P2, P6, P11, P15, P18, P33, totaling ~573-644 units depending on aging). However, because the current on-hand inventory alone exceeds the total expected demand for the remainder of the game (4 periods * ~135 units/period = 540 units), further ordering is unnecessary and would only incur avoidable holding costs ($1.0/unit). My objective is to let the inventory bleed down to maximize profit and minimize ending inventory costs. I will set the parameters to effectively stop ordering by utilizing the backend's base-stock logic against the existing (even if ghost-inflated) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss pattern remains the primary risk: confirmed lost shipments include P2, P6, P11, P15, P18, and P33, totaling approximately 573-644 units. However, current on-hand inventory (528) is sufficient for the remaining 4 periods of the game.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the game (Period 48 of 50). The current on-hand inventory is 403 units. Historical demand mean is approximately 110-120 units per period. With only 3 planning periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), the current inventory level (403 units) is more than sufficient to cover the expected total demand (approx. 330-360 units) without further ordering. The 'In-transit' pipeline remains heavily inflated by approximately 573-644 units of 'ghost' inventory (confirmed losses from P2, P6, P11, P15, P18, and P33). Even accounting for these losses, no new orders are necessary to avoid stockouts, and ordering more would only increase holding costs. I will set parameters to ensure a zero-order recommendation by maintaining the default logic while on-hand is high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-123.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49 of 50. The game concludes after Period 50. Current on-hand inventory is 347 units. Historical demand has averaged approximately 100-110 units per period. With only two periods of demand resolution remaining (Period 49 and Period 50), our current on-hand stock of 347 is more than sufficient to cover even a high-side demand scenario (e.g., 2 periods * 170 units). Any new order placed now would arrive, at the earliest, in Period 50 (if L=1) or after the game ends (if L=3), incurring unnecessary holding costs without the possibility of being sold. Therefore, we set parameters to ensure a zero order is placed. We use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with low values relative to on-hand inventory to prevent the OR engine from triggering an order despite the 'ghost' units in the pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $393.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision period of the simulation. The primary objective is to maximize the final reward by ensuring we fulfill demand while minimizing ending inventory that incurs holding costs. Current on-hand inventory is 199 units. Historical demand has averaged approximately 110-140 units per period, with the last 5 periods showing demands of 163, 64, 125, 56, and 148 (average ~111). Given that this is the final period, any order placed now will not arrive in time to satisfy demand within the game's horizon (as promised lead time is 2 periods and the game concludes after this period's resolution). Therefore, the 'in-transit' inventory of 683 units (which includes roughly 573-644 'ghost' units from historical losses) is irrelevant to current sales. With 199 units on hand and expected demand for the final period likely being under 170, we have sufficient stock to cover Period 50. I will set parameters to prevent the OR engine from placing an unnecessary final order, effectively setting a base stock target below current inventory + pipeline levels.
