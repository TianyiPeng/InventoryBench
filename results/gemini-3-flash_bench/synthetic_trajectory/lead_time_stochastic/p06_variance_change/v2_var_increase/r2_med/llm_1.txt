The product is 'chips(Regular)', a staple snack item with a provided initial demand history (P1-P5: 132, 74, 101, 90, 135), averaging approximately 106 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed in P1 will arrive during P3's arrival resolution and be visible at the start of P4. To cover demand for the lead time plus the order cycle (L+1 = 3 periods), I need to account for P1, P2, and P3 demand. However, since the system starts with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, there will be stockouts in P1 and P2 regardless of the P1 order. My goal is to establish inventory for P3 and beyond. Based on the average demand of ~106, a 3-period requirement is ~318 units. Given the relatively high holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4), I will aim to cover the mean demand with a slight buffer for variance. I will order 320 units to seed the pipeline.",

The pipeline (In-transit: 700) consists of orders from P11 (230 units), P12 (150 units), and the order placed in P13 (0 units). The P11 order (230 units) is now at T+3 and is highly likely to arrive in the Period 14 resolution phase. Given the high in-transit volume (700 units) relative to a 3-period demand window (~345-450 units), I have more than enough inventory incoming to cover both the immediate stockout risk and future periods once the P11 and P12 orders land. Adding more to the pipeline now would significantly increase holding cost risks without improving service levels, as the existing 700 units are already overdue or within the normal lead time window.",

Lead times have been highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with some orders (P2, P6) potentially lost. Since P12 hasn't arrived by P15 (L=3), and recent demand suggests we need ~110 units per period, the pipeline of 470 units (spread across P12 and potentially P15/future orders) is theoretically massive relative to demand. However, historical behavior shows a risk of loss. Current on-hand (138) covers P15 demand (~110). If the P12 order (150 units) arrives in P15 resolution, we reach ~178 ending inventory. If it fails, we hit 0 at P16.
