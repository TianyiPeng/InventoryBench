Historical demand from the first 5 periods (122, 121, 60, 83, 105) results in a mean of 98.2 and a standard deviation of 26.6. The OR algorithm recommends an order of 142 units based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, aiming to cover a (1+L)=3 period window. Currently, I have 0 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, as no previous orders were placed. There have been no concluded periods yet to verify if the actual lead time matches the promised 2 periods. Since there are no specific calendar dates or product-specific seasonality signals provided yet, I will use the OR recommendation as a baseline. The OR cap is calculated to ensure a high service level while smoothing out volatility. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning we don't want excessive safety stock.

Period 1 actual demand was 118, which is slightly above average but within normal variance. \n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 143 units aims to reach a base-stock level accounting for the 2-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=3). My goal is to ensure enough stock is in the pipeline to cover demand until the next possible arrival. Since Period 1's order won't arrive until Period 3, and any order placed now (Period 2) won't arrive until Period 4, the total pipeline (142 from P1 + today's order) must cover demand for Periods 2, 3, and 4.

If I follow OR's recommendation of 7, I am relying entirely on the 328 units in-transit. If those arrive, I'll have excess stock (holding cost $1.0 = profit $1.0).

Inventory & Demand Analysis: Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime, averaging ~161 units (Periods 24-26) compared to the long-term average of ~100. Total in-transit is 1019, but subtracting the 659 'phantom' units leaves a 'reliable' pipeline of 360 units (comprising the orders from P23, P24, P25, and P26). P23 (60 units) arrived in P25, so the remaining reliable pipeline is 300 units (P24: 120, P25: 120, P26: 120). Final Strategy: Holding cost equals profit ($1.0), which creates a critical fractile of 0.5; however, given the high stockout frequency and supply chain unreliability, maintaining a buffer is essential. The OR recommendation of 0 is rejected because it assumes the 1019 in-transit units are all valid. At a demand of ~160/period and L=2, we need ~480 units to cover the lead-time window.

However, based on Carry-over Insights, 899 units are confirmed lost or 'phantom' inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Therefore, the 'reliable' pipeline consists only of orders placed in P29 (120), P30 (120), P31 (0), P32 (0), P33 (0), and P34 (0). Of these, only P29 and P30 (total 240 units) are still in transit and potentially reliable. Total Reliable Pipeline = 240 units.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand has fluctuated significantly. While the early mean was ~100, recent demand (P30-P34) averages 89, though P23-P27 averaged ~160. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high loss rate, a conservative but sufficient approach is needed. To cover 3 periods at a high-end average of 130 units/period, we need ~390 units.\n4. **Final Strategy**: On-hand (36) + Reliable Pipeline (240) = 276 units. To reach a target stock of ~400 units, an order of 124 units is appropriate.

The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees the massive (phantom) in-transit total and the zero on-hand with a recent low demand spike.\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0. Expected arrivals in Period 37-38 depend on the P35 (124 units) and P36 (326 units) orders. Since lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, P35 (ordered at P35) should arrive at P36, P37, or P38.

The only viable pipeline units are the 120 units ordered in Period 38.
