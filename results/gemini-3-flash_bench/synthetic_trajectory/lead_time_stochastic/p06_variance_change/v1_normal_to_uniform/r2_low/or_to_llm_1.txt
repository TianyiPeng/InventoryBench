The standard deviation is approximately 25.8. Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) results in a critical fractile of 0.5 (q=1/(1+1)), implying a base-stock level targeting the median demand. Lead-time inference: Promised lead-time (L) is 2 periods. We must cover demand for the current period plus the lead-time (L+1 = 3 periods). OR Recommendation: 142 units. Given the mean demand of ~98, the total expected demand over 3 periods is ~294. However, the OR recommendation is 'capped' to prevent over-ordering in early periods with low starting inventory. The cap formula \u03bc\u0302/(1+L) + 1.645 * \u03c3\u0302/\u221a(1+L) approximates to 98 + 1.645 * 25.8 \u2248 140.4. My objective is to build inventory since we starting from 0.

The OR recommendation of 63 units is conservative. However, because the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning we should aim for the median demand.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand (Periods 1-6) averages 102 units/period. The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it assumes the 354 units in transit (including the potentially lost P2 order) are sufficient to cover the pipeline. However, if the 144 units from P2 are lost, the effective pipeline is only 210 units (P4 and P6 orders). Given the lead time is around 2-3 periods, we need to cover demand for the current period (P7) plus the lead time (P8, P9). Pipeline (210) / Avg Demand (102) = ~2 periods of coverage.

The current effective pipeline of 320 units covers roughly 7-8 periods of demand at the new regime, or 3 periods if demand reverts to the long-term mean. \n3. Strategy: With On-hand at 0 and widespread losses in the pipeline, there is a temptation to order. However, the effective pipeline (320) is still substantial compared to the current low demand. The OR baseline recommends 0 because it sees the massive unadjusted in-transit figure (744) and the recent demand drop. I will follow the OR recommendation of 0 units for this period because even with 424 units discounted as lost, the remaining 320 units in transit (from P18, P19, P20, and P21) are more than sufficient to cover the next 3 periods (L+1) given recent low demand trends.",

Lead-time is erratic (1-3 periods). Pipeline Analysis: In-transit is 724 units. However, based on the history and Carry-Over Insights, a large portion of this is likely lost or significantly overdue: P2(144), P6(110), P15(50), P17(120), P18(20), and P19(100) are all far beyond the promised lead-time of 2 or the maximum observed lead-time of 3. Total estimated loss = 544 units. Effective Pipeline = 724 - 544 = 180 units. This effective pipeline consists of orders from P20 (arrived), P21 (arrived), P26 (100), and P27 (80). Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it doesn't account for the massive stockouts and lost pipeline. Although effective pipeline (180) seems to cover 3-4 periods of demand, current on-hand is 0, and we have failed to satisfy demand in P26 and P27. The order in P26 (100) should arrive in P28 or P29.

Demand Analysis: While the demand regime recently hovered at a low mean of ~40, Period 28 saw a massive spike to 199 units, following a Period 25 spike of 189 units. This suggests high volatility or a return to higher demand. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 units because it counts all 654 'In-transit' units as valid inventory. Strategy: To cover volatile demand (~100-150 avg in spikes) and accounting for lost inventory, I need more than the 110 real units in transit.

Total In-transit is 674 units. However, based on 'Carry-Over Insights', 544 units (from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are effectively lost as they are many periods past due.

The recent 5-period average is approximately 87 units/period, but the peak demand is significantly higher. \n4. **Strategy**: The OR agent recommends 0 because it likely sees the 674 in-transit units as fully available. I must override this. With effective pipeline at 130 (consisting of orders from P28 (30) and P29 (100)), and demand surging back toward ~130-150 units, I need to ensure sufficient stock for (L+1) = 3 periods. 3 periods of demand at ~140 units is 420 units.

The recent 5-period average is ~80 units, but the high spikes suggest a need for higher coverage than the stable regime of 40 units seen around P22. \n4. **OR Baseline & Action**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it views the total 'In-transit' of 764 as sufficient.

However, historical analysis proves a significant portion of this pipeline is illusory.

These effective units are from P33, P37, P41, P42, and P43. Demand remains extremely volatile; the last three periods were 8, 19, and 192, following a period of 75. While the 5-period average is ~60, the peaks exceed 190. With 0 on-hand and the next arrival likely being the P41 order (120 units) or P42 (80 units) depending on lead time (which varies between 1-3 periods), there is a high risk of stockout given recent demand spikes.

Recent demand is extremely volatile, with spikes near 200 following periods of near-zero demand. The 10-period average is approximately 88 units. Pipeline Analysis: Total In-transit is 1184 units. However, confirmed or highly probable lost orders total 764 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30). Additionally, orders from P42 (80), P43 (80), and P44 (100) are in the standard lead-time window. The effective pipeline (viable orders) is 1184 - 764 = 420 units. Lead Time: Actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods for successful deliveries. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 units because it likely ignores the massive volume of lost shipments, seeing only the high total in-transit and current on-hand. However, with an effective pipeline of 420 units and a volatile demand that can hit 200 in a single period, we have enough stock to cover at least 4 periods of average demand. Given we are at P45 of 50, and holding costs equal profit ($1.0), over-ordering now poses a significant risk of leftover stock at the end of the game.

To cover the lead time of 2-3 periods plus the current period (total 3-4 periods of demand), we need roughly 320-360 units of stock. \n\nStrategy: Current effective supply is 230 units.

These 360 units correspond to orders from P33 onwards (P33, P37, P44, P46). \n\nLead-Time Analysis: The actual lead time remains erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. \n\nDemand Analysis: Demand is extremely volatile. While the OR recommendation is 0 (likely due to the inflated raw pipeline number and/or calculation quirks), recent demand shows spikes: P43 (192), P45 (149), P46 (159). The average over the last 5 periods is ~104 units, but the spikes are much higher. \n\nStrategy: Current effective pipeline is 360 units. Expected arrivals for P47/P48 includes the P44 order (100 units) and P46 order (100 units). Given 0 on-hand and high demand volatility with recent 150+ unit spikes, I need to ensure coverage.

Subtracting the 764 lost units results in an effective pipeline of 480 units. These effective units are orders from Periods 33, 37, 44, 46, and 47. Although On-hand inventory is currently 0, the demand continues to exhibit extreme volatility, with three of the last five periods seeing demand over 140 units. The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically correct for a standard base-stock policy given the large raw In-transit figure, but it fails to account for the massive volume of lost shipments. However, because the effective pipeline (480 units) is already quite high relative to the average demand and we are approaching the final periods of the game (P48 of 50), placing a large order now is risky due to high holding costs ($1.0/unit) and potential for the game to end before arrivals occur.
