Pipeline assessment: Total in-transit is 810. Examining history: Order P2 (150) is lost (12 periods elapsed). Order P6 (160) is lost (8 periods elapsed). This leaves active in-transit orders as P11 (180), P12 (220), P13 (100), and the current P14 order. Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from L=1 to L=3. Based on the L+1 logic (where L is the effective lead time to cover risk), I assume a lead time of 3 periods to be safe. Therefore, I need to cover demand for Periods 14, 15, 16, and 17 (approx 412 units). Active in-transit (P11-P13) equals 500 units. Since 500 units are already in the pipeline (more than the L+1 demand requirement) and 0 inventory is on hand, I will place a smaller safety order to maintain flow without overstocking given the high holding cost ($1.0) which equals the profit margin. I will order 100 units to maintain the buffer.",

In terms of lead time, recent arrivals (P37-P40) show a stabilized lead time of 1-2 periods. Reviewing the 'In-transit' pipeline of 1110 units, we must account for 710 units confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P29, P30, P33). This leaves a reliable pipeline of 400 units: P37 (100), P40 (250), and P41 (50). Since P37 (ordered at L=1/2/3) has not arrived by P41 conclude, it is now reaching the 4-period mark and may be delayed or lost; however, the P40 order of 250 is expected to arrive imminently (P42 or P43). With 67 units on hand and 400 reliable units in transit vs. a mean demand of ~126, the current total coverage is approx 467 units (roughly 3.7 periods of stock).
