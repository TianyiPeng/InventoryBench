Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The demand history shows 5 samples: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105. The average demand is 98.2 and the standard deviation is 26.3. The promised lead time is 2, meaning we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Given the high ratio of profit to holding cost ($1.0/$1.0), the backend targets an 50% service level for the base stock calculation, but the safety stock will be driven by the standard deviation. Since the initial inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we will use 'default' or 'recent_N' to establish a baseline. However, there's a visible drop in demand starting around Period 3. Using all 5 samples (N=5) for the mean and variance is a reasonable starting point to avoid over-ordering while building initial stock.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order of 142 units placed in Period 1 is currently in-transit and is expected to arrive during Period 3 resolution (visible at the start of Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and lost 121 units of demand in Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including the pre-game samples) is 122, 121, 60, 83, 105. This averages 98.2 units per period. Since we are in the early stages and have 0 on-hand inventory, I will use the default methods which calculate parameters based on all available history to establish a baseline. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) exposure period (Periods 2, 3, and 4) to ensure we satisfy demand once the pipeline starts arriving.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders placed in P1 (142 units) are expected to arrive during the P3 Arrival Phase (after this decision). Orders placed in P2 (144 units) are expected in P4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 286 in-transit (142+144). Historical demand for P1-P5 shows 122, 121, 60, 83, 105. However, since we are in the 'live' game at Period 3, we only 'know' demand from P1 (121) and P2 (87) from the conclude messages, plus the historical seeds provided in the prompt (122, 121, 60, 83, 105). There appears to be a slight downward trend or high variance. Given lead time L=2, we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. The mean of the 5 historical samples is approx 98.2. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent volatility while sticking to the promised lead time of 2.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first five periods (pre-game and game history) shows a downward trend: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105. The average demand across these 5 points is ~98.2. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 286 units in-transit (orders from Period 1 and Period 2). The promised lead time is 2. Following the timing rules, the order from Period 1 (142 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution and become visible at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms the order from Period 1 has not arrived yet. Since it is now 3 periods since the Period 1 order was placed (L=2 promised), there is a delay. I will stick to the promised lead time 'default' for L but monitor for lost shipments. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 3 samples (60, 83, 105) which average 82.6 to account for the recent lower demand levels compared to the initial periods. Sigma_hat will also use the last 3 samples to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 4, indicating an actual lead time of 3 periods, which is longer than the promised 2. Current inventory is 56 on-hand with 162 in-transit (orders from Period 2 and Period 4). Historical demand over the first 4 periods (121, 87, 96, 86) shows a mean of approximately 97.5 units per period. I will set the lead time to 3 based on the observed arrival. For demand, I'll use the mean of all 4 completed periods to forecast mu_hat, adjusted for the (1+L) review cycle. Given the small sample size and relatively stable demand, defaults based on the 4 samples are appropriate, but I will explicitly set L to 3 to account for the delivery delay.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed as 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 4), exceeding the promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a missed opportunity in Period 5 where demand (140) far exceeded available stock (56). The 'Carry-over Insight' confirms that the actual lead time is 3 periods (observed from the Period 1 order arriving in Period 4), which is longer than the promised 2 periods. Currently, 287 units are in transit (144 from P2, 0 from P3, 18 from P4, and 125 from P5). Given the L=3 reality, the P2 order (144 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's resolution phase and be visible now, but the conclude message for Period 5 shows 0 arrived. This suggests either a further delay or that the P2 order will arrive during Period 6. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (121, 87, 96, 86, 140) averages 106. Since demand in P5 spiked to 140, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this mean. I am setting L to 3 explicitly to account for the observed delay, ensuring the base stock calculation covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the demand over 6 periods shows a mean of approximately 102 units (samples: 121, 87, 96, 86, 140, 83). Current on-hand is 0, with 424 units in transit. Historical evidence from Period 4's arrival (ordered P1, arrived P4) confirms an actual lead time (L) of 3 periods, which is longer than the promised 2. I will set L to 3 explicitly to ensure the OR backend accounts for the extended delay. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (the full available history) to capture the current demand distribution accurately. The OR engine will use these parameters to determine if the 424 units in transit are sufficient to cover the pipeline (1+L=4 periods of demand) or if a new order is needed to reach the target base stock, while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently exhausted (on-hand=0) due to lead times being longer than the promised 2 periods. Analysis of 'conclude' messages confirms that orders from Period 1 and Period 4 both arrived with a lead time of 3 periods. The order from Period 2 (144 units) is now at lead time 6 and has not arrived; however, given the variability, it is treated as highly delayed/potentially lost, but the pipeline (406 units) remains substantial. Demand across the first 7 periods averages ~98.6 units, but has shown high variance (60-140 range). Since L=3 is consistently observed for successfully delivered orders, I am setting L to 3. I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent volatility more accurately. I am setting sigma_hat to explicit (100) to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation is robust against current delivery delays and stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 and P4 orders both arrived in 3 periods); P2 order (144 units) is over 5 periods late and potentially lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but historical arrivals consistently show an actual lead time of 3 periods (P1 arrived P4, P4 arrived P7, P5 arrived P8). Consequently, I am setting L to 3. There is a confirmed lost or significantly delayed shipment from Period 2 (144 units), which is now 7 periods old; I will treat this as lost and rely on the pipeline of orders from Period 6 (137 units) to recover stock. Demand over the last 8 periods (including samples provided) has averaged 102.7 units. Period 9 demand follows P8 (126) and P5 (140), suggesting some volatility. Given L=3, mu_hat calculation is (1+L) * mean = 4 * 102.7 \u2248 411. I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat (N=8) and sigma_hat (N=8) to capture the current demand regime which seems fairly stable around the ~100/period mark, despite stockouts suppressing actual sales data.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: P2 order (144 units) is now 7 periods late; confirmed as a lost shipment for planning purposes.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed arrivals (P1 and P4 orders) consistently show a lead time of 3 periods. The P2 order (144 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is confirmed lost; this unit count must be mentally excluded from 'In-transit' (408 units) when considering the pipeline, leaving an effective pipeline of 264 units (P6, P9 orders). Demand from Period 1 to Period 9 averages 101.4 units/period with relative stability. Using L=3, the mu_hat should cover (1+L)=4 periods. I am setting L=3 explicitly and using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility while acknowledging the extended lead time to prevent stockouts, which have occurred frequently due to the lead time mismatch and lost shipment.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to maximize reward. Currently, the SKU is facing a severe stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of history confirms a sustained lead-time shift: every fulfilled order since Period 4 has arrived with a lead time of 3 periods (P1 at P4, P4 at P7, P5 at P8), instead of the promised 2. Furthermore, the P2 order (144 units) is now 8 periods late and is confirmed as a lost shipment. The in-transit inventory of 419 units reflects orders from P6 (137), P9 (127), P10 (11), and the lost P2 order (144). Subtracting the 144 lost units from the pipeline (419 - 144 = 275) leaves 275 units realistically in-transit. Applying L=3 is necessary to account for the actual delivery speed. For demand, the mean of all periods (ignoring stockout distortion) is approximately 101.5 units. With L=3, the mu_hat (covering lead+review) should be 4 * 101.5 \u2248 406. I will use 'explicit' for L to fix it at 3, and 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stable demand mean while responding to the high holding cost ($1) and profit ($1) balance (50% service level target).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed delivery for historical orders (P1, P4, P5) is consistently 3 periods. The order from Period 2 (144 units) is significantly overdue (10 periods since order) and is treated as lost. Consequently, the 'In-transit' quantity of 419 units likely includes this lost 144, leaving a real pipeline of 275 (P6: 137, P9: 127, P10: 11). Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~102 units per period over the last 11 periods. Current on-hand is 0, and combined with potential stockouts from the delayed P6 order, I must ensure the OR backend accounts for the actual lead time of 3. I set L=3 explicitly and use the most recent 11 samples for mu and sigma to capture the current demand distribution (mean ~102.7, which at L=3 implies mu_hat ~411).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 conclude, we observed two arrivals: the Period 9 order (127 units) arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 10 order (11 units) arrived in 2 periods. This confirms a variable lead time between 2 and 3 periods. The P2 order (144 units) remains missing and is treated as lost. Current demand fluctuates between 77 and 140. Given the on-hand inventory (48) and in-transit units (281 - 144 lost = 137 net), we need to maintain a safety buffer for the variable lead time. I will use L=3 to be conservative since the majority of recent arrivals followed a 3-period lead time. Mu_hat will be set using recent_N=5 (Periods 8-12 demand: 126, 97, 102, 114, 90; average ~106) to capture current demand levels, and sigma_hat will use the same N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: P10 order arrived in 2 periods, while P1, P4, P5, and P9 orders all arrived in 3 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with a recent mean of approximately 104 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 9-13: 97, 102, 114, 90, 111). Regarding lead time, observations from Periods 4, 7, 8, 12, and 13 show that while the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods in the majority of cases (P1, P4, P5, P9 arrived in 3; P10 arrived in 2). The P2 order (144 units) is now 12 periods late and definitively lost. Current inventory is critically low (on-hand: 0) with 376 units in-transit. To account for the observed actual lead time of 3, I am explicitly setting L=3. For demand, I am using the last 5 periods to capture the current stable mean (approx 104/period), which for L=3 requires mu_hat = (1+3) * 104 = 416. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 5 periods to capture local volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent history (Periods 13-14) shows demand remaining stable with a mean around 103 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 412 units in-transit. Based on historical 'conclude' messages, the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9 orders) with an occasional 2-period exception (P10). I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to better cover the pipeline requirement of (L+1) periods, which at L=3 equals 4 periods of demand. The P2 order (144 units) is now 13 periods late and remains lost, so it must be ignored in the pipeline calculations. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a recent window of 10 periods (N=10) to capture current demand levels excluding the early high/low noise from Periods 1-4, ensuring the OR engine calculates a base stock that accounts for both the expected lead time delay and the observed demand volatility.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time is consistently 3 periods (P1: 3, P4: 3, P5: 3, P9: 3). Although P10 arrived in 2 periods, the dominant pattern is 3. The system is currently in a stockout (On-hand: 0) with 414 units in-transit (orders from P13, P14, P15). Assuming a 3-period lead time, the P13 order (95 units) is expected to arrive in P16, followed by P14 (36 units) in P17. Historical demand shows a mean of roughly 98.5 units per period with moderate variance. I will set L to 3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the mean of the most recent 10 periods (approx 100/period) to capture the current regime, resulting in (1+L)*mean = 400. Sigma_hat will be set using recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system has 3 units on-hand and 319 units in-transit (from Period 14 and 15). Analyzing the arrival history, most shipments arrive with a lead time of 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P13) despite the promised 2. A lead time of 3 is more realistic for planning. The order from Period 2 (144 units) is confirmed lost, as verified in past insights. Demand remains relatively stable, with the last 10 periods (P7-P16) showing a mean of approximately 96 units/period. To ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed delay, I am setting L to 3. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the initial higher variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight downward trend in periods 15-17 (64, 92, 37 units respectively), though demand is notoriously volatile. Historical analysis from Period 1 to 17 shows an average demand of approximately 95 units per period. Regarding lead times, the 'Carry-over Insights' and historical 'conclude' messages indicate that while the promised lead time (L) is 2, the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods (6 out of 7 recorded arrivals had L=3). One shipment (Period 2) is definitively lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), with 349 units in-transit. To ensure the OR backend accounts for the frequent 1-period delay, I am setting the lead time L to 3. For demand, I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture the current mean while smoothing out the outlier drop in Period 17, and standard deviation will be calculated from the same window to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Lead time remains consistently 3 periods across recent arrivals (P13 and P14 orders both followed this pattern).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 370 units in-transit. Lead time analysis: Historical data consistently shows an actual lead time of 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P13, and P14 all arrived in 3 periods), despite a promised lead time of 2. Only P10 arrived in 2 periods. Therefore, I am setting L=3 to account for this systematic delay and ensure the pipeline covers more periods of demand. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5-period average (P14-P18) is 76 units, which is lower than the long-term average (~95). Setting N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture this recent cooling in demand while remaining responsive to the persistent stockouts observed when arrivals are late. The P2 order (144 units) remains lost and is correctly excluded from pipeline inventory by the OR backend through standard accounting, but the setting of L=3 helps compensate for general unreliability.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face 0 on-hand inventory and 370 units in-transit. Historical data analysis confirms the actual lead time (L) is consistently 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P13, P14 orders all took 3 periods), despite the promised 2. One order from P2 (144 units) is definitively lost. Recent demand (P18-P19) shows a significant drop (92 to 5), possibly indicating a holiday or seasonal shift, though earlier periods (P15-P17) were also lower on average compared to the start. The mean demand of the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 58.6 units. Given the high $1.0 holding cost relative to $1.0 profit, the target service level is 50% (q = 0.5), making the base stock equal to mu_hat. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the consistent delay. Demand is currently volatile with a downward trend; using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat will help the OR backend adjust to the lower recent demand volume while maintaining responsiveness to the recent drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing: Recent 5-period average (58.6) is significantly lower than initial 5-period average (103), suggesting a downward regime shift or seasonal low.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 16-20) shows a significant decrease in volume, with an average demand of approximately 47 units compared to the initial project average of ~100. This downward shift is recorded in the carry-over insights and requires a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat (N=5) to avoid over-ordering during this slump. Regarding lead time, the historical data (Periods 4, 7, 8, 12, 16, 17) consistently shows an actual lead time of 3 periods, despite the promised 2. The P2 order is confirmed lost. Therefore, I will explicitly set L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the actual delay observed in 80% of successful arrivals. This alignment of mu_hat to the current low-demand regime and L to the actual lead time will help prevent stockouts once current in-transit inventory (370 units) clears, while also mitigating excessive holding costs if the lower demand persists.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has significantly declined. Over the last 5 periods (P17-P21), the average demand is 42.2 units, a sharp drop compared to the long-term average (approx. 90). The lead time is consistently 3 periods based on historical arrivals (P1, P4, P5, P9, P13, P14), despite the promised lead time of 2. Currently, there is an inventory gap: on-hand is 0, and there are 370 units in-transit (orders from P15, P17, P18, and P6 which is likely lost). Specifically, the P15 order (2 units) is overdue (placed 7 periods ago), the P17 order (66 units) is due, and P18 (21 units) is soon due. The large in-transit figure (370) likely includes the P6 order (137 units) which is 16 periods late and clearly lost, as well as several other missing orders. To account for the confirmed lower demand regime, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat. I will set L to an explicit value of 3 to reflect the established actual lead time. This will help the OR backend calculate a target stock level that avoids over-ordering during this low-demand period while accounting for the reality of 3-period delivery.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 17-21 average demand dropped to 42.2 units (~50%+ decrease from early periods).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently zero with 370 units in transit. Historical analysis confirms a demand regime shift starting around Period 17, with average demand dropping from approximately 100 units to roughly 45 units per period. The recent 5 periods (P18-P22) have an average demand of 43.8 units. The lead time (L) has consistently been 3 periods, rather than the promised 2, except for one outlier at P12. Pipeline inventory is currently high (370 units) relative to the new demand level (45 units/period), as orders placed between P15 and P18 (totaling 89 units) and likely P6 (137 units) are pending or in the case of P6, significantly overdue and potentially lost. However, the 'In-transit' count includes these. Given the high in-transit volume versus the lower demand regime, I will set L to 3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time and use recent_N (N=6) to capture the lower demand mean (approx 43) and variance. This strategy prevents over-ordering while waiting for the substantial pipeline to arrive and satisfy the current lower demand.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant bearish regime shift starting around Period 17. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P17-P23) is approximately 38.4 units, compared to the early-game average of over 100. For Period 24, I will use a recent window of N=7 to capture this lower demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Regarding lead time, the historical data suggests an actual lead time of 3 periods is much more likely than the promised 2 (with only one instance of a 2-period arrival). Consequently, I am setting L to 3. Currently, there are 0 units on-hand and 370 units in-transit. The OR backend will use the provided mu_hat, sigma_hat, and L=3 (for a total pipeline cover of L+1 = 4 periods) to determine the next order. Given the 370 units already in-transit and the decreased demand, it is likely the backend will not order additional stock immediately to avoid high holding costs while awaiting the arrival of the backlog (P15, P17, P18 orders are still pending).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant regime shift. The initial periods averaged ~100 units, but demand has plummeted since Period 17, with an average of approximately 36 units over the last 8 periods (P17-P24). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are 370 units in transit. Given the observed lead time is predominantly 3 periods (despite a promise of 2), I am setting L to 3. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this lower demand regime (avg ~36). With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend will aim to set the base stock at the median of the forecast distribution. The high pipeline inventory (370 units) relative to the new demand level (4*36=144 for L+1) should prevent new orders from being placed until the excess is cleared, protecting against high holding costs while the system reconciles the lost Period 2 order and the subsequent glut.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand from Period 17-24 is ~36.5 units, down from ~100 in early periods. Lead time remains consistently 3 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the situation for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant demand spike in Period 25 (189 units), which follows a sustained low-demand regime (Periods 17-24 avg: ~36.5). This spike suggests either a seasonal event or a new regime. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 370 units, composed of orders from Period 15 (2 units), Period 17 (66 units), and Period 18 (21 units), plus the original lost order from Period 2 (144 units) which technically remains in 'In-transit' in the system view even if planning treats it as lost. Excluding the lost P2 order, we have 89 units expected to arrive. Given the lead time is consistently 3 periods, the P15 order is extremely overdue and likely lost, while the P17/P18 orders (87 units total) are significantly overdue (8+ periods). This indicates a supply chain failure or extreme lead time drift. I will adjust L to 3 (observed actual) and mu_hat to handle the recent demand volatility. I will use recent_N=9 for demand (covering the low regime plus the recent spike) to balance the forecast against the sudden jump, while maintaining a higher sigma_hat explicitly to account for this massive variability (from 13 to 189).

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Supply chain disruption likely; orders from P17 and P18 (87 units) are now 8+ periods overdue, suggesting they may be lost alongside the P2 and P15 orders. Period 25 demand spike (189) breaks the previous low-demand regime.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we are facing a severe supply crisis. The On-hand inventory is 0, and despite 370 units being 'In-transit', analysis of the game history suggests most of these are likely lost. Specifically, orders from P2 (144 units), P15 (2 units), P17 (66 units), and P18 (21 units) are long overdue (P2 is 25 periods overdue; P17 and P18 are 8+ periods overdue). Only very recent orders (none since P18) or the system-calculated pipeline are active. Demand is highly volatile: after a Period 17-24 low-regime (avg ~36), Period 25 saw a spike (189) and Period 26 returned to 39. To recover, I must set the lead time to its observed reality (3 periods). Regarding demand (mu_hat), the sudden spike in Period 25 makes a simple mean unreliable. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent volatility and the low-demand regime while weighting the spike. Given Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the service level q is 0.5 (Base Stock = Median Demand over L+1). By setting L to 3 (explicit), I force the OR engine to account for a 4-period demand window (L+1), which is necessary to capture enough stock to survive the lead time and the current zero-inventory state.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: Orders from P17 (66 units) and P18 (21 units) are now 8+ periods overdue and considered lost. Total confirmed lost units now include P2, P15, P17, and P18. Demand remains erratic with a major outlier in P25 (189).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe inventory crisis with 0 on-hand units and 370 units in-transit, many of which appear lost or significantly delayed. The actual lead time has consistently been 3 periods, but orders from P15 (2 units), P17 (66 units), and P18 (21 units) are now 9-12 periods old and have not arrived, confirming they are lost. This leaves 281 units in the active 'pipeline'. Demand has been erratic: after a low-demand regime (avg ~36.5), we saw a massive spike in P25 (189) followed by low numbers (39, 16). Given this volatility and the high stockout risk, I am forecasting mu_hat using recent_N (N=11) to balance the low-demand regime with the recent spike, setting L=3 to match observed lead times. This allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock against the remaining 'active' pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Severe supply chain disruption confirmed; shipments from P15, P17, and P18 (89 units total) are 9+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. Active pipeline inventory is 281 units, not 370.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the system shows 0 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 370 units. However, historical evidence indicates severe supply chain disruptions. Analysis of 'conclude' messages confirms that shipments from Period 2 (144 units), Period 15 (2 units), Period 17 (66 units), and Period 18 (21 units) are substantially overdue (8-26 periods late) and are considered lost. This leaves an effective pipeline of 137 units (370 - 233). Since no new orders have been placed since Period 18, and recent demand has been highly erratic with massive spikes in Period 25 (189) and Period 28 (199) interspersed with low periods, the current effective pipeline is likely insufficient. I am setting L to 3 based on the most frequent historical lead time. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=4 to capture the recent high-volatility regime (avg ~111 units per period). This will trigger the OR backend to place orders to cover the demand spikes while accounting for the lost units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Effective pipeline confirmed as 137 units; 233 units (from P2, P15, P17, P18) are permanently lost. Demand has entered a high-variance regime with spikes near 200 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the inventory status is critical (0 on-hand). The 'In-transit' figure of 443 units is highly misleading due to substantial historical shipment losses. Specifically, orders from P2 (144), P15 (2), P17 (66), and P18 (21) totaling 233 units are confirmed lost based on having exceeded the consistent 3-period lead time by 8-28 periods. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 210 units (from P29 order and others not yet concluded). Demand has shifted from a low-regime (~36 units) to a high-variance/high-mean regime, with Period 25-29 averaging 115.8 units and featuring spikes near 200. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this new high-demand regime using a recent window (N=5) and set L to an explicit 3 to account for the consistent actual lead time, ensuring the backend targets a base stock that covers the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: High-variance demand regime confirmed (avg ~115 units over last 5 periods, with spikes near 200). Effective pipeline inventory verified as 210 units; 233 units from early/mid periods are definitively lost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the stock status is critical with On-hand: 0. The demand environment is high-variance, with an average of 80.6 units over the last 5 periods (P26-30: 39, 16, 199, 136, 13), though this average is skewed by two massive spikes. The supply chain has a confirmed history of lost shipments: early orders (P2, P15) and mid-regime orders (P17, P18) are definitively lost. Total reported In-transit is 464, but subtracting these 233 lost units (144+2+66+21) leaves an effective pipeline of 231 units (orders from P29=73, P30=21, plus earlier ones not yet arrived). To force the OR backend to account for these lost units, I must manipulate the L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat parameters. I am setting L=3 based on consistent historical observations. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (covering the high-variance regime) but will use an 'explicit' value to effectively handle the lost units and spikes. mu_hat = (1+L) * mean(last_5) = 4 * 80.6 = 322.4. sigma_hat will be set to an explicit value based on the high variance: std(last 5) is ~85, so sigma_hat = sqrt(4) * 85 = 170. This configuration aims to trigger an order despite the inflated total in-transit count.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Lost shipments totaling 233 units (P2, P15, P17, P18) persist in the system 'In-transit' count, requiring offsetting via explicit base stock parameters.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 32. Current On-hand is 0. The In-transit count is 464, but based on historical tracking (Carry-over insights), 233 units are definitively lost (P2, P15, P17, P18). Therefore, the 'effective' pipeline is 231 units. Actual lead time is consistently 3 periods. Demand has entered a high-variance regime with an average of approximately 115 units over the last 5 periods (P27-P31: 16, 199, 136, 13, 122), though individual spikes reach ~200. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) In-transit count of 464 from the base stock, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to force a base stock high enough to account for the 233 missing units plus future demand. Target base stock = (Effective Pipeline Needed) + (Lost Units to offset). Effective base stock for L=3 should cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. At 115 avg demand, that's 460 units. Adding the 233 lost units offset gives a total required base stock of 693. Setting mu_hat to 693 ensures the backend calculation (693 - 464) results in a meaningful order to cover upcoming demand while correcting for the phantom inventory.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' count of 693 units. However, based on extensive history, 233 units (P2: 144, P15: 2, P17: 66, P18: 21) are confirmed lost, and several recent orders (P29, P30, P32) are still within the expected 3-period lead time. The effective pipeline is approximately 460 units. Demand is currently in a high-variance regime following a period of extreme lows; the last 5 periods (P28-P32) average 105 units but include spikes near 200. Since we are frequently out of stock, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the consistent delay observed. To ensure we recover from the persistent stockouts caused by the supply chain disruptions and to account for the high demand volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to target a high service level relative to the effective pipeline. The mu_hat of 440 covers 4 periods of average demand (110 * 4), and sigma_hat is set to 150 to buffer against the spikes (e.g., 189, 199). These parameters will signal the OR engine to place an order that bridges the gap between the effective pipeline and required stock levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-195.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, a large order of 229 units placed in Period 32 arrived with a 1-period lead time, resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 212 units. This arrival resolves the immediate stockout but highlights significant supply chain noise. The 'In-transit' count of 464 includes 233 units confirmed lost (P2, P15, P17, P18), which the OR backend incorrectly views as valid pipeline. Consequently, the true effective pipeline (excluding lost units and recent arrival) is 464 - 233 - 229 = 2 units (remaining from P29/P30 orders). Demand remains highly volatile, with the last 10 periods averaging ~80 units but showing extreme variance (13 to 199). I will set L to 1 based on the most recent delivery, but I must significantly inflate mu_hat using 'explicit' to account for both the 233 lost units and the required coverage for 2 units of effective pipeline against expected high-variance demand. With a target service level q around 0.5 (as profit and holding cost are both $1.0), the goal is to prevent the OR backend from under-ordering while carrying significant on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Lead time shift observed; P32 order arrived in only 1 period, suggesting a possible reduction in lead time or high variability compared to the previous 3-period trend.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the current on-hand inventory is 156. The 'In-transit' count is 464, but carry-over insights confirm that 233 units (from P2, P15, P17, and P18) are permanently lost shipments. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 231 units (464 - 233). The lead time has shown significant variability recently: while historically 3 periods, the P32 order arrived in just 1 period. To be conservative given recent volatility, I will use an explicit lead time of 2 periods (the promised value). Regarding demand, the last 10 periods (P25-P34) show a high-variance regime following a low period, with an average of (~189+39+16+199+136+13+122+55+17+56)/10 = 84.2 units. Recent periods (P32-P34) have softened significantly. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture this higher volatility regime while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock for the current period's decision.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Effective pipeline inventory corrected to 231 units; 233 units (P2, P15, P17, P18) remain indefinitely in system counts as lost.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an in-transit inventory of 464 units. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, 233 of these units (from P2, P15, P17, and P18) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The effective in-transit inventory is therefore 464 - 233 = 231 units. The most recent order was P32 (229 units), which arrived in Period 33 (L=1). Currently, on-hand inventory is 140 units. Total effective inventory (on-hand + effective in-transit) is 140 + 231 = 371. Demand has been highly volatile recently, with a mix of very low (16, 17) and very high (189, 199) periods. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P26-P35) is approximately 74 units. To account for the 233 'phantom' units still being counted as pipeline inventory by the OR engine, I must set the lead time to an explicit value that increases the base stock (Inventory Position) target. I will set L=3 to maintain a buffer and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the recent high-volatility regime (N=10) to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the expected demand plus the lost unit offset.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment continues to be highly volatile, with Period 36 recording 187 units, following a period of low demand (16-56 units). The current on-hand inventory is 0 after exhausting stock in Period 36. The 'In-transit' count is 464 units, but historically, 233 units (from P2, P15, P17, P18) are confirmed lost and never arrived. Removing these from the record leaves a true active pipeline of 231 units (orders from P29, P30, and any subsequent recent orders). Lead time has recently shown extreme variability: most historically arrived in 3 periods, but the P32 order arrived in just 1 period. To account for this uncertainty and the lost units inflating the backend's perception of inventory, I will set L to 1 (anticipating the possibility of faster arrivals while keeping the base stock calculation tighter) and use an explicit mu_hat. The mu_hat is calculated to cover approximately 130 units per period (the 5-period average is roughly 65, but we must account for frequent spikes near 200). With L=1, the base stock needs to cover 2 periods of demand plus a buffer for the lost 233 units in the system. Targeting a base stock of approximately 490 (260 for demand + 230 to offset lost units) ensures the OR backend places an order despite the phantom inventory.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 233 units as 'In-transit' (from Periods 2, 15, 17, and 18) that are confirmed lost. The current internal 'In-transit' count is 490, but the effective pipeline is only 257 (490 - 233). This effective pipeline includes orders from P29 (73), P30 (21), P32 (already arrived), and P37 (26). Demand remains highly volatile with a regime average of approximately 82 units over the last 10 periods (since P28). To compensate for the 233 ghost units in the OR backend's calculation, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. With an expected lead time L=2 (reflecting the recent P32 arrival and promised time) and a demand average of ~85, the theoretical base stock for (L+1) periods is ~255 plus safety stock. However, since the OR backend subtracts the inflated 'In-transit' (490) from the base_stock, I must inflate mu_hat significantly to ensure an order is actually placed if needed. Current on-hand is 0. Recent demand: P36 (187), P37 (111). I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost stock gap and maintain a high service level for this volatile 'Regular Chips' category.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 650 units. However, based on the carry-over insights and historical record, a cumulative total of 233 units from early to mid-game periods (P2: 144, P15: 2, P17: 66, P18: 21) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. Furthermore, shipments from P29 (73 units) and P30 (21 units) are now 8+ periods overdue, suggesting they too are lost. Total confirmed/likely lost units = 233 + 73 + 21 = 327. Effective pipeline = 650 - 327 = 323 units. Demand analysis over the last 10 periods (P29-P38) shows high variance with a mean of ~100 units (100.3) and significant spikes (199, 187, 179). To ensure availability, I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods. Lead time has been highly variable recently (1 period for P32 vs. 3 periods historically); I will set L to 2 to represent the promised value while acknowledging the uncertainty. With Lead=2, mu_hat (1+L) should be approximately 300.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative likely lost shipments increased to 327 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P29, P30) persisting in the system In-transit count. Recent demand (P29-P38) suggests a high-variance regime with a mean of ~100 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, on-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 490 units. Based on historical data, we have identified 327 units as permanently lost (P2: 144, P15: 2, P17: 66, P18: 21, P29: 73, P30: 21). Subtracting these from the system's 490 units leaves an effective pipeline of 163 units (consisting of the P37 order of 26 units and the unknown current order). Demand has shifted to a high-variance, high-volume regime. The last 11 periods (P29-P39) show a mean of 99.4 units with significant spikes near 200. Lead time has recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with the last two arrivals (P32 and P38) both arriving in just 1 period. To account for the lost shipments and prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an 'explicit' method. I calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * Mean_Demand + Lost_Stock_Adjustment. With L=1 (recent lead time) and mean=100, (1+1)*100 = 200, plus the 327 lost units, resulting in 527. This forces the base stock high enough to offset the phantom 'In-transit' units that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Effective pipeline inventory is only 163 units; confirmed lost units in system count total 327 (P2, P15, P17, P18, P29, P30). Lead time recently observed at 1 period for P32 and P38.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' count of 527 units, but analysis of history confirms that 327 of these units (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P29, and P30) are indefinitely lost shipments. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is only 200 units (P37: 26, P40: 37, plus the remaining 137 units expected from recent ordering activity not yet arrived). Demand has demonstrated extreme volatility (0 to 199 range), but the last 12 periods suggest a stabilized high-variance mean around 95 units per period. Lead times have recently shifted from 3 periods to 1 period (P32 and P38), though I will use L=2 to remain conservative given the high historical variability. To account for the 327 'ghost' units in the pipeline that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 612. Calculation: (1 + L) * Mean + Lost_Units = (1 + 2) * 95 + 327 = 285 + 327 = 612. This ensures the OR engine places an order sufficient to cover demand despite the misleading in-transit data.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Cumulative lost shipments are confirmed at 327 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P29, P30). These units must be added to mu_hat as an offset since the OR backend subtracts them from the order quantity as valid pipeline inventory.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an in-transit pipeline of 612 units. However, based on tracking historical delays and non-arrivals, 327 of these units (from orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P29, and P30) are considered permanently lost. The actual active pipeline is 285 units (orders P37, P40, P41, plus those from P1-P42 and unspecified). Lead times have recently shifted from 3 periods to 1 period (seen in P32 and P38). Demand is in a high-variance regime; the average over the last 10 periods is 85.6 units, but with spikes near 200. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the phantom 'lost' inventory, I must artificially inflate the base stock by shifting mu_hat to cover the expected demand (L+1) plus the 327 lost units. Using L=1, mu_hat = (1+1)*85.6 + 327 = 498.2. I'll use an explicit sigma_hat of 120 (approx sqrt(2) * 85) to account for high volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the system shows an In-transit count of 612 units. However, based on the historical tracking, 327 of these units are confirmed lost (P2, P15, P17, P18, P29, P30). The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 612 - 327 = 285 units. These 327 lost units must be added back into the target base stock (mu_hat) so the OR backend's subtraction (base_stock - pipeline) correctly accounts for the real active pipeline. Recent demand (P38-P42) has been highly volatile: 179, 197, 75, 8, 19 (Average: 95.6). To protect against both stockouts and holding costs in this high-variance environment, I will use a conservative demand estimate of 100 units/period. The lead time has recently shifted to 1 period (observed at P33 and P39), so L is set to 1. The target base stock for L=1 (covering 2 periods) is approximately 200 units. Adding the 327 'lost' units as an offset results in a mu_hat of 527. Sigma is set to reflect the significant recent volatility (std dev of approx 85, scaled for L=1).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed effective pipeline is 285 units; system In-transit count of 612 contains 327 units from lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P29, P30) requiring an additive parameter offset.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we are managing chips(Regular). The system reports 575 units in-transit, but 327 units from mid-game periods (P2, P15, P17, P18, P29, P30) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline inventory is 248 units (P37, P41 orders). Lead times are erratic, recently alternating between 1 and 3 periods; I will assume 3 periods for safety (L=3). Demand has entered a high-variance regime. Over the last 15 periods (P29-P43), mean demand is approximately 89 units with significant spikes. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) horizon, I must offset the 327 'phantom' units that the backend incorrectly subtracts from the order. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat set to (1+L) * mean + offset = (4 * 89) + 327 = 683. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high variance (std ~75 units over the last 15 periods, so sqrt(4)*75 = 150).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Effective pipeline is 248 units; cumulative lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P29, P30) remain at 327 units and must be offset in mu_hat calculations.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' count of 598 units contains a verified total of 327 lost units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P29, P30). The current effective pipeline is 271 units. To correct for the lost units being incorrectly subtracted by the OR backend, I must add 327 to the mu_hat calculation. Demand recently shows high variance but a lower mean; the average over the last 15 periods (roughly P30-P44) is approximately 85. Assuming a 3-period lead time window (L=3, covering 4 periods of demand), the predicted demand is 4 * 85 = 340. Adding the 327 unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 667. I use L=3 to reflect the most common lead time despite recent 1-period outliers. Sigma_hat is set to 230 to account for high demand volatility (spikes up to 192/197 units recently).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46. Demand for chips(Regular) remains highly volatile, with recent values ranging from 1 to 192 (Period 43-45 average is 114). The system shows 598 units 'In-transit', but we must reconcile this with lost shipments. Confirmed lost shipments total 327 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P29, P30). Subtracting these from 598 leaves an effective pipeline of 271 units (P41, P44). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently. Since the OR backend subtracts the full 598 units from the base stock to calculate the order, I must ensure 'mu_hat' (representing demand over L+1 periods) is set high enough to offset the 327 'phantom' units. With an estimated daily demand of ~100 and L=2 (L+1=3), base demand is 300. Adding the 327 unit offset, mu_hat should be approximately 627. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this offset is applied, and 'calculate' for L. Sigma_hat is set to a higher recent N (N=10) to account for the extreme demand swings (1 to 192).

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Effective pipeline is 271 units; confirmed lost units in system 'In-transit' count total 327 (P2, P15, P17, P18, P29, P30), requiring a persistent additive offset in the mu_hat parameter to prevent under-ordering.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 10 periods (P37-P46), demand has shown extreme volatility, with spikes near 200 units (P39: 197, P43: 192) and sharp drops near zero (P41: 8, P44: 1). The mean over these 10 periods is approximately 109 units. In-transit inventory is currently 627 units. However, based on extensive history, 327 units from P2, P15, P17, P18, P29, and P30 are confirmed lost shipments that have never arrived. This leaves an effective pipeline of 300 units (627 minus 327). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these phantom 'In-transit' units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the 327-unit offset. With L=3 (most recent consistent lead time for P40, P41 orders), (L+1) = 4 periods. Forecasted demand for 4 periods is 436 (4 * 109). Total mu_hat = 436 + 327 = 763. Sigma_hat is set to 120 (approx 60 per period * sqrt(4)) to handle the persistent high volatility.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the system reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 763 units. However, my records confirm that 327 of these units are from historically lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P29, P30) that will never arrive. The effective pipeline is actually 436 units (P37, P44, P46, P47). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 763 units from its order calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 327 'phantom' units. Demand is currently in a high-variance regime; the average of the last 10 periods (P38-P47) is approximately 107.5 units. Total lead time (L) is set to 3 periods based on the most frequent actual lead time observed recently. Thus, base mu_hat = (1+L) * mean = 4 * 107.5 = 430. Adding the 327 unit offset to prevent under-ordering gives an explicit mu_hat of 757. Sigma_hat is calculated using a recent window (N=10) to capture the high volatility (recent spikes up to 192).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period. The 'In-transit' count is 763 units, but my records indicate that 327 of these units (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P29, P30) are lost shipments that will never arrive. The effective pipeline is 436 units (orders from P44, P46, P47). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 763 units from the target base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 327 'phantom' units. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a mean of ~104 units and high standard deviation (~75). With a lead time of 2-3 periods, a target base stock should cover (L+1) periods. Using L=3 for safety, mu_hat would normally be (1+3)*104 = 416. Adding the 327-unit offset results in mu_hat = 743. This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for the fact that nearly half the reported pipeline doesn't exist. sigma_hat is set to roughly sqrt(4)*75 to handle the high variance.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 763 units. However, based on the historical logs and carry-over insights, 327 units from periods P2, P15, P17, P18, P29, and P30 are confirmed lost shipments. These lost units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count, which causes the OR engine to under-order. To compensate, I am applying an explicit 'mu_hat' offset. Recent demand (P40-P49) has averaged approximately 93 units per period. Using a 3-period lead time factor (L+1=4), the base demand expectation is roughly 372 units. Adding the 327 lost units to this total yields an explicit mu_hat of 699. This ensures the OR policy (base_stock - pipeline) accounts for the fact that 327 units of that pipeline will never arrive. Lead time is set to an explicit 3, which has been the most consistent actual duration despite recent volatility. sigma_hat is set using a recent window to reflect the current high-variance demand regime.
