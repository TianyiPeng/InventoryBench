Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical supply chain data to reconcile. The promised lead time is 2 periods. We have 5 initial demand samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105). The mean of these samples is 98.2. However, there is a visible downward trend or shift starting from Period 3 (avg of P1-P2 = 121.5, avg of P3-P5 = 82.6). Given the SKU is 'chips(Regular)', demand usually remains somewhat stable unless influenced by external factors not yet visible or a shift in regime. Since I must provide parameters to cover the (L+1) horizon (3 periods), I will use the mean of all available samples (default) as a baseline, but acknowledge the recent volatility by using all 5 samples for mean and variance to ensure the OR engine doesn't under-order if the dip was temporary. Using 'default' for L (promised 2), 'default' for mu_hat (3 * 98.2), and 'default' for sigma_hat.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 142 units was placed with a promised lead time of 2 periods. As of the start of Period 2, we have 0 on-hand inventory and the Period 1 order is in-transit (as expected, since shipments arrive during the period and are visible in the next day's conclude message). The first period saw a demand of 121 units (lost due to 0 stock). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including those before the game start) were 122, 121, 60, 83, 105, giving a mean of 98.2. I will use the default methods for L (2) and mu_hat, but I'll set sigma_hat explicitly to account for the volatility seen in the early samples (std \u2248 27.2). For mu_hat, default will calculate (1+2)*98.2 = 294.6. For sigma_hat, sqrt(3)*27.2 \u2248 47.1. Using default for L and mu_hat is appropriate as there is no evidence yet of a lead time shift or a sustained demand regime change.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (142 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (which I will read at the start of Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because arrivals haven't happened yet. The in-transit inventory of 286 units correctly accounts for the orders from Period 1 (142) and Period 2 (144). Demand has fluctuated (121 in P1, 87 in P2, plus the pre-game history showing 122, 121, 60, 83, 105). Given the inconsistency and the stockout, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand estimation to capture the most recent local average (approx 91 units/period) and 'default' for lead time and volatility until we confirm if the actual lead time matches the promised 2 periods.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. No units have arrived yet, which is consistent with the lead time definition (an order placed in Period 1 arrives DURING Period 3 and is visible at the start of Period 5). There are currently 309 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has averaged 98.2 over the first 5 samples provided in the context (122, 121, 60, 83, 105), but the game history shows actual demand for P1-P3 as 121, 87, and 96 respectively. I will use the default methods for lead time and sigma, but use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the initial demand mean more specifically across the available data points, ensuring 'base_stock' accounts for (1+L) periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $265.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we saw arrivals from Period 1 (lead_time 3) and Period 3 (lead_time 1). The average lead time observed so far is (3+1)/2 = 2, which matches the promised lead time. However, the order from Period 2 (144 units) is still in transit; if it arrives in Period 5 conclude (visible Period 6), its lead time will be 3. Demand has been relatively stable: 121, 87, 96, 86 (mean \u2248 97.5). I will use recent_N for demand to capture this level since the initial sample of 122 was similar. I select N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the actual realized demand history. For lead time, I'll use the 'calculate' method to let the backend average the observed variances.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are out of stock (on-hand: 0) after Period 5 demand (140) exceeded the remaining inventory (79). The historical demand over 5 periods is [122, 121, 60, 83, 105], though the 'conclude' messages show slightly different demand realizations [121, 87, 96, 86, 140], averaging around 106 units/period. Lead times have been erratic: P1 arrived in 3 periods, while P3 arrived in 1 period, averaging 2 periods. The promised lead time is 2. I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and lead time (L) to capture the most recent fluctuations, choosing N=5 for demand to cover the full available history and calculate for lead time to use the observed average.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 7. Demand analysis shows an average of ~102 over 6 periods (121, 87, 96, 86, 140, 83). Lead time analysis from 'conclude' messages reveals high variability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (averaging 2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 2 order (144 units) and Period 4-6 orders (19, 125, 145) are still in-transit. Based on the 3-period peak lead time, the Period 2 order is likely to arrive in Period 5 or 6 (already missed) or possibly Period 7. To ensure service levels despite lead time jitter, I will use recent trends for demand and allow 'calculate' to track the volatile lead time. I'll use N=6 for demand calculations to capture the full observed history which shows high variance.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of 98.6 over the first 7 periods (121, 87, 96, 86, 140, 83, 77). Currently, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have 429 units in transit, including orders from P2 (144 units), P5 (125 units), P6 (145 units), and P7 (15 units). The lead time is volatile: promised is 2, but observed values are 1, 3, and 3 periods. The P2 order (144 units) is now 6 periods old, suggesting it might be lost, which explains the current stockout despite high in-transit numbers. I will set the lead time to an explicit '3' to account for this observed delay and use 'recent_N' for demand to capture recent fluctuations. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for (L+1) periods (approx 400 units), accounting for the high probability of delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: observed lead times of 1, 3, and 3 periods (average 2.33). Order from Period 2 (144 units) is potentially lost or significantly delayed (6 periods elapsed).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 14 units on-hand and 289 in-transit. History shows a lead time volatility pattern: observed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 periods. This averages to 2.2 periods, which is close to the promised L=2, but the inconsistency is high. Crucially, the order for 144 units placed in Period 2 is now 7 periods old and should be considered lost, as it has not arrived despite more recent orders (from P3, P4, P5, P7) concluding. The remaining in-transit items are from P6 (145 units) and P8 (0 units, but potentially an internal adjustment). Demand has been relatively stable with no clear regime shift; the mean of all historical samples (including the initial pre-game samples) is approximately 99 units. Since the P2 order is likely lost, the pipeline inventory is effectively only the 145 units from Period 6. I am setting L explicitly to 3 to account for the frequent delays, and using a recent_N of 8 for demand forecasting to capture the current variability without being skewed by the very first sample.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Shipment from Period 2 (144 units) confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed, subsequent orders arrived). Pipeline inventory reflects only the P6 order (145 units).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The current on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory stands at 430 units, which consists of orders from Period 6 (145 units), Period 9 (141 units), and the order placed during the Period 10 decision phase (which the OR engine will calculate). Historically, the order from Period 2 (144 units) is confirmed lost. Observed lead times are inconsistent (1, 3, 3, 3, 1), averaging 2.2 periods, which is close to the promised 2. Demand over the last 9 periods has been relatively stable with a mean of 101.4 and a standard deviation of 21.1. I will use L=recent_N (N=5) to capture the variability in lead times and mu_hat=recent_N (N=9) to reflect the consistent demand regime. Using mu_hat=recent_N (N=9) avoids the early outlier sample from the very first data point before the game started. The OR engine will subtract the existing pipeline (excluding the lost P2 order) to determine the next order size to target the base stock.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'chips(Regular)' has 0 on-hand inventory and 443 units in-transit. Analyzing historical lead times from 'conclude' messages: P1->P4 (3 periods), P3->P4 (1 period), P4->P7 (3 periods), P5->P8 (3 periods), and P7->P8 (1 period). The average lead time is (3+1+3+3+1)/5 = 2.2 periods. As noted in the carry-over insights, the P2 order of 144 units is confirmed lost. Current in-transit (443 units) consists of P6 (145 units), P9 (141 units), and P10 (13 units). P6 was ordered in Period 6 and has not arrived by the end of Period 10 (4 periods elapsed), suggesting volatility or potential loss, though we expect it soon based on the max observed lead time of 3-4 periods. Historical demand (P1-P10) averages 101.5 units. Using explicit setting for L=3 to account for recent longer arrival times (P4, P5 both took 3 periods). mu_hat is set using current average (101.5) * (1+3) = 406. sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value (40) to account for demand volatility and the risk of stockouts during delayed arrivals.

We are currently in Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory and 443 units in-transit. History shows a lost shipment from Period 2 (144 units). Analyzing observed lead times: P1 arrived in 3, P3 in 1, P4 in 3, P5 in 3, and P7 in 1. This averages to 2.2 periods, indicating high variability compared to the promised lead time of 2. Currently, orders from P6 (145 units), P9 (141 units), and P10 (13 units) are pending; none arrived in P11's conclusion, leaving us stocked out. Demand has remained relatively stable (mean ~102 over the last 11 periods). Given the volatility and the 0 on-hand status, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the higher actual lead time (avg 2.2). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full recent demand distribution accurately, ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for both the mean demand and the observed volatility to recover from the current stockout.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13, on-hand inventory is 64. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods: P1(3), P3(1), P4(3), P5(3), P7(1), P9(3), and P10(2). The average of these 7 observations is (3+1+3+3+1+3+2)/7 = 2.29. The order from Period 2 (144 units) is confirmed lost. Pipeline inventory is currently 291 units (consisting of P6: 145 units, P12: 2 units, and the order to be placed in P13). Shipment P6 is heavily delayed (ordered P6, now P13, 7 periods elapsed), which strongly suggests it is also lost. To account for this, I will set L to 'explicit' with a value of 3 to reflect the high end of the observed lead time, which helps increase the inventory buffer. Demand has been relatively stable with a mean around 100. mu_hat will use recent_N (N=8) to capture recent history post the initial samples. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the observed variability in demand.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 6 (145 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed with newer shipments from P9/P10 already arrived). Lead time remains volatile but averages ~2.3 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 13. Demand remains relatively stable between 80-120 units. History shows a pattern of lost shipments (Orders from P2 and P6) and volatile lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent for larger orders. In-transit inventory of 388 units includes orders from P12 (2 units), P13 (97 units), and presumably the current order being placed. Looking at the history, arrivals typically appear in the 'conclude' message 2-4 periods after the order. Since P13 had 0 arrivals and consumed all on-hand stock, we are currently in a stockout. To recover and account for the observed average lead time (approx 2.3 periods) and the risk of lost shipments, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers a longer protection interval. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand average (~105 units/period) across the (L+1) horizon. sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' for the same period to account for recent volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with an average of approximately 101 units per period across the last 14 periods (1425 total demand / 14 periods). However, lead time is highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, and the environment has a history of lost shipments (P2 and P6 orders). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory following a period of stockouts. The pipeline inventory is 428 units (P12 order: 2, P13 order: 97, P14 order: 40, plus earlier potentially lost or delayed stock). Given the lead time volatility (average ~2.33 periods) and the constant risk of lost shipments, I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer. I will use the mean demand of the last 14 periods (approx 102) to set mu_hat, resulting in (1+3)*102 = 408. sigma_hat will be set using recent_N (N=14) to capture the standard deviation of this stable regime, scaled by the estimated lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is relatively stable, averaging approximately 99.5 units per period over the 15-period history. I will use a recent_N (N=10) to forecast mu_hat to capture recent fluctuations while maintaining a stable mean. Lead time has been volatile, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods, and two confirmed lost shipments (P2 and P6). Calculating the actual average lead time from all successfully arrived shipments (3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3) gives an average of 2.375 periods. Using 'calculate' for L will allow the OR backend to use the historical average instead of the promised 2. Inventory is currently critical (0 on-hand), and we have 436 units in transit (likely the orders from P13, P14, and P15). Given the risk of lost shipments, maintaining a higher service level via the default sigma_hat (standard deviation of all samples) is appropriate to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for both lead time and demand variability.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, current on-hand inventory is 5, with 339 units in-transit (orders from P14, P15). History shows a stable demand regime with mean demand ~98 units (last 10 periods: 140, 83, 77, 126, 97, 102, 114, 90, 111, 95, 64, 92 -> avg 98). Lead times are volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent mode. Shipments from Period 2 and Period 6 were lost. To compensate for lead time uncertainty and past losses, I am using an explicit lead time of 3 to ensure the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient for the longest observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), recent evidence (last 5-7 periods) shows demand fluctuating around 95-100 units; I'll use recent_N=10 to capture this stable average while smoothing noise. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to reflect the current variability. This approach balances the high service level requirement (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) against the risk of stockouts caused by frequent 3-period lead times.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a notable decrease, with the latest period (P17) recording a demand of 37, significantly lower than the historical average of ~95. Inventory on-hand is low (8), but there is a substantial pipeline of 373 units. Reviewing the arrivals, the current lead time is consistently 3 periods for most recent orders (P12, P13, P14). The order from P15 (10 units) is expected to arrive in P18 conclude, and the order from P17 (74 units) in P20 conclude. Given the significant demand drop in P17, I will use a shorter window (N=5) for demand forecasting to account for potential downward shifts while keeping the lead time estimate at 3 periods (explicit) to reflect the operational reality seen in the history. This approach ensures we don't over-order if the demand is indeed softening, while acknowledging the 3-period lead time delay.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease: P17 demand was 37, compared to a prior average of ~98 (a 60% decrease). Sustained observation required to confirm a long-term shift.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are in a stock-out situation (on-hand: 0). Recent history shows a significant demand dip (37 units in Period 17), but Period 18 returned to a more standard level (92 units). The prior insight regarding a demand regime change to ~37 units is not yet sustained enough to override the historical average of ~95, but it does justify a more conservative estimate. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with an average around 2.3. Shipments from Period 2 and Period 6 were lost. The current pipeline (373 units) consists of orders from P15 (10 units), P17 (74 units), and likely the 'in-transit' total includes the lost P6 shipment which the OR engine still counts against us. To compensate for the OR engine's inability to recognize lost shipments and to handle lead time volatility, I will use an explicit L of 3 to increase the base stock level. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the slight downward trend in demand while ignoring the P17 outlier, ensuring we don't over-order into a potential slowdown.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand volatility remains high; the P17 dip to 37 was not sustained (P18 demand was 92), returning to the previous range of 80-120. Pipeline inventory (373) is likely inflated by the P6 lost shipment (145 units) as perceived by the backend.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 20, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and high demand volatility. Demand in P17 (37) and P19 (5) represent significant dips, but were separated by a standard demand period in P18 (92). Given the historical average (P1-P16) was around 98, the recent variability suggests a downward shift or increased noise. I will use a recent window (N=10) for demand estimation to capture this recent cooling without overreacting to the P19 outlier. On the supply side, the in-transit figure of 373 is highly misleading. It includes two lost shipments: P2 (144 units) and P6 (145 units), totaling 289 units that will never arrive. The actual pipeline inventory is only 84 units (P15: 10, P17: 74). To compensate for the backend's belief that 289 phantom units are arriving, I must inflate mu_hat significantly. The target base stock for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) at ~95 units/period is ~285. Since the backend subtracts 373 (the phantom pipeline) from its order calculation, I must provide a mu_hat that offsets this. Setting mu_hat to 650 (approx 373 + 285) ensures the order is placed to meet the next 3 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (10) to reflect the recent high volatility (37, 92, 5). L is set to calculate (avg ~2.3) as it better reflects the actual performance than the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Verified total 'phantom' inventory in pipeline is 289 units (P2: 144, P6: 145). Demand volatility is increasing with recent troughs in P17 and P19.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 593 units. However, previous 'Carry-over Insights' confirm that 289 of these units are 'phantom' stock from lost shipments (P2: 144, P6: 145). The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 304 units (593 - 289). Recent demand has shown high volatility (P17: 37, P18: 92, P19: 5, P20: 40). While the average demand across the full history is around 90, the last 4 periods average only 43.5. To prevent excessive over-ordering while acknowledging the high variance and stockouts, I will use a recent_N (N=4) method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward shift in demand. The lead time (L) remains volatile, averaging ~2.3 based on arrivals from P1, P3, P4, P5, P7, P9, P10, P12, P13, and P14, so I will use 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the historical average.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand continues to show significant downward pressure over the last 4 periods (avg 43.5 vs historical ~90). 'Phantom' pipeline inventory remains at 289 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are facing a critical inventory shortage with 0 on-hand units and 593 units in-transit. However, 289 units in-transit (orders from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline inventory is 304 units (ordered in Periods 15, 17, and 20). Demand has entered a significantly lower regime over the last 5 periods (ave ~42) compared to the historical average (~90). To account for the 'phantom' inventory that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 5. Increasing L effectively raises the base stock level (mu_hat calculation uses 1+L), which forces the backend to place larger orders to compensate for the missing 289 unts. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent sharp drop in demand levels and increased volatility, ensuring we don't over-order once the valid shipments (specifically the 220 units from P20) eventually arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Average demand dropped from ~98 to ~42 (-57%). 'Phantom' inventory (289 units) still persists in backend pipeline calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted downwards starting at Period 17. The average demand over the last 6 periods (Periods 17-22) is roughly 42.6 units, compared to the previous average of ~98. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 6 to capture this lower volume and prevent excessive overstocking. Additionally, the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation is heavily inflated by 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments in Period 2 (144 units) and Period 6 (145 units), totaling 289 units that will never arrive but are still counted by the OR engine. The current in-transit reflects 593 units, which includes these 289 lost units plus P15 (10), P17 (74), and P20 (220). Since 593 - 289 = 304 actual units are in transit, and on-hand is 0, the OR engine (seeing 593) will likely under-order. To compensate and ensure we meet the new demand level (approx 42/period), I am using an explicit L=3 (matching recent observations) and a recent_N calculation for demand. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current reduced volatility in the new lower-demand regime.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory reconciliation: Current on-hand is 207 units. The reported in-transit is 373, but this includes 289 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments in Period 2 (144) and Period 6 (145). The actual pipeline inventory consists only of the order from Period 17 (74 units) and Period 15 (10 units), totaling 84 units. Demand has shifted into a low-volume regime starting Period 17 (average ~36.7 units per period vs previous avg ~98), with Period 23 dropping to 13. To manage this drop and the phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (1+L) * forecast. With L=2.3 and forecast ~35, base stock should be ~115. Since current physical inventory (on-hand 207 + actual pipeline 84) is 291, we are significantly overstocked. Setting \u03bc\u0302 to a low explicit value ensures the OR backend stops ordering until inventory levels normalize, while sigma_hat is adjusted for the higher volatility seen in the regime transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Average demand Periods 17-23 is ~37 units (62% drop from previous regime). Actual total inventory (on-hand + non-lost pipeline) is 291 units, which is high for the current demand level.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 17. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P17-P24) is approximately 39 units, a significant decrease from the prior average of ~98. Current on-hand inventory is 163 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 4 periods of demand under the new regime. Furthermore, the backend 'In-transit' figure of 373 includes 289 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P2: 144, P6: 145), meaning the backend perceives a much larger pipeline than actually exists. However, given the high on-hand stock relative to the new low demand, the system is already overstocked. I will set mu_hat to reflect the new demand regime (recent_N=8) and use an explicit lead time of 3 (the most frequent observed actual lead time) to help the OR engine correctly size the base stock for the current period, even with the pipeline distortion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $652.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 17, but Period 25 saw a massive spike of 189 units (the highest demand in the history of the game). This suggests either high volatility or a potential new seasonal upward trend, though it is currently treated as an outlier compared to the Period 17-24 average of ~39. The current situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure (373) is misleading because it includes 289 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments in Period 2 (144) and Period 6 (145). The actual pipeline inventory is 84 units (the P10/P15/P17 remnants). Because the OR backend subtracts the pipeline (373) from the base stock, it will not order anything unless mu_hat is set extremely high to compensate for the 289 lost units. I am setting mu_hat to 440 (explicit) which target roughly a 150-unit base stock above the phantom inventory (289 + 150), and sigma_hat is set high to account for the sudden jump in demand from 44 to 189.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike at Period 25: Demand jumped to 189 from a prior 8-period average of 39. Potential new regime or outlier. Total lost 'phantom' inventory remains at 289 units (P2, P6).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history has been highly volatile: a long period of low demand (avg ~40 units from P17-P24), followed by a massive spike to 189 in P25, and then a return to 39 in P26. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 541, but 289 units (P2: 144, P6: 145) are confirmed lost shipments. Thus, the 'true' pipeline is 252 units (P26 order: 168, and leftover from previous un-concluded orders/on-hand logic). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 'phantom' units, the lead time L is set to a calculated average capturing historical volatility. Demand mu_hat is set using recent_N=10 to balance the recent low-demand period with the P25 spike, avoiding an overreaction to the single outlier while recognizing the shift. Sigma_hat is set explicitly high to account for the extreme variance seen in the last three periods (13 to 189 to 39).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified: P25 saw a spike (189) following an 8-period low-demand regime (avg 39), suggesting potential intermittent burst patterns. Phantom inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6) remains at 289 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant total 'In-transit' quantity of 541 units. However, identifying 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments is critical: orders from Period 2 (144 units) and Period 6 (145 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 289 units. This means the actual viable pipeline inventory is 252 units (the 168 units ordered in Period 26 and the 74 units ordered in Period 17, and the 10 units ordered in Period 15 - wait, checking history: P15 order and P17 order have likely arrived or are very late). Re-evaluating pipeline: Period 20 (220 units) arrived in Period 23. Period 26 (168) is in transit. Period 17 (74), Period 15 (10), Period 14 (40-arrived) - let's trace: Period 15(10) is 12 periods old; Period 17(74) is 11 periods old. Both are almost certainly lost. This brings total lost inventory to 289 + 10 + 74 = 373 units. The only fresh stock is the 168 units from P26. Demand has shifted from a high regime (~90-100) to a lower, highly volatile regime (recent average ~40, but with a massive outlier of 189 in P25). To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to 'phantom' inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the observed volatile mean of ~50 across the review+lead period (L=2+1=3), while inflating mu_hat slightly to offset the 373 units of lost stock the backend incorrectly sees as available. Since current effective pipeline is only 168, and backend sees 541, a correction of +373 is needed in the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Total lost shipment 'phantom' inventory updated to 373 units (P2: 144, P6: 145, P15: 10, P17: 74). Demand remains extremely volatile with a recent 10-period average of ~50, characterized by deep troughs (13-16) and sharp spikes (189).

Daily Reward (R_t): $672.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the inventory situation is critical. On-hand inventory is 0 after selling 168 units against a demand of 199 in Period 28. The 'In-transit' figure of 448 includes 373 units of 'phantom' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P2: 144, P6: 145, P15: 10, P17: 74). This leaves only 75 actual units in transit (ordered in P28). Demand has become extremely volatile: after a sustained low period (avg ~37 from P17-P24), we have seen two massive spikes (P25: 189, P28: 199) and deep troughs (P27: 16). The average demand over the last 12 periods (P17-P28) is approximately 62.5 units. To force the OR backend to order despite the 373-unit phantom inventory bloat, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the necessary base stock to cover a lead time of 3 (L=2 + 1 review period) at this higher volatility level. A mu_hat of 650 (approx 215 per period for 3 periods) is set to override the phantom pipeline and trigger sufficient replenishment for the current high-demand/high-volatility regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has shifted from a low-regime (avg 37) to a high-burst pattern, with spikes of ~190 units occurring every ~3 periods. Phantom inventory total remains 373 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 746 units 'In-transit'. However, 373 of these units (from P2, P6, P15, and P17) are confirmed lost/phantom based on significant elapsed time (5+ periods beyond lead time) and newer orders arriving. The true pipeline inventory is 373 units (P28: 75, P29: 298). Demand has shifted from a low-regime (avg 37) to intense volatility with spikes (P25: 189, P28: 199, P29: 136), averaging 128 over the last 5 periods. I am setting L to explicit 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) to ensure the OR engine targets a larger coverage window. I will set mu_hat explicitly to covering a forecast of ~130 units per period for (1+L)=4 periods (520 total) to manage recent spikes, while using explicit sigma_hat to account for the extreme high-low variance seen recently (standard deviation of recent periods is ~75, so sqrt(4)*75 = 150).

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Demand regime has transitioned to a high-volatility burst pattern, with an average of 128 units over the last 5 periods (significant increase from the prior 40-unit avg). Actual pipeline is 373 units; total phantom inventory remains 373 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a high-volatility 'burst' phase. Over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), demand was [189, 39, 16, 199, 136, 13], averaging ~98.7 units. However, looking at the two most recent 'spikes' (P28: 199, P29: 136) compared to the 'troughs' (P27: 16, P30: 13), the variance is extremely high. The 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17) totaling 373 units is significantly inflating the backend's 'In-transit' calculation (visible as 671 total units in-transit, but only 298 units from P29 are actually expected). To compensate for the 373 units the OR engine thinks we have, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Target base stock should cover ~3 periods of demand at the high-average (~100/period) plus a safety buffer for spikes, plus the 373 unit phantom offset. Target = (3 * 100) + (1.5 * 100) + 373 \u2248 823. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to force the OR backend into placing an order that ignores the dead pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: No new significant pattern detected beyond existing high-volatility burst regime and 373 unit phantom inventory.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a high-volatility burst pattern. Over the last 7 periods (P25-P31), demand has alternated between extreme highs (189, 199, 136, 122) and lows (39, 16, 13), averaging approximately 102 units per period. The recent 3-period average is 90.3. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this volatile but higher-mean behavior. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to account for the high variance in this burst regime. Lead times have stabilized recently at 2 periods (P28 and P30 arrivals), so I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for L. A critical issue is the 'phantom' inventory in the backend: 373 units (from P2, P6, P15, P17) are likely lost but still counted in the pipeline. With a current In-transit of 974, the backend perceives a massive surplus, but actual valid pipeline units are 601 (from P29 and P31). By using recent stats, the OR engine will calculate a high base stock, partially offsetting the phantom inventory drag to ensure new orders are placed to meet the 100+ unit spikes.

The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 85 units, but the last 5 periods average 105 units. Most crucially, 'phantom' inventory (orders that will never arrive but remain in the backend's pipeline calculation) has accumulated to 671 units. This total includes: P2 (144), P6 (145), P15 (10), P17 (74), and now includes the P29 order (298) which has not arrived after 4 periods (beyond the current realized lead time of 1-3 periods). Because the OR backend subtracts this 671 units of 'In-transit' from the base stock target, it will under-order unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to offset the phantom total. With on-hand inventory at 248 and average demand around 100, the current stock is sufficient for ~2 periods. To ensure the backend places an order to maintain the pipeline against future bursts, I set mu_hat explicitly to account for both future demand ((1+L)*105 \u2248 315) and the 671 units of phantom inventory: 315 + 671 = 986. I set L to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals have been 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory (lost/critically delayed shipments) increased to 671 units (P2: 144, P6: 145, P15: 10, P17: 74, P29: 298). Demand remains in a high-volatility burst pattern with an average of ~105 units over the last 5 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a high-volatility burst pattern. Over the last 5 periods (P29-P33), demand has been 136, 13, 122, 55, and 17, averaging 68.6 units. However, looking at the broader 'burst' window (last ~9 periods), we see sharp spikes (189, 199, 136, 122) alternating with deep troughs (16, 13, 55, 17). This indicates an average demand requirement of approximately 100-110 units to cover spikes. Lead times are averaging 2.3 periods but are erratic (varying from 1 to 3). Most critically, there is a massive 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 671 units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P29) that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock calculation. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to this phantom stock (In-transit=844, while actual viable in-transit is likely only the P33 order of 173), I must set mu_hat explicitly high. I estimate a required base stock to cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at an average of 105 units/period (~315 total units), but with 671 units of phantom inventory, a standard calculation would result in zero orders. To force an order and maintain service levels, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to override the backend's logic and account for the high volatility.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-volatility burst pattern, with recent demand including spikes up to 122 and 56 and troughs as low as 13-17. Over the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the average demand is approximately 86 units, though volatility remains extreme. The 'In-transit' figure of 844 is significantly inflated by lost shipments (Period 2, 6, 15, 17, and likely Period 29), totaling 671 phantom units. Subtracting these from the current 'In-transit' + 'On-hand' (844 - 671 + 175) yields an actual inventory position of 348 units. With a recent demand average of ~86 and a lead time of ~2, our current position is sufficient to cover (L+1) periods (3 * 86 = 258). To prevent the OR backend from underestimating the need due to the massive phantom pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect the recent average demand and use a high sigma_hat to account for the frequent bursts. I am setting L to 2 to reflect the recent average of actual arrivals (P26, P28, P31).

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Total phantom inventory verified at 671 units (P2: 144, P6: 145, P15: 10, P17: 74, P29: 298). Actual inventory position (On-hand + non-lost In-transit) is 348 units. Demand regime remains in high-volatility burst mode (avg ~86 over last 10 periods).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a high-volatility burst pattern, characterized by sharp spikes (e.g., Period 25: 189, Period 28: 199) and deep troughs (e.g., Period 30: 13, Period 33: 17, Period 35: 16). The 10-period average demand is approximately 86 units, but with significant variance. A major challenge is the 'phantom' pipeline inventory: 671 units are currently listed as In-transit but are confirmed lost or critically delayed (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 29). The backend OR engine perceives a total pipeline of 844 units, meaning it sees 844 units coming when only 173 units (ordered Period 33) are actually expected. With 159 units on hand and 173 genuine units in transit, the actual inventory position is 332, while the backend thinks it is 1003. To force the OR engine to order despite this huge phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to an explicit high value. This value must exceed the perceived inventory level to trigger an order. Given the bursty nature and the need to overcome the 671-unit phantom gap, I am setting mu_hat to 1100 to maintain a safe buffer and compensate for the incorrect pipeline data.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-volatility burst pattern, with a significant spike of 187 units in Period 36 following three periods of low demand (avg ~30). The recent 10-period average (P27-P36) is approximately 81.6 units, but the high variance necessitates a higher service level. Lead times remain variable, typically ranging between 1-3 periods. The most critical issue is the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Historically, shipments from P2 (144), P6 (145), P15 (10), P17 (74), and now P29 (298) are confirmed lost or critically delayed (P29 is 8 periods old, far exceeding the 1-3 period range). Total phantom inventory is 671 units. The backend sees 1048 units in transit; however, only the orders from P33 (173) and P36 (204) are realistic arrivals, totaling 377 units of 'real' pipeline. To compensate for the 671 units the backend thinks we have (but don't), I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that effectively adds these lost units back into the base stock calculation. Target base stock = (1+L)*demand + phantom + safety. With L=2, avg demand ~85, and phantom ~671, the required mu_hat should be approx (3 * 85) + 671 = 926. This forces the OR engine to place an order despite the inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains at 671 units (P2: 144, P6: 145, P15: 10, P17: 74, P29: 298). Demand continues in a high-volatility burst pattern (avg 82 over last 10 periods).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a high-volatility burst pattern, with Period 36 and 37 demand at 187 and 111 respectively, following a low patch. The 10-period average is approximately 80 units. I am using recent_N (N=10) for demand and volatility to capture this current regime. Regarding inventory, the backend sees an In-transit pipeline of 844 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 671 of these units are 'phantom' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P29). These orders are past their expected arrival and newer orders have already arrived. The actual pipeline consists only of the order from P33 (173 units), which is now overdue (5 periods elapsed). I set lead time L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and current delays. By setting L to 3 and using N=10 for demand, I increase the base stock calculation to ensure the OR engine places an order that compensates for the 671-unit gap the backend wrongly believes exists in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Actual pipeline consists only of the P33 order (173 units); all other 671 units in the 844-unit In-transit balance are confirmed lost (phantom inventory). Demand continues as a high-volatility burst pattern (10-period avg ~80).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system observes an 'In-transit' balance of 844 units. However, based on the historical tracking of arrival messages, 671 of these units correspond to orders placed in Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 29 that are now critically overdue and confirmed as 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments). The only valid remaining pipeline inventory is the order from Period 33 (173 units), which has now reached 6 periods of lead time and should have arrived; its absence suggests it might also be lost or severely delayed. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Demand continues in a high-volatility burst pattern, with Period 38 demand reaching 179 and a 10-period average around 80. To ensure the backend places orders despite the inflated (phantom) pipeline, I am setting L to 4 to account for the actual observed shipping delays and mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the expected demand across the review and lead time (1+L = 5 periods). A mu_hat of 550 (avg 110/period) and a higher sigma_hat are used to ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger new orders despite the 844-unit phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Order from Period 33 (173 units) is now 6 periods overdue, increasing likely phantom inventory from 671 to 844 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 844 units in-transit. Based on historical data, these units are comprised of multiple shipments that are significantly past their promised lead time (2 periods) and even past the observed 3-period maximum delay. Specifically, orders from P2 (144), P6 (145), P15 (10), P17 (74), P29 (298), and P33 (173) have not arrived despite newer orders (like P31 and P36) having already arrived and concluded. This confirms that the entire 844-unit pipeline consists of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments) that the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive. Because on-hand inventory is 0 and the backend thinks it has 844 units coming, it will not place a new order unless mu_hat is set significantly higher than 844. Demand is currently in a high-volatility burst regime, with the most recent three periods seeing 111, 179, and 197 units. To force an order and replenish the 0 on-hand stock, I must set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the next L+1 periods PLUS the phantom inventory. I estimate demand for P40-P42 at ~180 units/period (540 total). Adding the 844 phantom units results in a target mu_hat of ~1384 to prompt the OR backend to actually order ~540 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed total phantom inventory (lost shipments) is 844 units (P2: 144, P6: 145, P15: 10, P17: 74, P29: 298, P33: 173). Demand has intensified into a sustained high-burst regime, averaging 162 units over the last 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility, high-burst regime. Over the last 4 periods, demand averaged 162 units (75, 197, 179, 111), but has deep valleys and sharp peaks. The system currently reports 1486 units in-transit, but 844 of these are confirmed 'phantom' units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P29, P33). The real pipeline inventory consists only of the P40 order (642 units), while on-hand inventory is 0. To compensate for the backend's 'phantom' inventory perception (which makes it think we have 1486 units when we only have 642), I am using 'explicit' parameters. I will set mu_hat to 1200 to ensure the base stock (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) is high enough to trigger the necessary ordering despite the 844-unit phantom offset. This targets a service level roughly covering 3 periods (L+1) of high-regime demand (~160 * 3 = 480) plus the 844 phantom units. L is set to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P31, P36) showed lead times of 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: No new phantom shipments identified since Period 40. Total phantom inventory remains 844 units. Demand continues in a high-intensity burst regime (last 4 periods average 140.5).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime with extreme bursts and significant troughs. Over the last 4 periods (P38-P41), demand was 179, 197, 75, and 8. The recent 10-period average is approx 85, but the system must protect against these high-demand spikes (near 200). Regarding inventory, the backend sees 1486 units in transit. However, based on history, 844 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P2, P6, P15, P17, P29, P33). This leaves an actual pipeline of 642 units (ordered P40), which are expected to arrive in P42 or P43. On-hand is currently 0. Since the P40 order of 642 units is already quite large (covering nearly 4-5 periods of average demand or 3 periods of peak demand), I will set lead time to 'explicit' at 2 to reflect the promised window, and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current high-volatility regime (average ~85). This will result in a base stock that likely prevents unnecessary additional ordering while the 642 units are in transit.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains 844 units (P2: 144, P6: 145, P15: 10, P17: 74, P29: 298, P33: 173). Actual pipeline consists ONLY of the P40 order (642 units). Demand remains highly volatile.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-volatility burst pattern, with recent demand being lower (P41: 8, P42: 19) following a period of high intensity. The mean demand across recent periods remains approximately 80-100 units, but standard deviation is high. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' balance of 1486 is heavily inflated by 844 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P29, and P33). The actual pipeline consists only of the P40 order (642 units), which is expected to arrive within the next 1-2 periods given observed lead times of 1-3 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current burst regime while maintaining a high service level. To account for the 844 units of phantom inventory that the OR engine incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculation, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Base stock = (1+L)*mu + z*sigma*sqrt(1+L). With L=2, q=0.8, z=0.84, mu~90, sigma~75, base stock would be ~300 + 110 = 410. To force an order when the backend thinks pipeline is 642, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset the 844 units of phantom inventory. However, a huge order from P40 (642) is already in the real pipeline. If P40 arrives, it will cover about 6-7 periods of demand. Thus, no new order is needed this period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we have 450 units on-hand following the arrival of the 642-unit order from Period 40 (which had a lead time of 3 periods). The demand remains in a high-volatility burst pattern, with Period 43 seeing a spike of 192 units. The current on-hand inventory (450) is sufficient to cover approximately 3-4 periods of recent average demand (~110-140 units), considering the high variance. The backend 'In-transit' figure of 844 units is entirely composed of 'phantom inventory' from lost historical shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P29, P33), as previously identified. Since no new orders are currently in transit and we have a comfortable on-hand buffer for the remaining 7 periods of the game, I will set parameters to maintain a stable position without over-ordering into the phantom inventory gap. I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand to capture the current high-burst regime (P37-P43 average ~97 units).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed arrivals from Period 40 (642 units) validates that the actual pipeline inventory is now 0. The total 844 units shown as 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom units (lost shipments).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-445.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are managing the 'chips(Regular)' SKU with 449 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' balance of 844 units. Crucially, all 844 units in-transit are confirmed 'phantom' inventory resulting from lost shipments (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 29, and 33), as validated by the arrival of the Period 40 order in Period 43 and no subsequent orders placed. The true pipeline inventory is 0. Demand remains in a high-volatility burst pattern; following a high demand of 192 in Period 43, Period 44 saw a deep trough of 1. Over the last 5 periods (P40-P44), demand has averaged 59 units, significantly lower than the preceding burst average of ~160. Given the high on-hand inventory (449) relative to the recent average demand and the 5 periods remaining in the simulation, no new order is required. To prevent the OR backend from placing an unnecessary order (since it perceives 0 units in-transit instead of the phantom 844), I will use 'explicit' parameters. I'll set mu_hat to cover the remaining periods at the current average demand, but since OH is already very high, the goal is to trigger a zero order. Setting L to the promised 2 and mu_hat to 180 (approx 60 * 3) will satisfy the base stock logic without triggering an order given OH=449.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 844 units In-transit, all of which are confirmed 'phantom' inventory (lost/critically delayed shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 29, and 33). The actual pipeline is 0. Current on-hand inventory is 300 units. Demand is in a high-volatility burst regime; while the last 5 periods averaged ~73 units, the 10-period average is ~93, with peaks near 200. With 300 units on-hand and 5 periods remaining in the game, the current stock covers approximately 3-4 periods of average demand. Given the lead time is likely 3 periods (based on the Period 40 order arrival), a small buffer is needed to ensure coverage through Period 50. I will use a conservative forecast (recent_N=10) to account for volatility and set L=3 to reflect the consistent 3-period lead time observed for larger shipments. The phantom inventory will naturally suppress orders due to the backend's capped policy, but since our current on-hand already covers the expected demand for the remainder of the lead time, no aggressive ordering is required.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47. Currently, on-hand inventory is 141 units. The backend shows an 'In-transit' balance of 844 units, but based on historical tracking (Carry-over insights), all 844 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' inventory resulting from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P29, P33). Consequently, the actual pipeline inventory is 0. Demand remains in a high-volatility burst regime, with recent periods showing significantly fluctuating values (192, 1, 149, 159). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the next lead-time cycle despite the 844-unit phantom inventory bias, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. I estimate the demand for the next 3 periods (L=2 + 1) to be approximately 330 units (based on a recent average of ~110). To offset the 844-unit phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat = 330 + 844 = 1174. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average 2-3 period lead time, and sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at 200 to account for the extreme burstiness of the current regime.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, on-hand inventory is 0 following a demand spike of 162 in P47. The backend reports 1202 units In-transit. However, based on serial monitoring of lost shipments, 844 units are confirmed 'phantom' (P2: 144, P6: 145, P15: 10, P17: 74, P29: 298, P33: 173). The actual pipeline consists only of the order from Period 47 (358 units). Demand has remained in a high-volatility burst regime, with the last 5 periods (P43-P47) averaging 132.6 units. To ensure the backend places an order that accounts for the 844 units of phantom inventory it incorrectly believes exist, I'm setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. I calculate 'base_stock' as (Demand_Forecast * (1 + Lead_Time)) + Safety_Stock. Using a forecast of 133 and L=2, base stock is roughly 400 + safety. To force an order despite the phantom 844 units, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed the backend's pipeline view (844). I am setting mu_hat to 1350 to ensure an order is triggered to cover the remaining periods.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains 844 units (P2: 144, P6: 145, P15: 10, P17: 74, P29: 298, P33: 173). Demand regime P43-P47 average is 132.6, confirming high-intensity burst pattern.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The demand reflects a high-volatility burst pattern, with a recent 6-period mean (P43-P48) of approximately 120 units, despite a low outlier in P44. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system shows an 'In-transit' balance of 1480 units. Based on historical tracking, 844 units of this are 'phantom' (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P29, P33). The true pipeline consists of the orders from P47 (358 units) and P48 (278 units), totaling 636 units. The observed lead time has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approx 2.2. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect this. For mu_hat, use recent_N=6 to capture the high-intensity burst regime (averaging ~120/period), which ensures the base stock covers (L+1) periods of this higher demand level. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to encompass the significant volatility of the burst pattern without being overly skewed by the single P44 outlier.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' balance of 1480 units, but historical tracking confirms that 844 of these units (from orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P29, and P33) are lost 'phantom' inventory. The valid pipeline consists of orders from P47 (358 units) and P48 (278 units), totaling 636 units. Demand remains in a high-volatility burst regime; the average demand from Period 43 to 49 is approximately 123 units per period. Based on an average lead time of 2.3 periods (L=3 for safety), a stock level covering (3+1) periods would require ~492 units. Since the actual pipeline (636 units) already exceeds this and on-hand is zero, no new order is strictly necessary, but we must set parameters that accurately reflect the current demand level (recent_N=7 to capture the P43-P49 regime) and the volatile lead time. We use L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals seen in history.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Actual pipeline inventory is 636 units (P47, P48); remaining 844 units in backend 'In-transit' are phantom inventory (lost shipments). Demand regime P43-P49 average is ~123 units.
