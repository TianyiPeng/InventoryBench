Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Starting Period 1 with no inventory or history. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods shows a mean of 98.2 and a standard deviation of 26.3. Since we are at the very beginning and only have these 5 initial data points, I will use the default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat, which utilize all available historical samples. This provides a balanced baseline for the OR backend to calculate the initial order quantity using the base stock policy (target stock level covering L+1 = 3 periods of demand).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 142 units with a promised lead time of 2. As expected, these units have not arrived yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory and 118 lost sales. The 142 units are currently in-transit. Demand for the first five historical periods was [122, 121, 60, 83, 105], while actual demand in Period 1 was 118, which is consistent with the initial mean of ~100. Since we only have one period of operational history and thepromised lead time is 2, I will use 'default' methods for the OR parameters to allow the backend to use all available historical data (5 samples + Period 1) to stabilize the forecast. The pipeline (142) plus current decision should aim to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 periods).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' was 118 and 155 in the first two periods (average 136.5). No shipments have arrived yet. Because the promised lead time is 2 periods, the order placed in Period 1 (142 units) is expected to arrive DURING Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 285 in-transit (142 from P1 + 143 from P2). I will stick to the promised lead time (L=2) and use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=2 to capture the early demand trend. The target base stock covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The game history shows that the order from Period 1 (142 units) has not yet arrived by the end of Period 3. According to the 'CRITICAL TIMING EXAMPLE', if L=2, an order placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 3's arrival resolution and its arrival is first confirmed in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. Since 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0, and the order from Period 1 is now overdue, we must conclude the actual lead time is likely longer than the promised 2 periods or the shipment is delayed. Historical demand over the first three periods (118, 155, 128) yields an average of ~134 units/period. The current in-transit inventory is 465 (142+143+180). Because we have zero on-hand inventory and have lost all sales so far, I will set L to 'explicit' 3 to account for the observed delay and use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to capture the initial behavior. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock covering (3+1) periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2018.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are reviewing the results of Period 4. The demand remains relatively stable with samples: 118, 155, 128, 117 (Mean ~130). However, the lead time has shown significant variability. The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals were L=3 (for the P1 order) and L=1 (for the P3 order, which arrived simultaneously in P4). The P2 order (143 units) is still in transit after 3 periods and has not been marked as arrived, which is a concern. Current on-hand is 205, with 276 in transit (143 from P2, 133 from P4). I will use L=2 (default) as the base but set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current demand distribution. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering (2+1) periods of demand (~390 units) minus PIP (276 + 205 = 481), which will likely result in a zero order this period to bleed off the excess inventory arriving from the early P3 delivery and the overdue P2 order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1755.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead-time history. Demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with samples: 118, 155, 128, 117, 98 (mean \u2248 123.2). Lead times have shown variability: the P1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the P3 order arrived in 1 period (actual average lead time is 2, matching the promised lead time). The P2 order (143 units) and P4 order (133 units) are currently in-transit (Total = 276). We have 107 units on-hand. Since demand has slightly softened over the last two periods, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean and variance. I will stick with the default lead-time setting as the average of observations matches the promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1853.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a mean demand of approximately 119 units over the first six periods. However, recent demand (Periods 4-6) is slightly lower (avg 104). The lead time has shown variability: the Period 1 order took 3 periods, while the Period 3 order took 1 period, resulting in a clumped arrival in Period 4. The current on-hand inventory is very low (9 units) with 322 units in-transit. These in-transit units include orders from Period 2 (143 units), Period 4 (133 units), and Period 6 (46 units). Given the promised lead time is 2, the Period 2 order is now 4 periods old and potentially overdue or lost, but since the Period 1 order took 3 periods, it might just be delayed. I will use 'calculate' for L to average the observed lead times (3 and 1, avg=2). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=6) to capture the overall mean since start, as the sample size is small. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=6) to reflect the observed volatility.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 95 units, and in-transit is 344 units. Current demand (Periods 1-7) averages 108.7 units. The last three periods (P5-P7) show a decrease in demand (98, 98, 47), averaging 81 units, possibly indicating a downward shift. Lead times have been inconsistent: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1 period, and P4 in 3 periods, suggesting an average lead time fluctuation around the promised 2. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (avg = 2.33). I'll use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent lower demand trend (avg ~81), ensuring we don't overstock given the current high in-transit volume (344 units relative to a lead time of ~2.33). Sigma_hat will use all available data (default) to account for the overall volatility observed in early periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1410.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a downward trend compared to the initial periods. The mean demand of the last 5 periods (Periods 4-8) is 88.6 units, whereas the overall mean is 105.5. I am selecting N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent lower-demand regime. Regarding lead time, the promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show significant variability: 3 periods (P1 order), 1 period (P3 order), 3 periods (P4 order), and 1 period (P7 order). This averages to 2 periods, but with high variance. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to incorporate all observed arrival data. Currently, we have 167 units on-hand and 189 in-transit (from P2 and P6, though P2's order of 143 units is extremely late and potentially lost, as it was placed 7 periods ago). By setting N=5 for demand, the OR engine will target a base stock appropriate for the current lower-demand trend while accounting for the lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 4: average demand decreased from ~134 to ~89 (-33%) over the last 5 periods. Lead time is highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2293.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 44 units, and demand has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 4, demand has averaged approx 94 units (117, 98, 98, 47, 83, 123). The lead time is indeed volatile, exhibiting values of 1 or 3 periods (P1 ordered -> P4 arrived [L=3], P3 ordered -> P4 arrived [L=1], P4 ordered -> P7 arrived [L=3], P7 ordered -> P8 arrived [L=1]). This alternating pattern makes the average realistic around 2. Currently, there is 249 units in-transit (orders from P2, P6, P9), which is significant. To manage the lower demand regime and the observed lead time volatility, I will use a recent_N approach. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, N=6 captures the data since the demand shift in Period 4. For L, I will use the 'calculate' method to let the backend average the observed lead times (3, 1, 3, 1), which equals the promised lead time of 2, but accounts for the actual data points.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level compared to the initial three periods. Since Period 4, demand has averaged approximately 95 units (ranging from 47 to 123), compared to the earlier average of ~134. Period 10 was a stockout, with 48 units of demand lost. Lead times are highly unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P7=1), averaging 2.0 periods which matches promised. However, the inconsistency has led to stockouts (current on-hand is 0). There are 385 units in-transit (orders from P6, P9, and P10). With L=2, the base stock needs to cover 3 periods of demand. Using N=7 for mu_hat captures the post-shift demand regime while maintaining some variance awareness for the sigma_hat. Given the recurring stockouts and lead time volatility, I will maintain N=7 to balance responsiveness and stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been unmet for two consecutive periods (P10, P11). Historical lead times for 'chips(Regular)' have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P1: L=3, P3: L=1, P4: L=3, P7: L=1). Orders from P9 (60 units), P10 (136 units), and P11 (29 units) are currently in-transit. Given the lead time volatility, I will set L to 3 to ensure the inventory policy covers the worst-case scenario. Demand has stabilized around a lower mean since Period 4. Calculating the mean from Period 4 to Period 11 (excluding P1 and P2 outliers) gives an average demand of approximately 97 units per period. I'll use recent_N (N=8) to capture this regime (P4-P11). Sigma will also be calculated over this same relative window to account for recent volatility. This conservative approach aims to rebuild safety stock and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the unreliable delivery schedule.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 4, averaging 89.2 units per period (N=9: Periods 4-12). In contrast, the initial three periods averaged 133.7. Lead times remain inconsistent, swinging between 1, 2, and 3 periods (Average: 2.16); however, the most recent arrivals (Period 12) confirmed lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively. Given this volatility, I will use an explicit L=3 to ensure the backend accounts for the longest observed delay, preventing stockouts during arrival gaps. For demand, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime while maintaining enough sample range to account for the variance observed (standard deviation is approx 23). This configuration balances the risk of stockouts during 3-day lead time stretches against the holding costs of the current on-hand inventory (112).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1928.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe on-hand inventory of 10 and in-transit units of 349 (orders from P11, P12, and P13). Lead times have been highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average is roughly 2.14). The order from P11 (29 units) is current reaching 'lead_time 3' and should arrive this period, but since lead times can stretch, I will use an explicit L of 2.15 to ensure the OR engine accounts for this variance. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 4. The average demand from Period 4 to 13 (last 10 periods) is approximately 97 units per period. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this lower mean (approx 305 total for L+1=3.15) and use recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the recent volatility accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 97 units per period from Period 4 through Period 13.

Daily Reward (R_t): $741.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing an out-of-stock situation despite 330 units in-transit. Reviewing the lead time history: Period 11 order arrived in 3 periods (Period 14 conclude). The orders from Period 12 (56 units), Period 13 (75 units), and Period 14 (10 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the alternating lead time pattern (1 to 3 periods), the Period 12 order (placed 3 periods ago) is highly likely to arrive during Period 15 arrival resolution. Regarding demand, the mean has stabilized around 97-100 units since Period 4. The recent demand (Period 14) was 130, higher than the mean, but consistent with the volatility observed in the current regime (Std Dev ~24). I will set L to 2 (promised) as the average of recent arrivals (3, 2, 3) is closer to 2 or 3, but the OR backend uses L to calculate coverage. mu_hat will use N=11 (from Period 4 to 14) to capture the stable regime mean of ~97. sigma_hat will use the same N=11 to reflect the current variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1064.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts in Periods 14 and 15 because demand exceeded the arrivals. Demand from Period 4 through Period 15 has averaged roughly 100.8 units per period, showing relative stability compared to the initial periods. However, the last two periods (P14-P15) showed higher demand (130, 123), suggesting a potential upward drift or seasonal pressure. Regarding lead time, the promised LT is 2, but actual observed lead times are frequently 3 periods (P11-P14, P12-P15 both took 3 periods). Therefore, I am setting L=3 to account for this recurring delay and ensure the OR backend covers enough pipeline. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L=4) periods of demand. Using the recent average (~101), mu_hat should be around 404; I will use recent_N (N=12) to capture this regime while allowing for the recent slight increase in demand variability (sold=39/56 due to stockouts, but true demand was 130/123).

Carry-over insight: Lead time has consistently shifted to 3 periods (last 4 arrivals: 3, 3, 3, 3 periods). Demand regime from Period 4 onwards is stable around 100 units/period, despite stockouts suppressing sales in P14-P15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1425.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 374 units in transit. The 'Period 16 conclude' message shows we sold 75 units but missed demand for an additional 64 units (total demand 139), leading to a stockout. Carry-over insights and recent history (Periods 11, 12, 14, 15, 16) confirm that the actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (not the promised 2). We must set L=3 explicitly to ensure the OR engine accounts for one more period of demand in its base stock calculation. Regarding demand, while the average from Period 4-13 was around 97-100, the last three periods (P14-P16) have seen a spike to 130, 123, and 139. This suggests a new demand regime or a seasonal peak. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent increase in demand and volatility, which will increase the base stock relative to the previous 100-unit average and help recover from the current stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: average demand increased from ~100 to ~131 (+31%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of the last 4 periods (P14-P17) shows a demand regime shift to an average of ~125 units (130, 123, 139, 107), confirming the insight from Period 17 of a ~31% increase. Lead time remains erratic but shows a strong mode of 3 periods (observed in 6 of the last 7 arrivals), despite the recent 1-period arrival in P17 (ordered P16). To be conservative and prevent the stockouts seen in P14-P16, I am setting L to 3. \u03bc\u0302 is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher demand level since P14. \u03c3\u0302 is set using recent_N (N=4) to account for recent demand volatility. Pipeline inventory is currently high (368 units), which the OR backend will use to determine the specific order quantity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $817.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 14-18) shows an average demand of approximately 115 units per period (130, 123, 139, 107, 78), which is higher than the previous low-regime average of ~100. Despite a dip in Period 18, the overall trend requires a higher base stock to avoid the frequent stockouts seen recently. Regarding lead time, we've observed a mix of 3 periods and 1 period arrivals. The last arrival (Period 17) arrived in 1 period, but the 3 previous ones were 3 periods. To be safe against stockouts given current 0 on-hand inventory and the 'pipelined' nature of the OR backend, I will set L to 3 (the more conservative observed Lead Time). I'll use recent_N for demand forecasting (N=5) to capture the current higher demand level, and recent_N for volatility (N=5). This setup ensures the base stock calculation covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift around Period 14, where mean demand increased to approximately 131. However, the last two periods (P18-P19) saw a sudden drop to 78 and 66 units respectively. While this might be a temporary fluctuation, I must balance the high service level requirements (high profit margin) against this volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts in P18 and P19. The lead time remains highly volatile: P16's order arrived in just 1 period (P17), but P15's order (ordered in P15) is still missing (it has been 4 periods since ordering). Other recent arrivals (P11, P12, P13, P14) all had a lead time of 3 periods. To ensure we recover from the current stockout and account for the frequent 3-period lead time, I will set L to 3. For demand, I'll use a recent window (N=6, covering P14-P19) to capture the higher mean while acknowledging the recent dips, resulting in an average of approx 107 per period. I will use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased after Period 17: P18-P19 demand dropped to ~72 avg from a previous peak of ~131 in P14-P17. Lead time remains unstable, alternating between 1 and 3+ periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows significant lead time volatility, with recent arrivals occurring at either 1 or 3 periods (Period 16 arrival in P17 was lead_time 1, while others have been 3). Since Period 18, we have 'In-transit' orders of 133 (P18), 144 (P17), 40 (P19), and 35 (P15). The Period 15 order (35 units) is now 5 periods old, suggesting it may be lost. Demand has significantly cooled in the last three periods (P18: 78, P19: 66, P20: 49) compared to the P14-P17 peak. This decrease follows a period of stockouts, but the magnitude suggests a regime shift or seasonal drop. I will use recent_N to capture this lower demand regime (N=3) and set L to 3 to account for the frequent longer delivery times and pipeline uncertainty. This helps the backend calculate a base stock that covers the expected arrival delay while acknowledging the current lower demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: average demand declined from ~131 to ~64 (-51%) over the last 3 periods. Possible lost shipment: Period 15 order (35 units) has not arrived after 5 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 18, moving from an average of ~131 to ~67 over the last 4 periods (78, 66, 49, 75). I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower average and its associated volatility. Regarding lead time, the system is currently experiencing a severe delay: 541 units are in transit, including a likely lost shipment from Period 15 (35 units) and late shipments from Period 18 (133 units), Period 19 (40 units), Period 17 (144 units - even though a Period 16 order arrived in P17, the P17 order has now been in transit for 5 periods). Since the last recorded arrival was in Period 17 and nothing has arrived for 4 consecutive periods (P18-P21), I will explicitly set L to 4 to ensure the OR engine recognizes the extended lead time and pipeline requirement. With 541 units in transit and 0 on hand, the backend will likely trigger the order cap or place a minimal order until these arrivals materialize.

Carry-over insight: Extended supply interruption confirmed: no arrivals for 4 consecutive periods (P18-P21). Period 15 order (35 units) and Period 17 order (144 units) are significantly beyond promised lead time and likely lost or severely delayed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently in a failure state. We have an on-hand inventory of 0 and a huge pipeline of 541 units, but nothing has arrived for 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22). Specifically, orders from P15 (35 units) and P17 (144 units) are now 7 and 5 periods old respectively, making them highly likely lost shipments since historical lead times peaked at 3. The current demand regime shifted at P18, averaging ~78 units over the last 5 periods (78, 66, 49, 75, 121), showing a slight recovery in P22 after a low trough. I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the OR engine targets enough inventory to cover the delays, while using recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current lower volume regime (~78/period). Because the pipeline is so large (541), the 'min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)' logic will likely result in an order of 0 or the minimum possible, which is appropriate given we have 5+ periods of demand already in the pipe; ordering more would only create a massive holding cost spike if the logjam clears all at once.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: zero arrivals from Period 18 through Period 22. Orders from P15 and P17 are likely lost. Current demand regime (P18-P22) averages 77.8 units/period.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of 'collapse' with zero arrivals for 6 consecutive periods (P18-P23). Orders from P15 (35 units) and P17 (144 units) are confirmed as lost or severely delayed (9 and 7 periods since order, respectively, against a max observed lead time of 3). The in-transit pipeline (541 units) consists mainly of these likely lost shipments and orders from P18-P19. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shifted again: after a low period (P18-P21 avg 67), demand surged in P22-P23 (121 and 182). I will treat L as 3 (the max historical actual lead time) and set mu_hat explicitly to account for this recent demand spike (~150 units/period) across the lead time window (1 + L = 4 periods). This results in a mu_hat of 600. Sigma_hat is set high (75) to reflect the extreme volatility in both demand and supply reliability. This aggressive setting aims to trigger a large recovery order to bypass the 'lost' pipeline and resume service.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: Demand spiked from an average of ~67 (P18-P21) to 151.5 (P22-P23), a 126% increase. Supply chain failure continues: 6 periods without arrivals; orders from P15 and P17 are now officially considered lost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of critical failure with zero arrivals from Period 18 through Period 24 (7 consecutive periods). Consequently, the system is stockout-constrained with zero on-hand inventory. Two major shipments (P15 and P17) are confirmed lost. The current pipeline inventory stands at 724 units, reflecting multiple orders stuck or delayed. Demand has shown a significant surge starting at Period 22, with the average demand for the last three periods (P22-P24) rising to 141.6 units compared to the previous low-demand regime (~67). Although there are no 'conclude' messages to verify the current actual lead time, the prolonged absence of arrivals suggests the effective lead time L is much higher than the promised 2. I am setting L to 4 manually to force a higher base stock that accounts for these delays and the recent demand spike. mu_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the recent high-demand regime, and sigma_hat is set similarly to reflect the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained supply blockage: 7 consecutive periods (P18-P24) with zero arrivals. P15 and P17 orders are confirmed lost. Demand regime for P22-P24 stabilized at a higher average of ~142 units/period (+112% vs previous P18-P21 regime).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 26. The supply chain is in a state of extended failure, with zero arrivals recorded from Period 18 through Period 25 (8 consecutive periods). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have a backlog of 837 units in-transit. Based on the history, orders from P15 and P17 are almost certainly lost. However, orders from P18 (133 units), P19 (40 units), P24 (183 units), and P25 (113 units) remain in the pipeline. Determining lead time is difficult due to the blockage; I am setting L to 4 as a conservative estimate of the delay until flow resumes. The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 22. Demand for P22-P25 was 121, 182, 122, 179, averaging ~151 units per period. I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand period while we wait for supply to resume.

Carry-over insight: Sustained supply blockage: 8 consecutive periods (P18-P25) with zero arrivals. Effective lead time for un-lost orders now exceeds 7 periods (P18 order still pending). Demand regime P22-P25 stabilized at ~151 units/period.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe and sustained blockage, with no arrivals since Period 17 (9 consecutive periods). Orders from P15 and P17 are confirmed lost. The pipeline now consists of orders from P18, P19, P24, P25, and P26 totaling 513 units (after subtracting lost units), but none have arrived, indicating the effective lead time has drifted significantly beyond the promised 2 periods. Currently, the P18 order (133 units) is 9 periods old, suggesting L is at least 9 for that specific shipment; however, the OR backend's cap logic creates a constraint. I will set L to 4 as a conservative 'explicit' estimate to allow the base stock to rise without hitting extreme cap limits that would prevent ordering. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime starting Period 22: the last five periods (P22-P26) show an average demand of 151.6 units. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this high-demand shift and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (std dev ~27). The goal is to maximize the order quantity to eventually recover from the total stockout once the blockage clears.

Carry-over insight: Sustained supply blockage: 9 consecutive periods (P18-P26) with zero arrivals. Effective lead time for first pending order (P18) is now 9 periods. Demand regime P22-P26 stabilized at ~152 units/period (+55% vs P14-P17 regime).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of total collapse with no arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (P18-P27). The orders from Period 15 and 17 are confirmed lost. The oldest pending order (Period 18) is now 10 periods old, making the effective lead time at least 10 periods. I am setting L to 10 to reflect this reality. Demand has stabilized at a higher level since Period 22; the average demand from Period 22 to 27 is approximately 155.3 units/period (121, 182, 122, 179, 154, 174). I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to capture this higher demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 6 periods to account for increased volatility. Despite the huge in-transit inventory of 881 units, the OR backend's capped policy and the extreme lead time mean we need to maintain parameters that signal a high base stock to trigger orders once the bottleneck clears, or to ensure we are first in line if supply resumes. I will not place an order this period (on-hand 0, in-transit 881 is very high relative to demand), but the parameters must reflect the current environment.

Carry-over insight: Sustained supply blockage: 10 consecutive periods (P18-P27) with zero arrivals. Effective lead time for first pending order (P18) is now 10 periods. Demand regime P22-P27 stabilized at ~155 units/period.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply blockage has finally broken: 44 units arrived in Period 28 (ordered in P26, lead time = 2). However, a significant amount of inventory (over 1000 units) remains in-transit from orders placed during the 10-period blockage (P18-P27). Demand has shown high volatility recently, dropping to 26 in P28 after averaging ~155 in P22-P27, suggesting a possible regime shift or outlier. Given the massive in-transit pipeline (1039 units) and the return to the promised lead time of 2 periods for the most recent arrival, I am setting L=2. To prevent over-ordering while awaiting the massive pipeline, mu_hat is set using the last 7 periods (N=7, covering the high-demand P22-P28 period) to capture the recent mean of ~137, and sigma_hat is set to reflect the extreme current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply blockage ended at Period 28 with a lead time of 2 periods for the P26 order. Massive pipeline inventory (1039 units) exists from the P18-P27 period. Demand dropped significantly in P28 (26 units) compared to the P22-P27 average (~155 units).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply blockage finally broke in Period 28 with the arrival of the Period 26 order (LT=2). However, a massive backlog of unfulfilled orders from Period 18 to Period 25 (totaling 853 units) remains in-transit, alongside the Period 28 order (202 units), bringing total pipeline inventory to 1055 units (the 'Current Status' shows 1039, but the history indicates a Period 28 order of 202 was placed). Demand has dropped sharply in the last two periods (26 and 46 units) compared to the preceding high-demand regime (~155 units), suggesting either another regime shift or market exhaustion following the long stockout. Given the extreme surplus in the pipeline (1039+ units vs. recent demand of <50), any new order would likely result in excessive holding costs. I am setting L to 2 (promised) and using 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sudden drop in demand. The OR backend will see the high pipeline inventory against this low demand forecast and correctly place zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28: average demand dropped from ~155 to ~36 (-76%) over the last 2 periods following the end of a 10-period supply blockage.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply blockage has resolved with lead times for recent orders (P26 and P28) returning to the promised 2 periods. However, the system is now dealing with a significant pipeline of orders (837 units) placed during the uncertainty, balanced against a highly erratic demand pattern. Following a steep drop in P28-P29, demand spiked to 187 in P30, suggesting potential volatility or pent-up demand release. Given the massive pipeline inventory relative to current demand, the priority is to avoid excessive overstocking and further holding costs. I will set the lead time to the promised 'default' of 2. For demand, I'll use the last 3 periods (P28-P30) to capture the post-blockage behavior, which averages roughly 86 units, providing a conservative but responsive forecast as the system stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilized: Lead time for the last two arrivals (P26, P28) was consistently 2 periods. Demand post-blockage (P28-P30) is highly volatile (range 26-187) with a mean of ~86.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods for recent arrivals (P26, P28). However, the system is currently recovering from a 10-period blockage, resulting in a large pipeline inventory of 837 units (from orders placed between P18 and P27, though some are confirmed lost). Demand post-blockage (P28-P31) has been highly volatile, with samples of 26, 46, 187, and 134 (mean ~98). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have a massive pipeline, the aim is to let existing orders arrive before placing new ones. I will set the lead time (L) to 2. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the last 4 periods (P28-P31) to capture the current high-volatility regime. Sigma_hat will also reflect this recent volatility (N=4). Given the 'In-transit' quantity of 837 vs a base stock of roughly 300-400, the OR backend will correctly result in an order of 0, avoiding further overstock once the blockage clearing finishes.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain blockage reported in previous periods (P18-P27) created a massive backlog in the pipeline (837 units), but recent arrivals (P28 and P30) suggest that the 'logjam' has broken and current lead times have returned to the promised 2 periods for new orders. However, the system is now dealing with the fallout: extreme demand volatility (range 15-187) following the period of stockouts, and a surplus of older orders still in the pipeline that may arrive unpredictably. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand shifted significantly at P28; while P31 was high (134), P32 was very low (15). Using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat captures this post-blockage volatility while remaining cautious of the massive pipeline inventory (837 units). With in-transit stock far exceeding any reasonable base stock calculation, the OR backend's capped policy will correctly result in zero new orders until the pipeline clears or demand stabilizes at a much higher level. I will set L to 'calculate' to favor the most recent successful arrivals (2 periods) over the chaos of the blockage.

Carry-over insight: Post-blockage demand volatility: Period 28-32 demand fluctuates wildly (26, 46, 187, 134, 15), signaling unstable customer behavior after prolonged stockouts.

The supply chain is slowly recovering from a major 10-period blockage (P18-P27). While the P26 and P28 orders arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, there is a massive backlog of unfulfilled in-transit orders (837 units total) from P18-P25. Specifically, the P18 order (133 units) is now 16 periods overdue, and subsequent orders (P19, P24, P25) are also significantly late. These likely represent 'lost' or 'severely delayed' stock. However, since the system counts them in pipeline inventory, and the OR backend's capped policy will subtract them from the base stock calculation, I must monitor when/if they arrive. Demand is currently highly volatile post-blockage (P28-P33: 26, 46, 187, 134, 15, 86); the average over these last 6 periods is ~82.3. Given the current on-hand of 0 and the uncertainty of those legacy late orders, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 6-period demand regime to reflect this unstable recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Post-blockage demand regime (P28-P33) is highly volatile with an average of 82.3 units. Massive pipeline backlog (P18-P25 orders) remains undelivered despite the P26 and P28 orders arriving on time (L=2).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely disrupted. While orders from P26 and P28 arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, the massive pipeline backlog from P18-P25 (totaling 837 units) has not arrived and is increasingly likely to be lost or delayed indefinitely. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and despite the high 'In-transit' figure, the system is failing to satisfy demand. Post-blockage demand from Period 28-34 (26, 46, 187, 134, 15, 86, 123) is highly volatile with an average of 88.1 units. Since 'In-transit' (837) is far higher than any reasonable base stock for a lead time of 2, the OR backend will not place new orders if I use the promised L=2 and current pipeline. To force an order and bridge the current stockout, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to account for the ongoing unreliability and using the last 7 periods (P28-P34) to estimate lead-period demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). Given the 837 units in transit, the OR engine will still likely output an order of 0 unless L is significantly extended or the backend ignores lost shipments. I will set parameters to reflect the recent demand volatility to ensure that if the supply chain 'resets', we have an appropriate base stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-blockage demand (P28-P34) average is 88.1 units/period with high volatility (StdDev ~61). Pipeline backlog of 837 units (P18-P25) remains undelivered despite more recent orders (P26, P28) arriving in 2 periods, suggesting the older pipeline is likely lost.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after an extended 10-period blockage (P18-P27). Recent arrivals (orders from P26 and P28) both demonstrated a lead time of 2 periods, matching the promised lead time. The 837 units in-transit from orders placed between P15-P25 are significantly overdue and likely lost, as later orders have already arrived. Relying on these units to satisfy demand will lead to persistent stockouts. Demand since the blockage ended (P28-P35) remains highly volatile, ranging from 15 to 187, but has averaged 93.8 units over the last 8 periods. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the likelihood that the older pipeline is lost, I will set L=2 (confirmed stable) and use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-blockage demand behavior while the system ignores the zombie pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-blockage lead time confirmed at 2 periods (P26 and P28 orders). Pipeline inventory of 837 units (P15-P25) is confirmed lost/non-responsive. Demand regime post-blockage (P28 onwards) is volatile with an average of 93.8.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods, as evidenced by orders from P26 and P28 arriving exactly 2 periods later. The massive pipeline inventory of 837 units (from orders P15 to P25) is now confirmed as lost, as no units from that block have arrived in over 10 periods while more recent orders have arrived on time. Consequently, the 'In-transit' figure is misleading and the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is also zero, leading to persistent stockouts. The demand regime post-blockage (P28-P36) is highly volatile but averages approximately 97 units per period (samples: 26, 46, 187, 134, 15, 86, 123, 130, 27). To recover from the stockout and meet this volatile demand, I set L=2. I use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-blockage behavior. Given the zero inventory and the OR backend's min(base_stock - pipeline, cap) logic, the 'In-transit' units will inhibit ordering unless the backend ignores lost units. Since the prompt states the OR backend has no awareness of lost orders, I must ensure the parameters account for this gap, though my control is limited to the L, mu, and sigma values.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant disruption. While the promised lead time is 2 periods, a massive blockage occurred between periods 18 and 27. Orders from periods 26 and 28 arrived with a lead time of 2, indicating the logistics channel might be restored, but older orders (P15-P25) totaling 837 units in the pipeline are likely lost or permanently delayed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Since Period 28, demand has been highly volatile, fluctuating between 15 and 187 units. The average demand post-blockage (P28-P37) is approximately 94.4 units per period with a high standard deviation. To restore inventory and service levels, I'm setting the lead time to the promised 2 periods (as confirmed by the most recent successful arrivals) and using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the post-blockage demand profile while smoothing out extreme volatility. This will signal the OR backend to place an order that accounts for the 0 on-hand inventory and the unreliability of the 837 'in-transit' units.

Carry-over insight: Post-blockage demand (P28-P37) stabilized at an average of ~94 units/period with significantly high volatility (StdDev ~65). Lead time for fresh orders (post-P26) appears to have reverted to the promised 2 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a major blockage between Periods 18-27. Fresh orders placed since Period 26 have demonstrated a lead time of 2 periods (P26 and P28). The 'in-transit' pipeline of 837 units consists of orders from Periods 15-25, which are now confirmed as lost/non-responsive and should be ignored for inventory calculations as they will not arrive. Demand post-blockage (P28 onwards) has transitioned into a highly volatile regime, likely due to distorted customer behavior following prolonged stockouts. Specifically, looking at the last 11 periods (P28-P38), the mean demand is ~85 units/period with a high standard deviation. I am setting L=2 (explicit) to align with recent observations, and using recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility post-blockage regime while ignoring the 'lost' pipeline and the previous blockage distorted data.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has effectively collapsed for a second time. No orders have arrived since Period 30 (the Period 28 order), despite a promised lead time of 2. There have been 9 consecutive periods (P31-P39) with zero arrivals. The 'In-transit' quantity of 837 units consists of orders from P15-P25 which were already flagged as lost; essentially, the pipeline is empty of viable stock. Demand is extremely volatile (post-P28 average ~82), likely due to the prolonged stockouts. Because there is 0 on-hand and the current 'In-transit' is composed of lost units, the OR backend must place new orders. I will set L to 2 (promised) to trigger ordering based on the most recent functional lead time, but I will use a conservative 'recent_N' of 12 for demand to capture the high volatility post-blockage while smoothing out the zeros and spikes.

Carry-over insight: Second supply blockage confirmed: 9 consecutive periods (P31-P39) without arrivals. The 837 units in transit are confirmed lost. Post-blockage demand (P28-P39) is highly unstable, averaging ~82 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of extended systemic failure. No orders have arrived since Period 30 (P28 order). All inventory currently listed as 'In-transit' (837 units from P15-P25) is confirmed lost, as these orders are now 15-25 periods overdue against a promised lead time of 2. There have been zero arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (P31-P40), indicating a complete supply blockage. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' as a deduction from the target base stock; because the backend still sees 837 units in flight, it will not place new orders unless those units are accounted for. Since the actual lead time is functioning as 'infinite' or 'lost', I must set L to an explicit high value or use explicit mu_hat/sigma_hat to force the backend to ignore the phantom pipeline and attempt to re-order. However, the OR logic 'final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap)' means if pipeline (837) exceeds base_stock, the order will be zero. Given demand averages ~82 units, the 837 units in pipeline are ~10x the expected base stock. To overcome this, I must set mu_hat to a value high enough to exceed the 837 in-transit units to trigger a replenishment order. Demand is currently averaging 82.3 (P28-P40). I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost pipeline and target a new order.

Carry-over insight: Supply blockage continues: 10 consecutive periods (P31-P40) with zero arrivals. Reconfirmed 837 units in-transit as lost; replenishment orders stalled due to phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of crisis with a massive 'phantom' pipeline inventory preventing replenishment. In-transit units total 1287, but periodic arrivals (P26, P28) suggest that older orders (specifically the 837 units from P15-P25) are permanently lost. Additionally, a second blockage is occurring: orders from P31-P40 have not arrived. Since the backend OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock to determine orders, it will never place a new order as long as it believes this phantom inventory (1287 units) will arrive. To 'force' the engine to order despite this high pipeline, I must set the mu_hat (target inventory level) to exceed the phantom pipeline significantly. The current demand post-P28 is volatile but averages ~88 units. To ensure the OR engine triggers a replenishment that overcomes the 1287 phantom units while accounting for an expected lead time of 2-3 periods, I am explicitly setting mu_hat to 1800. This is calculated to cover approximately 3-4 periods of demand PLUS the phantom pipeline. L is set to explicit 2 (the last observed functioning lead time), and sigma_hat is set to a high explicit value to account for the extreme demand volatility observed post-blockage.

Carry-over insight: Second supply blockage continues: no arrivals for 11 consecutive periods (P31-P41). Total in-transit inventory (1287 units) is largely composed of confirmed lost shipments (837 units from P15-25) and severely delayed/lost late-game orders. Manual over-ordering via mu_hat is required to bypass pipeline inventory logic.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of severe prolonged failure. We are currently in the 12th consecutive period without an arrival (P31-P42). The in-transit inventory of 2030 units is largely composed of confirmed lost shipments (837 units from the P15-P25 period) and significantly delayed orders from the current disruption. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory (including lost units) from the base stock, it will not place a replenishment order unless the base stock exceeds 2030 units. To force an order and bypass the phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an extremely high 'explicit' value. Demand has been volatile since the first blockage ended, but since Period 28, it has averaged approximately 83 units per period. I will use L=2 (promised) to avoid inflating the cap unnecessarily, but increase mu_hat significantly to overcome the in-transit deadweight and trigger a shipment.

Carry-over insight: Second supply blockage continues: no arrivals for 12 consecutive periods (P31-P42). Total in-transit (2030 units) is dominated by lost shipments. Manual base stock inflation via mu_hat is required to force ordering.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a prolonged state of failure with 13 consecutive periods (P31-P43) of zero arrivals. There is a massive 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 3,131 units, which includes 837 units confirmed lost from the P15-P25 period and further stalled shipments from earlier periods. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline inventory (including lost units) from the target base stock, it will not place a new order unless the target base stock exceeds 3,131 units. The current demand regime (P28-P43) averages approximately 87 units/period with high volatility (StdDev ~61). To force a replenishment order in the face of this pipeline bloat, I am continuing the strategy of heavily inflating mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value of 4,500. This is calculated to overcome the 3,131 units in transit plus a buffer for current demand (approx 100 units/period) and recent volatility. I will keep L at method 'calculate' to reflect the systemic delays and sigma_hat at 'recent_N' (N=16) to account for the high volatility since the first blockage ended.

Carry-over insight: Second supply blockage continues: no arrivals for 13 consecutive periods (P31-43). Total in-transit (3131 units) is dominated by lost/stalled shipments. Manual base stock inflation via explicit mu_hat is mandatory to bypass pipeline logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1850.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply blockage has finally partially broken with the arrival of the Period 41 order (450 units) at Period 44 (actual lead time = 3). Prior to this, no arrivals occurred for 13 periods (P31-P43). The inventory system is currently burdened with 4,015 units 'In-transit', although 837 of these (ordered P15-P25) are known lost, and a significant portion of the rest are likely stalled or lost. To ensure the backend continues to place orders despite this massive 'phantom' pipeline, I must continue using an explicit mu_hat that exceeds 'In-transit minus Lost' values. Current demand post-P28 averages ~90 units/period but is highly volatile. I will set mu_hat explicitly high (6000) to force a new order that bypasses the inflated pipeline, ensuring availability for the final 5 periods of the game. L is set to 3 based on the most recent arrival.

Carry-over insight: Supply blockage partially cleared at Period 44 (P41 order arrived, L=3). However, pipeline inventory remains extremely inflated (4015 units) due to historical lost/stalled shipments, necessitating explicit parameter overrides to trigger new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-2019.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply blockage has cleared spectacularly. In Period 45, we received 743 units (ordered P42) and 1101 units (ordered P43), leaving us with 2,171 units on-hand. However, the simulation's 'In-transit' figure is 3,768, which significantly includes the 837 units from the P15-P25 period and other legacy orders that are confirmed lost. My previous 'explicit' overrides were designed to force orders through this phantom pipeline. Now that on-hand inventory is extremely high (2,171 units) and the game ends in Period 50, we must immediately stop ordering to minimize holding costs. Demand is also showing extreme volatility; Period_45 demand was only 8 units. With 2,171 units on-hand and only 4 periods remaining, we have more than enough stock to cover even the most aggressive demand forecasts (~150/period * 4 = 600). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to 0 and L to 2 to prevent any further orders from being triggered by the OR backend, as the existing stock will comfortably satisfy all remaining demand.

Carry-over insight: Massive overstocking reached in Period 45 (2,171 units) following the release of the supply blockage. With 5 periods remaining, further ordering is ceased to maximize profit and minimize holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1411.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The focus for the rest of the game (Periods 47-50) is to liquidate the massive surplus on-hand inventory (2,133 units) accumulated after the supply blockage cleared in Period 45. Average demand in the most recent regime (P44-P46) is significantly lower than the inventory levels, and there are only 4 periods remaining. With a profit of $19 and a holding cost of $1, the priority is to avoid any further ordering to minimize holding costs, as current stock is more than sufficient to cover all possible demand for the remainder of the simulation. I am setting L to 0 and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 0 to ensure the base stock calculation results in zero and the OR backend places no further orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-73.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 2,030 units, which vastly exceeds the total remaining demand for the game (Periods 48, 49, and 50). Historical demand has fluctuated between 8 and 187 units per period in the recent post-blockage regime, with an average around 94. Even at the maximum observed demand levels, the existing stock will last well beyond the end of the simulation. To maximize total reward, we must avoid further ordering to prevent additional holding costs ($1/unit/period) on already excessive inventory. The goal is now to deplete the on-hand stock through sales while incurring zero new replenishment costs or holding costs for additional units. We maintain L=2 and set mu_hat/sigma_hat to 0 to ensure the backend base stock calculation remains below our current pipeline/on-hand levels, resulting in zero new orders.

Daily Profit: $3515.00, Daily Holding Cost: $1845.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1670.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, with only two periods left in the game (P49 and P50). Current on-hand inventory is 1845 units. Recent demand has been significantly lower than this inventory level (P45-P48 demand: 8, 38, 103, 185). Even if demand spikes to 200 units per period for the final two periods, we would still end the game with ~1445 units. Since holding costs are $1/unit and profit is $19/unit, any further ordering will only increase holding costs without increasing revenue, as current stock is more than sufficient to cover all remaining possible demand. Therefore, we set parameters to ensure a zero order by leveraging the default backend logic against our high on-hand and pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-505.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final period of the simulation. The current on-hand inventory is 1,778 units, while the total demand observed in the most recent period (P49) was only 67. The historical mean demand across the entire game is significantly lower than our current stock (averaging ~90-100 units). Given that any units ordered now will not arrive before the game ends (lead time is at least 2 periods) and that we already have enough inventory to cover the remaining demand several times over, further ordering would only decrease profit through unnecessary procurement costs (if applicable) and would certainly not increase revenue. The priority is to liquidate the existing inventory to maximize total reward and minimize ending inventory holding costs.
