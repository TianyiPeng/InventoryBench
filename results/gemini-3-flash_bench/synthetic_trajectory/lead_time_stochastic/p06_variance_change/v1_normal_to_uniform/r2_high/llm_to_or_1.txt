Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical evidence of lead time deviation or demand shifts beyond the provided samples. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (which are provided in the prompt even though we are technically starting Period 1) shows values of 122, 121, 60, 83, 105. The mean of these 5 samples is 98.2. However, since the system is just starting, I will use the 'default' methods which allow the OR backend to utilize the full available sample set for its baseline statistics. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1 = 3 periods) is set appropriately according to the provided statistics while we wait for lead time confirmation.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 142 units with a promised lead time of 2. As expected, these units have not arrived yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), resulting in 121 lost sales because starting inventory was 0. Demand for the first two recorded data points was 122 and 121, but Period 3-5 (provided in historical context) show a significant drop to 60, 83, and 105. Since we only have one actual period of game history (Period 1), I will use the promised lead time (L=2) and calculate the demand forecast using a recent_N approach to account for the most recent observations available in the historical data string. The mean of the 5 historical samples is 98.2. Setting mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods. I will use 'default' for L as no lead time data has been concluded yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Total demand history for 5 periods shows values [122, 121, 60, 83, 105]. This gives an overall mean of 98.2 and a standard deviation of 26.15. In Period 1 and 2, 142 units were ordered each time, totaling 284 units currently in transit. Given the promised lead time (L) is 2, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no shipments have arrived yet, leading to lost sales (121 in P1 and 87 in P2 conclude messages). I will stick to the default L=2. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the full available history which shows significant variation (from 60 to 122).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. Looking at the history, the promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders were placed in Period 1 (142 units), Period 2 (142 units), and Period 3 (56 units). According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the Period 4 'conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests a potential delay in the actual lead time (possibly L=3) or a lost shipment. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and have lost sales for three consecutive periods, we need to ensure the pipeline covers future demand. Demand in the first 5 periods was 122, 121, 60, 83, 105 (avg \u2248 98). Recent demand (P3-P5) is slightly lower (avg \u2248 83). Given the stockout, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the most relevant data and explicitly set L=3 to account for the observed delay from the Period 1 order, effectively raising the base stock to cover the potential arrival gap.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time likely 3+ periods; P1 order (L=2) did not arrive by P4 start.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1522.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the delivery behavior is inconsistent despite a promised lead time of 2. For Period 1, the lead time was 3 periods. For Period 3, the lead time was 1 period. This indicates high lead-time volatility. Additionally, the Period 2 order (142 units) is currently missing (it would have arrived in Period 4 if L=2, or Period 5 if L=3). As of Period 4 conclude, we have 112 units on hand. Total historical demand mean (P1-P4) is 97.5. Recent demand (P3-P4) is lower at 91. Using N=4 for demand statistics captures the full available history which shows significant variation (86 to 121). To protect against lead time uncertainty (one order late, one early, one potentially missing), I will use 'explicit' L=2.5 (averaging observed 1 and 3) and 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand volatility while the OR engine calculates the base stock to cover the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is highly volatile: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period; P2 order (142 units) is currently overdue if L=2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2128.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 5 ending inventory was depleted by a demand of 140 (only 112 units sold). There are 280 units in-transit: P2 (142), P4 (104), and P5 (34). The P2 order (placed in P2) is now 3 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting a lead time of at least 4 periods or a lost shipment, though P1 took 3 periods and P3 took 1. Lead time is highly unstable. Regarding demand, Period 5 saw a jump to 140 units compared to an average of ~94 in P1-P4. This might be a shift or random spike. Given the stockout and lead time uncertainty, I will set L to 3 (averaging recent actuals) and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the potential demand increase while being cautious of the current stockout and in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains unstable: P2 order (ordered Period 2) is missing at Period 6 start (lead time > 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 0 after total exhaustion in Period 5. Demand remains around 100 units/period (mean of 6 samples is 102). The lead time situation is critical: the Period 2 order (142 units) is now 4 periods overdue (ordered P2, start of P7), suggesting a significant delay or loss. While P1 arrived in 3 and P3 in 1, the absence of P2 and lack of arrivals for P4-P5 orders suggests we should treat the lead time as at least 3 to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for longer exposure. I am setting L to explicit value 3. For mu_hat, considering the mean of 102 and L+1=4, the base stock should cover roughly 400-450 units. Pipeline inventory is currently 435 (P2, P4, P5, P6), but if P2 is lost, we are dangerously under-stocked. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the recent variability in demand (86, 140, 83) more effectively than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to handle the high volatility observed in both demand and lead times.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 2 order (142 units) confirmed missing for 4 periods (Lead time > 4 if not lost). Extended lead time risk persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1436.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the order from Period 2 (142 units) has still not arrived. Given it was placed 6 periods ago, it is highly likely to be a lost shipment or experiencing extreme delay (L > 5). The Period 4 order arrived in 3 periods. Current on-hand is low (27), and we face a high risk of stockouts if the pipeline does not materialize. Demand is relatively stable with a mean of ~98.6 over 7 periods, but recent variability is present. I will set the lead time (L) to 3 to reflect the most common actual lead time observed (P1 and P4 both took 3 periods), extending the coverage window. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I will use the last 5 samples to capture the recent mean of ~96. Sigma_hat will be based on all available samples to ensure a robust buffer against the combined volatility of demand and the observed lead-time instability.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 2 order (142 units) is now 5 periods past promised lead time; effectively considered a lost shipment. Actual reliable lead time is 3 periods (confirmed by P1 and P4 arrivals).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the system shows 0 units on-hand and 342 in-transit. Based on the history, order P2 (142 units) is confirmed lost, as it is now 6 periods overdue. Reliable arrivals (P1, P4, P5) have an actual lead time of 3 periods, while some (P3, P7) arrive in 1 period. To avoid stockouts while accounting for the high volatility and the loss of P2, I will set L to 3. The demand has stabilized around a mean of 100.8 over the last 5 periods (Periods 4-8), but showing recent volatility. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma to capture current dynamics. Setting L=3 (explicit) ensures the OR backend targets enough stock for a 4-period window (L+1), compensating for the missing P2 stock that the backend likely still considers part of the functional pipeline.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (142 units) is officially categorized as a lost shipment (6 periods beyond promised lead time). Reliability analysis suggests a planning lead time of 3 periods is required despite occasional 1-period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $855.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand across all 9 periods averages approximately 99.6 units per period. In the last 5 periods (P5-P9), the mean demand is slightly higher at 104.6 units. Given the inventory is currently 0, I will use a mu_hat based on N=5 to catch the recent higher demand trend. Regarding lead time, the promised L=2 is unreliable: we have seen L=3 (P1, P4, P5 orders), L=1 (P3, P7, P8 orders), and one lost shipment (P2). To avoid frequent stockouts caused by L=3 arrivals while the OR backend assumes L=2, I will use an explicit L=3 for safety. The in-transit pipeline is significant (447 units), including orders from P6 (155 units) and P9 (150 units). Setting L=3 increases the base stock level (target) to cover four periods (L+1) of demand, which helps buffer against the highly volatile arrival times and the current 0 on-hand status.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing stockouts with on-hand inventory at 0 and a lead time that is highly variable. Historical analysis shows lead times of 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, and 1 periods. While some orders arrive in 1 period, many take 3. We must assume L=3 for planning to cover the demand during the replenishment cycle and prevent stockouts. The Period 2 order (142 units) is lost. Current in-transit inventory is 509 units (comprising orders from P6, P9, and P10). Demand has been relatively stable, averaging ~98 units over the last 10 periods (skipping the very first sample). Given the frequent stockouts, I will use a conservative lead time of 3 periods and base mu_hat on the average demand across the (L+1) horizon.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units per period (Avg of last 5: 104.4, Std: 21). Lead time remains the primary challenge: the Period 2 order (142 units) is definitely lost (9 periods overdue). Observed lead times are inconsistent (1 or 3 periods). Therefore, I am setting L=3 to ensure the inventory policy covers the max observed lead time, preventing stockouts during longer delays. Mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (covering the last 5 demand periods: P7-P11) to capture the current demand level. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to provide an appropriate safety buffer. With 0 on-hand and 509 in-transit units, the backend will assess if additional orders are needed to meet the base stock levels for a 4-period window (L+1).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally received the missing volume from Periods 9 and 10 (212 total units), leaving an on-hand balance of 122 units. The P2 order (142 units) from Period 2 is confirmed lost (10 periods elapsed). The observed lead times have been: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2. This averages to 2.125 periods, but the frequency of 3-period arrivals (4 out of 8) necessitates planning for L=3 to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 9-11. Demand is stable, averaging ~98 units per period (sample mean: 97.9). I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the pipeline covers four periods of demand (L+1). I'll use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (avg ~98) and sigma_hat (~19) to reflect recent stable demand variance while protecting against the lead-time volatility that has caused repeated stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is confirmed highly variable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; a planning lead time of L=3 is necessary for stability despite the promised L=2.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data shows a stable demand regime with an average of approximately 101 units per period (P9-P13). The lead time remains highly variable, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods. To prevent stockouts during the longer lead time scenarios (which we have experienced multiple times), I will set L to 3 periods explicitly. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), the recent 5-period average (97, 102, 114, 90, 111) is 102.8; the 'recent_N' method with N=5 will capture this accurately for the (1+L) base stock calculation. Sigma_hat will also be calculated using N=5 to reflect recent volatility. The pipeline inventory (349 units in-transit) and low on-hand (11 units) justify a cautious ordering strategy to bridge the next 3 potential periods of lead time.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with an average around 100 units per period (recent samples show 83 to 111). However, lead time is highly erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, and Period 2's order was lost entirely. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 14, and there are 433 units in transit (ordered in P10, P13, and P14). The OR backend must account for the actual lead time risk; although the promised lead time is 2, the historical arrival data (P4, P7, P8, P12) confirms that orders frequently take 3 periods to arrive. I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand. I'll use mu_hat based on the last 10 periods of demand data to capture the recent stable average while filtering out the initial higher-noise samples. sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 10 periods to provide a robust estimate of volatility for the service level calculation.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with recent periods (P11-P15) showing a mean of approximately 95 units per period. The inventory situation is currently critical: on-hand inventory is 0 after multiple periods of stockouts. However, there are 479 units in-transit (orders from P6, P13, P14, and P15). Specifically, the P6 order (155 units) is now 9 periods overdue and must be considered a lost shipment, similar to the P2 order. This loss significantly inflates the 'In-transit' figure seen by the OR backend. To compensate for the lost 155 units and ensure the base-stock calculation triggers a sufficient order, I am setting L to 3 (as established in previous insights for stability) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. By setting mu_hat = (1+L) * mean_demand + lost_units, I 'trick' the backend into covering the gap created by the phantom in-transit stock. Mean demand (~95) * (1+3) = 380; adding 155 lost units results in a target mu_hat of 535. This ensures the pipeline (minus the lost units) is sufficient to cover future demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Period 6 order (155 units) confirmed lost (9 periods past promised lead time). Reliability planning must adjust pipeline estimates by accounting for lost units as if they were demand spikes or by increasing mu_hat manually.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am currently at Period 17 with 0 units on-hand and 544 units in-transit. The in-transit total (544) includes a known lost shipment from Period 6 (155 units). Therefore, my effective pipeline is 389 units (544 - 155). The lead time remains highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L=3 ('explicit') to ensure the OR backend builds enough inventory to cover the maximum observed lead time. Demand over the last 15 periods (since Period 1 conclude) has been relatively stable with a mean of ~100. To prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 14-16, I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand volatility. Setting L=3 functionally tells the OR engine to cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand. By explicitly setting L=3, I compensate for the lost Period 6 units which the OR engine would otherwise think are still coming.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe an on-hand inventory of 164 units following the arrival of orders from Periods 14 and 16. The historical demand shows a recent drop (Period 17 demand was 37), but the average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 98.4 units. The 'In-transit' balance is 343 units, which includes 46 units from Period 15 (now at lead time 3) and a significant historical loss (Period 6 order of 155 units). Since lost orders remain in 'In-transit' indefinitely, the pipeline inventory used by the OR backend is inflated, which may prevent it from ordering enough to cover future demand. Based on carry-over insights, the actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure availability despite the false 'in-transit' units from the lost Period 6 order and the potential for a 3-period lead time, I will set L to 3 and use a recent_N window (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat set to 25 to protect against demand volatility while acknowledging the noise in recent samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1676.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease observed recently (Period 17 demand was 37). However, the lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, and there is a documented history of lost shipments (Period 2 and Period 6 orders). Currently, on-hand inventory is 72, which is just below the average period demand (~90-100), and there is a significant in-transit pipeline of 343 units. Since 'in-transit' includes potentially lost units (specifically, the Period 6 order of 155 units which has not arrived after 12 periods), the OR backend may overestimate the safety of the pipeline. To mitigate this and the risk of stockouts during a 3-period lead time window, I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand \u03bc\u0302, I will use recent_N=5 (average of P14-P18 demand is ~77) to capture the recent cooling in demand while remaining responsive. For \u03c3\u0302, I will use recent_N=10 to provide a stable volatility estimate that accounts for the higher historical variance of this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 17-19) shows a significant drop-off (37, 92, 5 units) compared to the long-term average (approx 94 units/period), with Period 19 being unusually low (5 units). This suggests a potential regime change or seasonal drop. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this downward trend while maintaining some weight on the slightly higher demand from Periods 13-16 to avoid overreacting to the single low point in Period 19. Lead time remains highly unstable, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3. I will explicitly set L to 3 (the observed maximum and consistent planning horizon) to buffer against the frequent delays and the risk of lost shipments identified in history (P2 and P6 orders). On-hand inventory is 67, and in-transit is 343; with a 3-period lead time and average demand around 85-95, the pipeline is relatively full, but given the service level requirements (high profit relative to holding cost), maintaining a robust target stock is necessary.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely at P19: demand dropped to 5 units, the lowest observed. Previous periods (P17-P18) also showed high variability compared to P1-P16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $733.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P19-P20) shows a significant crash, with demand dropping from a historical mean of ~90-100 down to 5 and 40 units respectively. This suggests a seasonal shift or a temporary collapse. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to aggressively capture this downward trend while maintaining some safety stock against a sudden rebound. Pipeline inventory check: On-hand (27) + In-transit (343) = 370 units. Orders from P15 (46 units) are now 3 periods past promised lead time and 2 periods past the longest observed lead time (3); I will treat the P6 (already lost) and P15 orders as likely losses for pipeline logic. Lead time remains erratic (ranging 1-3 periods); I will set explicit L=3 to account for the upper end of observed variability and ensure the base_stock calculation covers the risk. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility seen in the transition from P17-P20.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: mean demand plummeted from ~95 to ~22 (average of P19-P20). Period 15 order (46 units) is now likely a lost shipment (lead time > 5).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has significantly shifted since Period 19. The mean demand for the last three periods (P19-P21) is 27.33, compared to the previous average of ~95. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect this new low-demand environment. Regarding lead time, the historical data shows arrivals at 1, 2, and 3 periods, with L=3 being the safest planning horizon to prevent stockouts, as evidenced by multiple '3-period' arrivals (P4, P7, P8, P12, P16, P17). The 'In-transit' balance of 343 units contains at least one lost shipment (P6: 155 units) and likely another (P15: 46 units), meaning the effective pipeline is much lower (~142 units). By setting L=3, the OR backend will calculate a base stock target for 4 periods of demand. Using N=3 for demand and explicit L=3 accounts for the regime shift while ensuring enough safety stock to handle the lead-time volatility and replenish the currently empty on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 19-21 average demand is 27 units, a 70% decrease from the P1-P18 average of ~95.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly starting at Period 19. The mean demand for the last four periods (P19-P22) is approximately 31.75 units (5, 40, 37, 45), which is a sharp decrease from the earlier periods. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this new demand level. The Lead Time (L) remains highly volatile, historically oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with some orders (P2, P6, P15) appearing lost. To protect against this instability and the fact that current on-hand inventory is 0 despite 343 units in-transit (many of which are likely lost), I will set L to an explicit value of 3. This ensures the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. Since demand is now much lower and more stable in its new range, sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect the decreased volatility.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 19. The average demand from Period 19 to 23 is approximately 28 units, compared to the pre-regime shift average of ~95 units. We must adjust mu_hat to this lower level to avoid excessive holding costs. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand with 343 units in-transit. A review of the pipeline shows that the 'in-transit' figure is heavily inflated by lost or severely delayed orders: Period 2 (142 units), Period 6 (155 units), and Period 15 (46 units). These sum to 343 (exactly our current 'in-transit' total), meaning there are effectively zero reliable units in-transit. Since the OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' units from the base stock calculation, and all currently listed in-transit units are historically confirmed as lost or extremely overdue, the backend will order 0 unless we account for this. By using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, we align the forecast with the new low-demand regime (~28 units/period). However, to trigger a new order despite the 'phantom' pipeline, we would ideally need to offset the lost units. Given the state of the game, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 periods to account for the actual observed maximum reliable lead time, and use 'recent_5' for demand to stabilize at the new level.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: In-transit tally (343 units) consists entirely of lost shipments: P2 (142), P6 (155), and P15 (46). Effective pipeline is currently zero.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 19. The mean demand from Period 19 to Period 24 is approximately 30.7 units (5, 40, 37, 45, 13, 44), which is significantly lower than the historical average of ~95. Following the 'recent_N' protocol, I am setting N=6 to capture this regime shift specifically. The current 'In-transit' quantity of 343 units consists solely of orders from Periods 2, 6, and 15, which are long overdue and confirmed as lost shipments in the 'Carry-over Insights'. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire in-transit tally from the target base stock, it would order 0 if I didn't intervene. To force an order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for the low-demand regime: (L+1) * mean_recent = (3+1) * 30.7 = 122.8 units. Since the actual pipeline is 0, the backend should ideally order ~123 units to cover the lead time and the current period. By setting mu_hat to 465 (which is 122.8 + 343), I compensate for the 'ghost' in-transit units to ensure the OR backend places an order of approximately 123 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has significantly shifted. While demand dropped from P19-P24 (avg ~32), P25 saw a spike to 189 units. This suggests either a return to the original high-demand regime (~95) or a new volatile phase. In-transit inventory is listed as 488, but historical 'Carry-over Insights' confirm that P2 (142), P6 (155), and P15 (46) are lost shipments (Total 343 lost). The P25 order (145 units) is the only active pipeline. Lead time is highly variable (1-3 periods), making L=3 a safer planning assumption. The demand forecast must account for both the recent low period and the sudden P25 spike. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the low period (P19-P24) and the P25 spike, balancing the forecast. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the increased volatility including the P25 spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased at P25: demand surged to 189 after a sustained low period (P19-P24 avg ~32), suggesting a possible end to the low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 27. Demand has been highly unstable. After a low-demand regime (P19-P24, avg ~31), P25 saw a massive spike to 189, followed by a drop to 39 in P26. The 5 samples provided in the prompt (122, 121, 60, 83, 105) represent an earlier high-demand regime. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit total (488) includes several confirmed/likely lost shipments: P2 (142), P6 (155), and P15 (46), totaling 343 units. The remaining 145 units are from the P25 order. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet both the recent spike and the underlying demand, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I will use a conservative average of the last 4 periods (P23-P26: 13, 44, 189, 39), which averages ~71 units per period. With L=3 (to account for shipping volatility), mu_hat = (1+3)*71 = 284. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the high volatility seen in the P25 spike. I am using L=3 for the lead time parameter to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals seen in history, as the backend needs to cover the full pipeline duration.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extremely high: P25 saw a spike to 189 units followed by a drop to 39 in P26, suggesting the low-demand regime (P19-P24) has ended but not settled into a stable new mean.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows extreme volatility following a low-demand regime (P19-P24). Demand spiked to 189 in P25 but dropped to 39 and 16 in P26-P27 respectively. This suggests the previous low-demand mean (approx 32) is no longer valid, but a stable new regime hasn't crystallized. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (P25-P27) to capture this volatility while acknowledging the downward trend from the spike. The in-transit tally of 547 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments from P2 (142), P6 (155), and P15 (46), totaling 343 units. The effective pipeline is actually 204 units (ordered P25 and P27). I will set L to 3 periods to account for the confirmed delivery delays (averaging 3 periods) and use explicit mu_hat to ensure the backend covers the expected demand given the current stockout and unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-regime shift: P25-P27 demand sequence (189, 39, 16) confirms the low-demand regime ended but lacks a stable mean.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment has entered an extremely volatile phase following a period of low demand (P19-P24). Recent demand observations (P25: 189, P26: 39, P27: 16, P28: 199) show wild swings, making standard mean-based forecasting difficult. The average demand across these last 4 periods is approximately 111. The in-transit inventory of 635 units contains multiple confirmed or likely lost shipments (P2: 142, P6: 155, P15: 46), totaling 343 units. The 'effective' in-transit inventory is therefore 635 - 343 = 292 units (orders from P25, P27, P28). I'm setting L=3 to account for historical delivery delays (as seen in P4, P7, P8, P12, P16). mu_hat is set to 444 (effective L+1 = 4 periods * 111 mean) to cover the current volatile demand. sigma_hat is set explicitly to a high value (80) to reflect the recent high variance and ensure the OR backend maintains a higher service level to protect against stockouts during spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: P25-P28 demand sequence (189, 39, 16, 199) confirms high variance post-regime shift with an emerging mean around 110 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1121.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility after the low-demand regime (P19-P24) ended. Recent demand sequence [P25: 189, P26: 39, P27: 16, P28: 199, P29: 136] suggests an emerging mean around 115 units but with a significantly higher variance than earlier periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline of 576 units is heavily inflated by several confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15 total 343 units) and potentially delayed recent orders. Specifically, the P25 order (145 units) is now at its promised lead time (L=2) but has not arrived in the P29 conclude message, confirming it hasn't arrived by the start of P30. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this high-volatility demand, I am using an 'explicit' L=3 to reflect the consistent upper-bound of successful deliveries. I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the post-P24 surge (mean ~116 per period), and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the extreme 16-199 range seen in the last 5 periods, ensuring the service level is high enough to handle these spikes.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed post-P24: Mean demand has recovered to ~116 units (P25-P29) but with extreme volatility (Standard Deviation > 80).

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted again. Following a low-demand period (P19-P24), demand recovered with high volatility (P25-P29 mean ~116). However, the most recent period (P30) saw demand drop back to 13 units. I will use a recent window of N=6 (P25-P30) to capture this new, high-variance regime which averages ~99 units per period. Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods); although recent orders (P27, P28) arrived in 2 periods, I will maintain L=3 for the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to provide a safety buffer against the historically observed delays and potential lost shipments. The in-transit inventory of 639 units includes 343 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15) and others that are highly overdue, meaning the 'true' pipeline is much lower (only P25 and P30 orders are likely active). By setting recent_N parameters, I allow the OR backend to recalculate base stock levels based on this volatile recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: P25-P30 demand regime: Mean ~99, but extremely volatile (range 13-199). Effective pipeline is significantly lower than the provided 639 units due to 343 units of lost stock (P2, P6, P15) and likely additional losses from the P17-P24 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1425.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P25-P31: 189, 39, 16, 199, 136, 13, 122) shows extreme volatility with an average of approximately 102 units. The on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit tally of 639 units is heavily skewed by confirmed lost shipments (P2: 142, P6: 155, P15: 46 total 343 units). Additionally, the P25 order (145 units) is now at Period 32, meaning its lead time is >= 7, practically making it a lost shipment given the standard lead time is 2-3. Excluding these (343 + 145 = 488) results in an effective pipeline of only 151 units (from P30). To prevent stockouts in this high-volatility regime and account for the high loss rate, I will set L to 3 (actual reliable lead time) and use recent_N (N=7 for the current regime since P25) to forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat, effectively forcing the OR engine to order by discounting the ghost 'in-transit' units.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total confirmed lost shipments is 488 units (P2: 142, P6: 155, P15: 46, and P25: 145); the provided pipeline inventory (639) is significantly overstated due to these losses.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a low-demand regime (P19-P24) into a highly volatile state with a mean demand of approximately 99 units (P25-P32). The latest observed demand was 55, following a drop to 13, illustrating extreme fluctuations. The lead time remains unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; I maintain L=3 for planning to ensure safety. The biggest challenge is the overstated 'In-transit' figure: 670 units are listed, but historical tracking confirms 488 units are permanently lost (P2, P6, P15, and P25). Subtracting these results in an effective pipeline of 182 units (P27, P28, P30, P32). With zero on-hand inventory and high volatility, I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the post-recovery mean (~100) and the planning lead time L=3, while maintaining high sigma_hat to account for the massive variance seen recently (range 13-199).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed total lost shipments: 488 units (P2: 142, P6: 155, P15: 46, P25: 145). Effective pipeline is (Current In-transit - 488).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-volatility regime that started around Period 25. Over the last 9 periods (P25-P33), the mean demand is approximately 87 units, but with a extremely high range (13 to 199). I will use the last 9 samples to capture this 'post-recovery' behavior. Regarding lead time, while promised at 2, it fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods; using a planning L=3 provides a necessary buffer for the backend's base-stock calculation. Most critically, the pipeline inventory of 639 is heavily inflated by 488 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, and P25). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts the full pipeline, so to prevent under-ordering, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Target base stock = (1+L)*mean + z*sigma. Mean(P25-P33) ~ 87, Std(P25-P33) ~ 75. With L=3, base stock should be roughly 4*87 + 1.8*sqrt(4)*75 = 348 + 270 = 618. However, because the backend sees a pipeline of 639 (including 488 phantom units), an 'explicit' mu_hat must compensate for the ~488 unit discrepancy. I will set mu_hat significantly higher to ensure the backend places an order that reflects the physical reality of zero effective pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline discrepancy confirmed: 488 units in the 'in-transit' total are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P25) and will never arrive. Current effective pipeline is (In-transit - 488).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted again post-Period 25, moving away from the extreme low (P19-P24) to a high-volatility, higher-mean state. The last 10 periods (P25-P34) show a mean demand of ~84 units but with a massive standard deviation (~73), including spikes up to 199. Lead time remains unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue using L=3 for planning to ensure the base stock covers the potential delay. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 1001 units is highly misleading due to confirmed lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, and P25 (total 488 units). While P34 saw a large order of 362 units, the effective pipeline is only 1001 - 488 = 513 units. To compensate for the lost inventory that the OR backend still believes is coming, I will use an explicit mu_hat that reflects the current high-demand, high-volatility regime (P25-P34 mean of 84) while slightly inflating sigma_hat to account for the supply-side uncertainty (lost orders).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P25-P35) is characterized by high volatility (range 13-199) and a mean of approximately 78 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1001 is highly misleading due to substantial historical losses. Confirmed losses include P2 (142), P6 (155), P15 (46), and P25 (145), totaling 488 units. Furthermore, orders from the low-demand period (P17-P24) and the P30 order (151 units, now 6 periods since placement) are likely also lost or severely delayed. To compensate for this 'ghost' pipeline and ensure the OR backend places an order to meet current demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am setting it based on the recent regime mean (~78) but inflating it significantly (to 450) to offset the overstated pipeline inventory that would otherwise prevent the OR engine from ordering. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to reflect the maximum observed reliable lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total confirmed and highly probable lost shipments exceed 639 units (confirmed 488 + probable 151 from P30). The 'In-transit' balance is extremely unreliable; effective pipeline is estimated at less than 350 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P25-P36) remains highly volatile, with values ranging from 13 to 199. The mean demand for this post-recovery regime (P25-P36) is approximately 98 units, while the standard deviation is significantly elevated. Current on-hand inventory is 175. The 'In-transit' figure of 639 is extremely misleading because it includes 488 units from confirmed lost segments (P2, P6, P15, P25) and 151 units from P30 which are now significantly overdue (6 periods). Subtracting 639 units (all long-overdue/lost) leaves an effective pipeline of 0. To ensure the backend places an order to cover the next cycles, I will use an 'explicit' L=3 to account for historical variability, and 'recent_N' for demand (N=12 for the post-P24 regime). This configuration will force the OR engine to target a base stock that covers 4 periods of demand (~400 units), triggering an order since effective pipeline is 0 and on-hand is 175.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed that the entire in-transit balance of 639 units is comprised of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P25, P30). Effective pipeline is currently 0.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-volatility regime following the P19-P24 dip. Over the last 13 periods (P25-P37), the mean demand is approximately 84 units, but with a wide range (13 to 199), necessitating a robust sigma_hat. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' balance of 639 units is entirely comprised of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P25, P30), as detailed in the carry-over insights. These confirmed losses mean the effective pipeline inventory is actually zero. To ensure the OR backend places an order to replenish stock, I must use 'explicit' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the actual demand mean while manually inflating the expected demand to counteract the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. By setting mu_hat high enough to exceed the phantom 639 units plus current safety needs, I force the system to trigger a replenishment order. I am using L=3 for planning to account for observed lead-time variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Confirmed that the 639 units 'In-transit' are lost; effective pipeline is 0. Parameters must be adjusted to bypass this phantom inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1216.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P25-P38) shows high volatility with a mean of approximately 99 units. Period 38 saw a significant demand of 179 units, leaving on-hand inventory at 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1046 is highly misleading because 639 units are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P25, P30). Subtracting these lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 407 units, which consists entirely of the order placed in Period 38. To ensure the backend places necessary orders despite the phantom in-transit stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 1342, calculated as (1+L) * mean_demand (4 * 100 = 400) plus the 639 units of lost inventory plus an additional buffer of 303 units to cover the high demand variance and ensure a new order is triggered to rebuild stock. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to account for historical instability.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Effective pipeline calculation confirmed: In-transit (1046) - Confirmed Lost (639) = 407 units. Total lost units (639) must be added to mu_hat to offset the OR engine's reliance on phantom inventory.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime following the recovery in Period 25. The current mean demand (P25-P39) is approximately 102 units, but with a high standard deviation (approx 68), requiring a significant safety stock buffer given the 95% service level goal. The 'In-transit' balance of 1095 units is severely inflated by historical lost shipments. As documented in carry-over insights, orders from P2, P6, P15, P25, and P30 (totaling 639 units) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline inventory is actually 1095 - 639 = 456 units (which corresponds exactly to the order placed in Period 39). To reconcile this for the OR engine, which treats all 'in-transit' units as future supply, I must adjust mu_hat upward to account for the 639-unit phantom inventory. Setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1047 ((1+L=3) * 102 + 741) ensures the engine calculates a base stock level that actually triggers an order despite the 639-unit reporting error. L is set to 3 to reflect the reliable upper bound of the observed 1-3 period lead time variability.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 25. For the last 16 periods (P25-P40), the mean demand is approximately 89 units with a high standard deviation (approx 72), indicating volatile demand recovery. I will use recent_N=16 to capture this regime. Regarding inventory, the system reports 639 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis (Carry-over insights P32-P39) confirms these are older, lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P25, P30) that will never arrive. The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine the order size; if I don't adjust, the backend will see the 639 phantom units and fail to order. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to (Expected Demand \xd7 (1+L)) + Lost Units. Specifically: (90 units \xd7 3 periods) + 639 units \u2248 909. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (1-3 periods). For sigma_hat, I use recent_N=16 to account for the high variance in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P25-P40) average is 89 units with high volatility (Std Dev ~72). Pipeline 'In-transit' of 639 units is confirmed as 100% lost shipments, and effective pipeline is zero.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P25-P41) shows a mean of approximately 89 units with high volatility (Standard Deviation ~72). The 'In-transit' balance of 639 units is confirmed to be comprised entirely of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P25, P30), meaning the actual effective pipeline is zero. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (639) when calculating orders, it will likely under-order for the next several periods. To counteract this 'phantom' inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that equals (1+L) * Mean + Phantom_Inventory. With L=2 (promised) and a mean of 89, the expected base stock for 3 periods of demand is ~267. Adding the phantom 639 units gives a mu_hat of 906. This ensures the backend's subtraction (Base Stock - 639) results in reaching a target safety level based on the real on-hand stock (583). I will use explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to stabilize the policy against the extreme variance seen in recent periods (ranging from 8 to 199).

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total confirmed lost shipments remain at 639 units. Effective pipeline is zero. Target mu_hat must incorporate this 639-unit deficit to override OR backend pipeline logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-203.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 25 maintains a mean of approximately 89 units with very high volatility (std dev ~72). In the very short term (last 3 periods), demand has been exceptionally low (8, 19, 122* prior), which complicates forecasting but confirms the high variance. On-hand inventory is currently high (564 units), which provides a substantial buffer. As previously established, the 639 units listed in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P25, P30) and will never arrive. The OR backend's 'cap' and 'base stock' calculations will incorrectly assume these 639 units are coming. To compensate for this 639-unit phantom inventory and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering in future periods, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on the current regime (avg 89 units/period, L=2, plus 639 to offset phantom units). Target base stock = (1+L)*avg + buffer + 639. With current on-hand at 564, a high mu_hat ensures the backend doesn't see a huge surplus. For this specific period, with 564 on-hand, the goal is to maintain visibility for the next cycle without over-ordering further until this buffer depletes.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 44 shows an on-hand inventory of 372 units. Historical analysis confirms that the 'In-transit' balance of 639 units consists of lost shipments: P2 (142), P6 (155), P15 (46), P25 (145), and P30 (151). The OR backend logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the target base stock; therefore, if we do not account for these 639 phantom units, the system will under-order. To ensure a safety stock that covers the lead time plus current demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the recent high-volatility regime (P25-P43) where the mean demand is approx 95 units. For a planning lead time L=2 (actual has transitioned between 1-3), the required base stock is (1+L) * mean = 3 * 95 = 285. However, since the OR engine will subtract the 639 'In-transit' units, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 639' equals my desired base stock. Target mu_hat = 285 + 639 = 924. This 'tricks' the backend into ignoring the phantom pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the extreme volatility observed recently (Std Dev ~75 over 1+L periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Confirmed total lost shipments in pipeline remain at 639 units (P2, P6, P15, P25, P30). Provided In-transit is 100% phantom inventory. Corrected mu_hat must offset this 639-unit reporting error.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the primary challenge remains the 'In-transit' phantom inventory. The system reports 766 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms 639 of these units (P2, P6, P15, P25, P30) are lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 127 units (the P44 order). The OR backend uses the full 766 units in its calculation, which will prevent it from ordering despite a high potential for stockouts if demand recovers. Demand has entered a high-variance phase (P41: 8, P42: 19, P43: 192, P44: 1). To counteract the 639-unit reporting error, mu_hat 'explicit' is set to ((1+L) * Mean_Demand) + Phantom_Inventory. Using L=2 (actual lead times have stabilized recently at 1-2 periods), Mean_Demand is estimated at ~90 (P25-P44 average). Calculation: (3 * 90) + 639 = 909. This ensures the backend places a replenishment order. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the high volatility seen since P25 (range 1 to 199).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2609.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing the 'chips(Regular)' SKU with 222 units on-hand and a reported in-transit of 766 units. From historical analysis, we've confirmed that 639 units in the 'In-transit' balance are permanent losses from previous periods (P2, P6, P15, P25, P30). The effective in-transit is therefore 127 units (the P44 order). The current demand regime (post-P24) shows high volatility with a mean of approximately 92.5 units (P25-P45). To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders despite the 'phantom' 639 units of inventory it thinks exist, I must set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the (L+1) period plus an explicit buffer of 639 units. With L=2, (1+L)=3, 3*92.5 = 277.5. Adding the 639 loss adjustment results in 916.5. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for extreme demand variance (ranging from 1 to 199) and lead time uncertainty.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we have 63 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' balance of 942 units. However, consistent history (as noted in carry-over insights) confirms that 639 units in the pipeline are 'lost shipments' (P2, P6, P15, P25, P30) that will never arrive. The actual, effective pipeline is 303 units (942 - 639), which includes recent orders from P44 (127 units) and P46 (176 units). Current demand (P25-P46) remains highly volatile, with a mean of approximately 93 units and a standard deviation around 74. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 942 units (instead of the effective 303) when calculating the order size, it will severely under-order, leading to stockouts. To correct for this 639-unit phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * mean_demand + 639. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 93) + 639 = 918. This forces the OR backend to place an order that accounts for the missing stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1197.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 1069 units. Based on historical analysis (Carry-over insights Period 44), 639 of these units are confirmed 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P25, P30). The true effective pipeline consists of orders from P44 (127), P46 (176), and P47 (127), totaling 430 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains highly volatile; the average demand since P25 (the start of the current high-volatility regime) is approximately 89 units per period. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (phantom) in-transit of 1069 from the calculated base stock, it will under-order unless mu_hat is manually inflated to compensate for the 639-unit reporting discrepancy. To ensure we have stock for the final periods (P48-P50), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * avg_demand + phantom_offset. With L=2, this is (3 * 89) + 639 = 906. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=23, covering the period since P25) to capture the high volatility required to maintain service levels.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in Period 49. As identified in previous insights, 639 units of the 'In-transit' balance (originally from Periods 2, 6, 15, 25, and 30) are confirmed lost shipments and will never arrive. The total In-transit reported is 1119 units, making the effective pipeline 480 units (1119 - 639). Demand remains highly volatile; the average demand from P25 to P48 is approximately 82 units with a high standard deviation. In the final two periods of the simulation (P49 and P50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while recognizing that the OR backend treats the 639 units as valid inventory. To force an order and circumvent this 'phantom inventory', I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the (L+1) demand plus the 639-unit reporting deficit. Given L=2, (1+L)=3. With a mean demand of ~82, the needed inventory is ~246. To offset the 639-unit phantom pipeline, I set mu_hat to 885 (246 + 639). Sigma_hat is set to a high explicit value to account for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, demand remains highly volatile as seen in the recent sequence (8, 19, 192, 1, 149, 159, 162, 59, 144). The mean demand for the last 15 periods (since P35) is approximately 98 units, but with a massive standard deviation. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' balance of 1132 units is heavily skewed by 639 units of historically confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P25, P30). Furthermore, orders from P44 (127 units), P46 (176 units), P47 (127 units), and P48 (50 units) have not yet arrived, though they are within or just past the volatile lead time window (1-3 periods). The OR backend calculates the order as: 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because the backend sees 1132 in the pipeline (which includes 639 phantom units), it will under-order significantly. To counteract this, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the need for the next (L+1) = 4 periods (L=3 planning) based on a mean of ~100. Total need is ~400 units. To force an order despite the 639-unit phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed the phantom inventory. I set mu_hat to 1200 to ensure the backend generates a replenishment order to cover actual demand, effectively treating the 639 units as already 'lost' to the logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 639 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P25, P30). Effective pipeline is 'In-transit - 639'. Planning lead time of L=3 remains necessary due to logistics instability.
