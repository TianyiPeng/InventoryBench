Demand Analysis: Historical demand (122, 121, 60, 83, 105) and recent sales (121, 87, 96, 86, 140) suggest an average demand of ~100-110 units per period. We are currently stocked out. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 142 units is based on L=2 and assumes the P2 order (144 units) is still coming. If I assume P2 is lost, I need to cover demand for Period 6, 7, and 8 (current period + lead time). Total demand for 3 periods (~315) - Pipeline (73) = 242 units.

The average demand over the last 6 periods (P25-P30) is approximately 98.3 units/period, which aligns closely with the long-term historical average (~100 units). Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is likely driven by the massive 'In-transit' figure (1139 units), but since 839 units are lost, the effective pipeline is only 300. To meet expected demand for the (L+1)=3 period window (P31, P32, P33), we need ~300 units (3 * 100).

Similarly, 839 units from earlier periods (P2-P25) are also stalled/lost. Total reliable pipeline currently consists of orders from P33 (105), P34 (100), and P35 (100), totaling 305 units.

The last three periods (P33-P35) have been low (17, 56, 16), averaging ~30 units. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 106 units. Given the low recent demand and the reliable pipeline of 305 units, existing stock + expected arrivals cover over 10 periods of the current demand regime (~30/period).

Currently, the reliability of arrival is highly volatile (lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods).

Historical demand has recently fluctuated between extreme lows (~1-20 units) and highs (180-200 units).

This confirms the logistics situation has stabilized compared to earlier systemic failures, though lead times remain inconsistent (1\u20133 periods). I will assume a lead time of 2 for safety planning.\n2. **Inventory & Pipeline Analysis**: Current on-hand is 127 units. In-transit is officially 1614 units, but based on the extensive history of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37), 1364 units are confirmed lost/stalled. This leaves a 'reliable' pipeline of 250 units (P44: 100, P45: 100, P46: 50). Total reliable inventory is 377 units.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Significant demand volatility continues. Recent periods show high demand (P45: 149, P46: 159), following a near-zero period (P44: 1). The 5-period moving average is approximately 104 units. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1), I need approximately 312 units.\n4. **Final Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it interprets the massive (but lost) 'In-transit' quantity as available stock. With 377 reliable units against a 3-period demand of ~312, I am technically covered. However, we are entering the final periods (47-50).

The recent 5-period average (P44-P48) is ~106 units, but individual periods vary from 1 up to 162. \n\nStrategy: The OR recommendation of 0 units likely stems from seeing the massive 'In-transit' figure of 1814.
