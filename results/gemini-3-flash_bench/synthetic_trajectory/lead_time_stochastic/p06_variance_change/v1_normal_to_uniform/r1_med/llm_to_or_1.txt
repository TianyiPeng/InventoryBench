Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is the first period (P1), strictly following the data resolution sequence: I see 5 historical periods (P1-P5) but am currently starting P1 in the environment state. Historical mean demand is 98.2 units/period with standard deviation 26.6. Promised lead time (L) is 2. The base-stock logic needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Current On-hand and In-transit are 0. I will use the 'default' methods to establish a baseline using all historical samples, which allows the OR backend to calculate the initial order needed to reach safety stock levels for the next three periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 142 units with a promised lead time of 2. Following the logic in Scenario A, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). Consequently, our current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 142 units in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 118, which resulted in 118 lost sales since we had 0 inventory. The historical demand data provided (Periods 1-5 mean: 98.2) differs slightly from the user's game history for Period 1 (118), but both suggest a baseline over 100. Given we have no concluded delivery data yet, I will use lead time (L) as default (2). For demand estimation (mu_hat), I will use the average of the 5 samples provided in the context (122, 121, 60, 83, 105), which is 98.2. Since L=2, mu_hat should reflect (1+L) periods, so 3 * 98.2 = 294.6. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation of those 5 samples is approximately 26.6; sqrt(1+L) * 26.6 is roughly 46. This initial setting aims to recover from the stockout as soon as units arrive.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. In Period 1, 142 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 2. In Period 2, another 142 units were ordered. Total in-transit is 284 units. Based on the 'Promised lead time: 2 periods' definition, the Period 1 order (ordered at the start of P1) is scheduled to arrive during Period 1+2=3 (Arrival Resolution Phase). Therefore, the 'Period 2 conclude' message correctly shows arrived=0. We expect the first shipment to arrive during the current period (Period 3) and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. Demand has been 118 and 155 (mean ~136.5), which is slightly higher than the historical samples provided (mean ~98). Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost all demand so far, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach to capture this slightly higher demand trend while waiting for the pipeline to arrive. I will set N=2 to reflect the two most recent observed periods (118 and 155) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the recent uptick in demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 0 units arrived, meaning the Period 1 order (142 units) is delayed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 448 units in transit (from Periods 1, 2, and 3). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) is 122, 121, 60, 83, 105, plus the in-game demand of 118, 155, 128. This suggests a mean demand around 110-120 units. Since the actual lead time is currently exceeding the promised 2 periods (P1 order is at least L=3), I will set L to 3 to adjust the inventory target and use recent_N for demand to capture the slightly higher in-game variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $279.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period (averaging 2). Since the promised lead time is 2, I will keep L at default (2). Historical demand for the last 5 periods (118, 155, 128, 117, and the current observation 105) shows a mean of approximately 124.6. There is no clear trend or seasonal data (dates are generic 'Period_X'), so I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current regime which seems stable around 120-130 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 189 and in-transit is 211, totaling 400, which covers over 3 periods of average demand, providing a safe buffer against the observed lead-time variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $301.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead time performance. Demand over the first 5 periods (118, 155, 128, 117, 98) averages approximately 123 units per period. I will use the mean of all 5 available samples to set mu_hat. Regarding lead time, the promised lead time is 2. However, the history shows one order arrived in 3 periods (Period 1 order) and another arrived in 1 period (Period 3 order), suggesting high variability but an average lead time that centers around 2. Therefore, I will stick to the 'default' lead time of 2. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' (all historical samples) to capture the standard behavior of this SKU, as there isn't yet enough evidence of a sustained demand regime shift. On-hand inventory is 91, and there are 213 units in-transit (orders from Period 2, 4, and 5). Total pipeline and on-hand (304) covers approximately 2.4 periods of average demand, which matches the (L+1) requirement for a lead time of 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 and 280 units are in-transit (orders from Period 2, 4, 5, 6). The lead time has been inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period, giving an average of 2 periods. Currently, the order from Period 2 (placed 5 periods ago) has not arrived and is likely lost. Demand has stabilized after an initial spike (Periods 1-3 mean: 133.6 vs Periods 4-6 mean: 104.3). I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand parameters to reflect this lower, more stable regime (approx 100 units/period) and stick to the default promised lead time of 2, allowing the OR calculation for base stock (L+1) to bridge the current stockout while accounting for the high probability that the Period 2 shipment is lost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: average demand decreased from ~134 to ~100 (-25%). Possible shipment loss: Period 2 order (142 units) has not arrived after 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $166.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the demand regime has indeed shifted. The initial demand (Periods 1-4) averaged 129.5 units, whereas the recent demand (Periods 5-7) has dropped to an average of 81.0 units (98, 98, 47). The Period 7 demand was particularly low (47). Regarding lead times, the promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals have been inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period, and Period 4 arrived in 3 periods. Most importantly, the Period 2 order (142 units) is now 6 periods overdue (placed Period 2, now Period 8) and is likely lost. The current in-transit (260) likely consists of Period 5 (2), Period 6 (67), Period 7 (49) plus the lost Period 2 (142). If we subtract the lost 142 units, the 'real' pipeline is 118. To compensate for the lead time variability and the lost shipment, I will use an explicit lead time of 3. For demand, I'll use recent_N (N=4) to capture the lower demand trend while smoothing the volatility of the Period 7 dip.

Carry-over insight: Shipment Loss Confirmed: Period 2 order (142 units) is 6 periods old and has not arrived; treating as lost in pipeline calculations. Demand regime lower: Average demand since Period 5 is ~81 units.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0. Analyzing the lead times: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, P4 arrived in 3 periods, P5 arrived in 3 periods, and P7 arrived in 1 period. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show a mix of 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.2. The order from P2 (142 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is definitely lost. The order from P6 (67 units) is 3 periods old and should arrive in the current period (P9) resolution if lead time is 3. Demand has stabilized at a lower level; the last 5 periods (P4-P8) show a mean of 88.6 (117, 98, 98, 47, 83). I will use L=3 to be conservative given the high frequency of 3-period arrivals, and use recent_N=5 for demand to reflect the current lower regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed highly variable lead time (oscillating between 1 and 3 periods). Average demand from P4-P8 is 88.6, confirming a significant drop from the initial P1-P2 average of 136.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe an 'In-transit' quantity of 270 units. This consists of the order from Period 2 (142 units - confirmed lost in previous carry-over insights), Period 6 (67 units - now 4 periods old, likely late or lost), and Period 9 (61 units - within promised lead time). Since the Period 2 order of 142 units is definitely lost, the effective pipeline is only 128 units. The lead time is highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (average is 2, but reliability is low). Demand has stabilized around a lower mean since Period 4. Using the last 6 periods (P4-P9) gives a mean demand of approximately 94. I will set the lead time to an explicit '3' to account for the frequent delays and the 'lost' inventory gap, and use a recent_N of 6 for demand to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Period 6 order (67 units) is now 4 periods old; if it does not arrive by Period 11, it should be considered likely lost, similar to the Period 2 order.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product is out of stock (On-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory shows 410 units, but this includes potentially lost or significantly delayed shipments. Specifically, the Period 2 order (142 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is confirmed lost. The Period 6 order (67 units) is 5 periods overdue and effectively lost. Accounting for these losses, the functional pipeline is Period 9 (61) and Period 10 (140), totaling 201 units. Lead times have been highly volatile (1 or 3 periods), so I will use an explicit L of 2 to reflect the promised lead time while acknowledging the average. Demand has shifted to a lower regime; the last 7 periods (P4-P10) average 94 units, compared to the initial 134. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current lower-demand, high-volatility environment (demand went from 47 to 123 recently).

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Period 6 order (67 units) is now 5 periods old with no arrival; adding to 'confirmed lost' list alongside Period 2 order (142 units). Functional pipeline is significantly lower than system 'In-transit' indicates.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant demand of approximately 100-120 units based on recent observations. The 'In-transit' figure of 410 is misleading due to confirmed/likely lost shipments: Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (67 units) are both over 5 periods old and clearly lost. Adjusting for these, the active pipeline consists of orders from P9 (61 units), P10 (140 units), and P11 (0 units), totaling 201 units. Lead times have been highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.25). To ensure we recover from the current stockout, I am setting the lead time L to 3 (explicit) to account for the risk of longer arrivals and increase the base stock. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime which averages around 103 units, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Two significant shipment losses confirmed: Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (67 units) have failed to arrive after 10 and 5 periods respectively; actual active pipeline is In-transit minus 209 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the 'In-transit' balance of 223 units includes two historically confirmed lost orders: Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (67 units), totaling 209 units. This means the actual functional pipeline is only 14 units (the order from P12). On-hand inventory is 117 units. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 4, with the last 9 periods (P4-P12) averaging approximately 96 units, though recent volatility is noted. Lead times are highly inconsistent, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.0). To account for the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline (lost orders), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Targeted base stock calculation: Expected demand for (L+1) periods is approximately 100 * (2+1) = 300 units. To compensate for the 209 'ghost' units that the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from the order quantity, I increase the base stock requirement by roughly that amount (300 + 209 = 509). I will set mu_hat to 510 to ensure the system places an order that covers the current demand despite the inflated pipeline inventory.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 15. The 'In-transit' figure is 401, but history confirms two lost shipments: Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (67 units), totaling 209 units that will never arrive. The functional pipeline is 192 units (P12: 14, P13: 178). Observed lead times are highly variable (1, 2, or 3 periods), with a mean of approximately 2.3 periods. I will use L=3 to be conservative given the inconsistent delivery and history of stockouts. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 4. The average demand from Period 4 to Period 13 is approximately 96.3 units. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this lower mean (avg ~96) and its associated volatility. By setting L to 'explicit' at 3, I ensure the OR backend accounts for the maximum observed lead time, while using recent_N for demand parameters ensures the base stock calculation reflects current consumption rather than the higher initial levels.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 15 with 0 on-hand inventory and an In-transit total of 408 units. Reviewing the history, two orders are confirmed lost: Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (67 units), totaling 209 phantom units. The actual active pipeline is 408 - 209 = 199 units (comprising orders from P12, P13, and P14). Demand has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 4. Calculating the mean demand from Period 4 to Period 14 (excluding initial launch spikes) gives an average of approximately 100 units per period (Sum=1100 over 11 periods). Lead times are erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; the average observed lead time is (3+1+3+3+1+1+3+2)/8 = 2.125 periods. To ensure we cover demand during the replenishment cycle (L+1 = 3 to 4 periods) while accounting for the high stockout risk (ending inventory is 0), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the last 11 periods to capture the current regime (~100/period) and 'calculate' for L to use the historical average. Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed actual active pipeline is In-transit minus 209 units (P2 and P6 orders lost). Demand regime since Period 4 stable at ~100 units/period. Lead time remains erratic, averaging ~2.1 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~106 units since Period 4. The current inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand and an 'In-transit' of 394 units. However, based on carry-over insights, the orders from Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (67 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 209 untrustworthy units. This leaves an active pipeline of 185 units (394 - 209). These active orders were placed in Period 13 (178 units) and Period 14 (7 units). Given the Promised Lead Time is 2 periods and observed lead times vary between 1-3 periods, the P13 order is currently at L=2 and should arrive in Period 16 or 17. Because the OR backend is unaware of these losses, L is set to 'explicit' at 2 to match the promised/average drift, and mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=12 (capturing the stable regime since P4) to ensure the system targets a base stock that accounts for current needs. I choose N=12 for sigma_hat as well to capture recent volatility.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17, the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 216 units. However, consistent with previous insights, orders from Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (67 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 209 units. This leaves an actual active pipeline of only 7 units (from Period 14). With 39 units on hand and 7 units in flight, the effective inventory is 46 units. The demand regime has stabilized around 100-110 units per period since Period 4 (mean of last 13 periods is 106). Lead times are erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a recent trend towards 3 periods. To prevent a stockout caused by the lost shipments, I will use an explicit lead time of 2 (conservative average) and set mu_hat explicitly to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus a buffer. A mu_hat of 380 (approx 125/period over 3 periods) ensures the base stock is high enough to trigger a large corrective order this period to replace the lost 209 units while accounting for the current demand level.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 371 units. Based on historical data, we have confirmed two lost shipments: Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (67 units), totaling 209 units. Subtracting these from the reported 371 leaves an actual active pipeline of 162 units (which is specifically the order placed in Period 17). Since the promised lead time is 2 periods and actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.1), the Period 17 order is not expected to arrive until Period 19 or 20. Therefore, Period 18 is likely to face a stockout. To recover, I need to set parameters that recognize the current lower demand regime (average ~104 since Period 12) while accounting for the high volatility and the fact that the OR backend overestimates the pipeline by 209 units. I will use 'explicit' for L to maintain a cautious buffer and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current regime of ~104 units/period.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19, the inventory status is critical (0 on-hand units) due to stockouts in Period 17 and 18. The current 'In-transit' balance is 384 units, consisting of orders from P17 (162 units), P18 (13 units), and the two confirmed lost shipments (P2: 142 units and P6: 67 units). Subtracting the 209 lost units leaves an active pipeline of 175 units, which is insufficient to cover the lead time + review period demand. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 107 units per period since P12 (latest regime), but variance remains high. Lead times are erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.3 periods based on recent history. To compensate the OR engine for the 209 missing units in the pipeline it sees, I will use 'explicit' methods for mu_hat. Specifically, for mu_hat, I will target a total base stock that accounts for (L+1) demand coverage (approx 3.3 * 107 = 353) plus the 209 inventory deficit, totaling 562 units. L is set to explicit 2.3 to reflect the realized average lead time delay.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are at zero on-hand inventory with a reported 'In-transit' of 593 units. However, based on our carry-over insights, orders from Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (67 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 209 phantom units. The true active pipeline is actually 384 units (593 - 209). Recent demand (P17-P19) has averaged approximately 83.7 units, showing a slight decrease compared to the mid-game average of ~100. Lead times remain erratic, with the most recent arrivals (P16, P17) taking 3 periods instead of the promised 2. To account for this, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers a longer safety window. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level of ~102/period across a (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to account for the current volatility. By setting L=3, the OR backend's order calculation will implicitly compensate for the missing 209 units because the calculated base_stock for (3+1) periods will significantly exceed the true pipeline of 384 units, prompting a restorative order.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Verified true active pipeline is In-transit minus 209 units (P2 and P6 remain lost). Recent 3-period lead times are consistent (observed in P15, P16, P17 arrivals).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 21: On-hand is 0, and In-transit is 593. However, history as recorded in carry-over insights confirms that 209 units (ordered in P2 and P6) are lost. Therefore, the active pipeline is only 384 units. Since Period 17, three large orders were placed (162, 13, 209). Given the erratic lead time (ranging between 1-3 periods, average ~2.2), we expect the P17 order (162 units) to arrive in Period 20 or 21. Since it did not arrive in Period 20, it is highly likely to arrive in Period 21. Demand has been declining recently (107, 78, 66, 49), but the longer-term regime since Period 4 averages ~100. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this stabilized regime. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average, which accounts for the variability. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have entered a stockout period starting from Period 17 (excluding small partial fulfillment). In-transit inventory shows 593 units, but 209 of these (P2=142, P6=67) are confirmed lost, leaving a true active pipeline of 384 units. These units come from orders in P17 (162), P18 (13), and P19 (209). Given the erratic lead time (observed range 1-3 periods, average currently ~2.2 based on history), the P17 order (162 units) is now at its L+2 mark and should arrive during Period 22. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 100 since Period 4. I am using 'recent_N' with N=18 for demand to capture this stable regime since the shift. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the erratic but observable delivery times (range 1-3). The OR engine needs to account for the gap between the system's pipeline view (593) and reality (384) to avoid under-ordering, but since the replenishment policy uses (base_stock - pipeline), and my active pipeline (384) is less than the system's in-transit (593), I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat with a high enough value to force the necessary replenishment despite the 'phantom' inventory in the system's view. Target: (L+1) * 100 = 300.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 23. Stock status: On-hand is 0, and the system reports an In-transit pipeline of 593 units. However, based on our carry-over insights, orders from Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (67 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 209 ghost units. The true active pipeline is actually 384 units (593 - 209). This active pipeline consists of orders from P17 (162), P18 (13), and P19 (209). Given the inconsistent lead times (averaging ~2.1 periods, but often 3), the P17 order (placed 6 periods ago) should have arrived by now; its absence suggests it might also be lost, but I will wait one more period before confirming. Recent demand (P18-P22) has been 78, 66, 49, 75, 121 (average ~78 units). Total demand history suggests a stable mean around 100, but recent volatility is high. I will set L to 'calculate' to capture the 2-3 period variance, and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average 78) to account for the most recent demand fluctuations while allowing the OR backend to handle the safety stock for higher volatility. The backend's base-stock target will consider the (inflated) in-transit of 593, which will likely result in a 0-order anyway since 593 > base_stock, but setting mu_hat and L correctly ensures we don't over-order when actual arrivals occur.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Potential shipment loss emerging at P17 (162 units), which is now 6 periods old and hasn't arrived. If it doesn't arrive by P24, the active pipeline correction will increase from 209 to 371 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 current state is critical: On-hand inventory is 0 and we are currently experiencing a stockout. The demand has spiked significantly in Period 23 (182 units) compared to the previous 5-period average (98 units). I must also reconcile the 'In-transit' figure: The backend sees 593 units in transit, but I have confirmed three lost shipments: Period 2 (142 units), Period 6 (67 units), and now Period 17 (162 units). Period 17's order is 7 periods old and is confirmed lost. Total lost volume = 142 + 67 + 162 = 371 units. True active pipeline = 593 - 371 = 222 units (Orders from P18: 13, P19: 209). To force the OR backend to order despite the high ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the current demand spike (~140 avg) times the risk-adjusted lead time (L=3), then inflated to overcome the 371-unit ghost inventory bias. By setting mu_hat = 850, I target a base stock high enough that (850 - 593) still results in a substantial reorder to cover the stockout and the actual lead time demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Shipment loss at P17 (162 units) confirmed (7 periods old). Total ghost inventory in system is 371 units (P2, P6, P17). Current demand is exhibiting a sharp upward trend, increasing from ~70 to 182 over the last 5 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand is currently in a high-growth phase, with recent values of 121, 182, and 122 (mean of 142 over the last 3 periods) compared to the previous stable regime of ~100. We must ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time + 1 period (3 periods total). However, a critical correction is needed for the 'In-transit' figure. The system reports 894 units in transit, but 371 of those are confirmed losses from Periods 2 (142), 6 (67), and 17 (162), as they are far past the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. The 'active' pipeline is therefore 523 units (894 - 371). To force the backend to account for these lost units, I will artificially increase the L parameter. Since the backend uses the formula: (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), reducing the 'ghost' inventory requires increasing the target base_stock. I will set L to 4 to account for the actual delivery delay and offset some of the ghost inventory. I'll use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current demand spike (avg ~142).

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory confirmed: 371 units (P2 order 142, P6 order 67, P17 order 162). Active pipeline is In-transit minus 371. Demand regime shifted upward at P22, currently averaging ~142 units/period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 analysis: Demand is in a high-growth regime (P22-P25: 121, 182, 122, 179), averaging ~151 units/period. On-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit is 894, but this includes 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P2: 142, P6: 67, P17: 162). Total ghost inventory is 371 units. True active pipeline = 894 - 371 = 523 units. These active orders (P18, P19, P24) are delayed; P18 and P19 are now 8 and 7 periods old respectively, and P24 is 2 periods old. Following the pattern of lost shipments (P17 lost at age 7), P18 and P19 are highly likely lost as well. If P18 (13 units) and P19 (209 units) are also lost, the true active pipeline is only 301 units (P24's order). Given the stockout and the high demand (avg 151), the OR backend needs to order significantly. To force an order despite the 'ghost' pipeline units, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the erratic lead times and use 'recent_5' for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand spike. I will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for high volatility (std dev remains high during spikes).

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Probable shipment loss at P18 (13 units) and P19 (209 units), which are 8 and 7 periods old respectively. Total ghost inventory potentially increases from 371 to 593 units. Demand regime confirmed high at ~151 units/period (P22-P25).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system shows an In-transit of 894 units and On-hand of 0. However, extensive historical analysis confirms massive 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments: P2 (142), P6 (67), P17 (162), P18 (13), and P19 (209) are all far beyond their promised lead time (P18 is 8 periods old, P19 is 7). Total confirmed ghost inventory is 593 units. Thus, the actual active pipeline is only 301 units (the order from P24). Demand has shifted significantly higher starting at P22, with the last five periods (P22-P26) averaging approximately 152 units. To force the OR backend to ignore the 593 ghost units and place a necessary order to meet this higher demand regime, I must significantly inflate the mu_hat. I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 1200, which targets a base stock of roughly 1200 units. Accounting for the 301 'real' in-transit units and 0 on-hand, this will trigger an order of approximately 300-400 units, which is necessary to cover current demand of ~150/period given the delivery risks and stockout status.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Ghost inventory cumulative total updated to 593 units (confirmed losses: P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Active pipeline is In-transit minus 593. Recent demand regime (P22-P26) stabilized at ~152 units/period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure (1243 units) is heavily inflated by confirmed and probable shipment losses. Following the findings in Period 27, ghost inventory total is 593 units (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Therefore, the active pipeline is actually 1243 - 593 = 650 units. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced zero arrivals since Period 17, leading to a long stockout since P17. Demand has significantly increased in a new regime starting around Period 22; the average demand from P22-P27 is approx 155 units/period. To rectify the stockout and account for the high demand regime (L+1 = 3 periods of risk), I must use the 'explicit' method for L to ensure the OR engine doesn't underestimate the lead time (averaging ~2.2 but highly erratic) and 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bypass the ghost inventory's impact on the order calculation. I set mu_hat to (1+2.2)*155 \u2248 496 and use a high sigma_hat to ensure a robust safety stock, while the internal logic will subtract the (miscalculated) pipeline. Because the backend subtracts the full 1243 in-transit, I must set mu_hat explicitly high to force an order that covers the gap created by the 593 lost units plus the forecast for the next 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime (P22-P27) stabilized at ~155 units/period (+55% from previous stable regime). Ghost inventory confirmed at 593 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1243 units. However, based on the history, we have confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) totaling 593 units (P2: 142, P6: 67, P17: 162, P18: 13, P19: 209). Additionally, orders from P24 (301 units) and P27 (349 units) are still within or just past the expected lead time window and haven't arrived yet. The active pipeline is adjusted to 1243 - 593 = 650 units. Demand showed a strong upward regime from P22-P27 (average ~155), though P28 saw a sharp drop to 26; I will treat P28 as a potential outlier or the start of a cooling period and use recent_N=7 to capture the high-demand regime while including the P28 cooling signal. I will use explicit L=3 to account for the frequent delays observed in history (max observed lead time is 3) to prevent stockouts during delivery variability.

Carry-over insight: Active pipeline correction: In-transit contains 593 units of lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Demand volatility increased with P28 drop to 26 after a high regime of ~155.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 30. Demand has recently been highly volatile, with a surge to ~155 (P22-P27) followed by a sharp drop (P28-P29: 26, 46). Inventory: On-hand is 303. Pipeline: In-transit is 894, but 593 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost shipments. Active pipeline is 894 - 593 = 301 units (this matches the P24 order). Lead time: Most recent successful delivery (P27 order) arrived in 2 periods. Parameter Strategy: Given the drastic drop in demand over the last two periods, using a longer-term average (recent_N=8) for mu_hat will smooth the spike and the drop to avoid over-correcting, while explicit lead time L=2 reflects the most recent reliable delivery behavior. The OR backend needs to know the inventory can handle upcoming demand despite the large 'ghost' in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime drop at P28-P29 after high volatility; avg demand for P22-P29 is ~125. Ghost inventory remains at 593 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19).

Daily Reward (R_t): $632.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 31. Inventory on-hand is 116 units. The In-transit figure is 894 units, but historically confirmed losses include P2 (142), P6 (67), P17 (162), P18 (13), and P19 (209), totaling 593 units of 'ghost inventory'. Thus, the active pipeline is 894 - 593 = 301 units, which corresponds to the order placed in Period 24. This order is now at L=7 and hasn't arrived, suggesting severe lead time extension or potential loss. Demand has been highly volatile: a high regime (P22-P27 avg ~155) followed by a sharp drop (P28-P29 avg ~36) and a sudden spike (P30 = 187). Given this instability, I will use an EWMA with gamma=0.3 for mu_hat to smooth the noise while staying responsive to the recent spike. Due to the extreme lead time uncertainty and missing shipments, I will set L to 3 (slightly above promised) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the likely arrival delay of the P24 order and future orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed total ghost inventory is 593 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Active pipeline is In-transit minus 593. P24 order (301 units) is now 7 periods old and likely delayed or at risk of loss. New demand regime is unstable: recent 4-period average (P27-P30) is ~108, but individual swings are 174 -> 26 -> 46 -> 187.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) despite recent arrivals. The system reports 894 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms significant 'ghost inventory'. Shipments from P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 are lost, totaling 593 units. Additionally, the P24 order (301 units) is now 8 periods old (ordered in P24, still hasn't arrived by P31 conclude). Given the maximum observed lead time is 3 periods, P24 is now 5 periods overdue and must be considered lost. Total ghost inventory is updated to 593 + 301 = 894 units. This means the REAL active pipeline is 0 (894 in-transit - 894 ghost). Demand is highly volatile; while the recent 5-period average (P27-P31) is 113.4, the swings are extreme (26 to 187). To recover from the current stockout and protect against this volatility and poor reliability, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 (the historical maximum) and set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (including the high-demand periods) to ensure a robust base stock that ignores the non-existent pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total ghost inventory updated to 894 units. The Period 24 order (301 units) is now 8 periods old and confirmed lost alongside P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19. Active pipeline is effectively zero.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 894 units. However, based on the historical logs and carry-over insights, this 894 units is entirely composed of lost shipments (Period 2: 142, Period 6: 67, Period 17: 162, Period 18: 13, Period 19: 209, and Period 24: 301). Since these orders are all 8+ periods old and the promised lead time is 2, they are effectively 'ghost inventory'. Consequently, the active pipeline is zero, and we are currently out of stock (on-hand is 0) despite these figures. Demand is highly volatile; after a recent spike, it dropped significantly to 134 and then 15 in the last two periods. Because the OR backend subtracts the pipeline (894 units) from its calculated target to determine the order, and the cap logic prevents excessive ordering, a massive pipeline error will lead to zero ordering even when stock is needed. To force the OR engine to order despite this 894-unit ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the current 'ghost' volume plus a buffer for the lead/review period. Current demand trend is downward/highly variable (avg 108 recently), so I'll target 3 periods of demand (~300 units) + the 894 units already in the books. Total target = 1194.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 1317 units. However, based on the history and persistent non-arrivals, a significant portion of this is 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments). Confirmed losses include P2 (142), P6 (67), P17 (162), P18 (13), P19 (209), and P24 (301), totaling 894 lost units. This matches the Period 32 insight. Therefore, the active pipeline consists of the P27 order (which arrived in P29) and the P33 order (423 units). Currently, on-hand is 0. Since the P33 order (423 units) was placed just last period and lead time averages ~2 periods, we expect it in P35 or P36. Demand has been highly volatile: the last 10 periods (P24-P33) show an average of roughly 100 units/period (122, 179, 154, 174, 26, 46, 187, 134, 15, 86). I will use a 10-period window to capture this high variance. Setting L=2 to reflect the promised and most recently observed lead time (P27 arrived in 2 periods). Increasing sigma_hat explicitly to account for the extreme demand swings (range 15 to 187) and ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient buffer to handle the volatility and stock-outs.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system monitors 'chips(Regular)' with significant pipeline reliability issues. As of Period 35, the 'In-transit' count of 1,317 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments. Cumulative confirmed ghost inventory totals 894 units (Orders: P2=142, P6=67, P17=162, P18=13, P19=209, P24=301). The active pipeline is therefore 1,317 - 894 = 423 units (which is specifically the order from Period 33). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The demand regime has been highly volatile but shows a recent 5-period average (P30-P34) of approximately 89 units. Given the erratic lead times (observed between 1 and 3 periods) and the high risk of total shipment loss, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of observed actual lead times) to increase the safety stock buffer. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat (covering P27-P34) to account for the recent volatility which averages 115.1 units per period, and a recent_N of 8 for sigma_hat to capture the high variance observed lately. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that compensates for the massive 'ghost' inventory while protecting against recent demand swings.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Ghost inventory confirmed at 894 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24). Active pipeline is In-transit minus 894. Recent 5-period demand avg ~89, but 10-period avg is ~113 due to high volatility.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 1317 units. However, based on detailed historical tracking, a significant portion of this represents 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24). The total ghost inventory is 894 units (142+67+162+13+209+301). Therefore, the actual active pipeline is only 423 units (1317 - 894), which corresponds exactly to the order placed in Period 33. With on-hand inventory at 0 and the P33 order yet to arrive (expected lead time ~2-3 periods), we are facing a stockout. Demand remains highly volatile; the last 5 periods (P31-P35) averaged ~98 units, while the broader recent average (P27-P35) is ~103. Given the Lead Time is promised at 2 but observed at 3 frequently, I will use L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers enough periods (L+1=4). mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 9 to capture the current volatile regime (avg ~103). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to reflect the high local variance (swings from 15 to 187).

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total ghost inventory remains 894 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24). Active pipeline is In-transit minus 894. P33 order (423 units) is the only active shipment. Continuous stockouts observed due to shipment losses.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, the system shows an In-transit inventory of 1,317 units and On-hand inventory of 0. Based on history, we have confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) totaling 894 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24). Subtracting this from 1,317 leaves 423 units, which corresponds exactly to the order placed in Period 33. This order is now 4 periods old (promised lead time 2, actual mean ~2.1) and has not yet arrived. Given the erratic nature of lead times, it is likely to arrive in Period 37 or 38. Demand remains highly volatile; the mean of the last 10 periods (P27-P36) is approximately 105 units. I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand and calculate for lead time to allow the OR backend to adjust to the current regime while acknowledging the delivery instability. We must continue to account for the massive 894-unit ghost inventory, as the OR backend will otherwise incorrectly think the pipeline is full.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed active pipeline is In-transit minus 894 units. The only truly active shipment is P33 (423 units), currently 4 periods old. Demand mean for last 10 periods (P27-P36) is 105.1 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system shows an In-transit balance of 1317 units, but most of these are 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments. Confirmed lost orders are: P2(142), P6(67), P17(162), P18(13), P19(209), and P24(301), totaling 894 units. Subtracting these from 1317 leaves 423 units (the P33 order) as the only truly active pipeline. The P33 order is now 5 periods old and has not arrived. Since promised lead time is 2 and average observed lead time is ~2-3, this order is significantly delayed. Demand over the last 10 periods (P28-P37) averages 93.3 units, though it remains highly volatile (ranging from 15 to 187). To ensure the OR backend ignores the 894 units of lost inventory and accounts for the delay, I am setting L=5 (matching the age of the oldest active shipment) and mu_hat based on the recent 10-period average. This will trigger a substantial order to replenish stock after continuous stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: P33 order (423 units) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived; if it does not arrive by P39, total ghost inventory will increase from 894 to 1317 units. Demand remains volatile with 10-period mean approximately 93 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by severe shipment losses and high demand volatility. Currently, the system shows 1,317 units in-transit, but based on historical context, the majority are 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments). Confirmed losses include P2 (142), P6 (67), P17 (162), P18 (13), P19 (209), and P24 (301), totaling 894 units. The remaining 423 units represent the order from P33, which is now 6 periods old. Given the promised lead time is 2 and the maximum observed lead time for successful arrivals has been 3, the P33 order is now highly likely to be lost as well. If we treat P33 as lost, the active pipeline is effectively 0. Demand has also been highly erratic; the 10-period average (P29-P38) is approximately 91.7, but individual periods vary from 0 to 187. To address the repeated stockouts caused by these losses and the fact that the OR backend's 'In-transit' view is inflated by 1,317 ghost units, I will set L to 13 to force the base stock calculation high enough to overcome the pipeline deduction and trigger a new order. I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the recent 10-period average (~92) and a high explicit sigma_hat (60) to account for the extreme volatility and prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Shipment loss at P33 (423 units) confirmed (6 periods old). Total ghost inventory in system is 1317 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P33). Effective active pipeline is zero.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a total failure in the logistics pipeline. As of Period 40, ghost inventory (orders placed but lost) has reached 1,317 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P33). The current 'In-transit' of 1,478 units consists of these 1,317 lost units plus the 161 units ordered in Period 39. This means the actual active pipeline is only 161 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains highly volatile, with the last 10 periods (P30-P39) averaging approximately 86.5 units, though several periods saw 0 or near-zero demand followed by spikes. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the massive 'ghost' pipeline, I will set L to a high 'explicit' value (4) to reflect the extreme delays/losses and set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for (1+L) periods of demand. Using a forecast of 100 units/period (slightly above the recent average to buffer against volatility), mu_hat = (1+4) * 100 = 500. This should trigger an order that fills the gap between the effective pipeline (161) and a safe base stock level, regardless of the 1,317 units of ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total ghost inventory confirmed at 1,317 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P33). Active pipeline is In-transit minus 1,317. Only active shipment is from P39 (161 units). Demand mean (P30-P39) is 86.5.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from severe shipment losses. Currently, the recorded in-transit inventory is 1317 units, but the game history and Carry-over Insights confirm that orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P33 (totaling 1317 units) have failed to arrive and should be treated as lost. Consequently, the actual active pipeline is effectively zero units. The arrival in Period 40 (161 units from P39) confirms that some orders do arrive with a lead time of 1, but the long-term trend is high unreliability. To trigger an order from the OR backend which sees 1317 units 'in-transit', I must use the 'explicit' method. For L, I will use a value of 2 (the promised lead time), as recent arrivals (P27 in P29, P39 in P40) show lead times of 2 and 1 respectively. For mu_hat, I will use the recent 10-period average (P31-P40) which is approximately 85.5, multiplied by (1+L) = 3 to get 256. However, to bypass the 1317 ghost units in the pipeline_inventory (base_stock - pipeline), I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the subtraction while considering the 'cap' mechanism. Given the cap is roughly mu_hat/(1+L) + 1.645*sigma_hat/sqrt(1+L), I set an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat that reflect the actual demand regime while acknowledging we are starting from zero real inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Confirmed total ghost inventory of 1317 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P33). Effective active pipeline is 0. Demand remains highly volatile, recent 10-period mean (P31-P40) is 85.5.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face extreme reliability issues with a high volume of 'ghost inventory' (shipments that have likely been lost). According to the Carry-over insight, a total of 1,317 units (from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P33) are confirmed or highly probable losses. Subtracting these from the current In-transit total of 1,585 leaves an 'active' pipeline of 268 units (which is specifically the order placed in Period 41). The Period 39 order of 161 units actually arrived in Period 40 with a lead time of 1, providing a brief respite from stockouts, but On-hand is currently 0. Demand remains highly volatile; the recent 10-period average is approximately 85.5 units, but individual periods swing from 0 to 177. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to satisfy future demand despite zero effective on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 10 to capture the current volatile mean (~85.5 * (1+L)). Sigma_hat is set to explicit (140) to account for the high variance and frequent stockouts observed, ensuring a higher service level. L is set to explicit 2 to match the promised lead time, as recent arrivals (P27 at L=2, P39 at L=1) suggest that when orders do arrive, they are close to the promised window.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face severe reliability issues with a high rate of shipment loss. Currently, 1317 units are confirmed as 'ghost inventory' (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P33). Although In-transit shows 1585 units, only the orders from P41 (268 units) and the unscheduled arrival from P42 are potentially active. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains volatile but has stabilized somewhat around a 10-period average of ~85-95 units. To compensate for the high risk of shipment loss and ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using the 'explicit' method. I set L to 3 to account for the upper end of observed lead times (historically 1-3 periods). mu_hat is set to 1000 to both cover demand for (1+L) periods and effectively reset the base stock level above the ghost inventory threshold. sigma_hat is set to 150 to handle the significant demand swings (ranges from 0 to 187). This aggressive targeting is necessary to force the system to bypass the 'In-transit' units that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost inventory remains at 1317 units. Effective active pipeline is In-transit (1585) minus 1317 = 268 units (P41 order). Demand mean (P31-P42) is 86.8. Systemic shipment loss frequency is approximately 60-70%.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faced significant shipment losses totaling 1317 units (Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19, 24, 33). These orders have not arrived and are well past the typical 1-3 period lead time. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 1585 units, but subtracting the 1317 units of ghost inventory reveals a true active pipeline of only 268 units (the Period 41 order). With Period 43 concluding and the P41 order now 2 periods old, it is expected to arrive in Period 44 or 45 based on historical variability (L=1 to 3). Demand remains highly volatile; the mean for the last 10 periods (P34-P43) is 105.1 units, while the mean for the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is 114.4 units. I will set mu_hat using a recent 10-period window to capture this volatility while maintaining a buffed inventory target to counteract the high 60-70% shipment loss rate. L is set to 'calculate' to use historical arrival data for the OR backend's service level calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Confirmed total ghost inventory is 1317 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P33). Effective active pipeline is 268 units (P41 order). Demand volatility remains high, with the recent 10-period mean (P34-P43) at 105.1 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, the order from Period 41 (268 units) arrived after a lead time of 3 periods, leaving 153 units on-hand. The total In-transit is 1317 units, but based on extensive historical tracking, all 1317 units are 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P33). Consequently, the effective active pipeline is zero. To ensure the OR backend places a necessary order, I must set the lead time parameter L to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the frequent 3-period lead times observed and manually inflate mu_hat to compensate for the 1317 units of ghost inventory that the backend incorrectly believes are coming. Demand remains volatile; the mean for the last 10 periods (P35-P44) is approximately 94.3 units. Using L=3, the backend expects to cover (1+3)=4 periods of demand (~377 units). However, because it sees 1317 units in transit, it will order 0 unless I use an explicit mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to (Expected Demand over L+1) + Ghost Inventory = (94.3 * 4) + 1317 \u2248 1694 units. This forces the backend to recognize that 153 on-hand + 1317 'transit' is insufficient for the upcoming periods if those transit units never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Total ghost inventory is 1317 units (lost orders: P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P33). Effective active pipeline is 0. Lead times are predominantly 3 periods when arrivals occur.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we have 145 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' figure of 1640. Based on extensive historical tracking, 1317 units are confirmed as 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P33). This leaves an effective active pipeline of 323 units (the P45 order). The recently arrived P41 order confirmed a lead time of 3 periods, aligning with recent successful arrivals. Demand is highly volatile; the 10-period mean (P36-P45) is approximately 93 units. Given the high risk of shipment loss (roughly 60-70%), the OR backend needs to maintain a higher base stock to compensate for the high stockout frequency without being misled by 'ghost' pipeline units. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the most common actual arrival time and using a 10-period average for demand to smooth out the extreme volatility (0 to 177 in the last 10 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure of 1640 is significantly inflated due to 1317 units of confirmed ghost inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P33). The actual active pipeline consists of only the P45 order (323 units). Demand remains highly volatile and unstable. Recent demand for the last 5 periods (P42-P46) averages 76.2, while the last 10 periods (P37-P46) averages 86.9. Given the high stockout history caused by order losses (approximately 70% loss rate), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this volatility while maintaining a sufficient buffer. L is set to 3 periods because, while the promised lead time is 2, actual successful arrivals (like P41 arriving in P44 and P39 arriving in P40) suggest a 3-period lead time is safer to account for 'review + lead' risk. On-hand is currently 107, and pipeline is 323, totaling 430 units against a 4-period demand window of approximately 348 units. No new order is likely triggered, but parameters ensure the base stock is correctly calibrated against the valid pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Active pipeline validated at 323 units (P45 order); system 'In-transit' of 1640 includes 1317 units of ghost inventory. No new losses detected in the last 2 periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU has an on-hand inventory of 4 units and a system 'In-transit' of 1640 units. Based on historical analysis, 1317 units are identified as 'ghost inventory' from confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P33). The active pipeline consists solely of the order placed in Period 45 (323 units), which is now 3 periods old. Given that the recent observed lead times are 1, 3, and 3 periods, this shipment is likely to arrive imminently. Demand remains highly volatile, with the last 10 periods (P38-P47) averaging 84.3 units, although individual spikes up to 177 are observed. To bridge the gap between the OR engine's perception of the pipeline (1640) and the reality (323), I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 (promised) while utilizing 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current volatile but slightly lower mean demand (approx 84/period). This setting will trigger the OR backend to place an order sufficient to cover the 3-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the significant 'ghost' inventory discrepancy.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period. The current 'In-transit' of 1640 includes 1317 units of confirmed ghost inventory (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P33). Subtracting this makes the effective active pipeline 323 units, which is the order from Period 45. This shipment is now 4 periods old (promised lead time 2). Given the 60-70% shipment loss frequency noted in history, there is a moderate risk this order is also delayed or lost. Demand remains volatile; the recent 10-period average (P39-P48) is approximately 102 units. For Period 49, the goal is to set parameters to cover the remaining demand in Period 50. With 0 on-hand and an uncertain pipeline, I will set L to 1 (representing the final period remaining) and mu_hat to cover a conservative estimate of the remaining demand. However, since the final order is min(base_stock - pipeline, cap), and 'In-transit' is 1640, the OR backend will calculate 1640 as pipeline unless mu_hat is set extremely high. To attempt to trigger a final top-up given the ghost inventory problem, I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the expected demand + the ghost inventory offset to ensure the backend sees a need for stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Confirmed total ghost inventory of 1317 units. Order from P45 (323 units) is 4 periods old and has not arrived; if it does not arrive next period, it will likely be the final loss recorded.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. The primary challenge remains 'ghost inventory': orders recorded as 'In-transit' that have been lost in the system. As of Period 49, shipments from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P33 are confirmed losses, totaling 1317 units. The order from P45 (323 units) is now 5 periods old; since actual lead times have capped at 3 periods for successful arrivals, this P45 shipment is now highly likely to be lost as well. Adding P45 to the ghost inventory results in 1317 + 323 = 1640 units of ghost inventory. With the current 'In-transit' visible at 1640 units, the effective active pipeline is currently 0. Demand remains volatile; the recent 10-period average (P40-P49) is approximately 84.9 units, though individual swings are large. To prevent stockouts at the start of a potential new cycle, I will set mu_hat to cover a safer demand level consistent with recent observed averages (~85) over (L+1) periods, while using explicit mode to bypass the OR engine's reliance on the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Ghost inventory updated to 1640 units; the P45 order (323 units) is 5 periods old and confirmed lost, matching the total In-transit. Effective active pipeline is 0. Recent 10-period demand average is ~85 units.
