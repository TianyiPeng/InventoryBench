Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (58, 163, 41, 0, 12) shows a high mean of 54.8 but extreme volatility (std ~ 64). As there is no prior inventory or in-transit shipments, and the promised lead time is 2 periods, the backend needs parameters to establish an initial base stock. Since demand varies wildly, I will use all available historical data ('default' method) to set the initial forecast while accounting for the high volatility. The base stock will aim to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 162 units, which are currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 2, we do not expect these units to arrive until Period 3 or 4 (observed in the Period 4 or 5 start messages respectively). The demand in Period 1 was 145 units, but since our starting on-hand was 0, those were lost sales. Currently, our on-hand inventory is 0. Recent historical demand (last 5 samples) shows: 58, 163, 41, 0, 12. Period 1's actual demand was 145, which aligns more with the higher historical samples (58, 163) than the zeros/lows. With only one period of live data, I will use recent_N for demand to capture the current volume while staying conservative due to the high variance. Specifically, I'll use N=5 for demand (including the new Period 1 observation of 145) to smooth out the noise while acknowledging current demand exists. Lead time logic remains default as no arrivals have concluded yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 162 units; in Period 2, we ordered 55 units. Total in-transit is 217. According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (read at Period 4). Historical demand data provided (58, 163, 41, 0, 12) seems to conflict with the 'Game History' (145, 134). I will prioritize the Game History demand for current forecasting. Mean demand over the last 2 periods is 139.5. Since on-hand is 0 and we have lost sales, I need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Using recent_N=2 for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the high initial volume while waiting for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2. Orders placed in Period 1 (162 units), Period 2 (55 units), and Period 3 (153 units) are currently 'In-transit' (total 370). Per the 'CRITICAL TIMING EXAMPLE', the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and become visible in the Period 4 'conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 0 arrivals. This suggests either a lead time longer than 2 or a delay. Demand has been significantly higher than the provided historical samples (avg ~122 vs samples <60), leading to stockouts because starting inventory was 0 and nothing has arrived yet. I will set L to 'explicit' 3 to account for the lack of Period 1 arrival in the Period 3 conclude. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=3 to capture the higher-than-expected demand observed in Periods 1-3 (145, 134, 87; avg 122).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time appears to be at least 3 periods, as the Period 1 order did not arrive in the Period 3 conclusion (expected L=2). Demand in periods 1-3 (avg 122) is significantly higher than historical samples (avg ~55).

Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the resolution of previous orders. Period 1's order arrived with a lead time of 3, while Period 3's order arrived with a lead time of 1, suggesting significant lead time volatility around a mean of ~2. Current on-hand is 92. Demand has shifted substantially: the initial historical samples (avg ~55) were much lower than the actual observed demand (P1: 145, P2: 134, P3: 87, P4: 223), which averages 147.25 over the first four periods. Period 4's demand of 223 is significantly higher than previous periods. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this higher demand regime and high volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the average of the observed lead times (3 and 1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed higher than pre-game samples: Avg demand periods 1-4 is 147 vs 55. Lead time variability observed (range 1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory with 414 units in-transit. Demand since Period 1 has averaged ~145 units per period (145, 134, 87, 223, 138), which is significantly higher than the pre-game samples (Avg ~55). Lead times have been highly volatile: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period. This suggests an average actual lead time closer to 2, but with high variance. The Period 2 order (55 units), Period 4 order (118 units), and Period 5 order (241 units) are still in-transit. Given the high demand and the stockout in Period 5 (sold only 92 out of 138 demand), I am setting L to 2 (the promised and approximate average) and using N=5 for demand (covering the game periods) to capture the higher mean (~145). Setting L to 2 implies the OR engine will target (1+L)=3 periods of demand coverage. mu_hat is explicitly set to (3 * 145) = 435 to ensure the pipeline is replenished against the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~145 units/period (Periods 1-5). Lead time is highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 and 435 units are in-transit (ordered in periods 2, 4, 5, and 6). Demand has been consistently higher than the pre-game samples, averaging 146.3 units over the first 6 periods (145, 134, 87, 223, 138, 151). Lead times have shown significant volatility: the Period 1 order took 3 periods, while the Period 3 order took only 1 period. The Period 2 order (55 units) is now at L=4 and potentially lost or severely delayed. To ensure we cover demand during the leads and review periods, I am setting L=3 (explicitly reflecting the longest observed successful lead time) and using recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime of ~146 units/period. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to account for the high variance (std ~44) observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Demand regime confirmed at ~146 units/period (Periods 1-6). Lead time is unstable, varying between 1 and 3 periods, with one order (Period 2) currently exceeding 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-78.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the demand regime has shifted compared to pre-game samples. The average demand across Periods 1-7 is approximately 128 units/period. The lead time is extremely volatile: we've seen lead times of 1 period (P3) and 3 periods (P1, P4). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (55 units), Period 5 (241 units), and Period 6 (21 units) are still in transit. The Period 2 order is now 6 periods late, indicating it is likely lost. Excluding the likely lost P2 order, the in-transit amount is 413. On-hand is 98. Total pipeline excluding lost items is ~511. Given the high volatility in lead time (ranging 1-3), I will set L to 3 to be conservative. mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=7) to capture the higher in-game demand mean (~128) compared to historical data, adjusted for (1+L).

Carry-over insight: Period 2 order (55 units) is likely lost (overdue by 4+ periods compared to longest observed lead time of 3). Demand variance is high, ranging from 20 to 223 in-game.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 374 units on-hand and 76 units in-transit (ordered in Period 6). The order from Period 2 (55 units) is now 7 periods overdue and remains likely lost. Demand has stabilized at a higher level than pre-game samples; the mean demand for the 8 periods played is 126.75, but with significant variability (standard deviation ~59.5). Lead times have been highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (observed lead times: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1). Using 'calculate' for L will average these observations (avg ~2.2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher-demand regime observed since the game started, ensuring we don't revert to the much lower pre-game historical averages. Current on-hand is high due to the simultaneous arrival of two large orders in Period 8, but we must maintain stock to cover the (L+1) period window given the lead time volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-352.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 363 units, which is quite high relative to recent demand. The last two periods (P8 and P9) showed a significant drop in demand (116 and 11 respectively), diverging from the earlier in-game average of ~145. This suggests a potential demand regime shift or high volatility. Lead times remain unstable: we've seen 1 period (P3, P7) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), while the P2 order is confirmed lost. Given the high on-hand stock and the reciente decline in demand, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=4) for demand forecasting to capture the recent slowdown and avoid excessive holding costs (which equal the unit profit). For lead time, I'll use 'calculate' to incorporate the observed 1-3 period variability into the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand has significantly dropped in the last two periods (Avg P8-P9 = 63.5 vs P1-P7 = 128). Monitoring for a sustained lower demand regime.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the inventory stands at 289 units on-hand and 133 in-transit. A review of recent demand (P7-P10: 20, 116, 11, 74) shows a significant drop and high volatility, with an average of 55.25 compared to the earlier game average of 146. This suggests a demand regime shift downwards. Lead times continue to be highly volatile (observed: 1, 3, 3, 3, 1 periods). The Period 2 order (55 units) and Period 6 order (21 units) are significantly overdue and likely lost, as later orders have already arrived. To adjust for the lower demand and high inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P7-P10) to reflect the new lower-demand regime and prevent further overstocking, as holding costs ($1) equal the profit per unit ($1). I am using 'calculate' for L to account for the actual observed lead time variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 10: Avg demand decreased from ~146 (P1-P6) to ~55 (P7-P10). Orders from Period 2 and Period 6 are confirmed lost.

Specifically, the last four periods (P8-P11) show an average of 56 units. The product is chips(Regular) and currently, the on-hand inventory is 266 units, which is quite high relative to the recent demand (approx. 5 periods of stock). There are 133 units in transit (likely the order from P9 and potentially an earlier one if not lost), though orders from P2 and P6 are definitively considered lost based on past insights. Due to the high inventory (266 on-hand + 133 in-transit = 399 total), the system should naturally avoid ordering more units if parameters are tuned to the current lower demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this lower demand level (covering the last 5 in-game samples) and set L to calculate to handle the observed lead time variability, which has ranged from 1 to 3 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, an order of 57 units arrived (ordered in Period 9, lead-time 3), resulting in a current on-hand inventory of 155. Demand in Period 12 spiked to 168, which is much higher than the previous 5 periods (which averaged ~50). This suggests the 'low demand regime' noted in carry-over insights might be ending or was simply highly volatile. The calculated average lead time for successful arrivals (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7, P9) is (3+1+3+3+1+3)/6 = 2.33 periods. Orders from P2 and P6 are definitely lost. Pipeline inventory is currently 76 (the order from P11, which hasn't arrived yet). Given the spike to 168, I will increase the demand forecast. I'll use a recent window (N=5) for demand to capture this recent volatility/spike (P8-12: 116, 11, 74, 23, 168; mean = 78.4). For lead time, I will use an explicit value of 3 to provide a safety buffer against the observed delays and losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly as of Period 12 (range 11-168 in the last 5 periods). Current mean demand (fixed N=5) is ~78, though the latest observation is more than double that. Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing a situation where demand has become highly volatile and lead times are unstable. Demand analysis: After a low-period regime, demand has spiked back up in the last two periods (P12: 168, P13: 109). The recent average (P9-P13) is approximately 77 units per period, but the volatility is significant. Lead time analysis: Observed lead times are consistently hitting 3 periods (P1: 3, P4: 3, P5: 3, P9: 3), with occasional 1-period arrivals. Promised L=2 is unreliable; I will use L=3 to ensure the inventory position covers the longer expected replenishment time. Inventory reconciliation: On-hand is 46, and In-transit is 159 (83 from P13 and 76 from a previous period not yet concluded or lost). However, we confirm orders from P2 and P6 are lost. To protect against the recent demand surge and high volatility (standard deviation is elevated), I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the recent upturn and keep sigma_hat based on recent volatility to maintain a safety buffer without excessive holding costs, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: recent range 11-168 (P9-P13). Mode lead time is 3 periods based on P1, P4, P5, and P9 arrivals.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of the 'conclude' messages indicates that the actual lead time is frequently 3 periods (Periods 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9 all arrived with lead times of 1 or 3, but the modal value for successful arrivals is 3). Promised lead time is 2, but L=3 is safer given the history. Demand has transitioned into a highly volatile state. While earlier periods (P1-P6) averaged 146, the most recent sequence (P10-P14) shows demands of [23, 168, 109, 43], averaging 85.8. Historical samples (P1-P5 in prompt) averaged ~55. Given this high variance and the shift from the ultra-high P1-P6 regime, I am using a recent window (N=5) to capture the current mean and volatility. The inventory position (On-hand 3 + In-transit 262 = 265) is relatively high, but since demand peaked at 168 recently, we must ensure the base stock targets this volatility. Setting L to 3 and using N=5 for demand statistics allows the OR engine to adapt to the recent average (~86) and the increased standard deviation.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory was exhausted (ending at 0) as expected arrivals from Periods 13 and 14 did not manifest. The confirmed lead time pattern is frequently 3 periods (seen in P4, P7, P8, and P12 concludes). I am setting L to explicit 3 to account for this consistent delay. Demand remains highly volatile; the last 5 periods (P11-P15) had demands of 23, 168, 109, 43, 53, averaging 79.2 units per period. However, given the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, the OR backend aims for a 50% service level which is risky given the current stockout. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this recent average while acknowledging the volatility. The in-transit pipeline (331 units) includes orders from P13 (83), P14 (103), and P15 (69), all of which are expected soon if the 3-period lead time holds.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory and have 248 units in transit. Demand has been highly volatile but seems to be averaging around 80 units over the last 5-7 periods. Specifically, the average demand of the last 7 periods (P10-P16) is approx 82.5 units. The lead time has stabilized to 3 periods for most recent arrivals (P1, P4, P5, P9, and P13 all arrived with L=3). Consequently, I will use an explicit L=3. For demand (mu_hat), choosing recent_N with N=7 captures the current regime of approximately 80 units/period, providing a (1+L) base stock target of roughly 330 units. Given the high volatility (range 23 to 168), setting sigma_hat to recent_N=7 will help the OR backend account for this variance to maintain service levels while being mindful of the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has consistently hit 3 periods for all recent successful arrivals (P1, P4, P5, P9, P13).

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the lead time for recent arrivals has stabilized at 3 periods (confirmed by orders from P13 and P14 arriving in P16 and P17 respectively). This is longer than the promised lead time of 2. On-hand inventory is very low (8 units), and demand has shown significant volatility, recently averaging roughly 85 units over the last 5 periods (P13-P17). The in-transit inventory includes orders from P15 (69 units) and P17 (83 units). Given that L=3, our order in P18 must cover demand for periods 18, 19, 20, and 21 (L+1=4 periods). I am setting L explicitly to 3 to align the OR backend with the observed reality. For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current demand level of ~84 units/period (total 4-period forecast ~336). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the heightened volatility seen in recent weeks, ensuring the base stock level provides an adequate safety buffer against stockouts without excessive holding costs, as profit and holding costs are equal (q=0.5).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 320 units in-transit. Demand has shown a recent upward trend, with the last 6 periods (P13-P18) averaging 88.7 units, and the most recent demand being 123. Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed for arrivals from P13 and P14, confirmed in the Carry-over Insights). The promised lead time is 2, but the actual operational lead time (L) is consistently 3. We have orders from Period 15 (69 units), Period 17 (83 units), and Period 18 (92 units) in the pipeline. Note that the Period 15 order is now at L=3 relative to this period's arrival phase, so it is expected to arrive during Period 19. My parameter settings reflect L=3 and a recent demand regime (last 6 periods) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the 4-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time has consistently hit 3 periods for five consecutive arrivals (P1, P4, P5, P9, P13, P14), suggesting a stable correction from the promised L=2 to an actual L=3.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with 355 units in-transit. Based on the consistent performance of the last five successful deliveries, the actual lead time (L) is stable at 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. The orders placed in Period 15 (69 units) and Period 17 (83 units) are currently at L=5 and L=3 respectively. Given previous history, the Period 15 order is likely lost or significantly delayed, while the Period 17 order should arrive imminently. Demand has entered a higher volatility phase but seems to be averaging around 90-100 units recently (Avg P13-P19 is ~92). I am setting L=3 explicitly to reflect reality. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level of approximately 92 units per period (before multiplying by 1+L), and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in this window (ranging from 43 to 123).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with 370 units in-transit. Based on 'conclude' messages from P17 and P19, the actual lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods (observed for orders from P13 and P14). The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals (P1, P4, P5, P9, P13, P14) consistently confirm L=3. Therefore, I am setting L to 3 (explicit). Demand has stabilized since the drop at P10; the mean demand from P13 to P20 is approximately 101.375 units per period. Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat captures this current demand level (P13-P20). For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N=8 to account for the sustained higher volatility observed in this regime (ranging from 43 to 123), ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover demand across the (L+1) horizon while stock arrives.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a heavy pipeline (383 units). Reviewing the 'conclude' messages, the most recent arrival was in Period 17 (order from Period 14). Orders from Period 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21 are all in-transit. Based on the Carry-over Insight and historical arrivals (P4, P7, P8, P12, P16, P17), the actual lead time L has stabilized at 3 periods (6 out of 8 successful arrivals). The current stockout is due to a cluster of orders from periods 18-21 not yet arriving. With L=3, the orders from P18 and P19 are expected to arrive in Period 22's arrival phase (visible in P23). Demand has stabilized at a higher level than the early game; the mean demand for the last 10 periods (P12-P21) is 102.9 units. I will set L=3 explicitly and use a recent_N of 10 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this current regime, which implies a base stock targeting (1+3) * 102.9 units, allowing the OR backend to reconcile the pipeline and avoid over-ordering while addressing the stockout.

Reviewing history, the arrivals from Period 17 (expected Period 20), Period 18 (expected Period 21), and Period 19 (expected Period 22) have not concluded yet, although the confirmed lead time in Carry-Over Insights is 3 periods. This indicates either a localized delay beyond 3 periods or a period of severe stockout while waiting for shipments. Demand has stabilized into a regime averaging approximately 110 units per period over the last 10 periods (P13-P22 avg = 101.9, P17-P22 avg = 108.5). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to align with historical lead-time evidence. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the relative stability of demand around the 110 range, while ensuring the backend calculates requirements for (1+L) = 4 periods (approx 440 units). This should help clear the stockout and maintain service levels once the pipeline arrives.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the system is recovering from a stockout. Period 23 saw a cluster arrival of orders from P20, P21, and P22 with lead times of 3, 2, and 1 periods respectively, meaning the erratic lead time behavior continues. However, the consistent mode and most frequent upper bound remains 3 periods. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~112 units per period over the last 10 periods (P14-P23), which is significantly higher than the initial historical data but lower than the early game peak. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 355 units (comprised of orders from P17 (83), P18 (92), P19 (35), and most likely residual pipeline). Given the profit/holding ratio (1.0/1.0), the service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock effectively targets the median demand over the (L+1) horizon. I will explicitly set L to 3 to account for the frequent delays, use the recent 10-period demand mean (~112) for mu_hat, and use recent_N for volatility to capture the current demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time cluster arrival in P23 confirms continued instability (LT 1, 2, and 3 all observed in one period); maintaining L=3 as the planning baseline. Demand mean for P14-P23 has stabilized at ~112 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing a stockout situation with high demand volatility. Demand for the last 10 periods (P14-P23) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 112 units per period, although recent observations (P24) show a dip. Lead time remains unstable, with recent arrivals (P23) showing lead times of 1, 2, and 3 periods all arriving simultaneously. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, L=3 remains the most robust baseline for planning to avoid further stockouts. I will use a recent window of N=11 (P14-P24) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable mean of approximately 108 units ((112*10+72)/11) and use the same window for sigma_hat to capture the significant volatility observed in this period. Setting L to 3 and using 'recent_N' for demand stats helps the OR backend establish a base stock level that accounts for the frequent 3-period lead time and the high variance in daily orders.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively steady since Period 14, with a mean demand of approximately 110 units (Periods 14-25 average is ~106, excluding the extreme Period 12 outlier). Recently (P24-P25), demand was 72 and 109. Lead times have been extremely volatile, with a cluster of arrivals in P23 (LTs of 1, 2, and 3) followed by no arrivals in P24 and P25. Given that orders from P15 (69 units), P17 (83 units), P18 (92 units), and P19 (35 units) are currently 'In-transit' and well beyond the typical 3-period lead time, they are likely lost or severely delayed. The currently calculated 'In-transit' of 393 units is misleading because many of those units are overdue and potentially lost. To compensate for these likely lost shipments and ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the current zero on-hand inventory, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the stabilized demand regime (avg ~107) while maintaining high responsiveness to volatility with sigma_hat 'default'.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 279 units) are likely lost as they have exceeded the 3-period observed lead time window without arriving by Period 25.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, the product chips(Regular) has 0 on-hand inventory and 393 units in-transit. Historical data suggests a recurring pattern of lost shipments: orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 354 units) have significantly exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods without arriving. Specifically, orders from P15/17/18/19 should have arrived by P22 at the latest. Consequently, the 'In-transit' figure of 393 is highly misleading, as approximately 354 units are likely lost, leaving an effective pipeline of only ~39 units (the P24 order). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 112 units (P14-P23), though recent periods P24-P26 show slightly lower demand (avg 87). I will use L=3 as the planning lead time, which has been the most consistent successful delivery duration. To compensate for the stockout and the lost pipeline units, I am using 'explicit' L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to force a significant replenishment order that ignores the 'phantom' in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom inventory confirmed: Orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (279 units) plus previously identified Period 2 and 6 losses are confirmed lost, causing persistent stockouts despite high reported in-transit numbers.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a persistent stockout state (ending_inventory = 0 for 4 consecutive periods). The 'In-transit' count of 448 is misleading because it includes confirmed lost orders from Periods 15 (69), 17 (83), 18 (92), and 19 (35), totaling 279 units. Subtracting these from the current 448 in-transit leaves only 169 units that are physically expected to arrive (ordered in P24 and P27). Demand has stabilized at roughly 100 units per period (Avg P20-P27 = 99.6 units). The lead time has settled at L=3 (as established in previous carry-overs). With on-hand inventory at 0 and the actual reliable pipeline at 169, we are significantly under-provisioned relative to the expected demand across the lead time plus one period (L+1=4 periods, ~400 units). I am setting mu_hat to 400 using the explicit method to account for this deficit and bypass the OR backend's inclusion of phantom inventory in its calculation. I will use L=3 to reflect the corrected lead time.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 448 units in transit, but a significant portion of this is 'phantom' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19). As established in Carry-Over Insights for Period 27, these 334 units (55+21+69+83+92+14) are missing and will not arrive. Effective pipeline inventory is therefore ~114 units (Orders from P20-P28 minus those already arrived). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have been stocking out consistently. Demand in the most recent regime (P14-P28) has returned to a stable average of approximately 101 units per period, but volatility remains present. I will set L=3 as the planning baseline since most successful recent deliveries followed this lead time. To compensate for the 'phantom' inventory being subtracted by the OR backend, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I need to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~404 units) plus a safety buffer. However, because the backend subtracts the full 448 'in-transit' units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to ensure an order is triggered. Setting mu_hat to a high explicit value of 700 will force the base stock high enough to overcome the phantom inventory drag and resume replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Persistent stockouts confirmed due to 334 units of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime P14-P28 stabilized at ~101 units/period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 30. Analysis of the pipeline reveals significant 'phantom' inventory: orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 24 (totaling 372 units) are significantly overdue (exceeding the observed 3-period max lead time) and are considered lost. This explains why we have 0 on-hand inventory despite 595 units reported in-transit. The real pipeline consists only of orders from Period 29 (202 units). Demand has stabilized at a regime of ~101 units/period since Period 14. To compensate for the lost units and restore service levels, I am setting L=3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and using explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Mu_hat is set to (1+3)*101 = 404. Sigma_hat is set based on the standard deviation of recent demand samples (approx 25) scaled by sqrt(1+3), totaling 50.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Total phantom inventory confirmed at 372 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Only P29 order is active in the pipeline. This confirms that 'In-transit' counts must be mentally adjusted downwards by this amount to prevent the OR backend from under-ordering.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 31. The situation is extremely critical due to 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Based on the history, orders from Period 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 24 (totaling 372 units) have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods and are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' is reported as 595 units. Subtracting the 372 lost units leaves an actual active pipeline of 223 units (21 units from P29 and whatever was ordered in P30). However, P30 order was 0, so the active pipeline is just the P29 order (223 units, though history says 202 ordered). We are currently stocked out. The demand regime for P14-P30 has stabilized at approximately 101 units per period. To force the OR backend to place a large recovery order despite the high (but fake) 'In-transit' number, I am significantly increasing mu_hat using 'explicit'. I've set mu_hat at 850, which covers 4 periods (L+1 with L=3) of demand (approx 400 units) plus an 'offset' to neutralize the ~450 units of phantom inventory that the backend incorrectly thinks is coming.

Carry-over insight: Phanton inventory breakdown: P2(55), P6(21), P15(69), P17(83), P18(92), P19(35), P24(38) = 393 units confirmed lost. Only active order in pipeline is P29 (202 units). Demand remains stable at approx 101 units/period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a massive 'phantom inventory' problem where multiple orders from middle periods (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) totaling 393 units are effectively lost but still reported in the 'In-transit' figure of 834. Period 32 shows On-hand = 0 and In-transit = 834. Of that 834, 393 units are confirmed lost, and several recent orders (P29, P31) are legitimate. Specifically, P29 (202 units) and P31 (239 units) are the only reliable stock in the pipeline. Total legitimate in-transit = 441 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 393 phantom units, I am adjusting L to 3 (observed actual lead time) and setting mu_hat to an explicit value that's significantly higher than the true demand of ~101 to compensate for the inventory the OR engine thinks we have but we actually don't. By setting L=3 and mu_hat=800, I force a higher base stock that accounts for the ~400 units of lost pipeline capacity. This ensures the OR engine places an order to bridge the stockout gap despite the high (but fake) in-transit numbers.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom (lost) inventory in pipeline is definitively 393 units: P2(55), P6(21), P15(69), P17(83), P18(92), P19(35), P24(38). This causes the OR backend to underestimate the actual need for new orders.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100-105 units over the last 15+ periods despite historical volatility. We are currently managing a massive 'phantom inventory' problem where 393 units in the pipeline (from periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 24) are lost and will never arrive. The current 'In-transit' is 595, but subtracting the 393 lost units leaves an actual active pipeline of 202 units (the Period 29 order). Since we have 139 on-hand and 202 arriving (likely within 1-2 periods given recent lead time variability), our true inventory position is 341. With a lead time of 3 and a demand of ~101, our base stock target (covering L+1=4 periods) should be approximately 404 units. To force the OR backend to order sufficiently, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. By setting mu_hat = 404 and sigma_hat based on recent high volatility, the backend (calculating base_stock - in_transit) will see (404 - 595), resulting in a zero order unless I compensate for the 393 phantom units. To effectively neutralize the phantom 393 units in the backend's calculation [Order = BaseStock - (Active_Pipeline + Phantom)], I will set mu_hat = 404 + 393 = 797 units. This ensures the backend places an order to reach the true desired base stock.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 32, the 'In-transit' figure contains 393 units of confirmed lost inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Parameter mu_hat must be adjusted upward by this amount to offset the 'phantom' supply in the OR backend's order calculation. Demand is stable at ~101 uints/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at approximately 101 units per period. The 'In-transit' figure (658) is heavily inflated by 393 units of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 24. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit) to subtract from the calculated base stock, it will under-order unless we compensate. To ensure the backend places an order that covers true needs, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target mu_hat as: ((1 + L) * historical_mean) + phantom_inventory. With L=3 and mean=101, this is (4 * 101) + 393 = 797. This forces the backend to recognize that 393 units of the pipeline are non-existent. I set L=3 as the explicit lead time based on the most frequent historical observation and consistent arrivals after Period 20. I use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility (N=10 covering Periods 24-33).

Carry-over insight: No new significant pattern detected; existing phantom inventory total remains at 393 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 101 units per period (P14-P34). However, the system faces a massive 'phantom inventory' problem. The current 'In-transit' figure of 768 includes 393 units from orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) that are definitively lost. The OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation; if we do not compensate, the backend will under-order or stop ordering entirely. To fix this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 3 (L+1=4 periods of demand) which is 4 * 101 = 404 units. To offset the 393 units of lost inventory that the backend incorrectly thinks are coming, I add that amount to the base stock: 404 + 393 = 797. Setting mu_hat to 797 ensures the backend places orders that actually reflect physical needs. L is set to explicit 3 to match the consistent actual lead time.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 797 units. However, consistent historical observation confirms that a significant portion of this pipeline is 'phantom' or lost inventory. Specifically, orders from P2 (55), P6 (21), P15 (69), P17 (83), P18 (92), P19 (35), and P24 (38) total 393 units that have never arrived and are well beyond any observed lead time window. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 797 - 393 = 404 units. To ensure the OR backend (which relies on 'pipeline_inventory' in its order logic) places sufficient orders despite this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on a stable demand of ~101 units/period (P14-P35 avg) over (L+1) periods, where L=3, and then add the 393 phantom units. This mathematical 'padding' forces the engine to ignore the 393 units of lost stock when calculating the order quantity: [Target Base Stock (L=3)] + 393. With L=3, (L+1)=4. Target base stock is approx 4 * 101 = 404. Adding 393 yields 797. L is set to explicit 3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time observed over the most recent successful delivery cycles.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P14-P36) is stable with a mean of approximately 101 units and low variance. However, the system faces a critical issue with 'phantom' inventory. Based on the history and carry-over insights, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24 (totaling 393 units) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The current 'In-transit' of 687 units includes this 393 units of lost stock, meaning the true active pipeline is only 294 units (Orders from P29, P31, P33, P35). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom supply, I set mu_hat to 'explicit' at 797. This value represents (L+1) * 101 units of needed coverage across the lead time, plus an offset of 393 units to neutralize the backend's deduction of the lost inventory from the order calculation [((3+1)*101) + 393 = 797]. L is set to explicit 3, reflecting the consistent upper bound of actual lead times observed.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P14-P37) has settled at an average of approximately 98 units per period, with relatively low volatility compared to earlier periods. Based on the history, 'phantom inventory' (lost orders) remains a critical issue. The total confirmed lost units are 415: P2(55), P6(21), P15(69), P17(83), P18(92), P19(35), P24(38), and now P29(202) is overdue past its 1-3 period window (P38-P29=9 periods). Total In-transit is 764. If we subtract the 415 phantom units, the 'real' pipeline is 349 units (Orders P33, P34, P35, P37). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the stockout, I'll set mu_hat to a value that reflects the demand for the lead time plus the lost inventory to compensate for the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic. Using L=3 (most frequent actual lead time) and mean demand ~98, the target stock should be around 392 (4 periods of demand). With 349 'real' units in transit, we need to order more. I will use 'explicit' to provide a mu_hat that forces an order despite the high reported in-transit number.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total phantom inventory confirmed at 415 units. This includes P2(55), P6(21), P15(69), P17(83), P18(92), P19(35), P24(38), and P29(22). Note: P29 (202 units) has likely been lost as it is 9 periods old. The 'In-transit' figure is significantly inflated by these non-arriving orders.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am currently at Period 39. The most critical issue is the accumulation of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Based on historical data, orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and now Period 29 (202 units, oldest active order, now 10 periods old) are almost certainly lost. This totals 617 units (393 + 22 from before P29 + 202 from P29 = 617 units). The current 'In-transit' is 800 units, but 617 of those are phantom units that will never arrive. The OR backend uses the formula 'order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit)'. If I leave L at 2 or 3 and use a normal mu_hat, the backend will see 800 in-transit and order nothing or very little, causing continued stockouts. To force the backend to place an order, I must increase mu_hat to offset these 617 units. My target base stock should cover approximately 4 periods (L=3 plus current period) of demand at ~101 units/period, which is ~404. However, with 800 units reported 'In-transit', I must set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - 800' results in a positive order of about 100-150 units to maintain the flow. Therefore, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 950 (which, after standard backend math, should overcome the phantom inventory drag). Lead time L is set to 3 as it is the most consistent recently observed reality.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom (lost) inventory in pipeline increased to 617 units (including P29's 202 units). This causes the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend to be highly misleading, requiring aggressive upward adjustment of mu_hat to trigger necessary replenishment.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we face a significant issue with 'phantom' inventory inflating the In-transit figure. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed lost: P2(55), P6(21), P15(69), P17(83), P18(92), P19(35), P24(38), and P29(202). Total lost inventory is 595 units. Subtracting these from the reported In-transit of 914 leaves 319 units of genuinely active shipments (from P31, P33, P37, P39). This phantom inventory causes the OR backend to under-order because it believes supply is coming. To compensate, I set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. Current demand is stable at ~100 units/period. With target L=3, the mu_hat should theoretically be (1+3)*100 = 400. However, to force the backend to ignore the 595 phantom units, I must add that volume to the expectation. Total mu_hat = 400 + 595 = 995. I set L=3 as it is the most frequent physical lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 30 based on recent demand fluctuations (range 75-110). This aggressive mu_hat adjustment is necessary to clear the backlog created by lost shipments and maintain availability for the final 10 periods.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory in pipeline (confirmed lost) is 595 units as of Period 39: P2(55), P6(21), P15(69), P17(83), P18(92), P19(35), P24(38), P29(202). Period 31 order (239 units) arrived in P32, but other older orders remain missing.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at approximately 100 units/period (average for P31-P40 is 95 units, range 75-110). However, the primary challenge is significant 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Total confirmed lost units are 595: P2(55), P6(21), P15(69), P17(83), P18(92), P19(35), P24(38), and P29(202). These units remain in the 'In-transit' figure (currently 845) but will never arrive. To protect the service level and prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' to bypass the backend's pipeline deduction logic. We calculate required base stock for (L+1) periods (L=3, so 4 periods of demand at 100 units/period = 400 units) and then add the 595 lost units to ensure the order calculation (BaseStock - InTransit) resolves to a meaningful replenishment quantity. Setting mu_hat to 995 (400 + 595) effectively signals to the backend that current availability is severely compromised by the losses.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical due to a large amount of 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived, yet still count toward the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend. As of Period 41, the total confirmed lost inventory is 595 units: P2(55), P6(21), P15(69), P17(83), P18(92), P19(35), P24(38), and P29(202). Period 33(63), Period 37(106), Period 40(81), and Period 41(103) are the only potentially valid orders in the pipeline. With 948 reported in-transit units and 595 confirmed lost, the OR's perception of the pipeline is inflated by ~170%. Demand has stabilized around 100 units/period (P14-P41 avg ~98). To force the backend to ignore the phantom stock and place an order that covers the next (L+1) periods, I am explicitly setting mu_hat to the sum of the required base stock (~400 units) plus the 595 phantom units. Setting L=3 reflects the consistent upper bound of successful deliveries. Sigma_hat is set to cover the observed volatility (range 72-110 in recent stable periods).

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory in pipeline (confirmed lost) remains at 595 units: P2(55), P6(21), P15(69), P17(83), P18(92), P19(35), P24(38), P29(202). This represents nearly 63% of the reported 'In-transit' balance, requiring aggressive mu_hat inflation for the OR backend to function.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at approximately 93 units per period (average of P29-P42). The primary challenge continues to be the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. As of P42, the In-transit balance is 995 units. Based on historical data, the following orders are confirmed lost: P2(55), P6(21), P15(69), P17(83), P18(92), P19(35), P24(38), and P29(202), totaling 595 units. These 'phantom' units mislead the OR backend into under-ordering because it believes they will arrive. To correct this, I am setting L=3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target mu_hat by taking the base requirement for (1+L) periods (93 * 4 = 372) and adding the 595 lost units (372 + 595 = 967). This forces the backend to recognize that 595 units of existing pipeline are non-existent, triggering the necessary orders to maintain service levels. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 914 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms a massive 'phantom' inventory problem. Confirmed lost orders include: P2(55), P6(21), P15(69), P17(83), P18(92), P19(35), P24(38), and P29(202), totaling 595 units. These will never arrive but are subtracted from the base stock by the OR backend. Recent arrivals (P38, P39, P40) show lead times of 1 and 3 periods, maintaining L=3 as a safe planning horizon. Demand for the last 15 periods (P29-P43) is stable with a mean of ~94 units/period. To trigger an order despite the phantom 595 units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (1+L)*demand + phantom + safety. With demand ~94 and L=3, (1+3)*94 = 376. Adding the 595 phantom units gives 971. I will set mu_hat to 975 to ensure the OR backend places an order to cover current stockouts and upcoming demand, effectively neutralizing the pipeline distortion.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit/holding ratio suggesting a high service level. The demand regime has been stable at approximately 101 units/period since Period 14. However, the system is severely handicapped by 'phantom inventory'. We have confirmed 595 units in the 'In-transit' figure are actually lost (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P29). These lost units total 595. Currently, the reported In-transit is 872, but the actual active pipeline is only 277 units (Orders P33, P37, P42, P44). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for an L=2 (planning horizon of 3 periods) at ~303 units, then add the 595 phantom units to the target so the backend's subtraction (Base Stock - Pipeline) results in the correct order quantity. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile but averaged lead time near the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: No new significant pattern detected; phantom inventory remains at 595 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29). Actual active pipeline: 277 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 101 units per period (P14-P45). The lead time remains erratic, with recent arrivals (P40, P41, P42) taking 3 periods, though we have seen 1-2 period arrivals recently as well. I will continue to use L=3 for safety. The critical issue remains the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Total confirmed lost/phantom inventory is 595 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29). With a reported in-transit of 847 units, the 'real' active pipeline is only 252 units (847 - 595). To compensate for the OR backend's use of the inflated 847 figure, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. Calculation: Target base_stock for (L+1=4) periods is ~404 units. To ensure the backend orders enough despite the 595 phantom units, I set mu_hat to approximately (Target + Phantom) / (L+1) = (404 + 595) / 4 = 249.75. I will set mu_hat = 1000 to ensure the backend triggers a replenishment order that covers the current stockout and the actual pipeline deficit.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed stable demand regime of ~102 units/period (avg P14-P46) and a highly erratic lead time (1-3 periods). A critical issue remains: the 'In-transit' figure of 1000 units is heavily inflated by 595 units of 'phantom' inventory (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P29) which are confirmed lost or significantly overdue. This leaves only 405 units as a true active pipeline (P33, P37, P44, P45, P46). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the actual shortfall, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on L=3 and a 102 unit forecast (approx 408 units) and then add the 595 unit phantom offset, resulting in a mu_hat of 1003. This forces the backend to ignore the fake pipeline units. Sigma is set to a recent window to capture high demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: No new significant pattern detected; phantom inventory remains at 595 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 100 units per period (P33-P47 mean is ~98). The inventory system remains heavily impacted by 'phantom' inventory\u2014orders that are officially in-transit but have been lost. As of Period 47, the confirmed lost orders are P2(55), P6(21), P15(69), P17(83), P18(92), P19(35), P24(38), and P29(202), totaling 595 units. Additionally, the Period 33 order (63 units) and the Period 37 order (106 units) are now 14 and 10 periods old respectively, far exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods; I am classifying these as lost as well. This brings the total phantom inventory to 764 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 1003 contains only 239 units of likely active inventory (P44-P47). To force the OR backend to place necessary orders despite the false 'In-transit' buffer, I set mu_hat using 'explicit' at a value that offsets this phantom inventory: (1+L)*demand + phantom_offset = (1+3)*100 + 764 = 1164. I am maintaining L=3 as it reflects the upper bound of the volatile lead time. This aggressive mu_hat adjustment is necessary to prevent stockouts in the final periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom (lost) inventory in pipeline increased to 764 units (added P33: 63 units and P37: 106 units to the existing 595 units). These orders are 10+ periods old and will not arrive. This significantly inflates the in-transit balance, requiring mu_hat inflation to trigger replenishment.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the 'In-transit' figure of 1164 units is heavily distorted by 764 units of confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29, P33, and P37). These orders are well beyond the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods and are considered lost. The actual active pipeline consists of orders from P44 (61), P45 (22), P46 (153), P47 (3), and P48 (161), totaling 400 units. Demand is stable in the current regime (P30-P48) with a mean of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation of 13. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the phantom inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for a lead time of 3 (L+1=4 periods): 4 * 101 + 1.645 * (sqrt(4) * 13) \u2248 447 units. To force the OR backend (which subtracts the 1164 in-transit) to place an order that restores the active pipeline to cover demand, I must inflate mu_hat. Specifically, mu_hat + 764 needs to cover the target inventory level. Setting mu_hat to 1211 (447 + 764) ensures the backend logic (base_stock - in_transit) results in appropriate ordering.

Carry-over insight: No new significant pattern detected; phantom inventory remains at 764 units (added P33: 63 units and P37: 106 units to the previous 595 units). Active pipeline is approximately 400 units.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. The primary challenge remains the significant 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline\u2014orders that have been 'In-transit' for a duration far exceeding the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods and are confirmed lost. As of Period 49, this total is 764 units: P2(55), P6(21), P15(69), P17(83), P18(92), P19(35), P24(38), P29(202), P33(63), and P37(106). With a reported 'In-transit' of 1211, the actual active pipeline is only 447 units (Orders P44, P45, P46, P47, P48, P49). Demand has been relatively stable at approximately 101 units per period since Period 14, although recent periods (P48-P49) show a slight uptick (~122 avg). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the inflated in-transit figure, I am inflating mu_hat. I use L=3 as the planning lead time. The mu_hat calculation is (1+L) * Mean_Demand + Phantom_Inventory = (4 * 105) + 764 = 1184. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=20 to capture the sustained high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom (lost) inventory in pipeline as of P49 is 764 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29, P33, P37). All these are >= 12 periods old. Active pipeline consists only of orders from P44 onwards.
