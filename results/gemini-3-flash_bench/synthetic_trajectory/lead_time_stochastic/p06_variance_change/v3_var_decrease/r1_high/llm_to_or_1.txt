Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical data and no current inventory. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the provided demand samples (Period 1-5), the initial demand (at Period 1) is 58 units. Since we must make a decision for Period 1 before seeing its outcome, I am using the provided sample data to set the forecast. The average demand across the five samples is [58, 163, 41, 0, 12] = 54.8 per period. With L=2, the coverage period is L+1=3. mu_hat = 3 * 54.8 = 164.4. The standard deviation of the samples is approx 64.9, so sigma_hat = sqrt(3) * 64.9 = 112.4. These parameters will trigger an initial order to build safety stock and meet expected demand once the shipment arrives in Period 3.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 162 units based on initial demand signals, but since the promised lead time is 2 periods, nothing arrived in Period 1 (this is normal). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 162 units in transit. The demand in Period 1 was 56 units. Considering the historical samples (58, 163, 41, 0, 12), the demand seems highly volatile and potentially skewed by the 163 value. With no stock on hand, we need to ensure the next order + current in-transit covers the lead time (L=2) and the review period (1). Total risk period = 3. I will use the 'default' method for L (2 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent fluctuations while smoothing out the outlier of 163 somewhat, though the backend will calculate (1+L) * mean. Given we only have 5 historical data points and 1 period of 'concluded' game history, N=3 is appropriate.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order of 162 units placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3 (Arrival Resolution) and will be visible in the Period 3 conclusion. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 (56 and 106 units respectively) because the initial inventory was zero and the first order hasn't arrived yet. Demand history shows Period 1: 58 (user demand list says 58, conclude message says 56 - I will follow the provided demand list samples), Period 2: 163 (conclude says 106 - there is a discrepancy, but the demand list provided in 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' is usually the ground truth for forecasting: 58, 163, 41...). Given the volatility and the fact that we are just starting to build history, I will use a 3-period window for demand forecasting where possible. The lead time appears to be behaving as promised (Order P1 -> Arrives P3), so L=default (2). mu_hat needs to cover L+1 (3) periods. Mean of samples (58, 163, 41) is approx 87.3. 87.3 * 3 = 262.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 56, Period 2 was 106, and Period 3 was 71 (average ~78). However, we have suffered stockouts since Period 1 because no orders have arrived yet. Promised lead time is 2. The order placed in Period 1 (162 units) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible in Period 4's start (Period 3 conclude). However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This suggests a lead time of at least 3 periods or a lost shipment. We have 298 units in transit (162 from P1 + 0 from P2 + 136 from P3). I will set L to 3 to account for the delay observed from the Period 1 order. Demand seems relatively stable around 75-80 units per period, so I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture the available history for mu and sigma, while checking for the expected arrival of the P1 order in the next cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3662.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that demand has been highly volatile (56, 106, 71, 198). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance: Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 order arrived in 1 period. This suggests an unstable delivery window. Total inventory (on-hand 100 + in-transit 98) is 198. The most recent demand (Period 4) spiked to 198, which is significantly higher than the previous average (~77). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is required. I will use recent_N for demand to capture the recent spike (N=4 to include the full available history of non-zero demand) and use 'calculate' for lead time to let the engine average the observed 3 and 1 period arrival times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we have 74 units on-hand and 311 units in-transit (ordered in Period 4 and 5). Looking at history: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods (Period 4), while Period 3's order arrived in 1 period (Period 4). The average lead time observed is 2 periods ((3+1)/2), which matches the promised lead time. The demand in the first 5 periods has been volatile (58, 163, 41, 0, 12 according to provided history; though game history shows 56, 106, 71, 198, 26). Averaging the last 5 demand figures from the 'Period X conclude' messages (56, 106, 71, 198, 26) gives 91.4 per period. With L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods, roughly 274. Since demand is unstable, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean and standard deviation. The large in-transit amount (311) against a mean of 91.4 suggests we are currently well-covered once those shipments arrive.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 39 with 510 units in transit. The demand history (56, 106, 71, 198, 26, 35) shows high volatility without a clear trend; the mean per period is approximately 82. Lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods (P4), while Period 3 order arrived in 1 period (P4). The promised lead time is 2, and the average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the engine factor in this variability. For demand (mu_hat), the last 3 periods (198, 26, 35) show extreme fluctuation that doesn't represent the full history well; I'll use the 'default' method to calculate the forecast based on the full sample set to stabilize the 'base stock' target, as the current pipeline (510) is already quite large relative to recent demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1723.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have been 3, 1, and 3 periods, averaging 2.33. The most recent order (from Period 4) took 3 periods. Current in-transit inventory is high (412 units) relative to recent demand, which has been volatile (samples: 56, 106, 71, 198, 26, 35, 93). Mean demand over all 7 periods is approx 83.5. Given the inconsistency in delivery (Period 4 saw a batch arrival, Period 7 saw a delayed arrival), I will set L to 3 to reflect the most recent actual delay. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher demand levels seen since Period 4 (avg ~88), ensuring the pipeline covers the (L+1) window against potential stockouts while acknowledging the large in-transit volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $283.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 230 units on hand and 356 units in transit (ordered in P6 and P8). Historically, demand has been volatile, ranging from 26 to 198. The most recent demand (P5-P8) averaged 45.25. However, earlier demand (P1-P4) averaged 107.75. Lead times were promised at 2, but observed actual lead times have been 3, 1, 3, and 3. This indicates an average actual lead time of 2.5, which is longer than the promised 2. To account for this, I will set L to 2.5 using 'explicit' to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the extra half-period of demand risk. For mu_hat, the 'default' method utilizes all 8 samples (avg ~77/period). With L=2.5, (1+L) = 3.5, giving mu_hat ~270. Given the sharp drops and spikes, I'll use 'default' for mu_hat to capture the long-term mean and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for the high historical variance (standard deviation ~56), ensuring we have enough safety stock for potential spikes while managing the holding cost for the current on-hand units.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed to be 3 periods in 3 out of 4 deliveries (P1, P4, P5), suggesting a sustained delay beyond promised L=2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $313.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively low and volatile over the last five periods (averaging 43.2 units) compared to the initial surge. The carry-over insight confirms that the actual lead time (L) frequently drifts to 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, and P8), regardless of the promised L=2. To account for this, I am setting L explicitly to 3. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), the last 5 periods (P5-P9) represent a more stable, lower demand regime than the start of the simulation; therefore, I am using recent_N with N=5 to avoid over-ordering based on early spikes. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods to reflect current volatility. With on-hand inventory at 352 and 199 in-transit units, the pipeline is well-stocked for this lower demand regime, so the OR backend will likely result in a small or zero order this period to minimize holding costs while the lead-time buffer remains adequate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 with an on-hand inventory of 309 units and 199 units in-transit (ordered in Period 6). Reviewing the lead time history: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1, P4 arrived in 3, P5 arrived in 3, and P8 arrived in 1. The average actual lead time is (3+1+3+3+1)/5 = 2.2 periods. While the promised lead time is 2, the behavior is volatile. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the historical average (approx 2.2). Demand has fluctuated: early periods (P1-P4) showed higher/volatile demand, while recent periods (P5-P10) have stabilized at a lower mean. The mean demand of the last 6 periods is approximately (26+35+93+27+35+43)/6 = 43.1. With current inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 508 units) and an expected demand over (L+1) periods (~3.2 periods) of roughly 138 units, we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand trends. Using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this lower demand regime and prevent unnecessary ordering while the engine works through the existing surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: Average demand decreased from ~108 (P1-P4) to ~43 (P5-P10), a reduction of approx 60%. Lead time remains volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4451.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, demand spiked to 238, which is a massive outlier compared to the average of ~43 observed between Periods 5-10. This suggests a potential structural shift or a recurring seasonal/calendar event that wasn't visible in the short history provided (Period 4 also saw a spike of 198). I am shifting to a hybrid forecasting approach. For L, although the promised time is 2, the 'calculate' method will allow the backend to use the mean of observed lead times (averaging the 1s and 3s). For mu_hat, the spike in Period 11 significantly raises the expected demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the low-demand regime (P5-10) plus the recent spike (P11), ensuring the system reacts to the possibility that high demand might persist without overreacting solely to one data point. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to capture the increased volatility introduced by the Period 11 spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Significant spike to 238 (following a period of avg ~43), suggesting intermittent high-demand volatility or seasonal patterns.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility phase. After a period of low demand (avg ~43 during P5-P10), P11 and P12 saw massive spikes (238 and 161 respectively), leading to a stockout (on-hand is 0). Current in-transit is 397 (P6 order of 199 and P12 order of 198). Given the previous carry-over insights, lead times are unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average observed is 2.2). To recover from the stockout and address this new high-demand regime, I am using recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focusing on the last 3 periods (P10-P12) where the shift occurred. I will set the lead time parameter L to 3 to reflect the high-end risk of delayed deliveries, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for a longer lead time and the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 11: Transition from low-demand (~43) to high-volatility spikes (avg ~147 over P10-P12). Lead time remains unreliable, typically oscillating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of stockout (On-hand: 0) with a significant demand spike occurring over the last three periods (P11-P13: 238, 161, 121), averaging 173 units per period. This contrasts sharply with the previous regime (P5-P10), which averaged ~43 units per period. Lead times are highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.3). My current pipeline inventory is 706 units, but none have arrived despite orders in P12 and P13. I need to set L to reflect the actual observed delay (closer to 3) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the replenishment gap during this high-demand volatility phase. I will use N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the recent spike without being overly influenced by the previous low-demand regime.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory and 889 units in-transit. Since Period 11, there has been a significant demand increase, with the last four periods averaging ~159 units (238, 161, 121, 117), compared to the previous low-demand regime of ~43. Lead times are highly unreliable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (observed: P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P8:1). No orders have arrived since Period 9, meaning orders from P12, P13, and P14 (totaling 690 units) are currently in-transit. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the mean of the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent high-demand regime. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use the last 4 periods to reflect the current high service-level requirement while in a stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed high: Average demand stabilized at ~159 since Period 11 (previously ~43); Lead time continues to show high variance (mode 3, min 1).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted from a low period (~43 units/period) to a significantly higher level starting at Period 11, averaging approximately 147 units per period over the last 5 periods (P11-P15: 238, 161, 121, 117, 96). While the last few signals show a downward trend, the overall level remains substantially higher than the P5-P10 period. Lead time has been highly volatile, with observed values alternating consistently between 1 and 3 periods (latest arriving in P15 was L=3). To account for both the higher recent demand and the unreliable lead time, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the likely 3-period delay. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the high-regime characteristics (P11-P15) while ignoring the previous low-demand phase. The high in-transit amount (691) relative to recent demand suggests we have significant orders pending (P13: 309, P14: 183), so the OR backend will moderate new ordering based on this pipeline.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are managing a demand regime that shifted at Period 11. Since Period 11, demand has been significantly higher and more volatile (average ~138 units over P11-P16) compared to the previous low-demand phase (avg ~43). Lead times have consistently oscillated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent observation for recent large shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory is 312, and pipeline inventory is 382 (total 694). The order from P14 (183 units) is expected to arrive in Period 17 (3-period lead time). Given the high demand volatility and unreliable lead times, I will set L to 3 to ensure the inventory target covers a longer lead cycle. mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current high-demand regime since Period 11, and sigma_hat will also use N=6 to reflect the increased variance observed in this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1745.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 18. Analysis of history shows a clear demand regime shift starting around Period 11, where demand increased and became more volatile compared to the low-demand phase of Periods 5-10. Since Period 11, the average demand is approximately 134 units (P11-P17). Regarding lead time, the persistent pattern is a delay of 3 periods (observed in orders from P12, P13, and P14), despite occasional outliers. On-hand inventory is currently high (383 units) due to the arrival of the P14 order. With 238 units still in transit (from P17 and potentially unfilled needs from historical gaps), the inventory position is relatively strong. I will set the lead time (L) to 3 to reflect the consistent actual performance. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime that began in Period 11. This helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock level while accounting for the increased volatility and longer lead times observed in the most recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P15, P16, and P17). Demand regime remains in high-volatility state since P11 (avg ~134).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe a steady lead time of 3 periods (confirmed by orders from P12, P13, and P14 all arriving exactly at L=3). Demand has stabilized into a high-volatility regime since Period 11. Specifically, over the last 8 periods (P11-P18), mean demand is approximately 128.6 units per period. Prior insights suggested L=3 and a high-demand regime, which is supported by the current inventory status (On-hand: 298, In-transit: 322). Given the 3-period lead time, we must cover a 4-period window (L+1). I will set L to 3 explicitly. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=8 to capture the mean of the current high-volatility regime (P11-P18). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=8 to reflect the high variance observed in this same period, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to handle the intermittent spikes (like the 238 in P11).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe an on-hand inventory of 198 units and 381 units in-transit. Analyzing demand since the regime shift at Period 11, the average demand is approximately 117 units per period (P11-P19), with high volatility (range 85-238). The lead time has stabilized at 3 periods, confirmed by the last three arrivals (ordered P12-P14, all arriving with Lead Time = 3). Consequently, the backend logic must account for a lead time of 3. I will set L to 'explicit' with a value of 3 to align with recent historical observations. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (P11-P19) to capture the current high-demand regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=9 to reflect the significant volatility observed in this period, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover demand during the extended lead time.

LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the on-hand inventory is 60 and in-transit is 461. Analyzing the history, demand has entered a high-volatility regime since Period 11, with recent demand average around 110-140 units (P18: 85, P19: 100, P20: 138). Lead time has effectively stabilized at 3 periods, as noted in the carry-over insights and validated by recent shipment arrivals (P15-P17). Although the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time L=3 is more representative of the system performance. I will set L=3 explicitly. For mu_hat, I'll use the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture this higher-demand regime (P11-P20) which accounts for both the spikes and the stabilizing trend. Sigma_hat is set to the last 10 periods as well to account for the increased volatility seen in this most recent regime.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 595 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the lead time has stabilized to approximately 3 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrivals in P15, P16, and P17). The current pipeline contains orders from P17 (39 units), P18 (84 units), P19 (59 units), P20 (80 units), and P21 (134 units), plus a pending order from P22 that the backend will generate. Since the actual lead time is consistently 3, an 'explicit' L value of 3 is set to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the extended lead time (L+1 = 4 periods of protection). Demand has been in a high-volatility regime since Period 11, with an average of approximately 115 units over the last 10 periods (P11-P20). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (tracking the shift from Period 11) to capture this current regime while accounting for the high volatility in sigma_hat.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-depleted (on-hand: 0) due to a series of order arrivals lagging behind the increased demand regime. Analysis of the history shows that since Period 12, every shipment that has arrived has done so with a lead time of 3 periods (P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17). Orders from P17, P18, P19, P20, P21, and P22 totaling 439 units are still in transit and are expected to arrive in Periods 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25 respectively (based on L=3). However, we see in the 'Period 22 conclude' message that arrivals from P17, P18, and P19 are missing, which confirms a likely lead time of at least 3, and potentially longer or indicating a bottleneck. Since Period 11, demand has averaged approximately 110 units per period (if we exclude the Period 11 spike and reconcile lost sales estimates in P12, P13, P14, P21, and P22). To stabilize the service level given the Stock-Out, I am setting L=3 to account for the observed delay and using recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat to capture the 'High-Volatility/High-Average' regime that began around Period 11. This will raise the base stock target to cover the 4-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time has drifted back to at least 3 periods; orders from P17-P19 are currently overdue based on the previously observed L=3 stability.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we saw a sudden cluster arrival of orders from Periods 20, 21, and 22, with lead times of 3, 2, and 1 respectively. This follows a long gap where orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19 have not arrived and are now significantly overdue (7, 6, and 5 periods respectively). Given the history of lost shipments or extreme delays, I must assume the orders from P17-P19 are lost or will arrive so late they shouldn't be counted in current pipeline calculations. Demand has shifted: after a high-volatility regime from P11-P21 (avg ~130), the last two periods (P22, P23) show a sharp drop (86 and 53). However, to maintain a safe service level against recent history, I will use a recent_N of 13 to capture the modern demand regime starting from Period 11. For Lead Time, although it varies, '3' remains the most frequent actual lead time and safe buffer.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Periods 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 182 units) are highly likely lost or severely delayed (overdue by 5-7 periods), as more recent orders (P20-P22) have already arrived.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1776.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in a high-demand regime that began in Period 11, with demand averaging approximately 107 units over the last 14 periods (P11-P24). Inventory management is currently complex due to confirmed lost shipments from Periods 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 182 units), which are now 5-7 periods overdue, while orders from P20-P22 have already arrived. These lost units must be excluded from 'pipeline inventory' to avoid under-ordering. The OR engine calculates order quantities using (Base Stock - Pipeline Inventory). To account for the lost 182 units, I will artificially inflate the mu_hat (target stock) using the 'explicit' method. I am setting L to 3, as it is the most frequent recent actual lead time. My forecast for (L+1) periods (4 periods) of demand is approx 428 (107 * 4). Adding back the 182 lost units results in a mu_hat of 610. I am using recent_N (N=14) for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility from the latest demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments from P17, P18, P19 (182 units total) confirmed; they are bypassed by orders from P20, P21, P22. Demand regime remains high since P11 (avg ~107). Lead time volatility persists with a mode of 3.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current on-hand inventory is 51. The demand regime has stabilized since Period 11, with an average demand of approximately 107 units per period and significant volatility. Recent history shows that shipments from Periods 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 182 units) are permanently lost, as later orders have already arrived and concluded. I am adjusting the backend logic to account for a 'perceived' Lead Time (L) of 3, which is the most frequent actual lead time observed (mode 3). For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I am using the last 15 periods (starting from Period 11) to capture the current high-volatility regime (N=15). Sigma_hat is also set using the last 15 periods to ensure the inventory buffer accounts for the observed demand variance and the risk of lead-time instability.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the high-volatility state established since Period 11, with recent demand samples (P24-P26) showing 99, 54, and 92 respectively. The current on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 26. In-transit inventory is high (631 units), consisting of orders from P24 (24 units) and P25 (226 units), plus likely the balance of orders from P26 and older periods. Based on the Carry-Over Insights, orders from P17, P18, and P19 are confirmed lost, while more recent orders (P20-P22) arrived in Period 23 with lead times of 1-3. The current mode for lead time is 3. For OR parameters, I'm setting L=3 (explicit) to reflect the operational reality. For mu_hat, I use recent_N (N=16, from Period 11 to 26) to capture the current high-demand regime mean (~113 per period). This translates to (1+3)*113 = 452. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N to reflect the high volatility of the current regime. These parameters aim to replenish inventory to cover lead time demand while accounting for the high levels of in-transit stock.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (since Period 11) is significantly higher than the early phase, with an average demand of approximately 107 units per period and notable volatility. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), and there are 631 units in-transit. However, 182 units from Periods 17-19 are confirmed lost, which the OR backend's standard pipeline calculation does not account for. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering by counting these phantom units, I am adjusting L to 3 (the observed mode) and mu_hat to a value that reflects the demand regime since P11 (approx 107 * (1+3) = 428). Given the lost shipments, I use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=17 (P11 to P27) to capture the current high-demand regime. This keeps the base stock high enough to recover from the service level dip caused by lost stock.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the inventory state is critical: 0 units on-hand and 631 units in-transit. A review of recent 'conclude' messages indicates a recurring lead-time volatility. While the mode is L=3, several recent orders (P24, P25) are overdue if L=3 were reliable, similar to the lost shipments from P17-P19 confirmed in earlier insights. Specifically, the order from P24 (24 units) and P25 (226 units) have not arrived by P28. Demand since the regime shift at P11 has been volatile but averages approximately 107 units per period. The current 'In-transit' of 631 units includes these potentially delayed or lost orders. My goal is to ensure the base stock levels are calculated using a realistic lead time (L=3) and reflecting the current high-demand regime. Given the repeated stockouts (P26-P28), I will set L to 3 (explicit) and mu_hat to a recent_N of 18 (covering the high-demand regime starting P11) to stabilize the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Persistent stockouts (P26-P28) observed despite high in-transit quantities, confirming extreme lead-time unreliability or further lost shipments from P24-P25.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a history of lead-time unreliability and lost shipments (notably P17-P19). Recent demand (P26-P29) has averaged 85.5 units per period. In-transit inventory is high (631 units), but nothing has arrived for 6 periods (since P23), suggesting either multiple lost shipments or a severe extension in lead time beyond the typical 1-3 periods. Orders from P24 (24 units) and P25 (226 units) are now overdue if L=3. To force the OR backend to place a protection order and account for the high likelihood that current in-transit stock is lost or significantly delayed, I am setting L=4 (reflecting the current delay) and using the recent demand regime (N=19, since the shift at P11) to forecast. While in-transit is theoretically high, the engine subtracts it from the base stock; by increasing L and mu_hat, I aim to trigger a refill if the engine perceives the pipeline as insufficient to cover the extended lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time crisis: No arrivals observed for 6 consecutive periods (P24-P29), confirming that either shipments from P24-P25 are lost or the actual lead time has spiked to >6 periods. Current demand remains stable in the high-volatility regime (avg ~90).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a critical lead-time crisis with zero on-hand inventory and no arrivals for 7 consecutive periods (P24-P30). A total of 674 units are in-transit, but recent history (P17-P19) confirms the system is prone to lost shipments or extreme localized lead-time spikes. Period 30 data shows demand remains steady (102 units), and the high-volatility regime since Period 11 averages approximately 107 units per period. The 674 units in-transit (from orders in P24, P25, and P30) represent about 6 periods of average demand. Because the OR backend subtracts in-transit from the base stock calculation, setting L=2 (promised) would result in zero ordering. To force an order and mitigate the risk of these 674 units being lost (similar to the 182 units lost in P17-P19), I am setting L to 6 (the current delay duration). This increases the safety stock and mean demand requirements (1+L). I will forecast mu_hat using the last 20 samples (recent_N=20) to capture the current high-demand regime more accurately than the long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Critical lead-time instability: No arrivals observed for 7 consecutive periods (P24-P30), meaning orders from P24 and P25 are either lost or delayed significantly beyond the previous mode of 3.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe lead-time crisis. As of Period 32, there have been zero arrivals for 8 consecutive periods (P24-P31). Orders from P24-P25 (250 units total) and P30-P31 (214 units) are currently in-transit, but the stockout is ongoing with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure is significantly inflated by 182 units from Periods 17-19 which were previously identified as lost. To recover from this, I am setting an 'explicit' lead time L=5 to reflect the current supply chain blockage, although the actual delay for current pending orders is already exceeding that. Demand has remained relatively stable in the high-volatility regime since P11; the mean demand from the last 15 samples (P17-P31) is approximately 95 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture this recent demand behavior while extending the safety stock calculation to account for the heightened lead time (L=5). The backend will order to reach a base stock level covering 6 periods of demand (L+1), adjusted for the pipeline. Because the pipeline includes lost shipments, the OR engine might under-order; however, the 'cap' mechanism and the explicit L=5 setting should help push orders through.

Carry-over insight: Critical lead-time failure: 8 consecutive periods (P24-P31) with zero arrivals. Total in-transit (845) includes 182 units confirmed lost (P17-P19) and 250 units severely delayed (P24-P25).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, an arrival of 171 units (ordered in P31, L=1) finally broke an 8-period drought of arrivals, during which orders from P24 and P25 (total 250 units) failed to arrive. Following the pattern of P17-P19, these missing units from P24 and P25 are now considered lost. The lead time remains highly volatile, showing a sudden drop to L=1 for the most recent shipment after an extreme disruption. To protect against this instability and the confirmed loss of 432 cumulative units (P17-P19: 182, P24-P25: 250), I am setting L to 3 (the mode of reliable deliveries) and mu_hat using recent_N=20 to capture the current demand regime (avg ~96 per period). This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the risk of lost pipeline inventory and recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmation: Orders from Period 24 (24 units) and Period 25 (226 units) are confirmed lost, as they were bypassed by the Period 31 order which arrived in Period 32. Total confirmed lost units to date: 432.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-volatility demand regime (avg ~90-100 units/period since Period 11) with extreme lead-time unreliability. In Period 33, we confirmed that orders from Periods 24 and 25 (total 250 units) are lost because the Period 31 order arrived first. This brings the lifetime total of lost units to 432 (from P17-19 and P24-25). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The current in-transit (674) includes orders from P23 (0), P30 (43), and P31 (already arrived/0), but the history lists in-transit at 674 units. Subtracting the confirmed lost units (432) from the accounting of in-transit is necessary to ensure the OR backend places a new order. I will set L to 3 (the frequent mode) and mu_hat to a recent 5-period average (N=5) to capture the current demand level (~100/period). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of orders from Periods 24 and 25 (250 units) as P31 bypassed them; total lost units now 432. Demand remains table in the high-volatility regime (avg ~100) since P31.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reflects high demand volatility with an average around 100 units since Period 31. We are experiencing significant supply chain issues: 432 units have been confirmed lost (from P17-P19 and P24-P25). Another shipment from Period 30 (43 units) is now at its promised L=2/mode L=3 mark but hasn't arrived. Inventory is currently 0 with a high in-transit value of 674, but 432 of those are confirmed lost, leaving only 242 active units in the pipeline (from P30, P31, and potential new orders). To recover from the current stockout and account for the high lead-time volatility (range 1-3 periods), I will set L to 3. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=4 (P31-P34) to capture the current demand regime around 96 units/period. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for high variance observed in this regime (approx 25-30% of mean).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 30 order (43 units) is the next expected arrival; if it does not arrive by Period 36, it should be monitored for potential loss given the history of bypassed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with on-hand units at 0 and persistent stockouts. Historically, orders from Period 17-19 (182 units) and Period 24-25 (250 units) are confirmed lost through bypass events (P31 order arrived in P32). This reduces the effective 'In-transit' from 674 to 242 units (P30: 43, P36: unknown, plus any other recent orders). Demand has stabilized at an average of roughly 100 units since Period 31 (P31-35: 134, 80, 100, 69, 108). Lead time is extremely unreliable, but the mode for successful deliveries is 3 periods. To recover, I need to signal the OR backend that our pipeline is much smaller than it thinks due to the 432 lost units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current ~100 demand mean and 'explicit' for L=3 to account for the frequent delays. I set sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect the high volatility seen since the regime shift.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead-time environment is highly unstable: orders from Period 24 and 25 (250 units) are confirmed lost, and the order from Period 30 (43 units) is now five periods overdue, likely lost or severely delayed. The most recent arrival (P31 order arriving in P32) suggests that while some orders get through quickly (L=1), others vanish. To recover from this, I must account for the lost pipeline. The 'In-transit' figure of 674 is misleading because it includes confirmed lost units from P17-P19 (182 units) and P24-P25 (250 units), totaling 432 units that will never arrive. Effectively, the reliable pipeline is only 674 - 432 = 242 units. Demand has stabilized in a high-volatility regime since Period 11, averaging ~97 units over the last 10 periods. I will set L to 3 to reflect the historical mode, and use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level. By setting L=3, the OR backend's target base stock will increase, helping to compensate for the inventory gap and the high probability of further shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Order from Period 30 (43 units) is now 6 periods overdue and highly likely lost, following the pattern of P17-P19 and P24-P25. Total confirmed/highly-likely lost units in pipeline: 475 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Demand has stabilized in a high-volatility regime since Period 31, averaging approximately 96 units per period (P31-P37: 134, 80, 100, 69, 108, 102, 88). The lead-time situation is extremely unreliable. Significant portions of 'In-transit' inventory are confirmed or likely lost: P17-P19 (182 units), P24-P25 (250 units), and now P30 (43 units), totaling 475 ghost units. These units must be discounted from the pipeline. To recover, I'm setting L to 3 (the frequent historical mode) and using an 'explicit' mu_hat to account for the current demand level (~100/period) multiplied by (1+L), totaling 400. This should trigger the OR backend to place a substantial order to clear the deficit created by the lost shipments, while ensuring the cap does not overly restrict the recovery order.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total confirmed/highly-likely lost units in pipeline elevated to 475 (P17-19, P24-25, P30). The pipeline inventory signal is heavily decoupled from reality.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we are facing an inventory crisis. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit quantity is 674 units, but based on historical evidence, 475 of those units are almost certainly lost (P17-P19: 182 units; P24-P25: 250 units; P30: 43 units). These orders were bypassed by the P31 order, which arrived in P32. This means the 'effective' pipeline is only 199 units (the P31 order was already delivered, so remaining in-transit must be from P32+ orders if any, but the history shows no orders placed since P31 until now). However, the system says 674 in-transit. Subtracting the 475 confirmed lost gives 199 units, which matches the P31 order (171) plus some discrepancy, but P31 already arrived. Wait, look at in-transit: Orders were placed in P31 (171) which arrived. No orders were placed P32-P38. The 674 in-transit must be the sum of 182 (P17-19) + 24 (P24) + 226 (P25) + 43 (P30) + 199 (Wait, P31 arrived). Actually, the 674 likely represents all units never marked 'concluded'. Since arrivals have stopped completely since P32, and demand is steady around 100, I must place a large order to restart the flow. I will use L=explicit=3 to reflect the mode lead time, and mu_hat=explicit to cover 4 periods (L+1) at a rate of ~100 units/period (400 total), plus a buffer for volatility. Setting sigma_hat=explicit to handle the high volatility seen since P11.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is currently in a state of failure due to significant lost shipments and prolonged stockouts. On-hand inventory is 0, and the demand has been unmet for 6 consecutive periods (P34-P39). The 'In-transit' quantity of 674 units is misleading because 475 units are confirmed or highly likely lost (P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P30). Specifically, orders from P31 arrived at P32, effectively bypassing everything placed between P17 and P30. Demand since P31 has stabilized around an average of 92 units per period. Since L=2 is the promised lead time and the recent delivery (P31 to P32) was L=1, but historical mode is L=3, I will set L to 3 to be safe. I will use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat to capture the post-P31 demand stability (avg ~92). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N to account for the consistent volatility in this regime. Because the backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, and the pipeline inventory is 'inflated' by 475 lost units, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to artificially inflate the target stock level, effectively 'ordering through' the ghost inventory. Target Base Stock should roughly be (L+1)*Demand = 4*92 = 368. However, since the OR engine sees 674 in transit, it will order 0 unless the base stock is > 674. To force an order that covers immediate needs plus a buffer, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that results in a base stock significantly higher than the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed supply chain 'phantom inventory' effect; 475 units in the 674 in-transit units are confirmed/highly likely lost (P17-P19, P24-P25, P30). The system requires explicit parameter inflation to bypass these ghost units in the OR calculation.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing significant 'phantom inventory'. Of the 983 units currently 'in-transit', 475 units are confirmed or highly likely lost (P17-P19: 182 units; P24-P25: 250 units; P30: 43 units), as they have been bypassed by later orders (e.g., the P31 order arrived in P32). Demand has stabilized in a high-volatility regime with an average of ~100 units per period (P31-P40 avg is 94.6). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the high (but fake) pipeline inventory, I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The 'phantom' inventory of 475 units needs to be countered. By setting mu_hat = (1+L) * Mean + Phantom_Correction, where L=3 and Mean=100 (Expected Demand over L+1 = 400), I will set mu_hat to 875. This signals to the OR engine that it needs to cover the demand plus the missing units it incorrectly assumes are coming. Sigma_hat is set based on recent high volatility (std dev ~22).

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Phantom inventory confirmed at 475 units (P17-P19, P24-P25, P30). The OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation is decoupled from actual expected arrivals.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face a massive 'phantom inventory' crisis. Currently, In-transit shows 983 units, but 475 of these (from Periods 17-19, 24-25, and 30) are confirmed or highly likely lost, as later orders (like the one from P31) have already arrived and been consumed. The OR engine subtracts all 983 in-transit units from its target base stock, leading to zero-order recommendations despite a current on-hand of 0 and consistent demand. To force the backend to place orders and bypass this ghost inventory, I am setting L to 3 (the observed mode) and mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. Demand has stabilized around ~100 units/period since Period 31. To offset the 475 lost units, I am inflating mu_hat. Base stock is roughly (1+L)*demand. With L=3, target is ~400 units. To overcome the -983 pipeline deduction, mu_hat must be significantly higher than the actual demand forecast to trigger any replenishment. I am setting mu_hat to 1400 to ensure the backend sees a requirement that exceeds the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Phantom inventory remains at 475 units. Re-stocking only triggered by explicit parameter inflation to bypass ghost units in the pipeline logic.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from 'phantom inventory' where the OR engine's pipeline inventory (1367 units) includes 475 units confirmed or highly likely lost (P17-19, P24-25, P30). With on-hand inventory at 0 and multiple periods of stockouts, the priority is to override the backend's capped policy and ensure a new order is triggered to meet current demand. Recent demand (P31-P42) averages ~100 units per period. To offset the 475 phantom units and ensure the OR logic places a 'catch-up' order, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 2100. This represents a desired base stock that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand (approx 400-500 units) plus an buffer to neutralize the 1367 in-transit 'ghost' units, forcing the system to recognize a real deficit. L is set to explicit 3 based on historical mode, and sigma_hat is maintained at a high explicit level to reflect the massive supply variance.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we see that the order from Period 40 (309 units) arrived in Period 43, confirming an actual lead time (L) of 3 periods. The 'phantom inventory' issue remains critical: currently, in-transit inventory is 1830 units, but 518 units are confirmed or highly likely lost (P17-19: 182 units, P24-25: 250 units, P30: 43 units, P31: already arrived; previous total 475 plus checking the next expected). Specifically, orders from P17-P30 are clearly bypassed or lost. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the inflated 'pipeline' (which includes these ghost units), I will continue to use the 'explicit' method. Demand since Period 31 has averaged approximately 100 units per period. With L=3, the review + lead time window is 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to 1200 effectively tells the OR engine we need 1200 units to cover the window, forcing an order because (base_stock - phantom_adjusted_in_transit) will finally trigger a positive value against the current on-hand (232) and remaining 'real' in-transit (~1312). This compensates for the ~518 lost units currently polluting the pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Phantom inventory (lost shipments) confirmed at 518 units (P17-P19, P24-P25, P30). Lead time for successful deliveries remains stable at 3 periods (confirmed by P40 order arrival).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 31 has stabilized with an average of approximately 100 units per period (P31-P44 average is ~99.4). Lead time for successful deliveries remains consistent at 3 periods (as seen with the Period 40 order arriving in Period 43). However, the system faces a significant 'phantom inventory' problem: 475 units from Periods 17-19, 24-25, and 30 are confirmed or highly likely lost, yet they remain in the OR engine's 'in-transit' calculation. Additionally, a large speculative order of 772 units was placed in P43, which is expected in P46. With 138 units on-hand and 1830 in-transit (of which 518 are likely lost), the 'real' pipeline is roughly 1312 units. This far exceeds the required base stock for a 3-period lead time at 100 units/period (approx 400-500 units). I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand regime and 'explicit' for L=3 to match the confirmed delivery speed. No new order will be triggered because the real pipeline (1312) plus on-hand (138) is much higher than the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Sustained 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments) total 518 units (P17-19, P24-25, P30, P31). Successful deliveries (e.g., P40) confirm a stable lead time of 3 periods despite earlier volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $806.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing a complex inventory situation with significant 'phantom inventory'. Historical data confirms that 518 units in the in-transit pipeline (from P17-19, P24-25, P30, P31) are lost or permanently delayed. Currently, we have 1189 units on-hand after receiving 1156 units in P45 (orders from P42 and P43). Recent demand has stabilized in a high-volatility regime with an average of approximately 101 units over the last 15 periods (since P31). Although the promised lead time is 2, successful deliveries (P40, P42, P43) consistently show an actual lead time of 2-3 periods. Since our currently on-hand inventory (1189) is very high relative to expected demand (~101/period), we do not need to order more. The OR backend's logic would subtract the remaining in-transit units (674 total - 1189 on hand is already plenty) from the base stock. Given we are at Period 46 of 50, we must prioritize minimizing holding costs for the final periods while maintaining enough stock to cover the remaining ~4 periods. With 1189 units on hand and 4 periods left, we have roughly 11.7 times the required stock. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are placed (keeping L at default and using recent_N for demand to maintain a realistic forecast).

Daily Profit: $1197.00, Daily Holding Cost: $1126.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 47. On-hand inventory is high (1126 units) following the arrival of large orders from P42 and P43 (totaling 1156 units) in Period 45. These arrivals confirm that the lead time for successful shipments has stabilized at approximately 2 to 3 periods. However, the 'phantom inventory' issue remains critical for the OR backend's calculation: 518 units in the 'In-transit' figure (674 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost (specifically orders from P17-P19, P24-P25, P30, and P31). Since the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock to determine the order quantity, it will under-order as long as these 'ghost' units persist. However, with 1126 units on hand and only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), and an average demand of ~100 units/period, we have more than enough stock to cover all remaining demand without further ordering. The goal now is to minimize holding costs. I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are placed, effectively allowing the on-hand inventory to deplete.

Carry-over insight: End-of-game strategy: On-hand inventory (1126) is sufficient to cover all remaining demand (approx. 400 units) for periods 47-50. No further ordering required.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1434.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the game (Period 48 of 50). Current on-hand inventory is 998 units. Recent demand has been stable in a high-volatility regime with an average of approximately 100 units per period (P43-P47: 77, 94, 105, 63, 128; Mean = 93.4). With only 3 periods of demand remaining (P48, P49, P50) and a conservative forecast of ~130 units per period, total remaining demand is roughly 390 units. Current on-hand inventory (998) is more than double the maximum expected remaining demand. Any further orders would only increase holding costs without contributing to profit, as the game ends at Period 50. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are placed by the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1102.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the game (Period 49 of 50). Current on-hand inventory is 893 units, which is significantly higher than any projected demand for the remaining two periods. Historical demand during this high-volatility regime has averaged approximately 100 units per period (max observed around 134 in recent periods). With only two periods left (P49 and P50), the maximum total demand expected is around 300 units. Carrying any more inventory will only incur unnecessary holding costs of $1.0/unit. Therefore, we set parameters to 0 to ensure the OR backend does not place any new orders, as we have more than enough stock to satisfy all remaining customers.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the final period (Period 50). The current on-hand inventory is 802 units. Historical demand since the stabilization in Period 31 has averaged approximately 97 units per period. With only one period of demand remaining (Period 50), the current inventory is more than sufficient to cover all possible demand. No further orders are necessary to maximize total reward, as any additional units ordered would only incur holding costs or arrive after the game ends. Parameters are set to maintain the 'no order' status while reflecting current demand statistics.
