The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive in Period 3 (after Period 3's decision phase) and be available for sale starting then. To maximize reward, I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 periods) to ensure stock is available as soon as possible, factoring in that Period 1 and 2 demand will be lost since I start with 0 stock. I will target a stock level that covers roughly 3 periods of average demand (approx 280 units) to establish a pipeline, while being mindful that since current on-hand is 0, Periods 1 and 2 will experience stockouts.",

Looking at historical demand (P1: 143, P2: 103, P3: 39, P4: 81, P5: 99), the mean demand for 'chips(Regular)' is approximately 93 units per period. The Period 1 demand in the game history was 38 units, which is lower than the historical sample mean but within a reasonable range. Since the current lead time pipeline (L+1 = 3 periods) should cover demand for Periods 2, 3, and 4, I need to ensure total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) meets this target. Target = 93 units/period * 3 periods = 279 units. We currently have 280 units in transit.

Arrival data in Period 4 shows mixed results: Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods (late), while Period 3 order arrived in 1 period (early). This signals high lead time volatility. d) Inventory: On-hand is 320. In-transit consists of orders from Period 2 (100 units) and Period 4 (80 units).

  "rationale": "The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' over periods 37-41 (84, 55, 118, 138, 62) averages approximately 91 units per period, showing high variance but a stable mean consistent with the previous regime of ~95 units. The primary operational challenge continues to be severe and frequent order loss. As of Period 42, the system reports 880 units 'In-transit'. Based on cumulative carry-over insights, 690 of these units are confirmed or highly likely lost: P2(100), P6(40), P15(140), P17(40), P29(100), P30(70), and P37(100). The P40 order (100 units) is now 2 periods old and has not arrived; while not yet confirmed lost (max lead time is 3), it is under observation. The P41 order (120 units) is also in transit. This leaves a 'reliable' pipeline of 220 units (P40, P41). With On-hand inventory at 23, the total reliable inventory is 243 units. To cover at least 3 periods of demand at the 95-unit average (approx 285 units) plus a safety buffer for potential losses, I will order 120 units to maintain a robust incoming stream.",
