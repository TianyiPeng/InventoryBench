Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have minimal historical demand data (5 samples) and no replenishment history. The lead time is promised as 2 periods. Given holding costs equal profit ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand to minimize total costs. I will use the default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat because we lack sufficient evidence of regime shifts or lead time variations at this stage. The mu_hat calculation will incorporate the promised Lead Time (2) and the mean of the 5 historical demand samples (approx 93), resulting in a base stock level calculation for 3 periods (L+1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 156 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude (read at the start of Period 4). Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 156 in-transit. Historical demand over the first 5 periods (including those provided in the snapshot) shows values of 143, 103, 39, 81, and 99. However, the game history for Period 1 shows a demand of only 3 units. This suggests a significant discrepancy between the provided historical samples and the actual demand encountered in the start of the game. Given the high volatility and the need to establish a baseline, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since only 1 period of live data is available (demand=3) but 5 historical samples were provided (avg ~93), I will set N=5 to encompass the known history while anticipating the system will adjust as more live data arrives. I'll maintain the default Lead Time of 2.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time is 2 periods. Looking at the history, an order of 156 units was placed in Period 1. Based on the lead time definition (Lead Time = 2), this order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclusion (which I will read at the start of Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the arrivals haven't happened yet. In-transit inventory is 195 (156 from P1 + 39 from P2). Historical demand samples are [143, 103, 39, 81, 99]. The actual demand observed in the 'conclude' messages for P1 (3) and P2 (17) is significantly lower than the historical samples provided in the prompt (143, 103). This suggests a potential regime shift or that the sample data represents a different context. Given the high volatility and the fact that we have 195 units in the pipeline against low recent demand, I will use a conservative approach. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent samples, while keeping the lead time at the default promised value until we confirm actual arrival times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. No shipments have arrived yet. Based on a promised lead time of 2 periods, the order placed in Period 1 (156 units) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have missed demand for three consecutive periods (Total demand: 3+17+81=101; Total sold: 0), we are currently in a stockout. The sample demand data provided (143, 103, 39, 81, 99) shows significant variance compared to the actual demand experienced in the first 3 periods (3, 17, 81). There is an upward trend in observed demand (3 -> 17 -> 81). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the mean of the provided historical samples (avg=93) while the 'recent_N' logic for mu_hat also incorporates the (1+L) factor, helping to build a buffer against the current stockout and the longer lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first arrival: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4, indicating an actual lead time of 3 periods, which is longer than the promised 2 periods. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable but shows fluctuation (143, 103, 39, 81, 99). Note: The 'demand' in the game history (3, 17, 81, 95) represents actually recorded demand after arrivals/stockouts, which slightly differs from the provided samples. Given the lead time drift from 2 to 3, I am adjusting L to 3 using the explicit method. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, since the demand pattern is still establishing and there's high volatility relative to the mean, I will use recent_N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current mean (~93) and variance. Lead time extension to 3 means we need to cover (3+1)=4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed as 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived at start of Period 4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are facing a stockout with 0 units on-hand. The history shows a demand mean of approximately 93 units/period over the last 5 periods (143, 103, 39, 81, 99 provided in samples; actual realized demands: 3, 17, 81, 95, 114). The promised lead time is 2, but the only concluded order (placed Period 1) arrived in Period 4, confirming an actual lead time of 3 periods. In-transit inventory is 175 (orders from P2=39, P4=30, P5=106). Since lead time is likely 3, we expect the P2 order (39 units) to arrive during P5's resolution (visible next) and the P4 order (30 units) during P7. Total pipeline covers some demand but we need to increase parameters to account for the longer lead time (L=3) and ensure sufficient inventory for the (L+1)=4 period window. I will set L to 3 explicitly and use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the recent upward trend.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 248 units in transit. Looking at the history, the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (actual lead time = 3). The orders from Period 2 (39 units), Period 4 (30 units), Period 5 (106 units), and Period 6 (73 units) are still in transit. If the lead time is consistently 3 periods, we expect the Period 2 order (39 units) to arrive during Period 5 conclude (which it didn't) or Period 6 conclude (which it didn't). This suggests either lead time variability or a lost shipment for the Period 2 order. Demand has shown a significant shift: Periods 1-3 averaged ~33, while Periods 4-6 jumped to ~95. I will use recent_N=3 for demand parameters to capture this higher mean (~95) and volatility. For lead time, I'll use explicit=3 based on the confirmed observation from the Period 1 shipment, as the promised lead time of 2 is currently unreliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: average demand increased from ~34 to ~95.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical data shows two major shifts: 1) The actual lead time is consistently 3 periods, not the promised 2 (P1 arrived P4, P4 arrived P7). 2) A demand regime shift occurred at Period 4, jumping from an average of ~34 (P1-P3: 3, 17, 81 - though P3 was a surge) to ~95 (P4-P7: 95, 114, 76, 77). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 345 units in-transit. Because the lead time is 3, decisions made now cover demand for Period 8, 9, 10, and 11 (L+1 = 4 periods). I am setting L to explicit value 3 to align with observed actual lead time. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=4 to capture the current higher demand regime (avg ~90.5). For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=4 to capture the current volatility since the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods across multiple deliveries (P1->P4, P4->P7). Demand regime stabilized at ~90 units/period since Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-17.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the on-hand inventory is 125 units with 129 units in-transit. Reviewing the lead time history: Period 1 (L=3), Period 4 (L=3), Period 5 (L=3), and Period 7 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations suggest high variability with a mode of 3. I will use L=3 to be safe. Regarding demand: a regime shift was identified at Period 4. The samples from Period 4 to 8 are: 95, 114, 76, 77, 108. The mean of these 5 samples is 94. Since the backend calculates mu_hat as (1+L) * mean, and I set L=3, the mu_hat will represent demand for 4 periods (~376 units). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5 (q=0.5), meaning the base stock level will target the median of the demand distribution. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the post-shift demand levels accurately while L=recent_N (using default recent_N=3 for lead times) adjusts for the observed delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Lead time highly variable (observed L=3 and L=1); demand regime stable at approx 94 units/period (N=5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 54 and pipeline inventory is 234. Reviewing lead times, we see significant variability: initial orders (P1, P4, P5) arrived with L=3, while recent orders (P7, P8) arrived with L=1. To protect against the longer observed lead time and ensure service levels, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 periods. For demand, the regime shifted at Period 4. The average demand from Period 4 to Period 9 (last 6 samples: 95, 114, 76, 77, 108, 88) is approximately 93 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand regime since the changepoint. This approach ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover (3+1) periods of demand at the current average rate and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Recent: P7 and P8 both L=1, prior L=3). Demand stable at ~93 units since Period 4.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the inventory situation is critical as on-hand stock is 0. Demand has stabilized at a high regime starting from Period 4. Calculating the mean demand from Period 4 to Period 10 (7 periods), the average is approximately 97.7 units per period. The lead time is significantly volatile: we have observed L=3 (P1, P4, P5 arrivals) and L=1 (P7, P8 arrivals). The promised lead time is 2, but the actual experience is an average of 2.2 periods. To protect against stockouts given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the recent volatility, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use recent_N with N=7 (capturing the regime since P4) to reflect the current mean of ~98. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=7 to capture the variance in this high-demand period.

In Period 12, the system shows zero on-hand inventory and 391 units in-transit. Demand since Period 4 has stabilized at an average of 98.6 units per period (sample: 95, 114, 76, 77, 108, 88, 125, 107). Lead time remains the primary source of volatility, showing values of 3, 3, 3, 1, and 1 across the last five observed arrivals. Because the pipeline is quite full (391 units, which is ~4 periods of current demand) and holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0), over-ordering carries significant risk. I will use a lead time of 2 (the promised value and middle ground of observed volatility) and base my demand forecast on the last 8 periods (the current stable regime). For sigma, I'll use the same 8-period window to capture the recent demand variance accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 4 at ~99 units/period. Lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 3 periods and 1 period.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 4, with a mean demand of approximately 99 units per period (Periods 4-12). Recent demand (Period 12) was 82. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this stable post-shift regime. Lead time remains highly volatile, showing values of 1, 2, and 3 periods in recent history (P8: L=1, P9: L=1, P10: L=3, P11: L=2, P12: L=3). Given this uncertainty and the 2-period promised lead time, I will set L to 2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering during periods of short lead times, while the OR backend's safety stock logic (sigma_hat) will help buffer against the variability. Current on-hand is 124 with 185 in transit (from P11 and P12), totaling 309, which covers roughly 3 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: observed lead times of 1, 2, and 3 periods (average ~2) over the last 5 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around ~99 units per period since Period 4. In the most recent periods (P12-P13), demand was 82 and 100, which aligns with this average. Lead time (L) remains highly volatile, showing recent values of 3, 1, 1, 3, and 2 periods (average 2.0). However, reflecting the underlying shift and volatility, I will use an explicit L of 2.1 to provide a slight buffer against the frequently occurring L=3 arrivals. For demand forecasting, I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the post-shift regime (since Period 4). Sigma_hat is calculated using the same N to capture the fluctuation in demand. The goal is to maintain a service level that manages this lead-time uncertainty given the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0/unit).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (since Period 4) remains stable, with the average demand over the last 11 periods being approximately 99 units. Lead times continue to be highly volatile, with the last 5 observed lead times being 3, 1, 1, 3, and 2 periods (averaging approximately 2 epochs). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 205 units in-transit (93 from P14 and 112 from previous unscheduled arrivals). With profit and holding costs being equal, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially (1+L) * mean. To account for lead-time volatility and the current stockout, I will use an explicit L of 2.0 (consistent with recent average and carry-over insights) and set mu_hat based on the last 11 periods (recent_N=11) to capture the current demand regime. Sigma_hat will also be set based on the same 11-period window to capture current volatility.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of ~102 units/period since Period 4 (calculated over 12 periods: avg=101.6). Lead times are highly volatile, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods (average is roughly 2.1). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 15, and there are 300 units in-transit (from orders in P14, P15, and previously unfulfilled amounts). Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which the base stock policy naturally targets by minimizing the difference between base stock and pipeline inventory. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability, and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the stabilized regime since Period 4. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 4: Mean demand is ~101.6 units/period (N=12 samples). Lead time remains volatile, ranging between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation for chips(Regular) shows 0 on-hand inventory and 373 units in-transit. The demand has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 4, with a mean of approximately 101.6 units per period. The lead time is the primary source of volatility, showing values of 1, 2, and 3 periods in recent history (averaging 2 periods). Currently, orders from Period 14 (93 units), Period 15 (95 units), and Period 16 (73 units) are pending. Since the promised lead time is 2, the order from Period 14 is expected to arrive during Period 16 or 17. To manage this high volatility in lead time while demand remains stable, I am setting L to 2 (the promised and recent average) and using N=12 for demand estimation (covering the stable regime from Period 4 to 16, which is 13 samples, but N is capped or chosen based on recent stability). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) demand window (300+ units), considering the 373 already in pipeline.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 4, with a mean demand of approximately 101.6 units per period. The most recent demand in Period 17 was lower (61 units), but there's no evidence yet of a sustained downward shift, so I will continue to use the statistics from the stable regime (N=14 periods since P4). Regarding lead time, it remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods without a clear predictable pattern. The recent sequences (3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1) average to approximately 2.0 periods. Given the high stockout risk seen in history (ending on-hand inventory frequently hits 0) and the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($1), the OR engine needs to balance service levels carefully. I'm setting L to 2 (recent average) and using recent_N for mu and sigma to capture the current stable demand regime (P4-P17).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 4, with a mean demand of approximately 98.4 units per period (N=15 samples from Period 4 to 18). Lead time remains volatile, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods (average is roughly 2.1). Therefore, using the 'calculate' method for lead time effectively captures the average behavior of this volatile supply chain. For forecasting demand (mu_hat), I will use N=15 to align with the start of the current demand regime at Period 4. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=15 to capture the volatility within this consistent regime. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (28) but pipeline inventory is robust (262), including a large order of 95 units from Period 15 and 73 units from Period 16, which are likely to arrive in the next 1-2 periods given historical patterns.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (since Period 4) remains stable around 95-100 units/period (mean of last 16 periods is ~96.5). However, lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Recent observations: P14 arrived at P17 (L=3), P16 arrived at P17 (L=1)). The 'promised' lead time is 2, and the average observed lead time is approximately 2.3. Currently, there are 330 units in-transit (orders from P15, P18, P19) and 0 on-hand. The total pipeline of 330 units covers approximately 3.4 periods of demand, which is sufficient given the maximum observed lead time of 3. I will set L to 2 (promised/average) and use the stable regime mean for mu_hat (N=16) and sigma_hat (N=16) to calculate the base stock requirements effectively, allowing the OR backend to handle the current stock-out through the pipeline inventory calculation.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 330 units in transit. Historical lead times for chips(Regular) have been highly volatile, recorded as 1, 2, or 3 periods (Average = 2). The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 4, with a slight upward trend in recent samples (Period 20 demand was 147). Analyzing the samples from Period 4 through 20 (N=17), the average demand is approximately 101 units. To account for the volatile lead time and recent demand spike, I will set L to the calculated average lead time and mu_hat using recent_N for the last 15 periods to capture the post-Period 4 regime accurately. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the observed volatility in this regime.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Two orders placed in Periods 15 (95 units) and 18 (55 units) are currently overdue relative to the promised lead time of 2, having reached L=6 and L=3 respectively. Historically, the lead time has been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, but the absence of the Period 15 order (6 periods since order) suggests possible loss or extreme delay. However, since the game mechanism keeps 'lost' items in transit, I must account for them. Demand has been relatively stable since Period 4, with a recent mean of approximately 95 units (last 18 periods). I will set L to 3 (the observed upper bound of 'normal' volatility) to increase the protected inventory level. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=18 to capture the stable regime starting at Period 4, which ensures the OR backend uses the current mean/variance while factoring in the expanded (1+L) window.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Order from Period 15 (95 units) has exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods (currently at L=6), suggesting a potential lost shipment or severe disruption.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and facing a supply chain disruption. The order from Period 15 (95 units) is now 7 periods late, suggesting it is a lost shipment. Additionally, orders from Periods 18, 19, 21, and 22 have not yet arrived. The promised lead time is 2, but actual history shows high volatility (1 to 3 periods). Given the current 'In-transit' of 388 units, which includes the likely lost 95 units, the effective pipeline is 293 units. Demand has remained relatively stable since Period 4, with a slight increase in mean; N=19 (from P4 to P22) gives a mean of approximately 98.7 units. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed maximum lead time and provide a buffer. mu_hat will use N=19 for the stabilized regime. sigma_hat will also use N=19 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Shipment from Period 15 is officially considered lost (7 periods elapsed, max L seen is 3). Pipeline inventory should be adjusted by -95 units to account for this loss.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 4, with a mean demand of approximately 101.5 units and a standard deviation around 30. Recent demand in Period 23 spiked to 169 units, but without clear calendar drivers, it's treated as high-variance noise within the existing regime. Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2). We have accounted for the loss of the shipment from Period 15 (95 units). The backend's current pipeline calculation likely still includes this lost shipment; by setting L=3 (explicit), we account for the worst-case observed transit time to ensure sufficient coverage. We use recent_N with N=20 to capture the stable demand regime starting from Period 4. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 ensures the OR backend uses data from the current regime while ignoring the low-demand initialization phase (Periods 1-3).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 4 has stabilized around a mean of ~102 units/period, despite high variance (recent demand has ranged from 46 to 169). The prompt indicates total in-transit is 402, but historical analysis confirms the shipment from Period 15 (95 units) is lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 402 - 95 = 307. Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2 (matching the promised lead time). Given we are currently stock-out (on-hand = 0), I will set L to the promised lead time of 2, and use recent_N (N=20 to cover the post-change stable period) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current regime's demand and volatility. The OR engine's service level (base stock) will be calculated based on the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, which targets a 50% service level; however, the pipeline inventory management must account for the lost stock to trigger an appropriate order size.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable since Period 4, with a mean around 101 units per period. Recent samples (P20-P25) show high volatility (ranging from 46 to 169) but confirm the level. I've set N=10 for mu_hat (approx 103/period) and sigma_hat to capture this recent variation. Lead time is highly volatile (1-3 periods). Most critically, inventory is currently 0 with a large in-transit pipeline of 402 units. However, we've already confirmed that the shipment from P15 (95 units) is lost. To account for this in the OR engine, I am using 'explicit' L=3 to ensure a higher base stock that considers the 3-period lead time risk. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline from base_stock, and the pipeline includes a 'ghost' lost shipment, I must widen the buffer or use a slightly longer L to protect against current stockouts.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 402 units in-transit. The demand regime has been stable since Period 4, with a mean of approximately 104 units per period over the last 20 periods (N=20). The order from Period 15 (95 units) is confirmed lost, so the backend's effective pipeline calculation (402 total - 95 lost = 307) must be considered. Lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2). To prevent stockouts during this period of zero on-hand inventory, I am setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat centered on the recent regime (N=20), and sigma_hat based on the same period to account for recent variability. The high in-transit amount (307 effective) relative to the base stock will likely result in a small or zero order this period from the OR engine, which is appropriate given the large volume of pending arrivals.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is currently critical with 0 units on-hand and high demand (Period 27 demand was 145). The 'In-transit' quantity is 402 units, but this includes a confirmed lost shipment of 95 units from Period 15. Adjusting for this, the effective pipeline is 307 units. The system is currently waiting for orders placed in Periods 18 (55 units), 19 (68 units), 24 (72 units), and subsequent recent orders if any (though history shows 0 orders from P25-P27). Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an observed average around 2. Demand since Period 4 has stabilized into a higher regime with a mean of approximately 101 units per period. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 0.50 (balanced stockouts vs holding). I will use N=24 for mu_hat (dating back to the start of the current demand regime at P4) to capture the long-term stable mean of ~101 units. For lead time, 'calculate' is used to capture the average of the fluctuating performance. For sigma_hat, N=24 is used to account for recent demand volatility.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Reviewing the history, demand remains stable around 100-110 units per period, but lead times are highly variable and shipments are frequently delayed or lost. Specifically, the order from Period 15 (95 units) is confirmed lost, and several subsequent orders (P18: 55 units, P19: 68 units, P24: 72 units) have now exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods (P18 is at L=11, P19 at L=10, P24 at L=5). These orders are likely lost. The current pipeline inventory (402) is heavily inflated by these 'ghost' units. To force the OR engine to place a recovery order despite the inflated pipeline, I will set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' high value. Based on the regime of ~102 units/period, a standard (L+1) baseline for L=2 (promised) or L=3 (observed max) would be ~300-400. However, because the backend subtracts the pipeline (402), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order that covers immediate demand plus safety stock, effectively bypassing the stuck pipeline. I am using mu_hat=650 to ensure an order of roughly 200-250 units is placed to break the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 18 (55 units), Period 19 (68 units), and Period 24 (72 units) are now considered lost as they have exceeded L=3. Total estimated lost units in current pipeline: 55+68+72+95(previously lost) = 290 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a severe inventory crisis with zero on-hand units and high lost demand. Analysis of history confirms that orders from Periods 15, 18, 19, and 24 are lost (total 290 units), as they haven't arrived within the observed max lead time of 3 periods. The current 'In-transit' of 639 units contains these 290 lost units, making the 'effective' pipeline 349. Demand since Period 4 has remained stable with a mean of ~102 units and a standard deviation of ~30. However, the OR engine is blind to these losses and thinks the pipeline is full, preventing it from ordering enough. To force the engine to replenish despite the 'phantom' inventory, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the gap. The target inventory level (base stock) needs to cover L+1 periods (roughly 4 periods) of demand. 4 periods * 102 demand/period = 408 units. Since the OR engine calculates order = max(0, base_stock - pipeline), and it sees a pipeline of 639, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that exceeds this pipeline. I will set mu_hat to 850 (covering about 8 periods of demand) to ensure the backend generates a significant order (approx 200+ units) to recover from the stockout. Lead time L is set to 3 to reflect the realistic upper bound of successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Pipeline reconciliation confirms total lost units = 290 (Orders from P15, P18, P19, P24). Effective pipeline at start of P30 is 349 (639-290).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the system is facing a severe inventory shortage with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical analysis confirms a stable demand regime since Period 4, averaging approximately 100 units per period. Lead times are highly volatile (ranging 1-3 periods) and shipments are frequently lost (P15, P18, P19, and P24 are confirmed lost). The 'In-transit' figure of 850 units includes these lost shipments. According to Carry-over Insights from Period 30, 290 units are total lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 850 - 290 = 560 units. This effective pipeline still seems high, but since we are at 0 on-hand and have experienced multiple lost shipments, I will set mu_hat using the last 20 periods (capturing the stabilized demand regime since P4) and keep L at 3 periods to account for the upper end of the volatile lead time. This conservative service level approach via the OR backend helps mitigate the risk of further stockouts due to lost or delayed orders.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently recovering from a series of lost shipments (P15, P18, P19, P24), which severely depleted on-hand inventory. The current pipeline (In-transit) is 850 units, but this includes the 290 units identified as irrevocably lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 560 units (850 - 290). Demand remains stable in the regime established at P4, currently averaging ~100 units/period (last 20 periods mean is ~98.6). Lead time is highly volatile but averages 2 periods (min 1, max 3). To ensure recovery and cover for the volatile lead time, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=20 to capture the current regime stability) and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability. With on-hand at 0 and demand high, the OR engine will use these parameters to maintain a sufficient base stock to refill the pipeline and restore service levels.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 32, effective pipeline reconciliation excludes 290 units (P15, P18, P19, P24). Demand regime since P4 is stable with a mean of ~100 units/period and lead time variability persists between 1-3 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 4 with a mean of approximately 100 units/period and a standard deviation around 25-30 units. Lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. A major concern is the loss of 290 units from orders placed in Periods 15, 18, 19, and 24, which have not arrived and are considered lost. The total in-transit quantity is 850 units, but after subtracting the confirmed lost units, the effective pipeline is 560 units (850 - 290). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To provide protection against lead time variance (up to L=3) and ensure availability for the current and future periods (L+1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20 to capture the stable regime since P4) to reflect the ~100 mean demand. The L is set to explicit 3 to account for the upper end of the observed lead time volatility, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover the maximum expected delay.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total pipeline loss remains 290 units (P15, P18, P19, P24). Effective pipeline is current 'In-transit' minus 290. Demand remains stable ~100 units/period since P4.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 4, with a mean of approximately 100 units per period. Lead times have historically fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, although there has been a significant disruption in deliveries recently. Specifically, 290 units from orders in Periods 15, 18, 19, and 24 are confirmed lost as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. The current 'In-transit' of 850 units includes these 290 lost units, making the effective pipeline 560 units. These effective units come from large orders placed in Period 29 (237 units) and Period 30 (211 units), which are currently at L=5 and L=4 respectively; given the historical volatility and recent drought, these orders are late but not yet confirmed lost compared to the P15-P24 group. Setting mu_hat to a recent average (N=20) captures the stable ~100 unit demand. Setting L to 3 (the upper bound of historical lead time) helps the OR engine account for the longer turnaround times observed, while sigma_hat is set to the recent standard deviation to handle volatility.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory remains at 0. Since Period 4, the demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable with a mean of approximately 100 units per period. Lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting an average lead time of 2 should be used for the policy. Pipeline reconciliation is complex: according to carry-over insights, 290 units from orders in Periods 15, 18, 19, and 24 are officially considered lost. Additionally, orders from P29 (237 units) and P30 (211 units) are now at L=6 and L=5 respectively; given that the maximum observed lead time for successful deliveries is 3, these are likely lost as well. If P29 and P30 are lost, the total lost pipeline increases to 290 + 237 + 211 = 738 units. With current 'In-transit' at 850, the effective pipeline is only 112 units (representing recent orders that are not yet overdue). To recover from the stockout and account for the significant pipeline depletion via losses, I am using 'recent_N' for demand (N=30 to cover the stable regime since P4) and an 'explicit' lead time L=2. This will trigger the OR backend to place a substantial order to cover the (L+1) period demand after subtracting the small valid pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Pipeline loss confirmed at 738 units total. Orders from P15, P18, P19, P24 (290 units) plus P29 (237 units) and P30 (211 units) have all exceeded the max observed lead time of 3 periods and are considered lost. Effective pipeline is 112 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, the system shows an 'In-transit' of 850 units and On-hand of 0. Based on history, orders from P15 (95), P18 (55), P19 (68), P24 (72), P29 (237), and P30 (211) satisfy the criteria for being 'lost' as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a significant margin (P30 is now at L=6). Total lost units = 95+55+68+72+237+211 = 738 units. The actual effective pipeline is 850 - 738 = 112 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (850) from the base stock, it will not order enough to cover the loss. To force the OR backend to order, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the (Actual Base Stock + Lost Units). Mean demand since P4 is stable at ~100 units/period. For a lead time (L) of 2 (promised) and review period of 1, we need to cover 3 periods. Base stock \u2248 3 * 100 + safety stock. Given the lost shipments, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1038 to offset the 738 units the backend incorrectly sees as coming. L is set to calculated to reflect the high variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Lost shipment total confirmed at 738 units (P15, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30). Effective pipeline is currently 112 units despite the 850 units reported in transit.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has been stable since Period 4, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units per period. Lead times have historically fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, but the system is currently experiencing a severe disruption where multiple orders are being lost. Based on the history, orders from Period 15, 18, 19, 24, 29, and 30 are now confirmed lost (totaling 738 units). Currently, the reported In-transit inventory is 1038 units, but only 300 units (ordered in Period 36) can be considered potentially valid pipeline inventory. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing repeated stockouts due to these lost shipments, I need to signal the OR backend to place an order that restores the target inventory level for the current stable demand (~100 units/period) while accounting for the volatile lead time (average ~2). By selecting recently stable N=20 for demand and explicit L=2, the backend will calculate a base stock to cover (2+1) periods of demand (~300 units). Since the OR engine subtracts the full 1038 in-transit units from the base stock, it will result in no order being placed unless I adjust parameters. However, the OR engine's internal cap and subtraction logic are fixed. I will use 'explicit' values to force a higher base stock that overcomes the 'phantom' inventory in the reported pipeline, ensuring the backend places a meaningful order this period to try and break the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Total lost shipments confirmed at 738 units (P15, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30). Effective pipeline is only 300 units (from P36 order) despite 1038 reported in-transit.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 4 has been stable, with a mean demand of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation around 28 units. Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, though many shipments have been lost entirely. Historically, the following orders were lost: P15 (95), P18 (55), P19 (68), P24 (72), P29 (237), and P30 (211), totaling 738 units. In Period 37, an order from P36 (188 units) arrived within 1 period, bringing on-hand inventory to 21 units. The reported 'In-transit' is 850 units, but after subtracting the confirmed 738 lost units, the effective pipeline is 112 units (representing any un-concluded orders placed very recently, though significantly, the record shows a gap of orders between P31 and P35). To maintain a high service level given the risk of future lost shipments and lead time volatility, I will set L to 3 (the maximum successful lead time) and use recent demand data (N=33, covering the stable period since P4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains relatively stable around 100 units/period (mean since P4 = 101.5), although recent demand in P37 and P38 spiked to 167 and 150 respectively, suggesting a potential seasonal uptick or higher volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 850 units is misleading due to substantial historical shipment losses. Based on the carry-over history, orders from P15 (95), P18 (55), P19 (68), P24 (72), P29 (237), and P30 (211) are considered lost (total 738 units). Period 36 order (188 units) arrived in P37 (L=1). There are no other active shipments in the pipeline except for those likely lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. To trigger a sufficient order from the OR backend, I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=35 to capture the stable regime since P4) and setting L to an explicit value of 2 (conservative average) to ensure the target base stock reflects the current need to replenish from zero on-hand and zero effective pipeline. Sigma is set to 'recent_N' (N=35) to handle the underlying demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Pipeline reconciliation confirms 738 units lost (P15, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30). Effective pipeline is currently 0 as all other reported in-transit units are from these expired orders. Recent demand (P37-38) shows a slight increase (avg 158) compared to the long-term avg of 100.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40, the supply chain is experiencing significant reliability issues. Historical analysis confirms a 'lost shipment' phenomenon where orders not arriving within 3 periods are effectively gone. Current 'In-transit' is reported as 850 units, but reconciliation shows these are all from lost shipments: P15(95), P18(55), P19(68), P24(72), P29(237), and P30(211), totaling 738 units. While this sums to 738, the system reports 850, meaning even the remaining 112 units (likely from earlier unaccounted gaps) are far beyond the observed L=3 window. Thus, effective pipeline is 0. Demand shifted slightly: P37-38 saw high demand (avg 158), but P39 dropped to 11. Long-term mean since P4 is ~100. I will use N=20 for mu_hat to capture the recent stable average while hedging against the recent volatility. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-3 period variance (average ~2). On-hand is 0, so a substantial order is required to restore the base stock level against an empty pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Effective pipeline inventory is confirmed as 0. All 850 units reported in-transit are from orders placed at or before Period 30, which exceeds the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a factor of 3x, confirming they are lost shipments.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 850 units in-transit, but these are all from orders placed at or before Period 30 (P15, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30). Given the maximum observed lead time is 3 periods, these orders are now over 10 periods old and are confirmed as lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has shown higher volatility recently (ranging from 11 to 182), so I will use a larger N for sigma calculation to capture this variance. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=10 to reflect the current demand environment while smoothing the recent outlier (11). Lead time remains variable between 1-3, so I will use the 'calculate' method to utilize the historical average. Setting parameters to trigger an order to refill the depleted inventory since on-hand is 0 and effective pipeline is 0.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and a critical inventory management challenge. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 850 units, but historical analysis confirms these units are from orders placed at or before Period 30 (P15, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30). Since the maximum observed lead time is 3 periods and these orders are now 12+ periods old, they are considered lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. Demand has recently shown high volatility with peaks around 150-180 units and a significant drop to 11 units in P39; the last two periods (P40-P41) averaged 165.5. I am setting L to explicit value 2 (original promised) to avoid over-ordering based on the anomaly of lost shipments, while using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand intensity (averaging ~123). Using explicit for sigma_hat allows me to account for the high demand volatility recently observed (ranging from 11 to 182).

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total pipeline loss updated to include all units currently listed as In-transit (850 units). Effective pipeline is 0. Recent demand (P37-P41) shows increased volatility and a higher periodic mean (~131.8) compared to the long-term stable mean of 100.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43, the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the reported in-transit quantity of 850 units is composed entirely of orders placed on or before Period 30 (P15, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30). Given that the maximum observed lead time in the history is 3 periods and these orders are now at least 13 periods old, they are confirmed lost. The effective pipeline remains 0. Demand shifted slightly in the recent period block (P37\u2013P42) to a mean of approximately 124.3, though with high variance (ranging from 11 to 182). I will utilize a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 to capture this more volatile demand phase while maintaining the expected lead time L at the promised value of 2 (given that the actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3). By treating the pipeline as zero, the OR backend will calculate the full base stock requirement to fulfill demand for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed effective pipeline is 0. All 850 units in 'In-transit' are lost shipments from P15-P30. Recent demand regime (P37-P42) mean is ~124 units/period with increased volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 850 units in-transit, but these represent orders from Periods 15, 18, 19, 24, 29, and 30. Since the maximum observed lead time in this environment is 3 periods and these orders are now 14+ periods overdue, they are confirmed lost. The effective pipeline remains 0. On-hand inventory is also 0. To prevent stockouts, we must place an order that covers the demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1). Although lead time has shown volatility (1-3 periods), I will use an explicit L of 2 (the promised value) because even with an actual lead time of 1, the capped OR policy provides sufficient buffer if mu_hat and sigma_hat are accurate. Recent demand (P37-P43) has shifted to an average of ~124 units/period with higher variance than the previous stable regime. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new higher-demand, higher-volatility regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: All 850 units in-transit are confirmed lost (all >14 periods old). Effective pipeline is currently 0. Recent demand regime (P37-P43) stabilized at ~124 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 850 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms these orders (placed Period 15\u201330) have far exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods (some by over 25 periods), indicating they are lost shipments. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand since Period 37 has shifted to a higher mean of approximately 123 units per period (N=8) compared to the previous stable regime. Due to the complete absence of stock and current 0 inventory (on-hand and effective pipeline), I will use 'explicit' methods to ensure the OR backend places an order sufficient to cover the current demand regime and account for lead time variability. Lead time L=3 is used as a conservative estimate (max observed) to ensure the base stock calculation (1+L) covers enough safety stock. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*123 = 492, and sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher recent volatility (std of ~50, so sqrt(4)*50 = 100).

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Effective pipeline inventory remains 0; the 850 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments. Recent demand regime (P37-P44) stabilized at ~123 units/period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 of 50. All 850 units listed 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from orders placed between Period 15 and Period 30, as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by significant margins (all are >15 periods old). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Recent demand from Period 37 onwards has shown increased volatility with a mean of approximately 115 units/period (P37-45). Since the inventory on-hand is 0 and the pipeline is empty, a restock is urgent. We will set the lead time to the maximum observed (3) to be conservative given the history of lost shipments. Demand parameters will focus on the recent stabilization around ~115 units since Period 37 (N=9 samples). This configuration ensures the OR backend attempts to cover at least (L+1)=4 periods of demand immediately.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Final confirmation that the 850 in-transit units are permanent losses. Demand regime from Period 37-45 has a mean of ~115.1 units/period with higher variability compared to the P4-P36 regime.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we are managing a stockout with zero on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' balance of 850 units is confirmed to be comprised entirely of lost shipments from Period 30 and earlier (all are over 16 periods old, while the maximum observed lead time is 3). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand shifted slightly starting at Period 37; from Period 37 to Period 46, the average demand is 115.1 units/period with higher volatility (std \u2248 49). To recover from the stockout and meet this higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture this recent behavior. I will set the lead time L to the historical average (calculate) to account for the observed volatility between 1 and 3 periods, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected arrival delay.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 37: Mean increased from ~100 to ~115.1 (+15%) with significantly higher volatility. Pipeline inventory is confirmed at 0 despite the 'In-transit' report of 850.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 37, with an average demand of approximately 115.1 units/period and increased volatility. For Period 48, I will use recent_N (N=11, covering the regime since P37) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current trend. The 'In-transit' report of 850 units is confirmed as lost shipments (orders from P15-P30), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Since the current on-hand inventory is also 0, the OR backend will calculate an order to reach the required base stock level to cover the lead time and review period. I am maintaining L as 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average lead time for the base stock calculation, which balances for the observed volatility (1-3 periods).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 37, moving from a mean of ~100 to a more volatile mean of ~121 over the last 12 periods (P37-P48). All 850 units currently reported as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 15-30, as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a factor of 5x or more. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. With only 1 period remaining in the simulation (Period 50), and on-hand inventory at 0, an order must be placed to capture Period 50 demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the current demand regime and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the historical volatility (averaging ~2 periods), though the system will likely only satisfy the final period if the actual lead time for this specific order is short.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand regime since P37 confirmed at mean ~121 (N=12) with high volatility. Effective pipeline remains 0 as 850 'In-transit' units are historical losses.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a distressed state with zero on-hand inventory and an effective pipeline of zero. All 850 units reported as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 15-30, as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by more than 5x. Since Period 37, a new demand regime has emerged: mean demand is approximately 115.1 units/period with significantly higher volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 50). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the period since the shift at P37) to capture this higher demand and risk. For Lead Time (L), I will use 'calculate' to reflect the historical variability (range 1-3, average ~2) while the OR backend's safety stock logic (z-score based on profit/holding cost) will account for the risk of stockouts during these fluctuations. No orders were placed in the last 13 periods; an order is urgently needed to restart supply.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Demand regime since P37 remains stable at ~115 units/period with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 50). All 850 in-transit units are confirmed lost; effective pipeline is 0.
