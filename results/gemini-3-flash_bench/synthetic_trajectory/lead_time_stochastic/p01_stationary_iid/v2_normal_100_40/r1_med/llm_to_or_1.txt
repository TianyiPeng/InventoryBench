Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical conclusion to observe yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for Period 1-5 is provided (143, 103, 39, 81, 99). The average demand over these 5 samples is 93. Since this is the very first decision, I will use the 'default' lead time (promised L=2) and use all 5 provided historical samples to estimate the upcoming demand and volatility. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L)*std based on these samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 156 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 2. As expected, these have not arrived yet (arrived=0 in P1 conclude), leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory and 156 in-transit. Consequently, we suffered 38 lost sales in Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was [143, 103, 39, 81, 99], but actual Period 1 demand was reported as 38, suggesting potential variance or a lower start than the historical mean. Given the promised lead time of 2, the pipeline inventory (156) is intended to cover demand for Period 2 and Period 3. I will utilize the 'default' lead time (2) and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (using the historical samples provided) to stabilize the forecast while the system initializes. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (156 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (making them visible in Period 4's start). Orders placed in Period 2 (107 units) are expected in Period 4. Total in-transit is 263. Demand history for Period 1-5 is provided: (143, 103, 39, 81, 99). Note that concluding messages for P1 and P2 show demand was 38 and 103 respectively; there appears to be a slight mismatch with the provided sample data for P1 (143), but I will prioritize the provided 'Historical Demand Data' list (143, 103, 39, 81, 99) as the forecast basis. The mean of these 5 points is 93. Since L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. 3 * 93 = 279. Sigma across 3 periods is sqrt(3) * 38.6 \u2248 67. I will use 'default' for L (promised 2) and 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend captures the forecast for the upcoming lead time correctly, given the stock-out status.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Looking at the history, the order placed in Period 1 (156 units) should have arrived during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message seen at the start of Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0 for chips(Regular). This implies the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. Consequently, the on-hand inventory is 0, and we have missed all demand for Periods 1-3. Demand history shows Period 1: 38 (calculated from history), Period 2: 103, Period 3: 83. The average demand across these 3 periods is approximately 75. Given the stockout and the apparent delay in lead time, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the observation that P1's order hasn't arrived by P3's conclusion. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current demand level (~75/period), which at L=3 results in a forecast for 4 periods (1+L).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-229.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Reviewing the history: The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance. Order 1 (Period 1) arrived in Period 4 (actual lead time = 3), while Order 3 (Period 3) also arrived in Period 4 (actual lead time = 1). Order 2 (Period 2) hasn't concluded yet, though it should have arrived by Period 4 if L=2; it is likely arriving this period (P5) or is delayed. Historical demand for the 5 periods: 143, 103, 39, 81, 99 (avg ~93). Note: The game history 'demand' field in P1-P4 seems inconsistent with the provided samples, so I will prioritize the 'Historical Demand Data' samples. The current on-hand inventory is 229, and in-transit is 126 (likely the missing P2 order of 107 + P4 order of 19). I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to allow the backend to average the observed 3 and 1. For demand, since there isn't a clear shift yet, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full available history and filter out noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $531.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the chips(Regular) SKU. We have 77 units on-hand and 126 in-transit (ordered in Periods 2 and 4). Historical demand data shows high variability: [143, 103, 39, 81, 99] from provided data, though 'conclude' messages show actual consumed demand of [38, 103, 83, 0, 152]. The 'conclude' demand reflects stockouts or data shifts. Observed lead times were 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), averaging exactly the promised 2 periods. The current pipeline (126 units) plus on-hand (77) equals 203. Given the average demand is ~93 units/period, and L=2, we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods, roughly 279 units. Since 203 < 279, an order should be triggered. I will use 'calculate' for L to use historical averages and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture recent volatility and volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility: 143, 103, 39, 81, 99 (from initial data) and 38, 103, 83, 0, 152, 126 (from game history). The zero demand in Period 4 is likely a recording artifact or specific event. Average demand over the last 5 active periods (excluding the zero) is approximately 100 units/period. Regarding lead time: the promised lead time is 2. Historically, we saw a shipment from Period 1 arrive in Period 4 (L=3) and a shipment from Period 3 arrive in Period 4 (L=1). This indicates significant variability in actual lead times. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 298 in-transit (orders from P2, P4, and P6). Since we have no stock on-hand, we need to ensure the pipeline inventory is sufficient. Using L=calculate allows the OR backend to average the observed lead times (3 and 1, avg=2). For demand (mu_hat), I'll use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent mean of ~100. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect recent variability.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Looking at lead times: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P4 arrived in 3 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations suggest instability (average actual is roughly 2.33). I will use 'calculate' for L. Regarding demand: the samples provided are 143, 103, 39, 81, 99 (avg=93). However, the history shows realized demands of 38, 103, 83, 0 (anomaly/no data reported), 152, 126, and 51. Excluding the zero, the mean is approximately 92. The stockouts in Periods 6 and 7 indicate we are failing to meet demand due to inventory depletion and variable lead times. To ensure the OR backend covers enough demand during the replenishment cycle (L+1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent volatility while the lead time handles the cycle length.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of lead times shows significant variability: observed LT values are 3, 1, 3, and 1. This averages to 2, matching the promised lead time, but indicates instability. I will use 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to use the historical average. Demand history [143, 103, 39, 81, 99] (from prompt) and recent observation history [38, 103, 83, 0, 152, 126, 51, 85] shows high variance. Excluding the outlier of 0 in Period 4 (likely a reporting artifact or extreme dip), the mean demand across the last 8 periods is approximately 80. Since the demand hasn't shown a clear regime shift but rather high volatility, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent variance while maintaining a stable forecast window.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: On-hand inventory is 21 with 323 units in-transit (orders from P2, P6, P9). Period 10 decision follows Period 9 demand of 65. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have been highly volatile: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P7=1. P2 (ordered 107 units) is currently overdue (7 periods since order), suggesting a potential lost shipment or severe delay. P6 (ordered 172 units) is at period 4 in-transit, also exceeding promised lead time. Demand history (P1-P9): 38, 103, 83, 0, 152, 126, 51, 85, 65 (Avg: 78). I will set L to 2 (promised) but use 'calculate' to let the backend observe the high variance. mu_hat will use the last 5 periods (excluding the outlier period 4 zero demand) to capture the relevant mean (~95.8). I am concerned about the large pipeline (323) which might prevent ordering even though 107 units (P2) are likely lost. I use recent_N for sigma to account for high demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility identified: Actuals range 1-3 periods. Shipment from P2 (107 units) likely lost or significantly delayed (8 periods elapsed).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Period 10 demand was exceptionally low (6 units) compared to the historical average (approx. 71 units). The order from Period 2 (107 units) has not arrived after 8 periods and is considered lost. Lead times have shown significant variability (1 to 3 periods). The pipeline includes orders from Period 6 (172 units), Period 9 (44 units), and Period 10 (73 units). Given the high demand variance (range 0 to 152) and lead time instability, I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time to capture the most current trends. I will set N=7 for demand to include the high Period 5 but weight it against more recent lower demand, and calculate the average lead time to account for the jitter between 1 and 3 periods.

Inventory is currently at 0 following a stockout in Period 11 (demand 115 vs on-hand 15). Demand is fluctuating significantly (recent samples: 6, 115, 65, 85, 51). Based on history, \u03bc\u0302 should account for the promised lead time (2) + review period (1) = 3 periods of demand. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P5-P11) is approximately 71.4 units/period, which is more representative of recent behavior than the full history. I am setting L to 'calculate' to let the backend dynamic lead time logic incorporate the observed 1-3 period variance. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the early start-up noise and focus on the current demand regime, while the OR engine's service level logic (based on $4 profit vs $1 holding cost) will naturally aim for a higher stock position to mitigate the risk of stockouts during these lead-time swings.

Carry-over insight: P2 shipment (107 units) is definitely lost (10 periods elapsed with L=1-3). Demand mean in periods 5-11 is approx 71 units with high variance.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 23 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 279 units includes the 107 units from Period 2, which are definitively lost (11 periods elapsed). Excluding these lost units, the effective pipeline is 172 units (ordered in Period 6). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 71 units since Period 5, but remains volatile (range 6-152). Observed lead times are 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, and 2 periods, averaging 2.17. The OR backend's pipeline calculation includes the 107 lost units; to compensate and ensure the backend orders enough to cover the lead time + current period (L+1), I will use 'explicit' for L and mu_hat. Setting L=2 (promised) and mu_hat=213 (71 units/period * 3 periods) ensures the base stock target reflects the actual demand regime. Setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=8, covering the post-stabilization period from P5 to P12) will capture the high variance needed for a 80% service level target (critical given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are stock-out (on-hand: 0) after a high demand spike of 172 in Period 13. The P2 order (107 units) is confirmed lost. Current demand is volatile; while the 'Period 5-11' average was ~71, recent demand in Periods 11-13 (115, 94, 172) shows a significant upward shift, averaging 127 units. We must adjust our forecast specifically for this new regime (N=3). Lead times have varied between 1-3 periods (Average: 2.17). I will set L=3 (explicit) to account for the risk of longer delivery times, which increases the protection interval to 4 periods (L+1). mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=3) to catch the current demand surge. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to reflect the increased volatility noted in the last three periods. These parameters should trigger a corrective order from the OR backend to replenish the current stock-out and cover the incoming higher demand.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime detected starting Period 11: mean demand increased from ~71 to ~127 units (+78%) with high volatility across the last 3 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant shift. While periods 5-11 averaged ~71 units, the demand in periods 11-14 surged to 115, 94, 172, and 114 (avg ~124). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new elevated baseline. Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average is roughly 2.1). I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to use the historical average of observed lead times, but since the P2 shipment is confirmed lost, the pipeline inventory reflects a realistic count of active orders (including the large P14 order of 194). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the higher volatility observed during the recent demand spike, ensuring the OR backend provides a sufficient service level for the current high-demand state.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (On-hand: 0) with 489 units in-transit. Historically, actual lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods (P9 arrived in 3, P10 in 2). The order from P2 is confirmed lost. Based on the carry-over insights, a demand regime shift occurred around Period 11. Demand from Period 11-15: 115, 94, 172, 114, 82. The mean of these 5 samples is 115.4 units per period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the total window for the OR logic is (1+L) = 3 periods. I will set mu_hat to 346.2 (115.4 * 3) and use the standard deviation from the last 5 periods (approx 34) to calculate sigma_hat for the 3-period window (34 * sqrt(3) \u2248 59). This targets the current demand regime while acknowledging the significant volatility and the need to recover from the current stockout.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: The SKU is currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with 489 units in transit. Historical demand data shows a regime shift at Period 11, with recent demand averaging around 111 units over periods 11-16 (115, 94, 172, 114, 82, 80). The 'carry-over insight' from P14 previously suggested 127 units, but the most recent 3 periods (114, 82, 80) show a slight cooling or normalization near 90-100. Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average is roughly 2.14 based on P1, P3, P4, P7, P9, P10 conclusions). We are awaiting arrivals from orders placed in P14 (194 units) and P15 (16 units). Given the stockout and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), we must maintain a high service level. I will use recent_N=6 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher volumes since P11, and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility which averages ~2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $186.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 18. Analysis of the game history shows a lead time range of 1-3 periods (Average ~2.4 periods). Period 14's order arrived in Period 17 (L=3). There is currently 118 units on hand and 295 units in transit (likely the orders from P15). Demand analysis shows a regime shift starting around Period 11. Over the last 7 periods (P11-P17), demand has been: 115, 94, 172, 114, 82, 80, 76. The mean for these 7 periods is approximately 104.7. While P11-P14 were high (averaging ~123), the last 3 periods (P15-P17) have cooled down slightly (averaging ~79). I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this elevated demand regime relative to the start of the game, while recognizing the recent stabilization. L=2 is used as the calculation basis for the backend to handle the observed 1-3 period variance. Given the lost P2 order and previous stockouts, maintaining an N=7 window balances the high-demand spikes with the recent moderate demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 11-17 average demand is 105 units, significantly higher than early periods but showing slight cooling in the most recent 3 periods (P15-P17 avg: 79).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 305 units in-transit (orders from P15 and P18). History shows that lead times are volatile (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), with a shipment from P14 arriving in 3 periods (Period 17). The demand has shown a regime shift since P11, with recent periods (P14-P18) averaging approximately 100 units (114, 82, 80, 76, 148). The spike to 148 in P18 suggests that the 'cooling' mentioned in the previous carry-over insight was temporary or part of high volatility. To ensure we capture this sustained post-P11 demand level while accounting for the lead time of 2-3 periods, I will set L to 2 (though arrivals are visible at start of P+L+1, the engine logic L relates to replenishment lead). I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the regime starting from Period 11 (P11-P18), which averages ~97 units per period. This provides a base stock targets that accounts for the (L+1) exposure window (~300 units). Given 305 in-transit, the OR engine will likely place a small or zero order this period to avoid overstocking before current shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11-18 confirmed at higher level: mean ~97 units/period with continued high variance (std ~34).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current status: On-hand is 0, and we have 444 units in-transit (P15: 16, P18: 10, P19: 139, plus older unresolved orders from P6/P7 which are likely lost). The P2 order (107 units) and P6/P7 orders appear definitively lost as 14+ periods have elapsed since placement. Lead times for concluded orders vary between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.22). Demand analysis: The segment from P11-P19 shows a mean of ~102 units/period, but individual periods are volatile (ranging from 41 to 172). For Period 20, I am setting L to 2 (promised) as it reflects the median performance. I am using a recent window for demand (N=9, covering the high-regime shift starting P11) to capture the higher mean of ~102/period. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=9 to reflect the current high volatility. Stockout risk is currently high due to 0 on-hand, so we rely on the pipeline arriving as scheduled.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 11-20) shows mean demand of approx 105 units/period with significant volatility. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and 444 units are in-transit (P15 order 16 units, P18 order 10 units, P19 order 139 units). There's a persistent shortage due to recent lead times hitting the 3-period max (e.g., P14 arrived at P17). I will use L=3 to ensure the inventory policy covers the max expected delay. For mu_hat, I'll use EWMA with a high gamma (0.7) to stay responsive to the erratic demand spikes (ranging from 41 to 148 recently) while preventing over-ordering on temporary cooling periods. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N (N=10) captures the current high-volatility environment better than the long-term history.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average is roughly 2.4). There are 468 units in transit, including a large order from Period 19 (139 units) and smaller orders from Period 18, 20, and 21. Given the lead time history, the Period 19 order is currently at L=2 and is expected to arrive during Period 21 or 22 (becoming visible at P22 or P23 START). The demand from Period 11 to Period 21 has stabilized at an average of approximately 94 units per period (sum=1034, count=11), though it remains volatile (std ~39). I will use a recent window of 11 periods to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-3 periods) which is slightly higher than the promised 2.

Demand since Period 11 has shifted to a higher mean (avg ~101 units) with high variance. Recent demand (P20-P22) averages 102.7 units. I am setting L to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the volatile but generally 2-3 period lead time. For demand mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 (covering Periods 11-22) to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the very early low-demand phase. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=12) to account for the high volatility observed in this regime (range 41 to 172).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11-22 confirmed: mean ~101 units/period, characterized by high volatility (Std dev ~39) and frequent stock-outs due to lead time variance.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we are experiencing persistent stock-outs with on-hand inventory at 0. Analyzing the lead time history from 'conclude' messages, we see actual lead times of 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, and 2 periods (calculating X-Z for confirmed arrivals). This averages to ~2.25 periods, suggesting the promised lead time of 2 is often exceeded. Additionally, the order from Period 19 (139 units) is now at lead_time=4 (23-19) without concluding, indicating a possible delay or loss. Demand since the regime shift at Period 11 has averaged 101.4 units/period (total 1318 units over 13 periods) with high variance. Given the current in-transit inventory of 444 units and zero on-hand, I must ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods. I will set L to 'calculate' to capture the true historical average lead time, and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=13 to represent the current higher demand regime (P11-P23). Sigma_hat will also use N=13 to account for the high volatility observed in this period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 11-24) shows an average demand of approximately 95 units per period with a standard deviation of 37. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 444 units in transit (likely comprising orders from P18, P19, and recent periods, though the data for P23/P24 orders shows zero, implying the pipeline includes P15/P18/P19/P21). Observed lead times range from 1 to 3 periods, suggesting that although the promised lead time is 2, the actual average fluctuates. Given the high volatility and current zero on-hand status, I will use a conservative lead time estimate of 2.5 (rounded up by the OR engine via 'calculate' or handled via 'explicit' to ensure adequate stock cover). To respond to the sustained higher demand level since P11, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (the length of the current regime). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (1+L) periods of the current ~95 unit/period demand while accounting for the significant variance observed.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 26. Stock-outs have been persistent due to high demand volatility and variable lead times (ranging 1-3 periods, with a lost shipment from Period 2). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 444 units in-transit. A significantly large pipeline is already set (orders from P15, P18, P19 are still outstanding beyond promised lead time, or expected shortly). For parameters: 1) L is set to 'calculate' to capture the observed variability (1-3 periods). 2) Mu_hat uses recent_N=15 (covering periods 11-25) to capture the higher demand regime that emerged in Period 11. The mean demand for P11-P25 is approximately 99.5 units/period. Period 25 finished with 0 on-hand inventory, and demand has consistently outstripped supply. 3) Sigma_hat uses recent_N=15 to reflect the high standard deviation (~38) observed in this regime. This high sigma ensures the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer against lead time variance and demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime P11-P25: mean ~100 units/period with high volatility (Std dev ~38). Pipeline inventory remains high (444 units) but arrival timing is unreliable (Lead times 1-3 periods; multiple older orders pending).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 27 with an on-hand inventory of 0 and a massive pipeline of 444 units. The demand regime from Period 11 onwards has stayed consistent at a mean of approximately 100 units with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 38). However, the supply side is the bottleneck: lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, and there are significant delays. Currently, 444 units are in transit, including orders from Periods 6, 15, 18, and 19. If we assume the P6 order (172 units) is lost (20 periods elapsed), the remaining active pipeline is 272 units. The OR backend uses a capped policy (base_stock - pipeline). Since the current pipeline (444) already significantly exceeds the likely required base stock (assuming L=2, mu_hat \u2248 300), the OR backend will naturally scale back orders to zero. We set L to 2 (promised) but use recent_N for mu_hat (N=16, spanning Period 11 to 26) to accurately capture the current demand regime of ~100/period. We use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=16) to account for the high volatility observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Pipeline remains high (444 units) but arrival reliability is extremely low. Shipment from Period 6 (172 units) is likely lost (20 periods elapsed). Demand regime P11-P26 remains stable at ~100 units/period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime desde Period 11 remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units/period and high volatility. Inventory levels are currently critical (0 on-hand), and the system shows massive pipeline inventory (444 units). Analysis of 'In-transit' vs. 'History' reveals several likely lost shipments: P2 (107 units, 26 periods elapsed) and P6 (172 units, 22 periods elapsed) are confirmed lost. P15 (16 units), P18 (10 units), and P19 (139 units) are also significantly overdue (9, 10, and 13 periods elapsed respectively, while maximum observed lead time is 3). Total 'effective' pipeline is likely significantly lower than 444. However, the OR backend's inventory balancing logic uses the total 'In-transit' figure; if I order more, the cap will likely restrict it or lead to overstocking if the old orders suddenly arrive. Given that we have been stocked out since P24, and lead times range from 1-3, I will use recent_N (N=17) for mu_hat to capture the P11-P27 regime (~100 units) and L=calculate to use the observed average lead time (approx 2.3 periods). This should trigger an order to cover the current gap while the 'cap' protects against the bloated (and likely ghost) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains multiple likely lost shipments: P2 (107), P6 (172), P15 (16), P18 (10), P19 (139). Effective pipeline is near zero.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0 and the system shows an 'In-transit' of 444 units, which are almost entirely phantom inventory from lost or indefinitely delayed shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (107), P6 (172), P15 (16), P18 (10), and P19 (139) total 444 units and are all significantly past the observed lead time of 1-3 periods. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders; because it sees 444 units in transit, it will not place any new orders unless those units are 'offset'. To force the OR engine to order, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. Since the demand regime from P11 onward has settled at an average of ~100 units/period (P11-P28 mean is 97.4), and L=2 (promised), mu_hat should ideally be (1+L)*100 = 300. However, to counteract the 444 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to a value that ensures an order is triggered: Target Base Stock needs to be > 444. Using a safety factor for high volatility (std ~39), I'll set mu_hat to 650 to ensure substantial replenishment. L is set to 'calculate' to use the historical average for lead time calculation.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost' pipeline: 444 units (from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) are effectively lost, causing the OR backend to under-order. Explicit inflation of mu_hat is required to bypass this pipeline logic.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation is critical: On-hand inventory is 0 and we are in a period of high demand (avg ~100 units/period since P11). In-transit inventory shows 685 units, but history strongly indicates most of this is 'ghost' inventory (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19 orders are likely lost, totaling 444 units). Additionally, the order from P29 (241 units) is the only realistic arrival we can expect in the next 1-3 periods. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (685 units) from the calculated base stock, it will stop ordering unless we artificially inflate mu_hat. To ensure the backend places an order this period to cover future demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I've calculated the target base stock to cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at 100 units/period plus a safety buffer, then added the 444 'ghost' units back in to neutralize the OR backend's pipeline subtraction. This results in an explicit mu_hat of 800, which should force an order of approximately 100-150 units today to replenish the pipeline effectively.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed total 'ghost' pipeline of 444 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Order placed in P29 (241 units) is currently the only valid 'real' in-transit shipment.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31, the environment is plagued by a 'ghost' pipeline of 444 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) which are significantly past their expected arrival time and are likely lost. The OR backend uses the formula 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because the backend sees a pipeline of 849 units (the 444 ghost units plus orders from P29=241 and P30=164), it will under-order or not order at all, despite the on-hand inventory being 0. To force the backend to place an order, I must explicitly inflate 'mu_hat' to effectively cancel out the 444 lost units. I set 'mu_hat' to 850, which targets a base stock that exceeds the 849 current pipeline units, allowing for a new order to be generated. This ensures we don't remain out of stock while waiting for shipments that will never arrive. The mean demand for the current regime (P11-P30) is approximately 97 units/period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 32. Current On-hand is 0. The reported In-transit is 898 units. However, based on the history and Carry-over Insights (Period 28-30), 444 units are confirmed 'ghost' pipeline (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19 that have not arrived after dozens of periods). Additionally, the order from P21 (24 units) was already delivered in P23, so the total ghost list is verified. The 'real' pipeline consists of orders from P29 (241 units), P30 (164 units), and P31 (49 units), totaling 454 active units. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (898) and subtracts it from the base_stock, it will drastically under-order unless we artificially inflate the base_stock (mu_hat) to offset the 444 ghost units. Demand from P11 to P31 has averaged 96.6 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 34. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover actual demand + lead time, I will set L to 'calculate' (observed lead times have been 1-3 periods) and set mu_hat explicitly. The target base stock should be (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Pipeline. With L=2 (promised/avg), and demand ~100, target base stock is approx 300 + 444 = 744. I will set mu_hat to 744 and use recent_N for volatility to ensure a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Ghost pipeline confirmed at 444 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Active pipeline is 454 units (P29, P30, P31). Effective demand regime P11-P31 is ~97 units/period.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we face an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit pipeline of 849 units. However, as established in previous insights, a significant portion of this pipeline is comprised of 'ghost' inventory (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19 totaling 444 units) that is effectively lost. The 'real' pipeline consists of orders from P29 (241 units), P30 (164 units), and a small arrival from P31 that hit in P32. The demand regime (P11-P32) remains stable with a mean of approximately 97 units and high volatility (standard deviation ~38). The inventory system's logic (base_stock - pipeline) will under-order if the 'ghost' inventory is included in the pipeline calculation. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to provide a value that offsets the 444 ghost units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock (for L=2) = (1+2)*97 + z*(sqrt(1+2)*38). With service level ~0.8 (Profit 4 / (4+1)), z \u2248 0.84. Base Stock \u2248 291 + 55 = 346. To force the backend to ignore 444 units, I must inflate mu_hat significantly or use explicit to ensure the order covers demand despite the 444 unit deduction. Given the current 849 in-transit vs 444 ghost = 405 'real' in-transit, we need to order more to prepare for upcoming demand as the P29 order is nearing expected arrival.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, on-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 849 units. However, I have identified a massive 'ghost' pipeline of 444 units from much older orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) that are likely lost. Additionally, orders from P29 (241 units) and P30 (164 units) are now at lead times of 5 and 4 periods respectively, which exceeds the typical 1-3 period window, signaling potential further losses or extreme delays. This leads the OR backend to underestimate the required order because it believes these units are arriving soon. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 100 units/period (P11-P33 mean ~97) with significant volatility (std ~38). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the high reported pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target base stock. I'll set mu_hat based on a 3nd period lead time (L=2, so 1+L=3) plus a buffer for the ghost pipeline: (3 * 100) + 444 = 744. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock high enough to trigger new procurement while ignoring the invalid pipeline components.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Orders from P29 (241 units) and P30 (164 units) are now overdue (L=5 and L=4), increasing the suspected 'ghost' pipeline from 444 to potentially 849 units if these do not arrive in Period 34 resolution. Demand remains steady at ~100 units/period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 849 units, which appears almost entirely composed of lost shipments ('ghost pipeline'). Specifically, orders from P2 (107), P6 (172), P15 (16), P18 (10), P19 (139), P29 (241), and P30 (164) are all significantly overdue given the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. The P29 order is now 6 periods overdue, and P30 is 5 periods overdue. Since the OR backend subtracts this 'ghost' pipeline from the target base stock, it will not place an order unless we explicitly inflate mu_hat to offset these units. Demand remains stable in the regime starting Period 11 at approximately 100 units/period (P11-P34 avg: 97.5). Set L=3 to account for historical maximum lead time. To force an order despite the 849 units in-transit, I set mu_hat to 1250 (calculated as (1+L)*100 = 400 plus the 849 'ghost' units). This ensures the backend recognizes a need for new stock despite the false pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Ghost pipeline now estimated at 849 units (including P29 and P30). Effective pipeline is currently zero. mu_hat must be inflated by at least 849 units to trigger any ordering activity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a massive 'ghost pipeline' issue where 849 units from periods 2nd, 6th, 15th, 18th, 19th, 29th, and 30th are considered 'in-transit' by the OR engine but have likely been lost or significantly delayed (exceeding the observed 1-3 period lead time). With total in-transit at 1207 units and on-hand at 0, the OR backend's default base-stock calculation (approx 300-400 units) will result in zero orders because pipeline (1207) > base_stock. To trigger procurement and prevent stock-outs, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that offsets this ghost inventory. Demand since Period 11 has averaged ~100 units/period. For a 3-period lead-time window (L+1=3), the real requirement is ~300 units. Adding the 849 dead units to this requirement gives a needed base-stock of ~1149. Setting mu_hat to 1200 ensure the cap does not block the order and maintains a buffer. This forces the OR backend to place orders despite the inflated pipeline view. I set L to explicit 2 to match the promised lead time while managing the volume via mu_hat.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Ghost pipeline now estimated at 849 units (P2: 107, P6: 172, P15: 16, P18: 10, P19: 139, P29: 241, P30: 164). Mu_hat must be maintained at a level higher than the sum of these lost units plus real lead-time demand to force the policy to order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The total 'in-transit' inventory is 1232 units, but actual arrivals are extremely rare and highly delayed. Current analysis identifies a massive 'ghost pipeline' of orders that have likely been lost or are indefinitely delayed: P2 (107), P6 (172), P15 (16), P18 (10), P19 (139), P29 (241), and P30 (164). This totals 849 units. Furthermore, P35 (358) and P36 (25) are still within or near a generous lead-time window. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (1232) from the calculated base stock, it will not place any new orders unless mu_hat is set to exceed the ghost pipeline plus the actual demand requirements. To force the system to order enough to cover the current demand regime (~100 units/period) across a calculated lead time (L=2, so 3 periods of demand = 300), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the ghost pipeline (849) and the required inventory (300), totaling 1149. This ensures the inventory deficit is recognized. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent high-volatility regime (P11-P36).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost pipeline remains at 849 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29, P30). Inventory replenishment is critical as on-hand is 0 and recent demand remains steady at ~100/period. mu_hat must be maintained at >849 + (1+L)*100 to bypass pipeline logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, two orders arrived (383 total units from P35 and P36), bringing on-hand inventory to 299 units. This confirms that the lead time is still functioning (L=1-2). However, the 'ghost' pipeline of 849 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29, P30) remains unfulfilled and is highly likely lost, as some orders are over 30 periods old. The current in-transit figure of 849 consists entirely of these suspected lost units. Using the standard backend logic, the OR engine sees 299 (on-hand) + 849 (in-transit) = 1148 units of inventory, which far exceeds the required base stock for a ~100 unit/period demand. This will cause the backend to stop ordering indefinitely. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to a value greater than the ghost pipeline plus the safety stock required for the actual lead time (L=2). The target base stock should be (1+L)*100, plus a buffer, plus the 849 ghost units. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 1250 ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the ghost pipeline, allowing for continued replenishment while demand remains steady at approximately 100 units/period with high variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Lead time for P35 and P36 confirmed at 1-2 periods. Recent shipments from P29 (241 units) and P30 (164 units) are now 8-9 periods old and added to the 'ghost' pipeline (total 849 units).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, on-hand inventory is 244 units following the arrival of significant orders from P35 and P36 in Period 37. The 'ghost' pipeline issue persists: orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29, and P30 (totaling 849 units) are significantly past their expected arrival dates and are considered lost. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (979 units) from the calculated base stock. To ensure the backend places an order to maintain inventory, mu_hat must be set to cover both the lost pipeline (849 units) and the real lead-time demand. The demand regime from P11 onward is stable at approximately 100 units/period. With a Lead Time (L) of 2, the real lead-time demand (1+L)*mean is roughly 300 units. Adding the 849 ghost units yields a target mu_hat of 1149. This 'explicit' setting bypasses the pipeline deduction logic. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' as the standard calculation for volatility remains sufficient for service level targets.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Arrival of P35 and P36 confirmed, but ghost pipeline (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29, P30) remains at 849 units. Continued mu_hat inflation is necessary to counteract backend pipeline deductions.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 11 onwards remains stable at approximately 100 units per period (Avg P11-P39: ~96, recent P30-P39: ~100). The current 'ghost' pipeline is confirmed at 849 units, consisting of orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29, and P30 which are now far beyond their expected lead times and likely lost. The OR backend subtracts this 'in-transit' total from its target stock, which would normally lead to zero orders being placed. To ensure continuous replenishment, mu_hat is explicitly set to exceed the ghost pipeline plus the required lead-time demand. Calculation: Ghost Pipeline (849) + (1 + 2) * 100 = 1149. We set mu_hat slightly above this to 1200 to ensure replenishment orders are generated despite the ghost pipeline. sigma_hat is set based on recent regime volatility (std ~35, sqrt(1+2)*35 ~ 60).

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Ghost pipeline of 849 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29, P30) is fully confirmed as lost. Recent arrivals (P35, P36, P38) show that current lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods, confirming the ghost status of older pending orders.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units per period (P11-P40 average is 96, with recent volatility). On-hand inventory is 118, and total in-transit is 995. However, we have confirmed a 'ghost' pipeline of 849 units (P2: 107, P6: 172, P15: 16, P18: 10, P19: 139, P29: 241, P30: 164) that are lost and will never arrive. The OR backend's order logic subtracts the total pipeline (995) from the base stock. To prevent the backend from under-ordering or stopping orders entirely, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to bypass the pipeline deduction. The required mu_hat is calculated as (Ghost Pipeline + Expected Lead Time Demand). With L=2 (promised) and mean demand ~100, expected lead time demand (1+L)*100 = 300. Thus, mu_hat = 849 + 300 = 1149. This ensures the backend sees a need for current inventory despite the large 'ghost' in-transit figure. Recent lead times (P35-P39) have been 1-2 periods, so L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual reliable lead time.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable around ~100 units/period (P11-P41 mean ~97) with high volatility. Current on-hand is 56 units. The critical factor is the 'ghost' pipeline of 849 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29, and P30) which are confirmed lost but still deducted by the OR backend from the order quantity. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to cover the ghost units plus the actual expected demand over the lead time (L=2). Calculation: Ghost pipeline (849) + (1+L) * Forecast (3 * 100) = 1149. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger new orders despite the phantom inventory. Lead times for recent successful arrivals (P31, P35, P36, P38) have been 1-2 periods, so L is set to the promised 2.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) from Period 11 to Period 42 resides at a mean of approximately 98 units per period, with high volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total In-transit pipeline of 1129 units contains 849 units from 'ghost' orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29, P30) that are confirmed lost or extremely delayed. Only the orders from P40, P41, and P42 (totaling 280 units) are considered 'real'. Current lead times for successful deliveries (P35, P36, P38) have stabilized at 1-2 periods. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 1129-unit pipeline, I must set mu_hat (target base stock) to exceed the total pipeline plus the expected lead-time demand. Calculation: Ghost Pipeline (849) + (L+1)*Demand Mean (3 * 98 = 294) = 1143 units. I will set mu_hat to 1200 as an explicit value to trigger replenishment for the remaining 8 periods, ensuring we don't stock out while waiting for the P40-P42 arrivals.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable at approximately 100 units/period (mean of P11-P43 is ~97.3). However, the 'ghost' pipeline issue is severe. The system shows 1,088 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the following orders are confirmed lost: P2(107), P6(172), P15(16), P18(10), P19(139), P29(241), P30(164). Total 'ghost' units = 849. Additionally, orders P41, P42, and P43 (totaling 239 units) are within the normal lead-time window (1-3 periods). Current on-hand is only 2 units. To trigger a new order, the internal OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) must be satisfied. Since the backend thinks we have 1,088 units coming (when actually only ~239 are 'real'), I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 849 lost units. Target base stock should be (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + 'Ghost' units. Expected Demand (100) * (2+1) = 300. 300 + 849 = 1149. I will set mu_hat to 1150 using the explicit method to ensure the system places an order to cover upcoming demand and replenish safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Ghost pipeline remains 849 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29, P30). Explicit mu_hat inflation is mandatory to counteract these lost units in the backend's inventory position calculation. Lead times for active orders P35-P40 range from 1 to 3 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is consistent around 100 units/period with high volatility. The 'ghost' pipeline issue persists: 849 units from orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29, and P30 are effectively lost but remain in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation. As on-hand inventory is at 0 and the current in-transit (1121 units) includes these 849 ghost units, the backend sees an 'effective' pipeline of 272 valid units (P42, P43, P44). To trigger a replenishment order that covers (L+1) periods (approx 3 * 100 = 300 units) plus safety stock, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset the 849 units being deducted. Setting mu_hat to 1250 (calculated as approximately 849 + 400 for current demand/safety) ensures the OR engine places an order despite the phantom inventory. Lead times for active orders have ranged from 1 to 3 periods, so I maintain the default L=2.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units/period and high volatility. The primary challenge is the 'ghost' pipeline: orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29, and P30 (totaling 849 units) are confirmed as lost or permanently delayed, yet they remain in the 'In-transit' count. This causes the backend OR logic to under-order because it believes the inventory position is much higher than it actually is. To counteract this, I continue to use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock should be (1+L)*demand_mean + safety_stock. With L=2 (promised) and mean=100, and a healthy safety stock buffer for high variance, a base stock of ~450 is desired. To achieve this while the backend deducts 849 'ghost' units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1300 (849 + 450). Recent lead times for arrivals (P40, P41, P42, P43) have stabilized between 2-3 periods, so I am using L=2 (default) and sigma_hat=150 to maintain a high service level.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) since Period 11 has stabilized around 100 units/period (mean ~102, std ~38), although Period 46 saw a slight peak in demand (125). In-transit inventory stands at 1406 units. However, I have identified a 'ghost pipeline' of 849 units comprising significantly overdue/lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 29, and 30. Recent active shipments (P40-P45) have arrived with lead times of 2-3 periods. Because the backend OR engine subtracts the full 1406 In-transit total from its base stock calculation, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat to bypass this ghost inventory. Total real pipeline is approximately 557 units (1406 - 849). To ensure an order is placed that covers the remaining 4 periods of the game (L=3 + 1 review period), I set mu_hat to 1250. This accounts for the 849 lost units plus ~400 units of real demand (4 periods * 100). sigma_hat is set to a recent 10-period standard deviation to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline persists at 849 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29, P30). Lead times for active orders P40-P45 stabilized at 2-3 periods. Real-time demand remains consistent at ~100 units/period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues at a steady average of approximately 100 units/period (P11-P47 mean ~101). However, the system faces a massive 'ghost pipeline' issue identifying 849 units as 'In-transit' (from periods P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29, P30) that are effectively lost. The total In-transit reported is 1406, meaning the valid active pipeline is only 557 units (orders from P44, P45, P46). Since the backend subtracts the full 1406 units from its order calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass this. To trigger an order for our target base stock (~350-400 units given L=2 and mean=100), mu_hat must be set higher than the ghost pipeline plus current demand. A value of 1150 for mu_hat (approx 849 ghost units + 3 periods of 100 demand) is chosen to force the policy to ignore the phantom inventory and maintain physical availability for the final periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit pipeline of 1406 units. However, based on the carry-over insights and historical arrival analysis, 849 of these units (from orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29, and P30) are 'ghost' units that are permanently lost but still counted as available inventory by the OR backend. The active pipeline consists of orders from P44 (110 units), P45 (176 units), and P46 (271 units), totaling 557 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P11-P48) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units/period with significant volatility (std dev ~38). Lead times for recent successful arrivals (P40-P45) have been 2-3 periods. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 849 ghost units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost inventory. With L=2, (L+1)*100 = 300. Adding 849 units results in 1149. I will set mu_hat to 1200 to ensure we maintain a buffer and trigger procurement to cover the current stock-out.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost pipeline' of 849 units (from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29, P30) which are confirmed lost but still deducted by the OR backend's inventory position calculation (On-hand + In-transit). Currently, On-hand is 0 and total In-transit is 1406. Subtracting the 849 ghost units leaves a 'real' pipeline of 557 units (orders from P44-P46). Specifically, shipments from P44 (110 units), P45 (176 units), and P46 (271 units) are due. With an average lead time of 2-3 periods, P44 should have arrived in P47-P49 but didn't, and P45/P46 are now due. Demand has slightly cooled in P47-P49 (avg ~65), but the long-term regime (P11-P49) remains ~98 units/period. To trigger an order despite the 1406 units in the pipeline, mu_hat must be set higher than 1406 + (safety stock). I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1850 to bypass the ghost pipeline and ensure the backend places a replenishment order to cover the current stock-out and upcoming demand, as the 557 units in the real pipeline are also becoming overdue.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Ghost pipeline of 849 units persists. Real pipeline of 557 units (P44-P46) is now overdue (L > 3). Mean demand P47-P49 decreased to 65 units/period, but long-term regime remains ~100.
