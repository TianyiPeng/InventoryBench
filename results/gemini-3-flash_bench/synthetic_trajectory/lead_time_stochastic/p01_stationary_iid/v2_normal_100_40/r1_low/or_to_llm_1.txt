Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), overstocking is as penalizing as missing a sale. 5. Strategy: I will follow the OR recommendation of 0 units.

Period 4 (40 units) and Period 5 (0 units) orders are still within the L=2 to L=3 window. 2. Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand inventory is 0.

In-transit breakdown: P6 (105 units), P7 (130 units - already arrived in P8 conclude), P8 (130 units). Wait, looking closely at P8 conclude: Arrived=130 units (ordered Period 7, LT=1). This means the 130 units from P7 are now on-hand (45 remaining), and the 105 from P6 and 130 from P8 are still in-transit (total 235 units in-transit). The UI says 'In-transit: 331', which likely includes the lost P2 order (96) + P6 (105) + P8 (130).

Total reliable pipeline is 0. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand mean is approximately 82 units/period (excluding the anomalous 0 in P4). Recent demand (P7-P9) averages 67. 4.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand is roughly 80-90 units/period (mean ~83). Recent demand has been lower (P10: 6), but P5-P8 were high. For a (1+L)=3 period window, we need roughly 250 units. 4. OR Reconciliation: The OR recommends 0 because it sees 104 units on-hand and 331 in-transit (Total 435), which far exceeds the required base stock. However, since 105 units are likely lost (P6), the real inventory position is 330.

Final Strategy: Even subtracting lost units, the pipeline contains 100 units (from P12) + any residual from previous periods. With 36 on-hand and 100 arriving soon, we can cover roughly 1.5 periods.

In-transit inventory is 371 units, composed of: P6 (105 units - confirmed lost), P7 (130 units - though history says P7's 130 arrived in P8, looking at P7's conclude), P8 (130 units - also arrived in P9). Let's re-verify the status: P10 (130 units) arrived in P12. Currently in transit: P12 (100 units), P13 (70), and potentially the P6 'lost' order of 105. Actually, according to the status, total in-transit is 371. This likely includes P6 (105), P12 (100), P13 (70), and perhaps a clerical error in tracking or P10? Regardless, on-hand is 0 and we are stocking out (sold 36 vs 172 demand). 3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand in P13 spiked to 172. The historical mean is roughly 80-90. 4. **OR Recommendation**: OR suggests 0 units because it views the 371 in-transit as sufficient. However, at least 105 of those (P6) are definitively lost. 5. **Strategy**: With 0 on-hand and high recent demand, we need to ensure local availability.

The Period 2 and Period 6 orders are confirmed lost. 2. **Current Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand inventory is 14 units. The in-transit pipeline of 271 units consists of orders from Period 15 (70 units, aged 4 periods - likely lost as max observed LT is 3), Period 17 (0 units), and Period 18 (0 units). Wait, looking closer: the history shows Orders at P15=70, P16=100 (arrived at P17). In-transit is 271? Let's re-verify: P15 (70) + P16 (arrived) + P14 (arrived) + P13 (arrived) + P12 (arrived). The 'In-transit: 271' must include the order from P15 (70) and potentially an order placed in P17 or P18 that isn't showing in the conclude messages yet. However, the game history shows P17: ordered=0, P18: ordered=0. Wait, the history says In-transit is 271, but the order history shows the last orders were P15 (70) and P16 (100). This discrepancy suggests a large order might have been placed but not listed in the 'ordered=' history clearly, or the 271 is a cumulative value I must account for. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand is volatile (P13: 172, P14: 114, P15: 82, P16: 80, P17: 76, P18: 148). The average demand over the last 5 periods is ~100 units. 4. **OR Baseline**: The OR recommends 0 units, likely because it sees the 271 units in the pipeline. Since the pipeline is very large (nearly 3 periods of demand) and on-hand is low (14), if that pipeline is real, I will have plenty of stock soon. However, P15 (70 units) is now 4 periods old and likely lost. Even subtracting 70 from 271 leaves 201 units. 5. **Final Strategy**: I will follow the OR recommendation of 0. The pipeline (even if P15 is lost) is sufficient to cover the 1-3 period lead time, and starting inventory (14) plus whatever arrives from that 271 pipeline will prevent excessive holding costs (which are $1.0/unit/period, equal to profit).",

I will rely on the fact that no orders were placed in P17, P18, or P19. If I order now (P20), with an average lead time of 2-3 periods, it will arrive around P22-P23.

The average demand over the last 10 periods is ~86 units. Lead-Time Analysis: Actual lead time is observed to be 1-3 periods. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely views the inflated 'In-transit' (547) as sufficient coverage.

Based on 'Carry-over Insights', at least 661 units are confirmed or likely lost (periods 2, 6, 15, 25, 29, 33, 44). This reduces the 'Adjusted In-transit' to 370 units (orders from P45, P46, P47). Specifically, the orders from P46 and P47 (100 each) are still within the observed 1-3 period lead time window. However, recent demand (P43-P46) has averaged ~134 units, while we have had stockouts for the last three periods (P46-P48). With only 2 periods remaining in the game (P49 and P50), we must ensure we have enough stock to cover the final two windows of demand. The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely ignored because it sees the massive unadjusted pipeline and the 0 profit/holding cost ratio (since profit $1.0 and holding cost $1.0 creates a critical fractile of 0.5, but the system might be defaulting to 0 due to the high pipeline). Since transit time is 1-3 periods, an order placed now in P49 has a chance to arrive for P50. However, the existing pipeline from P45-P47 is more likely to arrive.
