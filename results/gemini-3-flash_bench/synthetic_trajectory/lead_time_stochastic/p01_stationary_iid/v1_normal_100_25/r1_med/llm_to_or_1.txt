Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical performance or arrival data yet. The demand history provided (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) shows a mean of 89.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 16.7. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Without specific calendar events or product seasonality trends beyond the basic demand samples, I will use all available samples (N=5) to establish the initial demand forecast for the lead-time plus review period (L+1 = 3 periods). The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock level that balances the $4.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 118 units. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, we expect this order to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 118 units in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 108 units, which resulted in 108 units of lost sales since on-hand inventory was 0. Historical demand samples (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) show an average demand of approximately 89.8 per period. Since L=2, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. I will use the 'default' lead time (2) and 'default' demand statistics for this period, as the samples provide a stable baseline for initial inventory positioning before more specific trends emerge.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for chips(Regular) has been 108 (P1) and 124 (P2), with a 5-period sample mean of 89.8. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 239 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since the promised lead time is 2, the order from P1 (118 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase. The 'Period 1 conclude' and 'Period 2 conclude' messages show 0 arrivals, which is consistent with a 2-period lead time (P1 order arrives in P3, seen in P4 start). Given demand is slightly higher than the overall average in the last two periods, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current variability while awaiting the first arrival to satisfy demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2. The order placed in Period 1 (118 units) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 4 decision window. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0, and inventory remains 0. This indicates the lead time is either longer than promised or there is an observation delay. Based on the system description, an order placed in Period 1 with L=2 arrives in Period 3 and is seen at the start of Period 4. Since it hasn't arrived, I will set L to 3 to account for this delay/extended lead time. Demand across the first 5 samples provided (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) averages 89.8 units. I will use the 'default' calculation for mu_hat and sigma_hat but adjust L to 3 to ensure the OR backend provides enough safety stock and pipeline coverage.

Daily Profit: $316.00, Daily Holding Cost: $134.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $182.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we have 134 units on hand and 202 units in transit. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (LT=3), and Period 3's order also arrived in Period 4 (LT=1). This confirms the promised lead time of 2 is an average, but actual lead times vary. The historical demand for periods 1-5 is 108, 124, 85, 79, and 111 (average ~101.4). Since the data is relatively stable with no clear seasonal trend yet (only 5 samples), I will use 'default' or 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters. For lead time, since we've seen LT=3 and LT=1, the 'calculate' method is appropriate to let the backend average observed performance (average 2.0). These parameters set a base stock that covers the next (L+1)=3 periods of demand to ensure high service levels while managing holding costs.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the lead time and demand patterns. Promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), averaging 2. However, the P2 order is currently overdue (placed P2, should have arrived by P4-P5, still not arrived at P5 conclude), which suggests potential arrival volatility or a lost shipment. On-hand inventory is low (34), while demand has been relatively stable around a mean of 89.8 (Period 1-5: 108, 124, 85, 79, 100 - user input provided different samples than game history, I will use game history: 108, 124, 85, 79, 100). The Pipeline inventory is high (304), consisting of orders from P2 (121), P4 (81), and P5 (102). Since L=3 has been observed and an order is overdue, I will use an explicit L of 3 to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of all 5 periods (99.2) multiplied by (1+L) = 4, resulting in 396.8. Sigma_hat will use the default calculation based on historical volatility.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded stock in Period 6. Historical demand (P1-P6) averages 99 units/period (108, 124, 85, 79, 100, 98). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times observed so far are volatile: P1 arrived in 3 periods, while P3 arrived in 1 period. Currently, 392 units are in transit (orders from P2, P4, P5, and P6). The stockout in P6 happened because the P2 order (121 units) is now at lead_time=5, suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. Despite the missing P2 shipment, I will use recent_N (N=6) for demand forecasting to capture the stable mean of ~100 units/period. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to let the engine average the 3-period and 1-period arrivals, which approximates the promised 2-period lead time while acknowledging variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $324.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with 343 units in transit. Demand over the last 7 periods averages ~102 units. The promised lead time is 2, but observed arrivals show high volatility: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), Period 3 arrived in 1 period (P4), and Period 4 arrived in 3 periods (P7). Order from P2 (121 units), P5 (102 units), and P6 (88 units) are still in transit (311 units accounted for from those periods, plus P7's 32 units). The missing P2 order is significantly overdue (5 periods since order), suggesting a potential loss or extreme delay. To compensate for the unreliable lead time and the stockout, I am using an explicit lead time of 3 (the maximum observed) to increase the pipeline target and setting mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the most recent 7 samples to capture current demand levels (~100/unit per period). Setting L=3 and using recent demand history helps the OR backend target a higher base-stock level to buffer against lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; Period 2 order (121 units) is potentially lost as it is 5 periods overdue.

Daily Reward (R_t): $471.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of concluded orders reveals significant lead time variation: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 in 1, Period 4 in 3, Period 5 in 3, and Period 7 in 1. The Period 2 order (121 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be treated as lost. Consequently, the 'In-transit' figure of 304 units effectively contains only 183 'real' units (Orders from P6, P8). The average lead time of received orders is 2.2 periods. Demand over the last 5 periods (P4-P8) has averaged 104 units, showing a slight uptick compared to the initial periods. Given the volatility in lead times (1 to 3 periods), I will set L to 2.2 to reflect reality, and use a recent 5-period window for demand to capture the current mean of 104. This ensures mu_hat covers approximately 3.2 periods of demand (approx 333 units) to protect against the frequent 3-period lead time peaks while the OR engine manages the safety stock based on recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 2 order (121 units) remains missing after 6 periods; confirmed as lost. Real pipeline inventory adjusted to exclude this loss.

Daily Reward (R_t): $432.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0. The current in-transit inventory of 252 units includes: Period 2 (121 units - confirmed lost), Period 6 (88 units - 4 periods ago), and Period 9 (43 units - 1 period ago). Since 121 units are lost, the effective pipeline is only 131 units. Demand has shown a significant increase over the last three periods (122, 121, 145), deviating from the initial range of 79-108. The average demand of the last 3 periods is ~129.3. Lead times are extremely volatile, with observed values of 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1. Given the recent demand surge and the stockout in Period 9, I will use a conservative lead time estimate of 2 (promised) to ensure the OR backend targets a sufficient base stock, while using the most recent 4 demand samples to capture the upward trend. This avoids over-reacting to the single spike of 145 while acknowledging the regime shift from the early-period average (~95).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 7: Average increased from ~95 to ~129 (+35%) across the last 4 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Period 11. On-hand inventory is 0, and in-transit is 393 units. However, we have previously confirmed that the Period 2 order (121 units) is lost, making the effective pipeline 272 units (Orders from P6, P9, and P10). Demand analysis shows a sustained regime shift starting at Period 7: the last 4 periods (P7-P10) have demands of 122, 121, 145, and 115, averaging 125.75, which matches the carry-over insight of ~129 (+35% increase). Lead times are highly variable (1 to 3 periods); although the promised lead time is 2, the average of observed lead times is (3+1+3+3+1+1)/6 = 2.0. To account for the recent demand increase, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will use 'calculate' for L to utilize all observed lead-time data for a balanced expectation.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12. Reviewing the history: the Period 2 order (121 units) is now 9 periods late and is confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' of 494 units consists of orders from Periods 6 (88), 9 (43), 10 (141), 11 (101), and the lost Period 2 order (121). Excluding the lost order, the effective pipeline inventory is 373 units. On-hand is 0. Lead times are extremely volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average: 2.1). Demand shifted around Period 7; from P7-P11, the average demand is 118.4 (122, 121, 145, 115, 89). I'll use L=2 (promised) as the backend uses this for the pipeline gap calculation, but I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (N=5 corresponds to the detected regime shift) to reflect the recent average of ~118. This will result in mu_hat = (1+2)*118 = 354. Since 373 (in-transit) > 354, the OR backend will likely order 0 or very little, which is appropriate given the large volume of arriving stock relative to the new demand regime.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the on-hand inventory is 82 units. The 'In-transit' count is 310 units, which consists of orders from Period 2 (121 units - confirmed lost), Period 6 (88 units), and Period 11 (101 units). Excluding the lost Period 2 shipment, the effective pipeline is 189 units. In Period 12, we saw the arrival of orders from P9 (LT=3) and P10 (LT=2), which helped replenish the stock. Regarding lead times, the average observed lead time is 2.14 periods (samples: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2), but volatility remains high. I will use 'calculate' for L to utilize this empirical average. Demand analysis: A regime shift was identified at Period 7. Mean demand since P7 (P7-P12) is approximately 115.7 units (samples: 122, 121, 145, 115, 89, 102), which is higher than the initial average of ~95. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this higher mean. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the increased volatility observed in this newer regime.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 9 units with 375 units in-transit. The confirmed lost order from Period 2 (121 units) means the effective pipeline is 254 units (375 - 121). Historical lead times show high volatility ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average around 2.2 periods. Demand analysis indicates a regime shift around Period 7: the average demand for Periods 1-6 was ~99, while Periods 7-13 averaged ~110. However, the last two periods (12 and 13) showed a slight dip (102 and 73), suggesting the mean might be stabilizing or reverting. I will use a recent_N of 7 (covering the shift from Period 7 onwards) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this data reflects the current elevated demand regime better than the long-term average. Setting L to 'calculate' allows the OR backend to account for the observed lead time variability which has consistently exceeded the promised 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $205.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Period 15. Examining the history, the demand regime shift previously identified at Period 7 (averaging ~129) has cooled significantly. Demand for the last three periods (P12-P14) was 102, 73, and 63, averaging 79.3. The overall average from P1 to P14 is 97.4, but including the older data understates the recent drop. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the period from P7 onwards (covering both the spike and the recent drop) to balance the forecast. Lead times observed are 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3 periods. The average is 2.22. Although 2 is the promised lead time, the frequent '3' outcomes suggest setting L=2.2 (explicit) or calculate. Given the volatility, L=explicit 2.3 is prudent. The Period 2 order (121) is confirmed lost, so the pipeline inventory (In-transit: 331) effectively contains only valid orders from P13 (65) and P14 (57), plus any previous un-concluded orders. Wait - in-transit is 331. Orders from P12 was 0. Order P13(65) + P14(57) = 122. P2(121) is lost. This leaves 88 units unaccounted for (possibly from P10 or P11 if they hadn't arrived, but P10 and P11 are concluded). Correction: In-transit is total units yet to arrive. P2(121) + P13(65) + P14(57) = 243. The status says 331. This suggests there are other units in the pipe or P2 is still counted as in-transit by the backend. I will set L to 2.3 and use recent_N for demand to track the recent downward trend while accounting for the previous peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: average decreased from ~129 (P7-P11) to ~79 (P12-P14), returning closer to early levels. Lead time remains highly unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand at Period 15 spiked to 142, contradicting the previous observation of a decline. This volatility suggests we should use a broader sample of the recent regime (P12-P15) which averages ~95 units. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 338 units in-transit (Orders from P13, P14, P15). However, the Period 2 order (121 units) is officially confirmed lost and must be ignored. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2), so using 'calculate' (average of all observed) or 'explicit' is appropriate; I will set L to 2 to reflect the promised/average behavior. mu_hat will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to account for the recent spike while smoothing the previous dip. sigma_hat will use the same N=4 to capture this high recent volatility, ensuring we order enough to cover the variability and the high demand seen in P15.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased: after a dip (P12-P14 avg ~79), Period 15 saw a spike to 142 units. Recent 4-period average is ~95 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $260.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17, current on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit inventory is 273 units. Reviewing the 'in-transit' logic: the confirmed lost order from Period 2 (121 units) is still being tracked by the OR backend as pipeline inventory. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 273 - 121 = 152 units. These represent the orders from P14 (57 units), P15 (7 units), and P16 (0 units) plus a remaining balance from earlier. Historical lead times have been highly unstable (1, 2, and 3 periods), so I will set L to 3 to be conservative and avoid stockouts given the current zero on-hand status. Demand has shifted: P12-P14 averaged ~79, but P15-P16 averaged 125. The last 5 periods (P12-P16) average 97.6. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this return to a mid-level demand regime (~100 units/period) while accounting for the recent spike. Setting L=3 with this demand mean ensures the base stock calculation covers 4 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand remains elevated (P15: 142, P16: 108, P17: 148). The mean demand over the last 3 periods is ~133 units, representing a significant shift from the lower levels observed in P12-P14 (~79). Lead times are highly unstable, frequently hitting 3 periods (P13, P14 both arrived after 3 periods), though the promised lead time is 2. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this latest surge, and 'explicit' L=3 to account for the consistently observed lag in arrivals. The in-transit inventory of 365 includes orders from P15 (7 units), P17 (149 units), and the current order. Note: the P2 order (121 units) is officially considered lost based on previous carry-over insights. By setting L to 3 and using the recent high-demand average, the OR backend should maintain a base stock sufficient to cover the extended pipeline and the current surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Average increased from ~79 (P12-P14) to ~133 (P15-P17), a 68% increase. Lead time consistently observed at 3 periods for recent arrivals (P16, P17).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand remains high. The recent demand regime (P15-P18) shows an average demand of 126.75 units (142, 108, 148, 109). This validates the carry-over insight from Period 18 and suggests a sustained high-demand period compared to the dip in P12-P14. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 534 units, but this includes the lost order from P2 (121 units), meaning the effective pipeline is 413 units. Lead times for the last four arrivals (P11, P13, P14 orders) have all been 3 periods, suggesting that although the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time has stabilized at 3. I will set L to 3 and use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this higher mean, while using the standard deviation for the same period (sigma_hat) to account for recent volatility. The parameters target a coverage of (L+1) = 4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last four concluded shipments (Orders from P11, P13, P14). Demand regime from P15 onwards continues to average ~127 units.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a significant pipeline of 543 units. Review of 'Period 19 conclude' shows demand dropped to 62, contradicting the high-demand regime (+130 units) seen in P15-P18. Specifically, demand in P18 (109) and P19 (62) indicates a potential downward shift from the recent 127-unit average. To avoid over-ordering during a possible regime change, I am adjusting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P15-P19), which averages ~114 units, slightly damping the previous peak. For lead time, recent arrivals (P16, P17) and historical analysis confirm the effective lead time has stabilized at 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. Using L=3 ensures the backend accounts for the correct (L+1) risk window. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the high volatility experienced during this demand fluctuation. Current in-transit (543) includes orders from P17 (149), P18 (169), P19 (9), and likely recent unscheduled arrivals; however, 543 is high enough that the OR backend's capped policy will likely restrict new orders to prevent excessive holding costs once shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: After peaking at ~133 (P15-P17), demand has softened (P18: 109, P19: 62), bringing the recent 5-period average to ~114.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 543 units in-transit. A review of recent history shows that demand has softened since its peak at P15-P17 (~133). Specifically, demand from P18-P20 was 109, 62, and 102 (avg ~91). This suggests the previous 'peak' was short-lived or the market is currently cooling. Furthermore, lead times have been highly unreliable, though the most recent 'conclude' messages (P14, P16, P17) confirm a lead time of 3 periods. However, no shipments arrived in P18, P19, or P20 despite the high in-transit volume, suggesting a current delivery bottleneck or lead time extension. Given that on-hand is 0 and we are currently out of stock, I will set L to 3 (recent average) and use a recent_N window for demand (N=6) to capture the cooling period from the previous peak (avg ~112) to ensure a balanced stock level without over-ordering during a downward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling: avg demand decreased from ~133 (P15-P17) to ~91 (P18-P20). Significant lead time variance continues, with no arrivals observed in the last 3 periods despite high in-transit status.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0) and a significant supply bottleneck. No shipments have arrived in the last 4 periods (P18-P21), despite a large in-transit volume of 543 units. Historically, lead times for this SKU fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, but we are currently seeing a stretch of 0 arrivals. Orders from P15 (7 units), P17 (149 units), and P18 (169 units) are all currently in-transit. P15 and P17 are now 7 and 5 periods old respectively, suggesting they might be delayed or potentially lost, though they haven't exceeded the 'lost' threshold used in P2 and P9 yet. Demand has cooled from its peak of ~133 (P15-P17) to a recent average of ~95 (P18-P21). Given the high in-transit amount compared to recent demand, the OR backend's base-stock logic will naturally suppress ordering if L is set low. However, to account for the persistent delays and ensure the model target covers enough periods to weather the current supply gap, I will set lead time (L) explicitly to 3 (the upper bound of historical arrivals) and use recent_N for demand to capture the cooling phase (~95 per period).

Carry-over insight: Supply Blockage: No arrivals observed for 4 consecutive periods (P18-P21) despite 543 units in-transit. P15 and P17 orders are significantly overdue, suggesting continued lead-time instability or potential losses.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 shows a continued supply blockage with no units arriving for five consecutive periods (P18-P22), resulting in a current on-hand inventory of 0. There are 543 units in-transit, including orders from P15 (7 units), P17 (149 units), P18 (169 units), P19 (9 units), and P20/P21/P22 (0 units). The orders from P15 and P17 are now 7 and 5 periods old respectively, and since the recent maximum lead time was 3 periods, these are likely lost or severely delayed. This creates a massive hole in the pipeline. Demand from P18-P22 (109, 62, 102, 107, 105) averages 97 units. I will set the lead time to an explicit 4 to account for the current blockage and force the order calculation to look further ahead. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (avg ~97) to reflect the current softened demand regime (period 18-22). Given the extreme supply uncertainty, I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 30 to ensure the safety stock is robust against both demand variance and delivery inconsistency.

Carry-over insight: Supply Blockage Extended: No arrivals for 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22). Orders from P15 (at 7 periods old) and P17 (at 5 periods old) are likely lost, significantly reducing effective pipeline inventory despite the 'In-transit' display of 543 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a critical supply crisis. There have been no arrivals for 6 consecutive periods (P18-P23). The orders from P15 (7 units), P17 (149 units), and P18 (169 units) are now 8, 6, and 5 periods old respectively, and because historical lead times have not exceeded 3 periods in successful deliveries, these must be treated as lost. This effectively invalidates 325 units of the 543 units currently 'in-transit', leaving only approximately 218 units (from P19 and P22-P23) as potentially viable pipeline inventory. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 105 units over the last 6 periods (P18-P23). To force the OR backend to place a restorative order despite the high (but false) in-transit count, I am setting an 'explicit' lead time L of 5 to increase the base stock calculation, and keeping mu_hat aligned with the recent mean. This strategy aims to overcome the pipeline offset to replenish stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply Blockage Terminal: No arrivals for 6 consecutive periods (P18-P23). Orders from P15, P17, and P18 (totaling 325 units) are confirmed lost; effective pipeline is dramatically lower than the 543 units reported. Demand regime stabilized (P18-P23 avg: 105).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 25 and facing a critical supply failure. No units have arrived for 7 consecutive periods (P18-P24), despite an 'In-transit' count of 630. Historically, orders from P15 (7 units), P17 (149 units), P18 (169 units), and P19 (9 units) should have arrived by now based on a 3-period lead time. Their continued absence suggests these 334 units are lost. Additionally, orders from P20 and P21 were 0, so the only viable 'fresh' inventory is from the order placed in P24 (87 units) and whatever is ordered today. Demand has stabilized over the last 7 periods (P18-P24) at an average of 106 units per period. Because of the extreme delivery delays and high loss rate, I must set the lead time (L) to its observed maximum of 3 to force a higher base stock. I will use the recent demand average (last 7 periods) for mu_hat, while increasing sigma_hat to account for the supply-side volatility and potential under-forecasting.

Carry-over insight: Supply Blockage Critical: No arrivals for 7 periods (P18-P24). Orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (334 units) are confirmed lost. Effective pipeline inventory is drastically lower than the reported 630 units. Demand regime (P18-P24) mean is 106.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 26. The supply chain is in a critical failure state with zero arrivals for 8 consecutive periods (P18-P25). Despite an 'In-transit' count of 630 units, the following orders are definitively lost: P15 (7 units), P17 (149 units), P18 (169 units), and P19 (9 units), totaling 334 units. The earliest potentially viable order is from P24 (87 units), placed only 2 periods ago (within promised lead time), but given the historical performance, we cannot rely on it. Demand has stabilized into a regime (P18-P25) with a mean of ~103 units. With current on-hand inventory at 0 and a massive backlog of lost units, we must keep orders active to capture any possibility of supply restoration while acknowledging that 'In-transit' is severely inflated. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (which it calculates as orders placed minus arrivals), it considers the system fully stocked (630 units in transit vs. a base stock requirement of ~400 units). To force the backend to place new orders despite this phantom inventory, I will set 'L' to an explicit high value (4) to increase base stock calculations and use 'recent_N' for demand to maintain the 103-unit average. However, the system's capping logic and 'pipeline_inventory' subtraction mean new orders will remain frozen until arrivals are confirmed or the internal counter resets. I will use 'explicit' values to inflate the safety buffer and demand forecast to combat the phantom pipeline effect.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Supply Blockage Disaster: No arrivals for 8 periods (P18-P25). Total confirmed lost units: 334 (Orders from P15, P17, P18, P19). Current 'In-transit' of 630 represents only 296 potentially viable units (P24, P25 orders). Demand regime (P18-P25) mean is ~103.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a severe supply crisis where no shipments have arrived for nine consecutive periods (P18-P26). On-hand inventory is 0 and demand is completely unserved. The 'In-transit' figure of 630 units is misleading: following the logic from carry-over insights, orders from P15 (7 units), P17 (149 units), P18 (169 units), and P19 (9 units) totalling 334 units are confirmed lost as they are now 11, 9, 8, and 7 periods old respectively against a promised lead time of 2. The remaining viable pipeline consists only of the P24 order (87 units), leaving an effective pipeline of 87, not 630. Demand since P18 has stabilized around a mean of 100 units (avg P18-P26 is 100). To force the OR engine to place a large recovery order despite the inflated 'In-transit' tally, I will set 'L' to an explicit value of 8 to reflect the massive observed delay. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture the current 100-unit regime, and for sigma_hat I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture current volatility. This configuration increases the base stock target high enough to overcome the backend's pipeline subtraction.

Carry-over insight: Supply Blockage Catastrophic: No arrivals for 9 periods (P18-P26). Total confirmed lost units is 334 (Orders P15, P17-P19). Effective pipeline is only 87 units (from P24). Demand regime (P18-P26) mean is 100.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a catastrophic supply failure. No units have arrived for 10 consecutive periods (P18-P27). The cumulative 'In-transit' figure of 761 units is highly misleading. Based on historical data, shipments from P15 (7 units), P17 (149 units), P18 (169 units), and P19 (9 units) totaling 334 units are definitively lost as they are far beyond the observed 1-3 period lead time. The viable pipeline consists only of orders from P24 (87 units) and P27 (131 units), totaling 218 units. However, because no arrivals have been confirmed since Period 17, the effective lead time 'L' is effectively infinite or, for the purposes of the OR model, significantly elevated. I will set L to 10 (explicit) to reflect the current blockage duration and force the backend to account for a massive lead-time horizon. The demand regime from P18 to P27 has a mean of approximately 102 units; I will use N=10 to capture this stable post-peak regime. Setting L=10 and providing an explicit mu_hat covering (1+L) periods will signal the need for a massive order to overcome the pipeline deficit caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Supply Blockage Total: No arrivals for 10 periods (P18-P27). Confirmed lost units: 334 (Orders P15, P17-P19). Effective pipeline is only 218 units (P24, P27). Demand (P18-P27) stable at mean ~102.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a catastrophic supply blockage. No arrivals have been confirmed for 11 consecutive periods (P18-P28), since the Period 14 order arrived in Period 17. The current 'In-transit' of 893 units is misleading because orders from P15 (7 units), P17 (149 units), P18 (169 units), and P19 (9 units) totalling 334 units are extremely overdue and confirmed lost. The remaining pipeline consists of P24 (87), P27 (131), and P28 (132) totaling 350 potentially viable units, plus the new order to be placed this period. Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~105 since the cooling at P18 (P18-P28 average). I will set L to 10 to force the OR backend to acknowledge the arrival delay and trigger a large enough order to restore service once the blockage clears. mu_hat will use the recent 11-period average to reflect the current stable demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply Blockage Total: No arrivals for 11 periods (P18-P28). Confirmed lost units: 334 (Orders P15, P17-P19). Effective pipeline is only 350 units (P24, P27, P28). Demand regime (P18-P28) stable at mean ~105.

Daily Reward (R_t): $359.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply blockage has finally broken. In Period 29, the order placed in Period 27 arrived with a lead time of 2 periods. However, a significant backlog of orders (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) totaling 464 units has not arrived after more than 10 periods and must be considered lost at this stage to avoid under-ordering. The current 'In-transit' of 899 contains these 464 lost units, leaving an effective pipeline of 435 units (P28, P29, and potentially the un-arrived P27 remainder). Demand has remained remarkably stable around a mean of 105 since Period 18. I am setting L to 2 (observed in the most recent arrival) and mu_hat to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) using the stable mean from the last 12 periods (P18-P29). Sigma_hat is set to the standard deviation of that same period. By treating the older in-transit units as lost, the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will correctly trigger replenishment orders to meet future demand.

Carry-over insight: Supply Blockage broken at Period 29 with lead time = 2. Total confirmed lost units: 464 (Orders P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Effective pipeline inventory is vastly lower than the reported 899. Demand regime (P18-P29) mean is ~104.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The severe supply blockage that lasted from Period 18 to Period 28 was broken in Period 29. Orders from P27 and P28 both arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, suggesting that the supply chain has resumed normal operations (aligned with the promised lead time of 2). However, historical data strongly suggests that specific older orders are lost. Accounting for confirmed losses from P15 (7), P17 (149), P18 (169), P19 (9), and now likely P24 (87) which is 7 periods old and still hasn't arrived while later orders (P27, P28) have, the total lost volume is 421 units. Although the 'In-transit' shows 767, the effective pipeline is likely 767 - 421 = 346 units. The demand regime from Period 18 to Period 30 has remained relatively stable with a mean of approximately 104 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to replenish stock after the long drought without being misled by 'ghost' in-transit units, I will set mu_hat explicitly based on the 104 mean and L=2 (Total = 3*104 = 312). Using 'calculate' for L reflects the return of more normal lead times observed in the last two periods.

Carry-over insight: Supply blockage confirmed broken at Period 29; Lead time for most recent two arrivals (P27, P28) was 2 periods. Total estimated lost inventory: 421 units (Orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Demand regime (P18-P30) mean stable at ~104.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply blockage has resolved with the arrival of orders from Period 27 and 28, both showing a lead time of 2 periods. However, a significant amount of inventory remains missing and is now confirmed as lost. Specifically, orders from P15 (7), P17 (149), P18 (169), P19 (9), and P24 (87) are long overdue (ranging from 7 to 16 periods) and total 421 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 767 contains these 421 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 346 units (from P29 and the current zero orders). Demand remains stable around a mean of 104 (P18-P31). I am setting L to 2 periods based on the most recent successful deliveries. Mu_hat is set to roughly 3 periods of demand (1+L) at the current regime. By reducing the effective pipeline (ignoring the 421 lost units), the OR backend's capped policy will trigger necessary new orders to rebuild the stock buffer, which is currently at zero on-hand after Period 31's stockout.

Carry-over insight: Supply blockage definitively broken; recent lead times (P27, P28 orders) confirmed at 2 periods. Total lost inventory finalized at 421 units (Orders P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Demand regime (P18-P31) stable at mean ~104.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 32 periods, the supply chain has faced a significant disruption. A 'Supply Blockage' occurred from Period 18 to Period 28 where no arrivals were recorded. Based on historical data, shipments from Period 15 (7 units), Period 17 (149 units), Period 18 (169 units), Period 19 (9 units), and Period 24 (87 units) are confirmed lost (Total 421 units), as they are far beyond the current observed lead time of 2 periods. The reported 'In-transit' of 767 units includes these 421 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 346 units (Orders from P27, P28, P29). Since these 346 units have already started arriving (P27 and P28 arrived at P29 and P30), the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the remaining viable pipeline is only the P29 order (137 units). Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 104 units over the last 15 periods. To recover from the stockout caused by the losses, L is set to 2 (recent actual lead time), and mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=15) to capture the stabilized mean. sigma_hat uses recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock. This will trigger a large replenishment order to bridge the gap between effective pipeline and required base stock.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply blockage (P18-P28) has definitively broken, with recent arrivals (P27, P28) confirming a current lead time L=2. However, a significant amount of 'In-transit' inventory (421 units from orders P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) is confirmed lost based on the 'Supply Blockage Total' insights and the timing of subsequent arrivals. The current reported 'In-transit' of 767 units is misleading; the effective pipeline consists only of the P29 order (137 units) plus any very recent orders, though the history shows no orders from P30-P33. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been consistent around 104 units, the OR backend needs to order to replenish. I will set L=2 to match the most recent successful arrivals. Demand is stable (P18-P33 avg: 104.5), so I will use a recent_N of 16 to capture this entire stable post-boom period. Using a relatively high N for sigma_hat will ensure sufficient safety stock given the history of stockouts and supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered from blockage; Lead time for most recent arrivals (P27, P28) is 2 periods. Demand regime stable at ~104 units (P18-P33). Reported In-transit (767) includes 421 units from confirmed lost orders (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following a major blockage where multiple orders (Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, 24) were confirmed lost, totaling 421 units. Recent arrivals from orders placed in Periods 27 and 28 confirmed a lead time of 2 periods. The current 'In-transit' of 767 units is misleading; subtracting the 421 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 346 units. However, we have been at 0 on-hand inventory for 4 consecutive periods (P31-P34) due to no new orders being placed recently. Demand remains stable within the regime established at Period 18, with a mean of approximately 104 units. To recover inventory levels and meet this demand given a 2-period lead time, I will set L to the promised 2 periods (consistent with recent arrivals), use recent_N (N=17, covering the stable regime since P18) for mu_hat to capture the ~104 avg demand, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Note: The OR backend 'cap' and 'base_stock' logic will reconcile the pipeline, but since the backend is unaware of lost shipments, setting parameters to cover the (L+1) window is priority.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a massive blockage between Periods 18-28. Recent arrivals from orders placed in Periods 27 and 28 confirmed a lead time of 2 periods. However, a significant portion of the 'In-transit' inventory (767 units) consists of lost orders from the blockage period (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24), totaling 421 units. The adjusted viable pipeline inventory is 346 units (orders from P29 onwards). Demand has remained remarkably stable since Period 18, with a mean of approximately 104 units and moderate volatility. With on-hand inventory at 0 and the supply chain having recently processed the P27/P28 orders, we are likely awaiting the P29 order. I will use a recent_N (N=17, covering the stable period since P18) for demand forecasting to capture this stability, while keeping L at the promised 2 periods to align with recent successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Supply Chain Recovery: Lead time has stabilized back to 2 periods as of Period 30. Sustainable demand regime since Period 18: mean ~104, std ~18.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a significant blockage period. Recent observations from Period 29-30 confirmed a lead time of 2 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand has remained consistently stable around a mean of 104 with a standard deviation of approximately 18 since Period 18. Although 'In-transit' is reported as 767 units, carry-over insights and historical gaps confirm that 421 units (from orders P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) are effectively lost. The current on-hand inventory is 0. My parameters aim to replenish stock to meet the stable demand regime while acknowledging that the OR backend's 'pipeline' view is inflated by lost units. By setting L to default (2) and using recent_N (N=19, covering P18-P36) for demand parameters, I provide the engine with the current regime's statistics to recalculate the base stock level.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a major blockage (Periods 18-28). Lead times for the most recent arrivals (P27 and P28 orders) were confirmed at 2 periods. The demand regime from Period 18 to Period 37 is stable, with a mean of approximately 104 units and a standard deviation of roughly 18. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 767 is misleading because it includes 421 units from orders placed in P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24, which are long overdue and confirmed lost. Excluding these, the effective pipeline is only 346 units (from P29 onwards, though P30-P37 had zero orders). Since the system is currently stock-out with no viable pending arrivals (orders from P29-P37 were mostly zero or already arrived), I must set parameters to trigger a refill. I will use 'recent_N' with N=19 to capture the stable demand since the P18 shift, and 'explicit' for lead time to match the stabilized 2-period observation.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a catastrophic failure, with no arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (P31-P38) despite the system reporting 767 units 'In-transit'. Carry-over insights and historical analysis confirm that 421 of these units (from orders P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24) are lost. Furthermore, orders from P27, P28, and P29 have already arrived or were accounted for, and no orders were placed between P30 and P38. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is currently 0. The demand regime has remained remarkably stable since P18, with a mean of approximately 104 units and a standard deviation of 18. Despite the reported 'In-transit' figures, I must treat the pipeline as empty and the lead time as effectively 2 based on the last successful recovery. I will use 'explicit' methods to override the backend's inflated pipeline perception, signaling a need to rebuild stock for the current and future lead periods (L+1 = 3 periods). Setting mu_hat to cover 3 periods of demand (312 units) with a sigma_hat adjusted for volatility (32) will prompt the OR engine to place a recovery order.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Supply Chain Stagnation: No orders placed P30-P38; current In-transit (767) consists of 421 confirmed lost units and 346 units from orders P27-P29 which have partially arrived or are unaccounted for. Effective pipeline is 0. Demand stable at 104 since P18.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods, as confirmed by orders from Periods 27 and 28. However, no orders have been placed since Period 29, leading to the current stockout (On-hand: 0). The reported In-transit inventory of 767 units is highly misleading: 421 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, and 24 are confirmed lost, and the order from Period 29 (137 units) is now 11 periods overdue, suggesting it is also lost. The only potentially viable inventory was the Period 27/28 batch which has already arrived. Therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. Demand has been stable since Period 18 with a mean of ~104 and a standard deviation of ~18. To recover from the stockout, I set L=2, mu_hat to reflect demand over the 3-period window (L+1) using the stable recent regime (N=22 periods since P18), and sigma_hat accordingly. This will prompt the OR backend to place a significant order to cover the (L+1) demand window while correctly ignoring the ghost 'in-transit' units.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Effective pipeline inventory is confirmed at 0 units. In-transit reporting remains inflated by 558 units of lost shipments (Orders P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and now P29). Demand regime remains stable at mean ~104 (P18-P39).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 41. The demand regime has been stable since Period 18, averaging approximately 104 units (observed mean P18-P40 is ~103.5). The supply chain suffered a catastrophic failure with multiple lost orders (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and now P29 can be considered lost as it is 11 periods overdue). While lead time for P27 and P28 was 2 periods, there have been no arrivals since Period 30. On-hand inventory is 0 and the effective pipeline inventory is confirmed at 0 because all units in the reported In-transit (767) are from orders placed 11+ periods ago that are definitively lost. To restart the flow and meet demand, I must trigger an order. I will use L=2 (the last observed successful lead time) and a recent_N of 23 for mu_hat (covering the stable regime since P18) and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend generates a base stock that accounts for both current demand and the safety stock needed for volatility.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a major blockage and multiple lost shipments (Orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P29). Recent arrivals (P27, P28) confirm a lead time of 2 periods. Although the system reports an In-transit of 767, the effective pipeline inventory is 0 because the reported units correspond to confirmed lost orders. Demand has been stable since Period 18, with a mean of approximately 104 units and a standard deviation of ~18. I am using recent_N for both demand and volatility (N=24, covering P18-P41) to capture this stable regime. Since effective pipeline is 0 and on-hand is 0, the backend needs to trigger a significant order to restore inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Finalized Effective Pipeline Status: Reported In-transit of 767 units is 100% lost shipments (Orders P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29). Effective pipeline is currently 0.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43, the game is in its final phase (P43/50). The primary challenge is the discrepancy between the reported 'In-transit' inventory (767 units) and the actual effective pipeline. Historical analysis and Carry-over insights confirm that at least 558 units (Orders P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29) are permanently lost. Recent periods (P30-P42) show a cessation of ordering, and no arrivals have occurred since P30. At P42 conclude, on-hand is 0 and the effective pipeline is confirmed to be 0 as the remaining in-transit units are well beyond any feasible lead time. Demand has softened recently (P41: 64, P42: 65), but the long-term stable mean since P18 remains around 104 with a standard deviation of approximately 18. To maximize reward in the remaining 8 periods, I must restart ordering immediately to satisfy demand through the lead time. Given lead time has stabilized at 2 when supply actually moves, I use L=2. I set mu_hat to 312 ((1+2) * 104) and sigma_hat to 31.2 (sqrt(3) * 18) using the 'explicit' method to bypass the OR engine's reliance on the inflated 'In-transit' metric, forcing an order that accounts for the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Final demand regime check: Period 41 and 42 show a potential downward shift in demand (avg 64.5 vs prior 104), but further periods are needed to confirm a sustained shift.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we are managing a situation where the effective pipeline inventory is confirmed to be zero, despite the 'In-transit' display showing 767 units. Historical analysis (Carry-over insights Period 42) indicates that all these units (from orders P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29) are effectively lost. The current on-hand inventory is also 0. Demand analysis shows a sustained regime of ~104 units from Period 18 through 40. However, the last three periods (P41-P43) have shown a significant drop to an average of 63.6 units (64, 65, 62). This represents a new potential downward regime shift. Given the supply chain recovery observed earlier (P29-P30), lead time is currently treated as 2 periods (promised/recent). To restart the inventory cycle while respecting the recent demand drop, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the lower demand floor, while maintaining a default sigma_hat to account for volatility. Setting L to 'default' (2) aligns with the most recent successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand cooling confirmed: Demand decreased from ~104 (P18-P40) to ~64 (P41-P43), a 38% drop. Effective pipeline inventory remains 0 despite historical in-transit reporting of 767 units (all confirmed lost).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods, as confirmed by the last arrivals in Period 30. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 767 is entirely composed of lost shipments (Orders P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P29), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is also zero, leading to persistent stockouts. Demand has undergone a clear regime shift beginning at Period 41, dropping from an average of ~104 to ~65 (Periods 41-44: 64, 65, 62, 68). I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this cooling. I am setting L to explicit value 2 to reflect the recovered lead time. The OR backend will use these to place a recovery order that accounts for the zero effective inventory and the new demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shown high volatility recently. While a cooling trend was detected (avg ~64 observed in P41-P43), Period 45 saw a significant spike back to 116. Given this, I am reverting to a slightly more conservative demand estimate (N=5) to capture recent variability without overreacting solely to the cooling trend or the single spike. The reported in-transit of 767 is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (Orders P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Lead time has stabilized at 2 periods since the supply blockage recovery. By using explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat, I ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that compensates for the fact that it incorrectly believes there are 767 units arriving soon, when in reality none are. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand at the recent average of ~75 units, but since the OR backend subtracts the phantom 767 units, I must use an 'explicit' value that overrides this logic or provides a large enough target.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Demand high volatility continues; Period 45 spike (116) countered the recent cooling trend (P41-P44 avg ~65). Total lost units remain at 767, effective pipeline is zero.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a massive disruption (Period 18-29) where 767 units were lost. Current 'In-transit' of 1033 units includes 767 lost units and 266 units ordered last period. Effectively, the pipeline inventory is 266 units. On-hand remains 0 due to stockouts. Demand analysis: After a period of cooling (~65 units P41-P44), demand spiked again in P45 (116) and P46 (81), suggesting volatile but recovering demand. The recent 6-period average is ~76 units, while the long-term stable mean prior was ~104. Lead time since stabilization is 2 periods. I choose recent_N for mu_hat (N=6) to capture the current demand recovery while maintaining enough buffer for volatility. L is set to explicit '2' as it is the observed stable lead time post-blockage.

Carry-over insight: Final demand regime (P41-P46) reflects high volatility with a recent mean of ~76 units, recovering from a temporary dip. Effective pipeline inventory is (Reported In-transit - 767 lost units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, we are managing a recovery from a long period of out-of-stocks and supply disruptions. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit is 1033 units, but according to historical tracking (Carry-over insights), 767 of these units are confirmed lost (Orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P29). This leaves an effective pipeline of 266 units (the order placed in P46). The promised lead time is 2, and recent successful arrivals (P27, P28) followed a lead time of 2, so L=2 is appropriate. Regarding demand, we are seeing high volatility. Period 47 demand surged to 127 units, counteracting the previous cooling trend. Looking at the last 7 periods (P41-P47), the mean is approximately 83 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this volatile recovery period and ensure the backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the recent spike and the prior dip.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high volatility in demand confirmed: (P41-P47) mean ~83 units follows a cooling period. Effective pipeline inventory calculation remains critical: (Reported In-transit - 767 lost units). Previous blockage broken with L=2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are nearing the end of the simulation. The demand regime from Period 41 to 48 shows high volatility with a mean of approximately 83 units (samples: 64, 65, 62, 68, 116, 81, 127, 83). The reported in-transit inventory is 1033 units, but 767 of these units are confirmed lost shipments (Orders P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 266 units, which corresponds to the order placed in Period 46. With a confirmed lead time (L) of 2 periods, the order from Period 46 is expected to arrive during Period 48's resolution (visible in the Period 49 decision phase). However, the Period 48 conclude message shows arrived=0, suggesting this order might be arriving in Period 49 or is delayed. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 and the effective pipeline is 266 (covering roughly 3 periods of demand at the current mean), and we are at Period 49 of 50, no additional units are needed to cover the final period's demand. I will set the parameters to reflect the current demand mean (~83) and stabilized lead time (2).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a major blockage Period 15-28. Based on the most recent successfully arrived orders (P27, P28 arriving in P29, P30), the actual lead time is 2 periods, consistent with the promised lead time. However, the 'In-transit' count is severely inflated (1033 units) due to historical lost shipments (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29 totaling ~767 units). The only recent order placed was 266 units in Period 46. Demand has shifted from a stabilized regime of ~104 (P18-P40) to a more volatile regime (P41-P49). The last 9 periods (P41-P49) show a mean demand of ~83.4 units (64, 65, 62, 68, 116, 81, 127, 83, 135) with significantly higher variance. I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture this increased volatility and the slightly lower mean. Setting L to the promised 2 periods ensures the base stock calculation covers 3 periods of demand (L+1), while mu_hat and sigma_hat will adapt to the recent volatility seen in the last 9 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has significantly increased since Period 41: last 9 periods (P41-P49) mean is ~83 but with extreme swings (min 62, max 135). Effective pipeline continues to be drastically lower than reported 'In-transit' due to cumulative lost orders totaling 767 units.
