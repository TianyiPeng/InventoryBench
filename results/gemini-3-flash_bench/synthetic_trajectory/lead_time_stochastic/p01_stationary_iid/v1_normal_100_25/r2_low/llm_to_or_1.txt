Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a history of 5 demand samples: [100, 69, 92, 77, 111]. The mean demand is approximately 89.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 17.2. The promised lead time is 2, so the cover period is (1+L) = 3 periods. Given the high holding cost relative to profit (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0, implying a target service level of 50%), the OR backend will aim for a lean inventory. Since we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to set the forecast parameters, as this represents our best estimate of the current demand regime. The lead time L will be set to 'default' (2) as we have no historical arrival data to suggest a deviation from the promised timing.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 118 units, but since the promised lead time is 2, these units are expected to arrive during the 'arrival resolution phase' of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 118 units in transit. The demand in Period 1 was 89, which resulted in 89 lost sales because starting inventory was 0. Historical demand samples (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) show a mean of 89.8 and a standard deviation of 17.5. To ensure we cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3), we need to maintain a base stock that covers approximately 3 periods of demand. The OR backend uses the formula base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. By setting mu_hat = (1+L) * mean, we target the expected demand over the 3-period window. I will use the 'default' methods to utilize all available historical samples for the initial periods until a clear regime change is detected.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, the promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (118 units) and Period 2 (115 units). Based on the 2nd-period lead time rule, the order placed in Period 1 (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase. As per the rules, we will only see this arrival 'concluded' at the start of Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 233 units in transit. Demand for the first two periods was 89 and 98. The historical data provided (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) suggests an average demand of approximately 90 units per period. Since we have no reason yet to doubt the promised lead time of 2, I will use L=2. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the provided 5-period historical distribution (avg ~89.8, std ~16.5). The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders were placed in Period 1 (118 units), Period 2 (115 units), and Period 3 (48 units). Based on the 2-period lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0 for chips(Regular). This suggests that the order from Period 1 is delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. Consequently, we have had 0 sales for 3 periods due to 0 on-hand inventory, despite 301 units of accumulated demand. I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to account for this observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), the historical samples (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) suggest an average demand of 89.8. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the trend, setting mu_hat = (1+L) * average. Since L is now estimated as 3, the backend will compute (1+3) * 89.8. This increased buffer helps address the stockout caused by the delivery delay.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time for chips(Regular) appears to be at least 3 periods, as the Period 1 order (placed at Start of P1, promised L=2) did not arrive by the end of Period 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival of the Period 1 order (118 units) with a lead time of 3 periods and the Period 3 order (48 units) with a lead time of 1 period. This confirms that while the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times are highly variable (avg = 2). On-hand inventory is 65 units with 226 units in-transit (from orders in Period 2 and 4). Historical demand over the first 5 periods (100, 69, 92, 77, 111 - including the recent demand of 101 in P4) averages ~90 units per period. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, effectively targeting the median demand forecast. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed lead times (3 and 1) and use the last 5 periods of demand (N=5) to capture the current mean and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 order took 1 period (average 2.0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for Period_1 to Period_5 is [100, 69, 92, 77, 111] (mean: 89.8). The 'conclude' messages show demand realizations slightly different from the provided historical samples (P1-P5 demand: 89, 98, 114, 101, 48), with P5 showing a significant drop to 48. Lead time is highly volatile: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 order took 1 period. Promised lead time is 2. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 346, which is high relative to the mean demand (~3-4 periods of coverage). On-hand is low (17). I will use L=2 (promised/average) but increase N for demand to 5 to smooth out the P5 outlier while maintaining responsiveness. The high in-transit count suggests the OR engine will likely moderate ordering naturally if base stock is calculated correctly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after stockouts in Period 6 (sold 17 out of 63 demanded). Total in-transit inventory is 346 (orders from P2, P4, and P5). Historical lead times show significant variability: P1 took 3 periods, while P3 took only 1 period. The average observed lead time is 2.0. The promised lead time is also 2. Demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with a mean of ~88 units across 6 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the system target service level is q = 0.5. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to average the observed variability and 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand parameters to capture the full history of this relatively new SKU while accounting for the stockout period's demand (63). This approach helps ensure we cover the lead time + review period (L+1=3) without over-ordering in a high holding-cost environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-3.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time for chips(Regular) is highly variable, with values of 3, 1, and 3 periods across three concluded orders (averaging 2.33 periods). The promised lead time is 2. The Period 2 order (115 units) is now 5 periods overdue (since it hasn't arrived by the end of Period 7), indicating a lost shipment. The Period 5 order (120 units) is still in-transit and expected soon. Historical demand across the last 7 periods (89, 98, 114, 101, 48, 63, 54) shows a shift after Period 4; the mean of the first 4 samples was ~100.5, while the last 3 samples (P5-P7) averaged ~55. This suggests a demand regime shift downwards. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this new lower regime and 'calculate' for lead time to account for the observed volatility. Using N=3 for sigma_hat will also reflect the recent lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: mean decreased from ~100 to ~55 (-45%) based on last 3 periods of data. Lost shipment suspicion: Period 2 order (115 units) significantly past expected delivery window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we analyze chips(Regular) which shows significant lead time and demand volatility. Lead Time: Observed actual lead times are 3, 1, 3, 3 periods. The 'calculate' method will average these to 2.5, which is more realistic than the promised 2. Demand Analysis: While a previous insight suggested a drop to ~55, Period 8 saw demand jump back up to 104. Over the last 4 periods (P5-P8), demand was 48, 63, 54, 104 (average 67.25). Currently, on-hand inventory is 73. The 'In-transit' of 115 belongs to the Period 2 order, which is now 7 periods old and almost certainly lost (normal lead time max is 3). I am choosing recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current regime including the recent spike, and N=4 for lead time (L) to reflect the consistent delays. This helps the OR engine maintain a higher base stock to buffer against the unstable lead times and the recovery in demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 2 order (115 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed, max observed L=3). Recent demand (P5-P8) shows high variance with a mean of 67.25.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a sustained demand regime shift that began in Period 5. The demand from Period 5 to Period 9 (48, 63, 54, 104, 52) averages 64.2, which is significantly lower than the Period 1-4 average (~100). The Period 2 order (115 units) is confirmed lost as it is now 8 periods overdue, while the maximum observed lead time is 3. Lead times for successful arrivals (P1, P3, P4, P5) have been 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods respectively, making the average actual lead time 2.5 periods. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand and its associated volatility (std ~23). This ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate and the observed logistics delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P5-P9): mean 64.2 (-35% from initial). Lead time frequently 3 periods despite promised 2.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (Periods 5-10) has shifted to a lower mean compared to the initial periods. The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 67 units (48, 63, 54, 104, 52, 83). Lead times have been inconsistent, frequently hitting 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 all took 3 periods) despite the promised 2. The order from Period 2 is definitively lost. Currently, there are 236 units in-transit (orders from P9, P10, and older pending). Given the high demand in P10 (83) and a stockout (sold only 21), I need to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed lead time of 3 and uses the post-shift demand mean. Setting L to the average calculated lead time (which captures the frequent 3-period arrivals) and using the last 6 periods of demand data will provide a more accurate base stock for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime (P5-P10): mean 67.3. Lead time frequently 3 periods (3 out of 4 successful arrivals observed a lead time of 3). Period 2 order confirmed lost.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 270 units in transit. Historical analysis reveals two critical issues: 1) The Period 2 order (115 units) is definitively lost after 10 periods. 2) The actual lead time is consistently 3 periods rather than the promised 2 (observed in orders from Periods 1, 4, and 5). Consequently, the current pipeline inventory for the OR engine's calculation (270 units) is inflated by the 115 lost units; however, since I cannot manually adjust the pipeline inventory field, I must adjust the base stock parameters to compensate. Demand has entered a lower-traffic regime since Period 5, averaging approximately 71 units per period (P5-P11). I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the observed reality. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) representing the 7 periods of the current regime (P5-P11). To account for the stockout and the lost shipment, I will use a high sigma_hat (recent_N, N=7) to ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is consistently 3 periods (not 2). Demand regime P5-P11 mean is 71 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the analysis confirms that the actual lead time (L) for chips(Regular) is consistently 3 periods rather than the promised 2 (four out of five recent arrivals had L=3). I am setting L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the extra period of demand coverage. Demand has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 5. For the last 8 periods (P5-P12), the mean demand is 70.875 with a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. The on-hand inventory is 59 and there are 165 units in transit (orders from P11 and P12). The Period 2 order of 115 units remains confirmed lost and does not impact pipeline inventory calculations. These parameters will help the OR backend set a base stock level that covers the 3-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=4) against the current demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P5-P12) mean: 70.875 units. Lead time is reliably 3 periods (4/5 recent deliveries had L=3).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling 59 units in Period 13. The demand regime shifted around Period 5; from P5 to P13, the average demand is 69.56 units (n=9). The recent demand (last 3 periods) average is slightly higher at 75.3, but given the range [48, 104] since P5, the regime mean of ~70 is stable. Lead time (L) has consistently shown an actual value of 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, P8, and P12), despite the promised L=2. The order from P2 (115 units) is confirmed lost. Currently, 222 units are in transit (ordered in P11, P12, P13). Using L=3 for the inventory policy is necessary to cover the lead time + review period (1+L=4). I will set L to explicit 3, and use the recent demand mean (N=9 since the P5 shift) for mu_hat. Sigma_hat is set to default as the backend's calculation over the historical dataset (which now includes the lower demand regime and higher variance) provides a safe buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown higher volatility in the recent regime starting at Period 5, with the most recent demand (P14) spiking to 128 units. The average demand from P5-P14 is 73.1 units. Lead time is consistently behaving closer to 3 periods (observed lead times: 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3). The Period 2 order (115 units) is confirmed lost. My goal is to set parameters that cover the risk of a 3-period lead time while accounting for the recent demand spike. I will use L=3 and set mu_hat based on the average of the last 10 samples (representing the lower-demand regime P5-P14) to provide the OR engine with the correct (1+L) scaling for a base-stock policy that needs to cover 4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed in Period 14 (128 units), significantly higher than the previous regime mean of ~70. Monitoring if this initiates a high-demand regime or is an outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand was 107 (following a demand of 128 in Period 14). This confirms a significant upward demand shift from the previous regime (~70). The average demand over the last two periods (14 and 15) is 117.5. The lead time (L) is consistently 3 periods based on 5 out of the last 6 successful deliveries. We are currently out of stock with 0 on-hand, and although there are 288 units in-transit (orders from P13, P14, P15), the current demand surge requires higher inventory targets. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for observed logistics. For mu_hat, I will use a recent_N of 2 to aggressively capture the new high-demand regime (avg ~117.5) and for sigma_hat I will use recent_N of 5 to capture the volatility during this transition.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 14: Demand increased from ~70 to ~117.5 (+67%) over the last two periods. Stockouts are currently occurring due to this spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 14 (P14-P16 demand: 128, 107, 80; mean ~105). This is significantly higher than the previous regime (P5-P13 mean ~71). Stockouts have occurred for four consecutive periods (P13-P16) because recent orders (P12-P13) were sized for the lower demand regime and in-transit inventory from the legacy regime was insufficient. The actual lead time is consistently 3 periods (observed in orders from P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12, P13). In-transit inventory is 394 units, primarily consisting of the large P16 order (163 units) and orders from P14-P15 (58 units each). Since on-hand is 0 and we are facing a high-demand regime with a 3-period lead time, I will set L to 3. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the high-demand volatility since Period 14. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the increased variance in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime persists (P14-P16): average demand increased to 105 units. Significant stockouts ongoing due to regime shift lag.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-67.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the demand regime shifted at Period 14. Average demand from P14-P17 is 98 units (128, 107, 80, 77), which is a significant increase from the previous ~70 unit mean. Although demand dipped in P16-P17, the lead time remains unstable. Observed lead times recently are 3, 3, 3, 3, and 1. An 'explicit' L of 3 is used to capture the most frequent delay. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to anchor to the latest demand regime start (Period 14). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility associated with this regime shift. Currently, on-hand inventory is 144 following a large arrival in P17 (163 units), with 199 in-transit, providing a temporary buffer while the OR engine recalibrates base stock to the higher consumption rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: mean increased from ~70 to ~98 (+40%) based on P14-P17 data. Lead time remains consistently 3 periods for most deliveries, despite transient 1-period arrivals (e.g., Period 16 order).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are observing a sustained demand regime shift that began in Period 14. The average demand from P14 to P18 is approximately 99.2 units per period (128, 107, 80, 77, 104), a significant increase from the previous mean of ~70. Lead times have consistently shown a pattern of 3 periods (evident in orders from P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12, P13, P14), despite an occasional 1-period arrival (P16). To ensure the OR backend adequately covers demand over the risk horizon (Lead time L + 1 review period), I am setting L to 3. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=5 to capture the mean of the current high-demand regime (approx 100 units/period). For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current volatility. This configuration helps the system recover from recent stockouts and align inventory with the new demand level.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher regime starting at Period 14. The average demand for this most recent period (P14-P19) is approximately 97 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and despite 357 units in-transit, the system has experienced recurring stockouts due to the demand jump and lead time variability. Speaking of lead time, while the promised lead time is 2, historical data shows 'lead_time=3' is the most frequent outcome (6 out of the last 10 arrivals). Therefore, setting L to an explicit value of 3 is necessary to ensure the backend calculates base stock requirements that cover the transit period and the current period's demand (L+1 = 4 periods of coverage). mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to capture the 97-unit mean of the current high-demand regime. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to properly account for the local volatility of this new regime and maintain the required service level (50% based on profit/holding cost ratio).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P14-P20) indicates a sustained high-demand regime with a mean of approximately 103.3 units (128, 107, 80, 77, 104, 86, 141), which is a significant increase from the previous ~70 unit mean. Period 20 recorded the highest demand yet (141), leading to a total stockout (on-hand is 0). Lead time has demonstrated high variability but mostly clusters at 3 periods (P11, P12, P13, P14 orders all took 3 periods). Although a 1-period arrival occurred at P17, the system must plan for the more frequent 3-period delay to avoid recurrent stockouts during this high-demand phase. I am setting L=3 (explicit) to account for this reality. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current high-demand regime (P14-P20). sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to reflect the increased volatility observed during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 persists: Mean demand increased from ~70 to ~103 (+47%) based on P14-P20 data. Stockouts are frequent due to volatility (max demand 141 in P20) and lead time variability.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 14, moving from a mean of ~70 to ~103 (Period 14-21 average: 103.1). Stockouts are persistent (0 on-hand currently) because of this demand step-up and lead time variability. Lead time is consistently reported as 3 periods for most orders (excluding a few statistical outliers), so L is set to 3. To stabilize inventory against this higher demand level and high variance (Period 20 peaked at 141), I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (Period 14-21) to capture this new elevated mean of approximately 103 units per period. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with the same window will account for the increased volatility seen during this regime shift.

Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced a prolonged stockout over the last three periods (P20-P22) due to order arrivals failing to keep pace with demand. Although the promised lead time is 2, the historical arrival data (specifically the conclude messages) confirms that the actual lead time is frequently 3 periods (6 out of the last 10 successful arrivals). The Period 2 order (115 units) is confirmed lost. With 414 units currently in transit (including orders from P15 onwards, many of which are now due or overdue given a 3-period lead time expectation), we must set parameters that allow for the replenishment of safety stock while recognizing the persistent high-demand regime. Using N=9 for demand stats covers the entire high-demand regime since P14. L=3 is used to reflect the reliable actual lead time delivery pattern.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 24. Since the demand regime shift at Period 14, the average demand has settled around 100 units (mean of P14-P23 is 98.4), with significant volatility (high of 141, low of 70). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we are coming off a period where we could only partially satisfy demand. Lead times continue to be unreliable, frequently hitting 3 periods (as seen with the Period 20 order arriving in P23). The in-transit pipeline (357 units) consists of orders from Periods 15 (58), 17 (26), 18 (49), and 19 (109). Note that the Period 15 order is now extremely overdue (9 periods) and likely lost. To prevent further stockouts given the current high-demand regime and 3-period lead time reality, I am setting L to 3. For mu_hat, I am using the mean of the high-demand regime (P14-P23, N=10), then multiplying by (1+L) to cover the 4-period risk window. For sigma_hat, I'm using the recent volatility from the same window to ensure the OR backend's service level calculation is robust against spikes like the 141 units seen in Period 20.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: High-demand regime (P14-P23) remains stable with a mean of 98.4. Period 15 order (58 units) is likely lost (9 periods elapsed). Lead time remains biased toward 3 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has stabilized at a significantly higher mean. Calculating demand over the last 11 periods (P14-P24), the mean is 99.45 units (1094 total / 11). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we are experiencing frequent stockouts. Lead time analysis: promised L=2, but historical performance (Period 1, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20) consistently shows L=3 is more probable (with occasional variability). Pipeline inventory is 393 units, but Period 15 (58 units) is likely lost (9 periods elapsed), and orders from P17-P19 are also delayed. To capture the higher demand regime and account for the 3-period lead time bias, I am using recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the volatility since P14. I am setting L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation covers the 4-period window (L+1) required to reach the next arrival in this higher demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand regime P14-P24 mean confirmed at 99.45 (+42% vs previous regime). Period 15 order (58 units) confirmed lost. Lead time remains biased at 3 periods despite promised 2.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 26. The demand regime from Period 14 onwards remains stable with a mean of approximately 99.45. Period 25 conclude shows on-hand inventory is 0, and there are significant stockouts occurring because arrivals are delayed. As established in previous insights, lead time is reliably 3 periods (not the promised 2), and the order from Period 15 is confirmed lost. Calculating pipeline inventory: In-transit is total 398 units, but we must subtract the lost P15 order (58 units) and the P2 total order which was previously flagged as lost. However, looking at the 'In-transit' figure of 398 and subtracting only the P15 lost order (58), the backend still sees 340 units in transit (P17, P18, P19, P20, P21, P24, P25 orders). To compensate for the lead time being 3 instead of 2, I set L=explicit (3). mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=12) to capture the high-demand regime since Period 14. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 14, with a mean demand of 100.3 units (calculated from Period 14 to Period 26). However, the system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time (L) is consistently biased toward 3 periods: although the promised L is 2, most recent arrivals (Periods 11, 12, 13, 14, 20) confirm a lead time of 3 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 400 reflects orders placed recently (specifically large volumes from Periods 17-19 and onwards) that are caught in this 3-period lead time window. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (1:1), a service level of 50% is technically optimal for the base stock formula, but to recover from stockouts and account for the frequent 3-period lead time, I am setting L to 3 explicitly and using a recent_N (N=13) to capture the high-demand regime since P14. This will help the backend calculate a sufficient base stock to cover the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 14-26 confirmed: mean 100.3 units. Lead time remains structurally biased at 3 periods (observed in 11/15 arrivals).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 context: Currently experiencing 0 on-hand inventory and persistent stockouts. Demand analysis: The high-demand regime starting at Period 14 remains stable. From Period 14 to Period 27, the mean demand is 100.2 units. Lead time analysis: Historical analysis (Carry-over insights and game history) confirms that the structural lead time is consistently 3 periods rather than the promised 2 (observed in the majority of successful arrivals). The pipeline inventory is currently 400 units, but with L=3, we must cover 4 periods of demand (L+1). I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to align with observed behavior. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (covering the high-demand regime from P14-P27) to capture the current mean of ~100. For sigma_hat, 'recent_N' with N=14 will provide a volatility estimate based on this specific regime, helping the OR backend adjust for the high demand variance and zero-stock scenario.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units since Period 14 (P14-P28 mean = 98.7s). Currently, we are facing significant stockouts (on-hand is 0) despite 399 units in-transit. Based on historical 'conclude' messages, the actual lead time (L) is consistently 3 periods rather than the promised 2 (observed in 11 of the last 15 successful deliveries). Recent arrivals (P28) showed an order from P26 arriving in 2 periods, but the majority of the pipeline (orders from P24 and P25) has not yet arrived by the end of P28, suggesting a 3rd period of lead time is likely. The OR backend uses L to calculate base stock as (1+L) * mean_demand; setting L to explicit 3 ensures the engine aims for a 4-period inventory coverage (395-400 units). I will use the last 15 periods (P14-P28) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this encompasses the entire high-demand regime and current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 14-28 confirmed: mean 98.7 units. Lead time remains structurally biased at 3 periods despite occasional deviations.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has consistently averaged around 99 units, despite significant volatility and ongoing lead-time reliability issues. The current on-hand inventory is 0, with 399 units in-transit. However, recent delivery history shows persistent delays and missing shipments (e.g., P15 order lost), while most successful arrivals reflect a lead time of 3 periods rather than the promised 2. Using L=3.0 via 'explicit' better captures the structural delay observed in 11 of the last 15 arrivals, helping the OR engine correctly size the pipeline inventory. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=16) to capture the stable high-demand regime from P14-P29 (mean ~99.3 units). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=16) to reflect the high volatility observed in this period (standard deviation ~20), ensuring a higher service level to mitigate frequent stockouts.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 14-30) maintains a mean of approximately 98 units, though recent observations show high volatility (65 to 138). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 404 units in-transit. Based on the history, structural lead time is consistently 3 periods rather than the promised 2 (observed in the majority of successful arrivals). The Period 15 order (58 units) and several other mid-game orders that haven't arrived are definitively lost, which the OR backend does not account for automatically. To ensure the backend doesn't underestimate the necessary base stock, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to cover the likely 4-period risk cycle (L+1). I will use the mean of the current regime (N=17, from Period 14 to 30) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the increased demand and volatility since the last shift. This strategy aims to recover from the current stockout state by reconciling the pipeline with the actual lead-time behavior.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 14. Calculating the mean from P14 to P31 (18 samples), the average demand is 99.4 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts recently. The structural lead time continues to be biased toward 3 periods rather than the promised 2 (verified by historical arrivals where L=3 is the mode). The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 404 units) currently covers approximately 4 periods of standard demand (404 / 99.4 \u2248 4.06), which is appropriate given a lead time of 3 periods + 1 review period requirement. I will set L to 3 to reflect actual delivery times, and use a recent_N of 18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's behavior precisely. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the persistent stockout risk during the current high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 14-31 confirmed: mean 99.4 units. Lead time continues to exhibit structural bias at 3 periods (mode) despite promised 2.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-demand regime since Period 14, with a mean demand of approximately 99.4 units and significant volatility. Currently, the SKU is experiencing a major stockout (on-hand inventory = 0), and several orders remain in-transit. Based on 'Carry-over Insights' and historical data, the actual lead time is structurally biased toward 3 periods (not the promised 2). We must adjust the OR parameters to reflect this longer lead time (L=3) and the current demand mean. Using L=3 means the target pipeline inventory (base stock) must cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand, roughly 400 units. Since current in-transit is 404 units and on-hand is 0, setting L=3 with recent demand statistics will allow the backend to stabilize around a base stock of ~400-500 depending on the calculated safety stock, preventing excessive ordering while aiming to resolve the stockout when the pipeline arrives.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 remains stable with a mean of approximately 99.5 units and high volatility. However, the system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time (L) is structurally biased towards 3 periods (observed consistently since P4), even though the promised L is 2. The pipeline inventory (404 units) currently consists of several orders that haven't arrived, likely due to this structural delay. I will set L to 3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the (L+1) demand window. Mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=20) to capture the current high-demand regime (P14-P33). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to account for the high variance (demand ranging from 65 to 141). This configuration aims to replenish stock levels quickly to meet the ~100 unit/period demand while covering the 3-period lead time.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 14 with a mean of approximately 100 units. Period 34 demand was 76, and the mean from Period 14 to Period 34 is 98.3 units. The lead time continues to show a significant structural bias towards 3 periods (mode) despite the promised 2. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant in-transit pipeline of 404 units. This pipeline is much larger than the required base stock (which for a 3-period lead time and ~100 mean demand would be ~400 units). I will set L to 3 to reflect the high probability of a 3-period arrival, and use N=21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire current high-demand regime (P14-P34). The backend will likely order 0 or very little given the large in-transit volume and 0 on-hand inventory, allowing the pipeline to clear.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 14, with a mean demand of approximately 99.4 units per period. I am maintaining the mu_hat forecast based on the last 22 periods (P14-P35) to capture this regime accurately. The lead time (L) remains structurally biased at 3 periods, rather than the promised 2, based on extensive historical observation (most recently confirmed in the carry-over insights). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 404 units in-transit. A notable amount of this in-transit inventory is significantly overdue and likely lost (specifically orders from Period 15, 18, 19, 24, and 25 are well beyond the 3-period lead time). However, recent history (P30-P35) shows several periods where no new orders were placed, and we are currently waiting for more recent orders to conclude. I will set L to 3 to reflect the actual supply chain behavior, and use the recent demand regime for mu and sigma to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover the extended lead time and high volatility.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 14 with a mean of approximately 100 units. Recent periods (P29-P36) maintain this pattern (mean 100, std ~24). However, the supply chain is severely disrupted. The structural lead time is 3 periods, but multiple orders from Period 19 onwards (specifically P19, P20, P21, P24, P25) have not arrived, leading to a prolonged stockout since Period 30. There are currently 404 units in-transit, but these represent old orders that are likely lost or significantly delayed. To force the OR engine to place a new order despite the high 'pipeline inventory', I am using 'explicit' L to reflect the 3-period reality and 'explicit' mu_hat. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is likely comprised of lost shipments, I need to ensure the system targets a base stock that triggers an fresh order. I will use N=23 for mu_hat (the length of the current regime P14-36) and L=3.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed supply chain failure. Orders from P19, P20, P21, P24, and P25 (totaling ~170+ units) are significantly past the 3-period lead time and likely lost. Demand remains stable in the P14-P36 regime (mean ~100).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a severe supply chain failure. Orders from Periods 19, 20, 21, 24, and 25 (totalling ~200+ units) are confirmed lost as they are now far beyond the observed 3-period lead time. Demand remains stable within the regime established at Period 14 (P14-P37 mean \u2248 100 units). On-hand inventory is 0, and 'In-transit' includes both the lost units and potentially any recent automated adjustments. To recover from high stockouts and mitigate the impact of lost shipments, I am setting L to 3 (the structural actual lead time) and using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=24 to capture the stability of the current high-demand regime since P14. This allows the OR backend to recalculate the necessary pipeline to cover the 4-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure exacerbated: total lost units from P19-P25 estimated at 200+. Structural lead time remains 3 periods. Demand regime P14-P37 mean = 100.1 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has encountered a severe and prolonged failure. Orders from Period 19 through Period 25 (excluding Period 20 and 21 arrivals in P23) are confirmed lost, totaling over 200 units. Additionally, the backend currently shows 404 units in-transit, yet no arrivals have occurred since Period 30. Despite the promised lead time of 2, the structural lead time is 3 periods, and the current system state shows extreme delays or permanent losses for all pipeline inventory. Demand from Period 14 to Period 38 remains stable with a mean of 99.7 units. Due to the 0 on-hand inventory and the unreliability of the 'In-transit' figure (much of which is likely lost), I will set L=3 to account for the structural delay. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=25 (covering the stable high-demand regime since P14) to maintain an accurate forecast. Similarly, sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=25 to capture recent volatility. This configuration aims to trigger an order to replenish the zero on-hand balance while accounting for the extended lead time.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of severe failure. From P18 to P39, we have placed orders totaling 404 units, yet almost none have arrived since P23. Specific missing orders include P19 (109), P24 (36), P25 (5), P26 (2), P28 (1), and P30 (6), many of which are now mathematically confirmed as lost given the historical maximum lead time of 3 periods. Demand from P14-P39 has stabilized around a mean of 98.7 units (recent mean: 98.4 units over the last 26 periods). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the 404 units 'in-transit' are largely fictitious/lost shipments that the OR backend still counts toward pipeline inventory, I must use an 'explicit' L to account for the structural lead time of 3 periods and an 'explicit' mu_hat to force more orders through the OR engine's budget/cap logic. By setting mu_hat high enough, I aim to trigger orders that compensate for the lost pipeline units to restore service levels for the remaining 10 periods.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed (P18-P39): The 404 units currently in-transit consist of at least 200+ units from orders (P18, P19, P24, etc.) that are essentially lost. Demand remains steady at ~99 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has effectively collapsed. As of Period 41, the in-transit inventory of 404 units is largely comprised of lost shipments from Periods 18, 19, 24, 25, and others, which are now dozens of periods overdue. On-hand inventory is 0 and has been for several periods, leading to continuous stockouts. Demand has been stable since Period 14 with a mean of ~99 units per period. Because the backend OR engine subtracts 'pipeline inventory' (the 404 units) from the calculated base stock, it will not place new orders despite the stockout, as it believes 404 units are coming. To force the engine to order, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it high enough to overcome the phantom pipeline inventory. I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods. With L=2 (promised) or L=3 (observed mode), a base stock of ~400 units is needed. However, to trigger an order when 404 units are already 'in-transit', mu_hat must exceed the in-transit value plus current demand. I will set L to 3 (actual) and mu_hat to a value that reflects the desired target inventory level plus the 'lost' pipeline. Calculation: Target Base Stock (100 * 4) = 400. To get the backend to order ~100 units now, I need base_stock to be ~500. At L=3, mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 400. I set mu_hat to 600 explicitly to force the system to bypass the stuck pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Continued supply chain bypass required. Total phantom in-transit units (404) are blocking new orders. Demand remains stable at ~100 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we are dealing with a severe supply chain breakdown where approximately 404 units labeled as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (orders from P18-P36). These units are 'phantom' inventory that prevents the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I am setting L to 1 and mu_hat/sigma_hat to high values. Since the backend capped policy for orders is 'order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)', and the cap formula includes mu_hat/(1+L), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a value high enough to overcome the 603 units total in-transit (404 lost + 199 placed in P41) and trigger a fulfillment order. Demand (P14-P41) mean is ~100. With 0 on-hand and 199 valid units in-transit (from P41), and a structural lead time of 3, the system needs a massive signal to ignore the dead 404 units and secure stock for the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Supply chain bypass remains active. In-transit pool (603) contains ~404 lost units that must be offset by inflated mu_hat to allow the OR controller to place necessary replenishment orders.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show severe dysfunction. High in-transit numbers (1143 units) are misleading because they include substantial quantities from historical orders (Period 18 through Period 25) that are definitely lost. These 'phantom' units prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders. To bypass this, I am maintaining an significantly inflated mu_hat. The demand regime from P14 onwards is stable with a mean of ~100. Since structural lead time is 3 periods, the base stock should cover (3+1) periods, approximately 400 units. However, because the system subtracts the 1143 in-transit units from the base stock calculation, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome this deficit and trigger replenishment. Given the jump in in-transit from 603 to 1143 (due to the bypass orders from P41 and P42), I will further increase mu_hat to ensure continued ordering until arrivals physically manifest. I set L to 3 to reflect the consistent structural delay.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain exhibits a significant structural failure where orders placed between Period 18 and Period 40 (approx. 603 units) are lost or indefinitely delayed. To bypass this, I have transitioned the OR controller to an 'inflated mu' strategy to overcome the phantom pipeline inventory. Demand remains stable in the current regime (P14-P43) with a mean of 99.1 units and standard deviation of approx 21.0. Given the structural lead time of 3 periods (L=3), the base stock calculation needs to cover (L+1)=4 periods. Current 'In-transit' is 1500 units, which include the recent recovery orders from P41 (199), P42 (540), and P43 (357), plus the ~404 lost units. To trigger a new order of ~100 units in Period 44, the target base stock must exceed the observed pipeline. Since the OR engine's order calculation is 'base_stock - pipeline', I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat set to (1+L)*mean + lost_units (4*100 + 1100 = 1500) to ensure the system doesn't stop ordering while waiting for phantom inventory that will never arrive. L is set to explicit 3 to match observed reality.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bypass active: mu_hat must be significantly inflated to offset ~600+ lost units in the pipeline inventory view.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised by 'phantom' in-transit inventory\u2014orders from earlier periods (P18-P37) that are essentially lost but still counted as pipeline stock by the OR engine. Period 41's order finally arrived in Period 44 (L=3), confirming that the system can still deliver if the OR engine is forced to bypass the existing pipeline. Currently, in-transit inventory is 1401, but the majority of this represents historical lost units. To trigger new orders and maintain on-hand inventory for the remaining 5 periods, I will continue the 'bypass' strategy by inflating mu_hat. I am using an explicit mu_hat of 1600. This value is calculated to exceed the ~1400 units in-transit while accounting for 4 periods (L+1) of demand (~400 units), which forces the backend to place more orders. Lead time (L) remains set to 3 periods based on consistent historical delays. Demand remains stable around 100 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Supply chain bypass requires significant mu_hat inflation to offset ~1200+ lost/stalled units in-transit. First successful arrival since P30 occurred in P44 with L=3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-820.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain flow has resumed after a significant period of failure. In Period 45, shipments from P42 (540 units) and P43 (357 units) arrived, following the arrival of the P41 shipment in Period 44. This has cleared the 'lost' inventory backlog in terms of physical availability, resulting in an on-hand inventory of 919 units. The structural lead time remains 3 periods. Demand from Period 14 through Period 45 remains stable with a mean of approximately 99 units. Since the current on-hand inventory (919) far exceeds the expected demand for the remainder of the game (Periods 46-50), and the in-transit inventory (582) is still high (containing some likely lost older orders and more recent ones), the OR controller should naturally stop ordering to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat to the actual regime mean (~100/period) and L to 3 to allow the inventory to deplete naturally. No further bypass/inflation is needed now that on-hand stock is sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain flow resumed Period 44-45: Orders from P41, P42, and P43 arrived, ending the stockout phase. On-hand inventory now exceeds remaining lifecycle demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-663.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 of 50. In Period 45, massive orders placed during the 'supply chain bypass' phase (P41-P43) arrived, resulting in an on-hand inventory of 791 units. With only 4 periods remaining (47, 48, 49, 50) and a mean demand of approximately 100 units/period, the total expected remaining demand is roughly 400. Our current on-hand inventory (791) plus non-lost in-transit units already significantly exceeds this total requirement. To maximize profit and minimize holding costs for the remaining periods, we must stop ordering immediately. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat to 0 to prevent the OR engine from placing any further orders, effectively coasting on existing stock until the end of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Inventory surplus confirmed. On-hand inventory (791) is sufficient to cover all remaining periods (P47-P50) given demand regime mean of ~100. Ordering stopped to minimize holding costs.

Daily Profit: $102.00, Daily Holding Cost: $689.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-587.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of a 50-period game. The current on-hand inventory is 689 units, which significantly exceeds the total expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (P48, P49, P50). Given the stable demand regime mean of approximately 100 units per period (P14-P47), total remaining demand is forecast at ~300 units. Carrying any more inventory will only incur unnecessary holding costs of $1/unit/period, while stockout risk is essentially zero. Consequently, I am setting all parameters to minimum values to ensure the OR engine places zero orders for the remainder of the session. The supply chain has cleared enough units from the late-game bypass orders to reach a safe termination state.

Carry-over insight: End-of-life inventory surplus: On-hand inventory as of P48 (689) covers 200%+ of remaining lifecycle demand (approx 300 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-475.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the penultimate period (Period 49 of 50). Current on-hand inventory is 582 units. The stable demand regime (P14-P48) has a mean of approximately 100 units. With only two periods remaining (P49 and P50), the total expected demand is roughly 200 units. Our current on-hand inventory (582) is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand for the lifecycle of the simulation. Placing any further orders would only increase holding costs without providing additional revenue. Therefore, ordering is stopped by maintaining the current strategy of not requesting new stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-294.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the start of Period 50, which is the final period of the game. The current on-hand inventory is 438 units. Historical demand has been stable around a mean of ~100 units per period (P14-P49 mean \u2248 99.4). Even accounting for the potential of high-end demand volatility (the maximum observed demand was 144 in P49), the 438 units currently in stock are significantly more than enough to cover the demand for the final period. Any further ordering would only result in unnecessary holding costs, as orders placed now would not arrive until after the game concludes (given the structural lead time of 3 periods) and on-hand inventory already exceeds projected demand. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure no new order is placed.
