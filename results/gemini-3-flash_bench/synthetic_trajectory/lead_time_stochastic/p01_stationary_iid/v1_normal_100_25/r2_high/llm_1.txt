Looking at the provided historical samples, demand for the first 5 periods was 100, 69, 92, 77, and 111, averaging approximately 90 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 4. To bridge the gap until then, I need to cover Period 1, 2, and 3 demand from this order or future ones, though currently, on-hand and in-transit are both 0. Given the average demand of ~90 and the need to build initial stock for lead time (L+1 = 3 periods), I will target an order of 300 units to establish 3 periods of coverage (90 * 3 + safety margin).",

The promised lead time is 2. Inventory state: Currently 0 on-hand due to the Period 14 stockout. In-transit pipeline consists of 120 (ordered P13), 100 (ordered P14), and 100 (ordered P12). Wait, checking history: P12 order (100) was placed, P13 order (120) placed, P14 order (100) placed. In-transit is reported as 420. This suggests P9, P10, and P12-P14 orders might be in there, but concluding messages show P9 and P10 arrived in P12. The 420 in-transit must be: P12 (100), P13 (120), P14 (100), and potentially the phantom P2 order (100) still lingering in the system total. Effective pipeline: We expect P12's 100 to likely arrive in P15 or P16. To cover 3 periods of demand (L+1 = 2+1=3) at ~100 units/period (safety buffer for recent high demand), we need ~300 units. Total pipeline (excluding P2) is 320. However, we are at 0 stock and have missed demand. I will order 100 to maintain a rolling buffer against the lead-time volatility and replenish the lost sales momentum.",
