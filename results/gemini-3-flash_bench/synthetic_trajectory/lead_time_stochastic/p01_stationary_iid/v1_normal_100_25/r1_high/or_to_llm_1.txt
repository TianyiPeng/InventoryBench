The OR algorithm suggests ordering 118 units based on a base-stock policy that targets a high service level (critical fractile = 19/20 = 0.95). Starting from an empty inventory (0 on-hand, 0 in-transit), the priority is to establish a pipeline that covers the current period plus the 2-period lead time (L+1=3).

This consists of P6 (110 units, 4 periods ago - likely lost as it's past the max observed lead time of 3), P9 (130 units), and the P2 lost shipment (121 units). According to carry-over insights, P2 is lost. P6 is also highly suspect. Therefore, effective pipeline is only the P9 order (130 units). 3. Demand Analysis: Demand has increased recently (P7:122, P8:121, P9:145), showing a mean shift from ~95 to ~130. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 7 units is extremely low because it likely counts the lost P2/P6 shipments (231 units) as pipeline inventory.

Comparison to OR: OR suggests 0 units because it calculates the base stock level (for L=2) as being fully covered by the current 162 on-hand plus a massive in-transit total (it likely hasn't discounted the 231 lost units). If we ignore lost units, OR's pipeline check would be (162 + 426) = 588, which is well above its base stock. Adjusted pipeline is actually 195. 5. Action: To cover 3 periods of demand at a safety-conscious rate of 120 units/period (360 total), we have 357 units available.

Even with the corrected pipeline of 640 units, mathematically, we have over 6 periods of demand coverage in transit. However, with zero stock on hand and a total cessation of deliveries for 5 periods, we are in a stockout crisis.

Recent history shows high volatility: P31 arrived in 1 period, P32 arrived in 1 period, but P29, P30, and P34/P35 have not arrived. I assume a base lead time of 2-3 periods but must account for significant shipping losses.\n\n2. **Inventory & Pipeline Analysis**: Visible On-hand is 0. System 'In-transit' is 1321. However, I have verified or highly suspected losses for the following periods: P2(121), P6(110), P15(50), P18(120), P19(100), P24(100), P29(120), and P30(120). Total estimated lost units = 841. \n   Effective Pipeline = 1321 - 841 = 480 units. These comprise P31(120 - wait, P31 already arrived), P32(120 - already arrived), P33(120), P34(115), P35(125). Let's re-verify: Total orders P1-P35 = 3591. Total arrived = 2270. In-transit = 1321.

Since 841 units are likely lost, the 'real' pipeline is much thinner. With 0 on-hand and a demand of ~110, I need to maintain a pipeline that covers at least 3 periods (L+1). Target Stock = 110 * 3 = 330 units. Current effective pipeline (P33-P35) is 360 units. While this technically covers the target, the high loss rate (approx 30-40% of orders) suggests I should over-order to ensure at least one shipment gets through.

Pipeline Analysis: System 'In-transit' is 1326. Based on history, verified lost shipments total 841 units (P2=121, P6=110, P15=50, P18=120, P19=100, P24=100, P29=120, P30=120).

Adjusting for those arrivals, the remaining active pipeline is P33 (120), P35 (125), and P36 (120) = 365 units. 3. Inventory & Demand Analysis: Current on-hand is 0. Demand remains steady at ~110-120 units. With an effective pipeline of 365 units covering roughly 3 periods of demand, we need to maintain a continuous ordering flow to prevent stockouts, especially given the high stockout penalty (Profit $19 vs Holding $1). 4.

Since the real active pipeline is 360 units and on-hand is 52, the total coverage is 412 units. Given a lead time of 2 and an average demand of 110, we require a base stock of ~330-350 units.

These effective units are from P40 (100 - already arrived in P43), P41 (100 - already arrived in P44), P42 (100), P43 (100), and P44 (60). Thus, the actual undelivered pipeline is 260 units (P42-P44 orders). Current demand has softened to ~65 units/period (P41-P44 avg). With 70 units on-hand and 260 units in the real pipeline (total 330 units), I have enough coverage for approximately 5 periods of demand.

The 'In-transit' total is 1441 units, but based on the carry-over insights, at least 1081 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30, P33, P37). This leaves an effective pipeline of 360 units: P44 (60 units), P45 (60 units), and P46 (120 units), plus any potential arrivals from the remaining unaccounted 'In-transit' units. \n2. **Inventory & Demand Analysis**: Current on-hand inventory is 73 units. Recent demand (P41-P46) has fluctuated between 62 and 116, averaging approximately 76 units per period. The 360 units in the effective pipeline cover roughly 4.7 periods of demand at the current rate.\n3. **OR Recommendation Comparison**: The OR agent recommends 0 units. This is likely because it sees the massive system 'In-transit' (1441) and determines that no more stock is needed. However, when correcting for 1081 lost units, the effective pipeline is much smaller. \n4. **Final Strategy**: Since there are only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47, P48, P49, P50), and we have 73 units on hand plus 360 units in the reliable pipeline (P44-P46), we already have 433 units available or coming. With a demand mean of ~80, we need ~320 units to finish the game.
