Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows a mean of 89.8 (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) and a standard deviation of 16.96. Since this is the initial period with no observed lead time departures or demand regime shifts yet, I will use all available samples (N=5) to calculate parameters. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that accounts for demand during the current period plus the 2-period lead time (L+1=3 periods).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory, ordered 118 units, and faced a demand of 89. Since arrivals happen after the decision phase and the promised lead time is 2 periods, the 0 units arrived in Period 1 as expected (lead time 2 means an order placed in P1 arrives in P3). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 118 units in-transit. The demand history [100, 69, 92, 77, 111] (pre-game) and P1 demand (89) shows a relatively stable mean around 90. Given the lead time of 2, the pipeline needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (including P1) to capture the current demand level and 'default' for lead time and sigma since there is no evidence yet of lead time deviation or significant volatility shifts.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time (L) is 2. The Period 1 order (118 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 3 and will be visible at the start of Period 4. The Period 2 order (115 units) is expected in Period 4 and visible in Period 5. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 (89 and 98 units respectively). Total in-transit is 233 units (118 + 115). Historical demand samples are [100, 69, 92, 77, 111], with a mean of 89.8 and a standard deviation of 16.9. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the full recent distribution, and 'default' for L as there is no evidence yet to suggest the promised lead time of 2 is incorrect.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2. Orders were placed in Period 1 (118 units), Period 2 (115 units), and Period 3 (66 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests a delay or a longer actual lead time than promised. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have lost all demand from Periods 1-3. Demand samples are [100, 69, 92, 77, 111] (pre-game) and [89, 98, 114] (in-game). The mean demand is approximately 93.75. Since the promised lead time of 2 is not being met (P1 order did not arrive in P3), I will tentatively increase the lead time estimate (L) to 3 to account for this delay and ensure the base stock calculation covers more periods of demand. I will use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to capture the recent slight upward trend in demand (last 5 samples including 2 in-game).

Daily Reward (R_t): $321.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)': Period 1 order (118 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3). Period 2 order (115 units) has not yet arrived (at least 3 periods). Period 3 order (66 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). The variation in observed lead times (1 and 3) relative to the promised 2 suggests volatility in shipping. Average lead time from concluded orders is (3+1)/2 = 2. Demand over the first 4 periods was 89, 98, 114, 101 (mean=100.5, std=10.3), and Period 5 demand is 111. The current on-hand inventory is 83, with 234 in transit. Given the lead time variability, I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the average actual lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current demand distribution, ensuring the base stock level targets the correct service level while accounting for the established demand mean and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $157.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Based on the history, demand has been relatively stable with an average of approximately 92.5 units over the first 5 periods (samples: 100, 69, 92, 77, 111 - though the 'conclude' messages show slightly different realized demand: 89, 98, 114, 101, 48). The mean of realized demand is 90. The lead time is volatile: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3's arrived in 1 period. The promised lead time is 2. Currently, we have 35 units on hand and 345 units in transit (orders from P2, P4, and P5). Since actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3, I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average observed performance. For demand (mu_hat), the recent drop to 48 in Period 5 might be an outlier or a shift; I will use recent_N=5 to capture the overall average while weighting recent history. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture the observed volatility.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 6 where demand (63) exceeded supply (35). The game history shows high lead time variability: Lead time for the Period 1 order was 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period. Currently, 368 units are in-transit (orders from P2, P4, P5, and P6). Given the promised lead time is 2, the P2 order (115 units) is now overdue (placed P2, should have arrived P4 or P5). The P4 order (119 units) is also expected to arrive imminently. Demand over the last 6 periods has averaged 85.5 units, though recent periods (P5=48, P6=63) are lower than the start. I will use a conservative lead time estimate of 2 (relying on 'calculate' to weight actuals) and use N=6 for demand parameters to capture the full recent history while managing the current stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability observed: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. P2 order is currently overdue (placed P2, not arrived by P6 contribute).

Daily Reward (R_t): $151.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe significant lead time variability and a potentially lost or severely delayed shipment from Period 2. Specifically, Period 1 took 3 periods, Period 3 took 1 period, and Period 4 took 3 periods. The order from Period 2 (115 units) is now 6 periods late (ordered P2, currently P8) and should be considered lost for current planning purposes. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows an average of 83.25 units over the first 8 periods (including samples provided in prompt), with recent demand being slightly lower. Given the lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods), I will set the explicit lead time to 3 to ensure the base stock covers the maximum observed realistic delay. mu_hat will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent demand average (~75 units/period) across the lead plus review time (1+3=4 periods). sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to capture the standard deviation of recent fluctuations. This conservative approach buffers against the demonstrated lead time unpredictability and the loss of the Period 2 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Order placed Period 2 (115 units) likely lost or indefinitely delayed (6 periods elapsed since order). Lead time is highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $327.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we analyze the demand and lead-time patterns. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' over 8 periods shows a mean of 83.8 units/period, but with high volatility (observed values 48 to 114). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations are [3, 1, 3, 3, 1]. Notably, the order from Period 2 (115 units) is now 7 periods old and has not arrived, confirming it is lost. The pipeline (In-transit) is 161 (orders from Period 6 and 8), and On-hand is 89. Given the high lead-time variance (ranging from 1 to 3, plus lost orders), I will set L to 3 to be conservative. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the mean of the most recent 5 samples (P4-P8), which is 74.4 units/period. The backend will calculate (1+L)*mu_hat, resulting in a base stock level covering 4 periods of demand. This defensive posture compensates for the lost shipment and lead-time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: P2 order (115 units) confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Lead time remains unstable between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, demand remains stable with an average of approximately 82 units across the last 9 periods. However, lead time is highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P7: 1, P8: 1). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (115 units) is confirmed lost as it has been 8 periods since placement. The on-hand inventory is 60 units, which is less than one period of average demand. There are 229 units in transit (from P6 and P9), but the timing of their arrival is uncertain due to lead-time instability. To protect against the 3-period lead-time scenario (L=3) and ensure availability over the 4-period risk horizon (L+1), I will set L to 3 and use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility. This conservative lead time setting helps the OR backend maintain a higher safety stock to buffer against delayed arrivals or further lost shipments.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after demand for Period 10 (83 units) exhausted the available 60 units. Lead time analysis: P2 order (115 units) is confirmed lost (9 periods elapsed). Observed lead times are: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1, P8=1. This yields an average lead time of 2.0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time of 2, despite significant volatility between 1 and 3 periods. Demand has remained relatively stable across the first 10 periods (Mean \u2248 80.2, Std Dev \u2248 23.9). However, because on-hand inventory is currently zero and we have a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), we need to ensure the Pipeline Inventory (305 units) is accounted for correctly. The OR backend uses (1+L) periods of demand for the base stock. With L=2, it looks at 3 periods. I will use 'calculate' for L to use the historical average (2.0) and 'recent_N' for demand to capture recent variability while smoothing. The 305 units in-transit (from P6, P9, P10 orders) should arrive soon; the P6 order (23 units) is now at lead_time=4 and may be delayed/lost, so I will monitor this closely.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: P6 order (23 units) is overdue (placed P6, not arrived by P10 conclude - 4 periods elapsed). Regular lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating strictly between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing a critical inventory shortage with 0 units on-hand and an ongoing stockout since Period 10. The system confirms several supply chain issues: the order from P2 (115 units) is lost, and the order from P6 (23 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods elapsed vs. promised 2), making it likely lost as well. Observed lead times for successful deliveries have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P7: 1, P8: 1). To mitigate this volatility and the risk of lost shipments, I will set an explicit lead time L=3 to ensure the backend computes a safety stock covering the maximum observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5-period average (P7-P11) is approximately 77.6 units/period. Over a (3+1) period horizon, mu_hat should be approximately 310. Using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 allows the OR backend to adapt to this recent demand level while considering the longer lead time. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to capture the current demand variability.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (23 units) confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed without arrival). Lead time remains erratic but upper-bounded by 3 periods for successful arrivals.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 105 units. Analysis of historical lead times shows high volatility (1, 2, and 3 periods), with two orders (P2 and P6) successfully identified as lost after 7 and 5 periods respectively. The most recent deliveries (P9 and P10) arrived with lead times of 3 and 2 periods, suggesting the system is currently functioning within the 2-3 period range. I will set L to 'calculate' to capture this weighted average of the volatile but existing arrival pattern. For demand, historical samples (89, 98, 114, 101, 48, 63, 54, 104, 52, 83, 95, 62) suggest a mean around 80. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to cover the full range of observed fluctuations while remaining responsive to the lower demand seen in the mid-periods. This configuration balances the risk of lost shipments and lead time uncertainty against the holding cost of units that do eventually arrive in clusters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $240.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 36 units and in-transit is 228 units. Historical lead times for successful arrivals have been 1, 2, or 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1, P9:3, P10:2). Two orders (P2 and P6) are confirmed lost after 7+ and 5 periods respectively. This indicates a stochastic environment where about 20% of orders fail to arrive. Demand over the last 13 periods shows a mean of approximately 79 units (sum=1028). To mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by lost orders and volatile lead times (L=1-3), I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of successful arrivals) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer protection interval. mu_hat is set using recent_N=13 to capture the full range of historical demand, and sigma_hat is set to explicit=60. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR engine will naturally target a high service level (~80%). By assuming L=3, we increase the safety stock to buffer against the 1-in-5 chance of an order being lost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained order loss rate of approximately 15-20% (P2 and P6 lost). Lead time for successful deliveries remains volatile between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 after stockouts in Period 14. Historical lead times for successful arrivals are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods: P1(3), P3(1), P4(3), P5(3), P7(1), P8(1), P9(3), P10(2), and P11(3). The pipeline inventory (295 units) accounts for orders from P12 (8 units), P13 (44 units), and P14 (105 units), plus whatever was ordered in the previous decision phase (P15). However, significant order loss continues (P2 and P6 were never delivered), suggesting a roughly 15-20% failure rate. Demand remains relatively stable but fluctuated higher recently (128 in P14). To mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by lead-time volatility and lost shipments, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 (the upper bound of successful deliveries) and the 'recent_N' method for demand (N=5) to capture recent consumption patterns. This higher L and localized demand average will result in a higher base stock, providing a safety buffer against intermittent supply failures.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, the system state for chips(Regular) shows 0 on-hand inventory and 386 units in-transit. The game history confirms significant supply chain disruptions: orders from Period 2 and Period 6 were lost, and lead times for successful deliveries fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.4 periods). Demand remains relatively stable with periodic spikes (mean ~85 units). Total pipeline inventory (386) is composed of orders from Period 13 (44), Period 14 (105), and Period 15 (99). Given that the Period 13 order (placed 3 periods ago) has not arrived yet, and we are currently at 0 inventory, we are in a stockout situation. To improve the backend's calculation, I am setting the lead time (L) to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of successful arrivals and account for the risk of delays. For demand (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent demand fluctuations (average ~85 units). For sigma (sigma_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture current volatility. These parameters will raise the base stock level to better handle the observed delivery delays and the 15-20% loss rate.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Looking at recent demand (Periods 14-16: 128, 107, 80), the average demand is approximately 105 units. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times for the last 5 successful arrivals were: 3, 2, 3, 3, 3 periods. This suggests an effective lead time (L) of 3. Two orders have been lost historically (P2, P6 representing ~12.5% loss rate). There are 342 units in transit (P14: 105, P15: 99, P16: 0, P17 decision yet to be added). Current pipeline (342) covers roughly 3.2 periods of demand (342/105). To prevent future stockouts while accounting for the high lead time volatility and high holding cost relative to stockout loss, the OR parameters should reflect the recent average demand of ~105 and an L of 3. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility and set L to an explicit value of 3 based on the consistent recent lag of 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last 3 deliveries (P11, P12, P13 orders arrived at P14, P15, P16 respectively). Demand remains volatile with a recent 3-period average around 105 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of the start of Period 18, we observe that the lead time for chips(Regular) has stabilized at 3 periods for the last four successful deliveries (Orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14 arrived at P14, P15, P16, and P17 respectively). The pipeline inventory is currently high (299 units), composed of orders from Period 15 (99 units), Period 17 (62 units), and the large order placed in Period 16 (assumed around 138 given the 0 order output from the OR but high pipeline growth). Demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) has averaged approximately 92.2 units. Given the service level target (critical ratio = 0.8) and the proven 3-period lead time, I will set L to 'explicit' 3 to account for the observation delay plus arrival timing. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current demand velocity, which will ensure base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has maintained stability at 3 periods for 4 consecutive successful arrivals (P11-P14 orders). Recent demand (P13-P17) is averaging 92 units per period.

Daily Profit: $112.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 19 with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows a sustained lead time of 3 periods for the last 5 successful deliveries (P11, P12, P13, P14, P15 - although P15's arrival will be confirmed in Period 20's start, it followed the P14 cycle). The 'In-transit' quantity of 383 units covers the orders from P15 (99), P17 (62), and P18 (84), plus P16 (which was 0 units). Note that orders from P15 and P17 are expected to arrive in Period 18-19 resolution, meaning we should see stock in the next conclude message. I am setting L to 3 to reflect this established lead-time reality, which is longer than the promised 2. Demand has been relatively stable but volatile around a mean of ~85-90 units. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (approx 90 units/period) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. Setting L=3 and using these methods ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that accounts for the 4-period risk horizon (L+1) while acknowledging the longer actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last 5 successful cycles (Orders placed P11-P15). Current order-to-arrival cycle consistently exceeds the promised 2 periods by 1 extra period.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, on-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of the history shows that the actual lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods for the last 5 successful arrivals (Periods 14 through 17 confirms origins from P11-P15), which is consistently higher than the promised 2 periods. Orders placed in P18 and P19 are expected to arrive in P21 and P22 respectively, explaining the current inventory gap. Demand has been relatively consistent but volatile; following the carry-over insight, the last 7 periods (P13-P19) average approximately 93 units. Given the service level goal (Profit=4, Holding=1 => 80% critical ratio), the OR engine needs to account for the actual observed lead time of 3 periods (L=3) to correctly calculate 'pipeline inventory' and 'base stock' across the (L+1) horizon. Calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) captures the current regime's volatility and mean effectively.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has remained stable at 3 periods for 6 consecutive successful cycles (Orders placed P11-P16).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 433 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last six successful delivery cycles (Orders P11-P16). However, the conclude messages for P18-P20 show that orders placed in Period 15 and Period 16 have arrived or are due, but we are currently seeing a 'stockout' in confirmation messages (P18-P20 conclude show zero arrivals). Looking at the history, orders P15 (99 units) and P16 (0 units) should have arrived by P18 or P19 if lead time was 3. Order P17 (62 units) was placed at P17 and would be due at P20 (3-period lead time). The fact that P18, P19, and P20 conclude messages show 0 arrivals suggests we might be experiencing another period of delayed shipments or a transition in arrival timing. Demand has shown a significant spike in Period 20 (141 units), with the last 5 periods (P16-P20) averaging 97.6 units. To account for the shifted lead time (stabilized at 3) and the recent demand trend, I am setting L to 3 and using a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the latest volume effectively.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent history confirms a stable lead time of 3 periods (observed for orders P11 through P16). Although we are currently experiencing a stockout (On-hand: 0) and zero arrivals in the last 4 periods (P18-P21), this is explained by the decision to order 0 units in P16 and P20, and the logic of a 3-period lead time where orders from P18 are not expected until P21's resolution (visible P22). To account for the confirmed shift from the promised L=2 to the actual L=3, I am using explicit lead time of 3. Demand remains relatively stable but volatile; the mean of the last 10 periods (P12-P21) is approximately 95.6, which aligns with the long-term average. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent variance while acknowledging the higher demand volatility (e.g., P20 demand was 141). Pipeline inventory is high (435), but since we are currently empty and the backend order cap is based on (1+L), setting L=3 ensures the base stock calculation properly covers the 4-period risk horizon (review + lead time).

Carry-over insight: Lead time has remained stable at 3 periods for 7 consecutive successful cycles (Orders placed P11-P17 arrived by P20).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 23. On-hand inventory is 0, and the system is heavily stock-depleted with a large backlog of unsatisfied demand in the previous 5 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 435 units includes orders from Period 15 (99 units), 17 (62 units), 18 (84 units), 19 (50 units), 21 (2 units), and potentially very old ones, although carry-over insights suggest a 15-20% loss rate (P2 and P6 were confirmed lost). However, lead time has consistently shown stability at 3 periods for the last 7 successful deliveries (P11-P17). Under L=3, the order from P15 (99 units) was expected to arrive during P18's resolution, P17 (62 units) during P20's resolution, and P18 (84 units) during P21's resolution. The fact that 'On-hand' is 0 in P23 despite these expected arrivals strongly suggests a severe disruption in the supply chain (either a significant lead-time extension beyond 3 periods or a cluster of lost shipments). I will set L to 'explicit' at 4 to account for the increasing delay and set mu_hat to 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect the mean demand of approximately 98 units per period. The sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture current volatility. The OR backend will see 435 in pipeline and try to reach the base stock; if the backend perceives these 435 units as valid, 'final order' will likely be capped or zero, which is appropriate until the existing pipeline either arrives or is confirmed lost.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply chain disruption starting P18: Orders from P15, P17, and P18 (totalling 245 units) have not arrived within the previously stable 3-period lead time window, resulting in 5 consecutive periods of zero sales and depleted on-hand inventory.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe disruption. While Period 23 saw a small arrival of 2 units (ordered in Period 21), orders from Period 15 (99 units), 17 (62 units), 18 (84 units), and 19 (50 units) are now critically overdue, significantly exceeding the previously stable 3-period lead time. This indicates either a massive backlog or a cluster of lost shipments. On-hand inventory is zero and sales have been lost for 6 consecutive periods (except for the 2 units in P23). I am keeping L at 4 to reflect the current delay and increase the base stock target, although the primary issue is the non-arrival of the 'In-transit' pile (532 units). I will use a recent demand window of 10 periods to capture current demand levels (~91/period) while ignoring the zero-sales periods which were supply-constrained, not demand-constrained.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption intensified: Orders from Period 15, 17, 18, and 19 (295 units combined) are significantly overdue (5-8 periods elapsed), suggesting a high probability of loss or extreme systemic delay. Only a small order from Period 21 arrived quickly (L=2) in Period 23.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing extreme disruption. Orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totalling 295 units) are significantly overdue (5-9 periods elapsed), following a history of lost shipments (P2, P6). While P21 arrived in 2 periods, the massive 'In-transit' quantity of 534 units vs. zero 'On-hand' suggests that the pipeline is blocked or unreliable. Demand remains stable, with the most recent 5-period average (P20-P24) at 102.4 units and the full historical average at approximately 90 units. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock, and our 'In-transit' is bloated by likely-lost orders, the OR engine will refuse to place new orders unless we adjust parameters. I will set L to 3 (the last stable observed lead time) but use an 'explicit' L to reflect the increased risk. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=10) to capture current demand levels (~900 for mu_hat at L=3) while allowing the backend to calculate volatility. However, to bypass the 'In-transit' block, I must ensure the computed base_stock exceeds 534. A base_stock covering 4 periods (L+1) at 100 units/period is only 400. To force orders, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 750 (representing a very high safety requirement) to attempt to trigger replenishment despite the stuck pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: Orders from P15, P17, P18, P19 (295 units) are \u22655 periods overdue and likely lost. In-transit inventory (534) is largely composed of 'ghost' units, preventing the OR backend from ordering. Lead time for successful deliveries is currently decoupled from promised values.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe crisis marked by significant order losses and extreme lead-time volatility. Orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, and 20 (totaling ~295 units) are now more than 5 periods overdue and must be considered lost. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' units from its 'base_stock' target before ordering. Currently, 'In-transit' is 658, but a large portion consists of These lost/ghost units, preventing the system from placing new orders while on-hand inventory remains at 0. To force the OR backend to place orders and bypass this inventory blockade, I am setting L to 1, while using 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat values. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat significantly higher than the actual demand (inflating them to cover the 'ghost' pipeline), I enable the backend to compute a 'base_stock' that exceeds the 658 units in-transit, thereby triggering new procurement. Current demand averages approximately 95 units per period. I am targeting a base stock near 1000 units to overcome the 658 units of stuck pipeline and demand for the next two periods.

Carry-over insight: Systemic failure confirmed: 295 units from P15-P20 are \u22656 periods overdue and essentially lost; In-transit inventory (658) is heavily corrupted by these 'ghost' units, necessitating parameter inflation to force new orders.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of systemic failure, with a high volume of 'ghost' inventory (roughly 574 units from periods 15-22) that has likely been lost. This corrupts the in-transit view, causing the OR backend to underestimate the actual need for new orders. In Period 25 and 26, I significantly inflated mu_hat and sigma_hat to force orders despite the high pipeline. Current on-hand is 0, and we have missed sales in 7 of the last 9 periods. Recent demand (P23-P26) averages 97.5 units. To ensure the system continues to order sufficiently to meet demand while bypassing the 'ghost' inventory lock, I will continue using an explicit mu_hat set to approximately three times the expected (L+1) demand. Lead time (L) for successful recent arrivals (P21, P23) has been 2 periods, but historical volatility suggests using an explicit L=3 to maintain a safety buffer. Sigma_hat is set explicitly high to maintain a high service level target during this recovery.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory corruption confirmed: Orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, and P22 (approx. 574 units) are \u22655 periods overdue and effectively lost. This 'ghost' in-transit inventory requires explicit parameter inflation (mu_hat > 3x actual demand) to force the OR engine to place necessary replacement orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a major supply chain failure coupled with inventory record corruption. Approximately 810 units ordered between Periods 15 and 26 (specifically P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P22, P24, P25, P26) are significantly overdue or missing. These 'ghost' units are counted by the OR backend as 'In-transit' (currently 1,411 units), preventing the engine from placing new orders while on-hand inventory remains at 0. Demand is stable at approximately 100 units/period (mean of last 5 periods: 98). To bypass the pipeline inventory check and force an order that covers the 3-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=4), I am setting an extremely high explicit mu_hat. The target base stock should be (100 units/period * 4 periods) + safety stock - (current pipeline). Since pipeline (1,411) minus 'ghosts' (~810) is ~601, and we need to trigger an order of at least ~100-200 units to avoid stockouts if a shipment finally arrives, I will set mu_hat to 1800. This should force the Capped Policy to trigger an order near the cap value (~350 units) despite the inflated in-transit numbers.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory corruption confirmed: Orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P22, P24, P25, and P26 (totalling ~810 units) are overdue and likely lost. The 1,411 units in-transit are largely 'ghost' units. Parameter mu_hat must be maintained at >1500 to force the backend to place replacement orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive 'ghost' in-transit inventory. A total of ~810 units from orders placed in Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, and now likely 27, are long overdue and effectively lost. Currently, only orders from Period 26 (419 units) have arrived, leaving the 'In-transit' count at a highly inflated 1,413 units. Since the OR backend uses 'base_stock - in_transit' to determine order size, and the 'in_transit' is populated by these non-existent units, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat to a level that exceeds the ghost inventory plus required stock. Average demand is ~100 units/period. To force a replenishment of approximately 100-200 units, I will set mu_hat to 1800. This ensures (mu_hat - in_transit) remains positive and large enough to trigger an order despite the massive pipeline corruption. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed delivery times for those orders that do arrive.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory corruption persists: ~810 units (P15-P25) are overdue/lost. Total in-transit (1413) is dominated by 'ghost' units. mu_hat must be kept >1800 to bypass the backend's deduction of these lost units from new orders.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In-transit inventory (1,297 units) is heavily corrupted by 'ghost' orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, and 25, totaling approximately 810 units. These orders are significantly past the observed lead time of 2-3 periods and are considered lost. Recent successful arrivals from P26 (L=2) and P27 (L=2) indicate that current lead time has returned to the promised 2 periods. However, the OR backend's logic subtracts total in-transit units from the base stock. To maintain a healthy stock level and compensate for the ~810 'ghost' units, mu_hat must be set to a value that covers expected demand (~100 units/period) for the (L+1) window, plus the sum of lost units. Base stock calculation needs to be > 1,110 (expected demand ~300 + 810 lost) to trigger any order. Setting mu_hat to 1,800 provides a sufficient buffer to bypass the in-transit inventory corruption and ensure continuous replenishment despite the on-hand inventory of 534 units, which will be depleted quickly by demand (~100/period) and upcoming high review cycles.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for successful deliveries has stabilized at 2 periods (observed from P26 and P27 orders). Total 'ghost' in-transit inventory from lost shipments (P15-P25) is confirmed at approximately 810 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-630.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods, as evidenced by orders from Periods 26, 27, and 28 arriving exactly on schedule. However, there remains approximately 810 units of 'ghost' in-transit inventory from the systemic failure between Periods 15 and 25 (specifically orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P22, P24, and P25). Current on-hand inventory is high at 890 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 8-10 periods of demand (averaging ~90-100 units/period). The total in-transit is 879, which consists of the 810 'ghost' units plus the P29 order (218 units) and P30 order (3 units). To prevent the OR backend from prematurely ordering due to the ghost units or over-ordering due to the current surplus, I am setting parameters to a steady-state level. Since on-hand (890) + real in-transit (221) = 1111, and the backend sees in-transit as 879, it perceives total inventory as 1769. I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) to allow the current surplus to bleed down, avoiding further holding costs while monitoring if the 'ghost' units ever arrive.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered: Lead time stabilized at 2 periods for the last 3 deliveries (P26-P28). Total 'ghost' in-transit inventory from lost P15-P25 shipments is 810 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods, as seen from orders placed in Period 26, 27, and 28 all arriving with L=2. However, the system is currently carrying approximately 810 units of 'ghost' in-transit inventory from lost shipments (Periods 15-25). On-hand inventory is currently high (805 units) due to aggressive replacement ordering in previous periods. Since on-hand + (true) in-transit is now sufficient to cover near-term demand, and lead time has returned to 2, I am reverting parameters toward normal levels. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=10) to capture current consumption patterns while acknowledging the 'ghost' inventory still inflates the pipeline count. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat back to realistic levels, the OR engine will stop ordering until the existing surplus is consumed.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time (L) of 2 periods, as confirmed by orders from Periods 26, 27, and 28 all arriving with L=2. However, the system is carrying approximately 816 units of 'ghost' in-transit inventory from lost shipments (Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25). On-hand inventory is currently high (689 units) due to the arrival of the massive recovery orders placed in Periods 26-28. Demand remains stable, with the most recent 5-period average (P28-P32) at 97.2 units. Given the high on-hand inventory and the 'ghost' units still in the pipeline, the OR backend is naturally suppressed from ordering. No aggressive inflation of mu_hat is required this period because on-hand stock is sufficient to cover approximately 7 periods of demand. I will set parameters based on recent stable performance (L=2, recent demand avg ~97) while allowing the OR engine to use the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain fully recovered: Lead time stabilized at 2 periods (Observed P26-P28). Total 'ghost' in-transit inventory from lost P15-P25 shipments is confirmed at 816 units.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods (confirmed by orders from P26, P27, and P28). High inventory levels (On-hand: 574) resulted from the large replacement orders (P26-P28) forced by the 'ghost' inventory crisis. Currently, the in-transit inventory of 879 units consists of approximately 816 'ghost' units (lost orders P15-P25) and real units from P29 (218) and P30 (3). Since On-hand + Real In-transit (574 + 221 = 795) is well above the safety stock requirement for the stable demand regime (~95 units/period), the OR engine should not place new orders. To ensure the engine accounts for the 'ghost' units correctly, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the actual recent demand (~95 units) while setting L to the recently observed stable lead time of 2 periods. The backend will naturally order zero units because (On-hand + Pipeline) >> base_stock.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time (L) of 2 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 26, 27, and 28. However, the system is still carrying approximately 816 'ghost' units in-transit from the systemic failure between Periods 15 and 25. These orders (P15-P25) are now over 10 periods overdue and will never arrive. Current on-hand inventory is 498 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of demand (avg ~95). Total in-transit is 879, but 816 of these are 'ghosts', meaning the 'true' pipeline inventory is only 63 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these ghost units, mu_hat must be set high enough to offset the ~816 units it subtracts from the base stock. I will set L to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the stable L=2. For mu_hat, I will use 'explicit' and set it to 1100. This is calculated as: (Target Base Stock (~300) + Ghost units (816)) \u2248 1116. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation results in a net positive order or maintains safety stock without being paralyzed by the invisible loss of the 816 units. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent demand volatility.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods (orders from P21, P23, P26, P27, and P28 all arrived with L=2). Systemic 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (Periods 15-25) is calculated to be approximately 816 units (total in-transit 879 minus recent valid orders from P29-P30). Currently, on-hand inventory is 384 units, which is sufficient to cover about 4 periods of demand (avg ~90-100). The OR backend's capped policy will naturally prevent over-ordering as long as parameters are normalized. Since current on-hand (384) + valid in-transit (63) is roughly 447 units, and our target base stock (assuming L=2 and mean=95) would be ~380-400, the system did not order in recent periods. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=10) and 'explicit' for L=2 to reflect the stabilized performance. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent samples to reflect current volatility and mean demand (~95 units/period).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods (observed from P26-P28). However, the system's 'In-transit' balance of 879 units is almost entirely composed of 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P15-P25 totaling ~816 units, plus various smaller overdues from P29-P30 which haven't arrived). On-hand inventory is 294, which is approximately 3 periods of demand at the current average of ~95 units. Since the OR backend subtracts the 'ghost' in-transit units from the base_stock calculation, I must keep mu_hat explicitly high to prevent it from zeroing out orders once on-hand inventory drops further. For this period, with 294 on-hand, we are still safe, but to ensure the OR backend doesn't prematurely stop ordering while trying to clear 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat to 1200 to offset the ~879 in-transit units and target a healthy on-hand level. This effectively communicates to the backend that we need more stock despite the high internal in-transit count.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods (L=2) observed since Period 23. Historical analysis confirms a total of 816 'ghost' units in-transit (Orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P22, P24, P25) which are effectively lost. Current total In-transit is 939 units; subtracting the 816 ghost units leaves 123 units of 'true' pipeline inventory. Current On-hand is 175. Total 'real' inventory (175 + 123 = 298) is approaching the desired base stock for a 3-period window (L+1=3) at a demand of ~100/period. To ensure the OR backend places a new order despite the 939 units it sees in-transit, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset the ghost units. Target Base Stock = (True inventory needed) + Ghost Units. Calculation: approx (3 * 100) + 816 = 1116. Setting mu_hat to 1150 to maintain a safe service level as on-hand inventory depletes.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods (as seen in arrivals for orders from Periods 26, 27, and 28). However, the 'In-transit' balance of 1,010 units is significantly inflated by 'ghost' inventory\u2014orders from Periods 15-25 (totaling ~816 units) and Period 29 (218 units) that are long overdue and presumed lost. The OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' figure from its order calculation. To receive any new stock, mu_hat must be set high enough to offset these 1,010 ghost units plus the desired base stock (approx 300 units). I have set mu_hat explicitly to 1350 to force a replacement order of approximately 70-100 units, accounting for current on-hand inventory (126). Demand remains stable around an average of 95 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $223.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an actual lead time (L) of approximately 1-2 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 113. The critical issue is the 'in-transit' figure of 1,194, which is heavily corrupted by approximately 816 'ghost units' from lost shipments (P15-P25) and previous parameter inflation. These units will never arrive but the OR engine subtracts them from the base stock calculation, preventing necessary new orders. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat explicitly high enough to overcome the ghost inventory. Demand is stable around 100 units/period. For a target inventory covering L+1 (3 periods), we need ~300 units. To force the engine to order when it sees 113 on-hand + 1194 'in-transit' (Total 1307), mu_hat must be set above 1307 + desired new order. I will use mu_hat = 1600 to trigger replenishment and sigma_hat = 30 for safety.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory corruption confirmed: ~816 units (P15-P25) are permanently lost but remain in 'In-transit' count. mu_hat must be maintained at significantly inflated levels (>1400) until these units are no longer a factor to ensure the OR engine continues to place orders.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an observed lead time of 1-2 periods for recent successful arrivals (P38 arrived in 1 period, P39 arrived in 1 period). However, the system remains corrupted by approximately 816 'ghost' units from the massive Period 15-25 failure that remain in the 'In-transit' count (1,258 total in-transit). With on-hand inventory at 260 and 'ghost' in-transit at 816, the OR engine sees a pipeline of ~1,076 units. To prevent the engine from stopping orders due to this fake surplus, mu_hat must be set to a value that offsets the ghost units plus covers actual demand. Mean demand is stable around 100 units. To maintain a safety stock and cover a 3-period horizon (L=2) of ~300 units while bypassing 816 ghost units, mu_hat needs to be at least 1,116. I will set mu_hat to 1,300 to ensure consistent ordering and sigma_hat to 150 to maintain a buffer for demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory corruption remains active: ~816 units from P15-P25 are permanently lost but stay in the 'In-transit' total. Explicit inflation of mu_hat (>1100) is required to force the backend to ignore these units and place orders.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant 'ghost' inventory corruption. Approximately 816 units from orders placed between Period 15 and Period 25 are permanently lost but remain in the 'In-transit' calculation. Current on-hand inventory is 159, and total reported in-transit is 1,258. After subtracting the ~816 ghost units, the functional in-transit is roughly 442 units (P40 order of 319 + P37 order of 60 + P38/P39 remainder). Lead time has recently shown efficiency (L=1 for P38 and P39), but historically fluctuates. Average demand remains stable around 100 units/period (recent 5-period avg = 105). To ensure the OR engine places a replacement order despite the 816-unit inflation, mu_hat must be set to cover (expected demand * (L+1)) + ghost units. Calculation: (100 * 3) + 816 \u2248 1116. We will set mu_hat explicitly to 1200 to maintain a safety buffer and prevent stockouts as the previous larger orders arrive and are consumed.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an actual lead time (L) of approximately 1-2 periods for recent successful deliveries (P38, P39 arrived in 1 period). However, the system is fundamentally corrupted by ~816 units of 'ghost' inventory from Periods 15-25 that remain in the 'In-transit' count but will never arrive. Current on-hand inventory is low (46 units) and there were no arrivals in Period 42. Since the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (1258 units) from its base stock calculation, I must provide an extremely inflated mu_hat to bypass this and trigger necessary ordering. Average demand is ~95 units/period. For a target inventory covering (L+1) periods plus a safety buffer, the backend would normally seek ~300-400 total units. To overcome the 1258 units of 'ghost' in-transit and 46 on-hand, mu_hat must be set significantly higher than the sum of ghost units and desired stock level. I will set mu_hat to 1400 and L to 2 to ensure a robust order is placed to replenish on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory corruption remains active: ~816 units from P15-P25 are permanently lost but stay in the 'In-transit' total. mu_hat must be maintained at >1100 to force the backend to place orders.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant 'ghost' inventory issues, with approximately 816 units from periods 15-25 permanently lost but still counted in the 'In-transit' total (1,068). Current on-hand inventory is 288, and the most recent successful delivery (Period 40 order) arrived in Period 43 (L=3), though lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 recently. To ensure the OR backend places any necessary orders, mu_hat must be maintained at a high level that ignores the ~816 ghost units. With a stable demand mean around 95 units and an observed lead time of 2-3, a realistic pipeline requirement would be ~400 units. To reach this while the backend 'sees' 816 units that don't exist, mu_hat needs to be set around 1200+ (816 + 400). I am keeping mu_hat at 1150 and L at 3 to maintain a safety buffer as we approach the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently in a stable demand regime with mean demand approximately 95 units per period. Lead times have fluctuated between 1-3 periods, but the most critical issue is the systemic 'ghost' in-transit inventory. Approximately 816 units (from orders P15-P25) are permanently lost but remain in the pipeline count. As of Period 45, on-hand inventory is 210 and in-transit is 1068. After subtracting the 816 ghost units, the true usable in-transit is 252 units. Total true inventory (on-hand + true in-transit) is 462 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 1068 in-transit and stopping all orders, mu_hat must be inflated to cover the ghost units plus the targeted base stock. With a target of roughly 400-500 units (L=2, L+1=3 periods of demand ~300 + safety stock), adding 816 units requires mu_hat to be ~1100-1200. I will maintain mu_hat at 1150 to ensure replacements for current consumption continue to be ordered while managing the holding cost of the current 210 units on hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $156.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain exhibits systemic inventory corruption where ~816 units from the P15-P25 interval are permanently lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (Current In-transit: 939 - 129 just arrived = 810 approx ghost units). This 'ghost' inventory prevents the OR backend's base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) from placing necessary orders unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to bypass the ~810 unit subtraction. Recent demand (P40-P45) is stable around 100 units/period. With a Lead Time of 2-3 periods, the required protection level over (L+1) periods is approximately 400 units. To force the engine to maintain this level despite the 810 'ghost' units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1210. I am using mu_hat: explicit at 1250 and sigma_hat: explicit at 150 (reflecting recent demand volatility) to ensure the system places orders as on-hand inventory depletes towards the end of the game.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory corruption: ~810-816 units from P15-P25 are permanently lost but stay in 'In-transit' totals. Parameter mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by ~810 units above actual forecasted demand to force the OR backend to place orders.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (recent arrivals: P38=1, P39=1, P40=3, P43=2). However, the systemic issue of 'ghost' inventory persists. Approximately 816 units from the P15-P25 disruption remain in the 'In-transit' count (1137 current in-transit minus the active P46 order of 198 and potential P45/P44 orders). This ghost inventory prevents the OR backend's base-stock logic from triggering new orders because it 'sees' 816 units that will never arrive. To counter this, I must set mu_hat to a value that covers the desired pipeline stock (approx 3 periods of demand at 100/period = 300) PLUS the ghost inventory (~816). Total mu_hat target is ~1116. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure this offset is strictly maintained. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average of volatile but successful deliveries. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from 'ghost' in-transit inventory. Approximately 816 units from orders P15-P25 are permanently lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (currently 1137 units). With only 10 units on-hand and 1137 in-transit, the OR backend sees 1147 units of 'pipeline inventory'. Since the desired base stock is significantly lower than this, the backend will not place new orders unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to exceed the 'ghost' count plus current needs. Recent demand (P43-P47) averages ~97 units. With a stable lead time of 2-3 periods, a normal base stock (L+1) would be ~300-400 units. To bypass the 816 lost units, mu_hat must be set above 1150 (816 + 300+). I am setting mu_hat to 1100 as a tactical choice to manage ending inventory as we approach the game's end (Period 50), ensuring we have enough stock to satisfy the final 2 periods of demand without excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. Inventory is currently 0, and we have 1,137 units in-transit. However, based on extensive historical evidence (Carry-over insights and P15-P25 history), approximately 816 of these in-transit units are 'ghost' units from permanently lost shipments that never arrived. This leaves real in-transit inventory at approximately 321 units (1137 - 816). Our latest successful order arrival was from P43 (arrived P45, L=2). Since then, we placed a large order in P46 (198 units) which is expected to arrive in P48 or P49. In P48, we experienced a stockout (107 demand, only 10 sold). To ensure we maximize reward in the final period (P50), we must ensure enough real stock is ordered now to cover P49 and P50 demand, while manually compensating for the 816 'ghost' units that the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from our order quantity. Mean demand is stable around 100 units/period. For a target inventory covering P49 and P50 (L=2 approach), we need about 300 units real inventory (including safety stock). To bypass the 816 ghost units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 300 (real target) + 816 (offset) = 1116. Setting mu_hat to 1200 provides a slight buffer to ensure a final order is placed despite the corruption.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains plagued by roughly 810-816 units of 'ghost' in-transit inventory from the Period 15-25 disruptions. These lost units never arrived but are still counted by the OR backend as pipeline inventory. Consequently, the backend subtracts these units from every order, leading to stockouts. Current on-hand is 0, and lead time has recently shown variability between 1 and 3 periods (P39 was 1, P40 was 3, P43 was 2). To force an order, I must set mu_hat such that (mu_hat - ghost_inventory) covers (L+1) periods of demand. Average demand is around 90-100 units/period. With L=2, base demand for the cycle is ~300. Adding the 816 ghost units, mu_hat needs to be at least 1116. I will set mu_hat to 1200 to ensure the backend places an order that overcomes the ghost inventory and provides a safety buffer for current demand, which peaked at 144 last period.
