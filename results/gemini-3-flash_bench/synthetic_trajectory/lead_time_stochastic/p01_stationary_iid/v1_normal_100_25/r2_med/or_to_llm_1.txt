Historical demand over the last 5 periods has a mean of approximately 90 units (100, 69, 92, 77, 111). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. The OR algorithm suggests ordering 118 units, based on a base-stock policy that balances the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1) using the historical mean and variance. Since we have no recorded arrivals yet to verify the actual lead time, I will stick close to the OR recommendation for this initial order to establish the pipeline. However, looking at the recent demand of 111 in Period 5, I will round the order slightly up to ensure we cover the lead time transition phase efficiently without excessive stockout risk, while acknowledging the OR cap is designed to prevent over-ordering.",

Consequently, the orders from P2 (115 units) and P3 (61 units) are also still in transit. Total in-transit is 294 units.\n2. Inventory & Demand Analysis: Historical demand averages ~90 units/period (P1: 100, P2: 69, P3: 92, P4: 77, P5: 111 - average 89.8). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no shipments have arrived yet. Customer demand is being lost. \n3. OR Recommendation Analysis: The OR agent recommends only 10 units. This is because the OR agent sees a pipeline of 294 units and assumes a lead time of 2. It calculates that the pipeline is nearly sufficient for the base stock level. However, since we haven't received anything yet, we are facing a stockout. \n4. Strategy: I will significantly increase the order quantity above the OR recommendation. While we have 294 units in transit, the uncertainty of arrival and the current stockout justify a buffer. If the P1 order arrives in Period 4 (visible in P5), we finally start selling.

Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), while Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The Period 2 order (115 units) is still in transit as of Period 5 start and is likely to arrive during this period (which would make its lead time L=3). \nDemand Analysis: Recent demand has been stable around the mean (89, 98, 114, 101), with an average of approximately 100 units/period. \nOR Recommendation Analysis: The OR agent recommends 33 units based on a promised lead time of 2. However, with 78 on hand and 195 in-transit (Total = 273), and a demand of roughly 100/period, we are covered for nearly 3 periods. If the 115 units from Period 2 arrive this period (as L=3 pattern suggests), our on-hand will surge to nearly 190. \nStrategy: The pipeline (273 total) is sufficient to cover the 3-period lead time we've observed (300 units required).

The P2 shipment (115) is now at L=4 (overdue), suggesting it might be lost or significantly delayed. \n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 42 units assumes L=2 and stable demand.

Demand analysis: Historical mean is ~88.75. P8 demand was 104. Recommended coverage for (L+1) = 3.2 periods requires ~284 units. 4. Strategy: On-hand (40) + Pipeline (110) = 150 units. The OR recommendation of 26 units is extremely conservative, likely because its internal pipeline calculation includes the lost P2 order (115 units). If we subtract the lost 115 units from the OR's perceived pipeline, the adjusted order should be roughly 26 + 115 = 141.

Current 'In-transit' is 300, but accounting for the lost P2 order (115) and assuming P6 (65) might eventually arrive, the 'reliable' pipeline is roughly 185 units (including P9's 120 units). 3. Demand analysis: Demand is fluctuating between 50-100 units with an average around 80. The 5 initial samples + 9 game periods provide a mean of ~86 units. 4.

Recent successful arrivals (P34 at L=2, P35 at L=2, P36 at L=1) suggest the current actual lead time is 1-2 periods for successful deliveries.\n\n2. **Inventory Analysis**: Current on-hand is 106.

This makes the effective pipeline 895 - 715 = 180 units (the order from P37 of 100 units and the likely-in-transit remainder). Total effective supply = 106 (on-hand) + 180 (pipeline) = 286 units.\n\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is (115+76+114+90+119)/5 = 102.8 units. Total demand over the replenishment cycle (L+1 = 3 periods) is approximately 309 units.\n\n4. **Final Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees the massive (but false) 895-unit pipeline.

However, my historical analysis shows that a significant portion of this pipeline is permanently lost and will never arrive. Specifically, shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25, P29, and P30 (totaling 715 units) are all significantly overdue (>5-10 periods). Most recently, P41 (100 units) and P42 (100 units) are currently 3 and 2 periods old respectively and may arrive soon, while P43 (100 units) is just 1 period old. Excluding the 715 lost units, the 'Effective' pipeline is roughly 480 units (1195 - 715). Given current on-hand inventory (23 units) and a lead time that fluctuates between 1-3 periods, a base stock level covering 3-4 periods of demand (approx 350-400 units) is appropriate. Since the effective pipeline (480) already exceeds this, and to prevent overstocking as we approach the end of the game (Period 50), I will target a smaller replenishment of 80 units.

The system 'In-transit' figure of 1175 is highly misleading due to a massive backlog of lost or significantly delayed shipments. Based on the Carry-Over Insights, at least 715 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30). Additionally, orders P42 and P43 (200 units total) have not yet arrived. The OR recommendation suggests 0 units because it looks at the unadjusted pipeline (1175 units) and thinks the machine is overstocked. However, subtracting the 715 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 460 units. With the game ending in 5 periods (P45-P50) and a lead time of 1-3 periods, we must ensure enough stock for the final stretch. Since P42 and P43 (L=2 and L=3 respectively) are expected to arrive in the next 1-2 periods, and we just received P41 (L=3), there is a moderate amount of inventory already moving.

However, based on the chronic pattern of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30), at least 715 units are permanently lost and will never arrive. This makes our effective pipeline 340 units (1055 - 715).

For the final two periods (P49 and P50), we need approximately 200 units. The effective pipeline has enough units to cover this if they arrive, but given the extremely high loss rate (approx 70% of the reported pipeline contains dead orders) and recent instability, a small order is prudent to ensure some availability for the final period (P50), though we must also avoid high holding costs for the end of the game.
