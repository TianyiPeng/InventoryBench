Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a high margin-to-holding-cost ratio (1.0/1.0 implies a target service level q = 0.5, which is moderate). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 130, 88, 64, 58, 129. The mean demand is 93.8 and the standard deviation is 36.3. Since there are no seasonal indicators or calendar dates provided yet, I will use the mean of the available historical samples to set the initial pipeline target. Given L=2, the review+lead period covers 3 periods (1+L). Based on the available data, I'll use all 5 samples ('default') to estimate the demand for the upcoming cycle.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 151 units was placed with a promised lead time of 2 periods. As expected for L=2, 'Period 1 conclude' shows 0 units arrived, as the order is scheduled to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 2 conclude' message read at the start of Period 3. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the game started with 0 inventory and the first order is still in transit. Demand in Period 1 was 134. Historical demand samples (130, 88, 64, 58, 129) show a mean of 93.8. However, the recent samples from the last two periods (Period 5 of history=129, Period 1 of game=134) suggest a higher demand regime compared to the mid-history dip. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the most relevant recent history) to capture this level while smoothing variance. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised 2 periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Our promised lead time (L) is 2. The orders placed in Period 1 (151 units) and Period 2 (133 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the lead time definition (Scenario A), the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and be visible in Period 3's conclude message. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because starting inventory was 0. Demand for the first two periods was 134 and 129. Since there are only 2 historical samples and L=2, I will use 'default' methods which utilize available historical data and promised lead time, ensuring the pipeline (including the 284 in-transit units) is evaluated against the target stock level (1+L)*mean_demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The initial demand samples (130, 88, 64, 58, 129) provided a mean of ~94. However, observed demand in Periods 1-3 (134, 129, 79) shows a slightly higher actual consumption (avg ~114). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 and Period 2 have not yet arrived as of the start of Period 4, which is expected under a 2-period lead time (Period 1 order arrives 'during' Period 3 and is visible in 'Period 3 conclude', yet 'Period 3 conclude' says arrived=0). Actually, correction: if L=2, an order placed in P1 arrives in P3 resolution and should be visible in P3 conclude. Since P1 (151 units), P2 (133), and P3 (30) haven't arrived, there is a risk that lead times are longer or there is a delay. However, looking at the 'Period 3 conclude', arrived is still 0. This suggests L is at least 3, or the system timing means the P1 order arrives in P4. I will stick to 'default' (2) for L for now but monitor closely. For mu_hat, I'll use recent demand (N=3) which is roughly 114 per period. Total mu_hat for (1+L=3) periods = 3 * 114 = 342.

Daily Reward (R_t): $29.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival of the Period 1 order (151 units, L=3) and the Period 3 order (30 units, L=1), while the Period 2 order (133 units) is still in transit. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance (1 and 3). Given the demand history [130, 88, 64, 58, 129] (note: 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the prompt differs slightly from 'Game History' demand, but both show a volatile start), the average demand is approximately 94 units. With on-hand inventory at 76 and 161 units in transit (Period 2 + Period 4 orders), we are currently covered for about 2.5 periods. However, the holding cost ($1.0) is equal to profit ($1.0), meaning the critical ratio for the base-stock policy is 0.5 (q = 1/(1+1)). This implies the OR engine will target a base stock roughly equal to the mean demand over (L+1) periods with no safety stock buffer. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the observed lead time average (2.0) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent fluctuations.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0). Looking at lead time history: Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (L=3), while Period 3 arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2, and the average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. I will use 'calculate' for L. Demand shows high variance (134, 129, 79, 105, 139). The mean of the 5 historical samples is 117.2. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat will set target stock for L+1 (3 periods) at approximately 351.6. Sigma is high relative to mean (~25), so sqrt(3)*25 ~ 43. Given we have 315 units in-transit (Orders from P2, P4, P5), and currently 0 on-hand, an order will be triggered to bridge the gap between (On-hand + In-transit) and the Base Stock (mu + z*sigma). Since Profit=Holding=$1.0, the service level q = 0.5, making z*=0, so base_stock = mu_hat.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 469 in-transit. Demand has been volatile, averaging approximately 113.8 units over the first 6 periods (134, 129, 79, 105, 139, 96). Lead times have shown significant variability: while the promised lead time is 2, actual observed lead times have been 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order). The P2 order (133 units) is currently overdue as of P6 conclude, as it has not arrived by the end of its 4th period. Since on-hand is zero and we have a high volume in-transit (469 units vs approx 340-450 needed for (L+1) coverage), I will set lead time (L) to 'calculate' to account for the observed drift, and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=6 to capture the full historical range while acknowledging the high holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit ($1.0), which suggests the OR backend will target a service level near 50%. This balanced approach prevents over-ordering while stock is in-transit.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory and 441 units in-transit. Historical demand has fluctuated between 58 and 139 across the provided samples and game history, with a mean around 104 units. We observed actual lead times of 1 and 3 periods, deviating from the promised 2 periods. The order from Period 2 (133 units) is significantly overdue (6 periods since order), suggesting it may be lost. The orders from Period 5 (154 units) and Period 6 (154 units) are currently at lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively; if they arrive in Period 8, they will replenish stock. Given the high stockout risk and inconsistent delivery, I am setting L to 3 (recent average) to account for delays. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand (covering the game history) to capture the current mean of ~112 units. This approach aims to restore inventory levels while acknowledging the volatility in lead times and the potential loss of the Period 2 shipment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand is relatively stable but high, with a mean around 118 units per period based on historical samples. The promised lead time is 2, but observed arrivals show significant variability (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3). Specifically, P5 ordered units arrived in P8 (LT=3). We are currently missing the order from P2 (133 units) and P6 (154 units). The P2 order is significantly overdue (7 periods since order), suggesting it may be lost. The P6 order is at L+2. To protect against the inconsistent lead times which seem to trend towards 3 periods, I am setting L to 3 explicitly. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I will use the average of all available samples (Period 1-8: 134, 129, 79, 105, 139, 96, 134, 125 = 117.6), scaled by (1+L) = 4, resulting in 470. I will use a conservative sigma_hat using \u2018recent_N\u2019 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is inconsistent and averaging 3 periods (Recent samples: P4 order LT=3, P5 order LT=3). Period 2 order (133 units) appears to be lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with 415 units in-transit. A review of the lead time history shows high variability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 in 1, Period 4 in 3, Period 5 in 3, and Period 8 in 1. Period 2 (133 units) is significantly overdue (7 periods since order) and is considered lost. The average lead time of successful deliveries is roughly 2.2 periods, but 3 is the most frequent delay for larger orders. I will use L=explicit (value 3) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this longer cycle. For demand forecasting, the last 4 periods (P6-P9) show a mean of 125.5 (96, 134, 125, 147), which is fairly consistent with the overall average of ~121. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this latest slightly higher demand trend. This strategy aims to build enough safety stock to handle the 3-period lead time and the current stockout situation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is highly erratic, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Mode: 3). P2 order (133 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with an average of approximately 114 units over the first 10 periods. However, supply chain reliability is poor. Most crucially, the Period 2 order of 133 units is now 9 periods old and confirmed lost, and the Period 6 order (154 units) is now 5 periods old with no arrival, suggesting it may also be lost or severely delayed. Observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode of 3. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To protect against stockouts given the high risk of lost shipments and the 3-period lead time, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to override the promised 2. I will use the mean of the last 10 samples (excluding the initialization period if necessary, but 10 is the full history here) to set mu_hat at (1+3)*114.1 = 456.4. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect the volatility of the entire historical series under the assumed L=3 lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Period 6 order (154 units) is now 5 periods overdue and highly likely lost, following the confirmed loss of the Period 2 order.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing significant supply chain disruption. We have zero on-hand inventory and 502 units in-transit. Analyzing the history: Orders from Period 2 (133 units) and Period 6 (154 units) are definitively lost as they are well beyond the observed 1-3 period lead time Window. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.6 for arrived orders). Currently, orders from P9 (128 units) and P10 (87 units) are the most likely candidates for arrival. Demand remains relatively stable, with a mean of approximately 110 units over the last 11 periods. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire 'pipeline_inventory' (502 units) from its base stock calculation, and it 'believes' the lost units (287 units) will eventually arrive, it will severely under-order, leading to continued stockouts. To compensate for the 287 lost units that the OR engine thinks are still coming, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed lead time) and using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next (L+1)=4 periods to be 440 units, and I am adding the 287 lost units back into the requirement to force the backend to place a restorative order. Total mu_hat = 440 + 287 = 727.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Period 6 order (154 units) is lost (6 periods elapsed). Total verified lost units in pipeline: 287 (P2 and P6). Supply is highly unreliable with lead times alternating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the supply chain remains highly unreliable. History shows two confirmed lost shipments (Period 2 and Period 6), totaling 287 units. While Period 12 saw the arrival of Period 9 (LT=3) and Period 10 (LT=2) orders, the lead time has historically fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent for large orders. The current on-hand inventory is 68 units, and the pipeline shows 506 units in-transit. However, subtract the 287 lost units (P2/P6), leaving an effective pipeline of 219 units (from P12). Demand remains relatively stable between 90-150 units. To account for the unreliable lead time and risk of loss, I am setting L to 3 (explicit). I will use the mean of the last 5 demand samples (approx. 117.6) for mu_hat, calculated as (1+3)*117.6 = 470.4. Using sigma_hat 'default' allows the OR engine to account for the overall volatility in the demand stream while the explicit L and mu_hat handle the supply-side uncertainty.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent supply reliability has been very poor. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Analyzing the pipeline (506 units), we have confirmed that the orders from Period 2 (133 units) and Period 6 (154 units) are lost, totaling 287 units that will never arrive. The remaining active pipeline consists of orders from Period 12 (219 units) and Period 13 (0 units - though marked 0, there or could be a discrepancy in the transit reporting; however, only the P12 order is valid in transit). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging closer to 3. I will set L to 3 to account for this reality. Demand remains steady with a mean of approximately 117 units over the last 13 periods (excluding the seed data). Because of the stockout and the loss of nearly 300 units from the pipeline, I need to ensure the OR backend's Base Stock calculation (which subtracts Pipeline Inventory) doesn't use the 'inflated' 506 units. Since I cannot directly modify the backend's pipeline view, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 and an 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as (1+L)*mean_demand plus a buffer to compensate for the 287 lost units currently being miscounted as available in transit, ensuring an order is actually triggered.

Carry-over insight: Supply Chain Vulnerability: 287 units (P2: 133, P6: 154) are confirmed lost and deducted from effective pipeline calculations. Demand regime is stable at ~117/period.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' pipeline is 731 units. However, based on historical evidence, 287 of these units are lost (Period 2: 133 units, Period 6: 154 units). These units have not arrived after 13 and 9 periods respectively, while the maximum observed lead time is 3. The effective pipeline is therefore 444 units (731 - 287). These 444 units represent orders from P12 (219 units) and P14 (225 units). The lead time is highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers the maximum expected delay. Demand is relatively stable. The mean of the last 5 demand samples (P10-P14) is 117. With L=3, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand, approximately 468 units. By setting L to 3 and using explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent data, I aim to trigger the OR backend to maintain a base stock that offsets the lost units and addresses the supply volatility.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 146 units on hand. The 'In-transit' balance of 512 units includes two confirmed lost orders: Period 2 (133 units) and Period 6 (154 units), totaling 287 units. The effective pipeline is therefore 225 units (the order from Period 14). Lead times show a clear pattern of instability, frequently hitting 3 periods (P1: 3, P4: 3, P5: 3, P9: 3, P12: 3), even though the promised lead time is 2. To account for this, I will set L to 3. This adjustment allows the OR backend to target a higher inventory level that covers the longer-than-promised delivery cycle. Demand has been relatively stable; the mean over the last 15 periods is ~116 per period. Using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat captures the current demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide adequate safety stock for the high volatility observed in both supply and demand.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, current on-hand inventory is 51 units. The historical demand for chips(Regular) remains stable, with an average of approximately 117 units per period across the last 10 periods. The primary challenge is highly erratic supply: lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, and two shipments (Period 2: 133 units, Period 6: 154 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 287 units. While the 'In-transit' figure is reported as 512, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 225 units (from Period 14), as the 287 lost units are still being counted by the system. Given that the promised lead time is 2 but the mode is 3, I will set L to 3 to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation accounts for the longer coverage needed (L+1=4 periods). I am using mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 10-period regime to capture the current demand volatility while maintaining a sufficient buffer against the inconsistent lead times.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains relatively stable around an average of 115-120 units per period. Lead times are highly erratic, predominantly 3 periods (observed in 6 out of 10 arrivals), with occasional values of 1 or 2 periods. The 'In-transit' count of 287 consists entirely of confirmed lost orders (P2: 133, P6: 154), meaning the effective pipeline is actually zero. Because on-hand inventory is 150 and current demand is ~120, we have enough stock for the immediate period but need to re-establish the pipeline given the 3-period lead time. I will set L to 3 (explicitly capturing the dominant lead time) and use recent_N (N=10) for demand and volatility to reflect the stable regime. The goal is to ensure the backend triggers an order to cover the (L+1)=4 period window, ignoring the phantom 'lost' units in the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-42.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 status: On-hand inventory is 96 units following a low demand period (54 units in P18). The pipeline contains 311 units, but 287 of these (ordered in P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of only 24 units from the P18 order. The demand regime remains stable around 117 units/period (last 10 periods average is ~114). Lead times are erratic, but 3 periods is the most common actual delay for successfully arrived orders. To compensate for the high risk of lost shipments and the 3-period lead time, I am setting L to 3 explicitly. For demand, mu_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture the current stable regime (approx 117 * 4 = 468). Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the observed demand volatility, which is necessary given the high holding cost-to-profit ratio (1:1) and supply unreliability.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 19. The total 'In-transit' quantity reported by the system is 336 units. However, consistent history (recorded in carry-over insights) confirms that the Period 2 order (133 units) and the Period 6 order (154 units) are lost, totaling 287 units. Subtracting these from the reported in-transit quantity leaves 49 units of 'real' pipeline inventory (likely the orders from P18 and P19). Demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 110-120 units per period (last 5 periods mean: 98, last 10 periods mean: 110.8). Lead times have consistently hit 3 periods for almost all major deliveries (P9 order arrived in 3, P12 in 3, P14 in 3), despite the promised 2. I will set L to 3 and mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to reflect a stable demand of ~111/period across 4 periods (L+1). Since holding cost equals profit, the OR backend targets a 50% service level; given the supply unreliability and lost shipments, maintaining a higher safety stock via sigma_hat is necessary.

Carry-over insight: Sustained lead time of 3 periods confirmed (observations: P9, P12, P14 orders all took 3 periods). Real pipeline inventory remains total_system_in_transit minus 287 lost units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 430 units in-transit. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, 287 of these units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 143 units (from P18, P19, and P20). Actual lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods (confirmed in P20), which is longer than the promised 2 periods. Demand is relatively stable but shows high variance, with recent samples (P16-P20) averaging 94 units/period. To ensure we cover the review period plus the 3-period lead time (total 4 periods of demand) while the OR backend only sees the promised L=2, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering periods 16-20) to capture the current demand mean of 94, which the backend will scale by (1+L). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to provide a robust volatility estimate given the erratic demand spikes. This setup targets a base stock that accounts for the actual lead time and lost inventory gap.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 430 units. However, based on history, 287 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline is therefore 430 - 287 = 143 units (consisting of orders from P18, P19, and P20). Actual lead time is consistently 3 periods, confirmed by arrivals at P12, P15, and P17. Demand remains stable around a mean of 115-117. With a lead time of 3, the backend uses a base stock to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. I use explicit L=3 to match recent history. I use recent_N=15 for mu_hat to capture the stable demand regime while filtering out the early noise. I use recent_N=15 for sigma_hat to maintain a safety buffer against the high variability in demand and arrival timing.

In Period 23, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand is stable, but the supply chain remains unreliable. Lead time has consistently converged to 3 periods in recent history (P9, P12, P14 orders were all LT=3). The in-transit pipeline is listed as 437 units; however, historical data confirms that 287 units (P2: 133, P6: 154) are lost. The effective in-transit quantity is actually 150 units (P18: 24, P19: 25, P20: 94, P22: 7). Given the current on-hand of 0 and effective pipeline of 150, and using a lead time of 3, we must cover 4 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~112 and L=3, the base stock should target roughly 450-500 units. To reach this target while accounting for the 'phantom' lost stock in the OR engine's pipeline calculation, I will set L to 3 and provide an explicit mu_hat based on the stable recent regime (~112 units/period) to trigger a replenishment order that compensates for the lost units and aligns with the observed 3-period lead time.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24, on-hand inventory is 0. Total in-transit is 339 units, but historical analysis confirms 287 units are permanently lost (P2: 133, P6: 154). Thus, the effective pipeline is only 52 units (339 - 287). Lead times are highly erratic, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, though 3 is most frequent recently (P20 took 3 periods). I will set L to 3 to ensure the target inventory covers the longer arrival window. Demand has been stable but shows significant variance (ranging from ~50 to ~150). I am using recent_N=15 for mu_hat (approx 111.4/period) and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and volatility accurately. The OR backend will compute a base stock for a 4-period window (L+1) and subtract the effective pipeline of 52 units. By setting L=3, I'm instructing the backend to account for a longer lead time, which helps prevent stockouts given the recent history of 3-period arrivals.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable with a mean of approximately 110-120 units per period. The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. We have 444 units in-transit, but 287 of those (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost and have not arrived after more than 15 periods. The effective pipeline is therefore 157 units (444 - 287). Observed lead times are predominantly 3 periods (e.g., Period 20 order arrived in P23), though some short 1-period arrivals occur. I will set L to 3 to reflect the actual dominant lead time and use an explicit mu_hat to ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock that covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand (~440-460 units). Since current on-hand is 0 and effective pipeline is only 157, the OR engine will trigger an order to close the gap to the target base stock, accounting for the lost units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 441 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 287 of these units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 154 units (orders from P18, P19, P24, and P25). Lead times remain highly volatile, primarily alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average closer to 3. Demand is stable, with a recent 10-period mean of approximately 107.5 units. Because the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the service level q \u2248 0.5, directing the OR engine to aim for the median demand. I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent shipment delays and using recent_N=10 for demand to capture the current regime. Setting L=3 (explicit) ensures the backend calculates the base stock for (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~430 units), which will trigger an order to cover the gap since the effective pipeline (154) + on-hand (0) is well below this level.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead times are predominantly 3 periods (observed in P20, P22, P23). Total in-transit is 441 units, but 287 units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 154 units (orders from P24 and P19). Demand is stable with a mean of ~112 units/period (last 20 periods). To recover from the stock-out and account for the 3-period lead time, the OR backend needs parameter L set to 3. I will use 'explicit' for L to ensure the backend projects demand over 4 periods (L+1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the noise from the lost supply periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently at Period 28 with zero on-hand inventory and 452 units in-transit. A critical analysis of the pipeline indicates that 287 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost and have not arrived despite the passage of over 20 periods. Subtracting these lost units from the 452 in-transit units yields an effective pipeline of 165 units (orders from P24 and P27). Recent lead times average 2.5-3 periods, significantly longer than the promised 2 periods; I am setting L to 3 to reflect this reality. Demand has been stable but shows occasional volatility, with a recent mean around 111 units/period. By setting L to 3, the OR backend targets a base stock covering 4 periods of demand (L+1). Since the OR backend is unaware of lost shipments, it will overestimated the pipeline as 452 units. To bridge this gap and force an order to maintain service levels, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory = Mean Demand * (L+1) = 111 * 4 = 444. To ensure the backend places a necessary order while subtracting its perceived pipeline of 452, I will set mu_hat high enough to trigger the desired replenishment while accounting for the imminent arrival of the P24 order (105 units).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the system has 0 units on-hand and 550 units in-transit. Based on Carry-Over Insights, 287 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 263 units (550 - 287). The observed lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods (confirmed in Period 20). Demand over the last 15 periods (since Period 14) averages 107.5 units, showing relative stability despite high volatility. To ensure the OR backend accounts for both the actual lead time and the supply reliability issues, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3. I will also use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=15) to capture the current stable demand regime while providing the OR engine with the correct look-ahead window. Since the lost units (287) are not recognized by the backend, and the backend subtracts 'total_system_in_transit' from the target base stock, I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat to offset the 'phantom' inventory. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mean_demand = (3+1) * 107.5 = 430. To counteract the backend's subtraction of 287 lost units, I adjust the mu_hat parameter: Adjusted Base Stock = 430 + 287 = 717. Setting mu_hat to 717 and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=15) to maintain appropriate safety stock for current volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the system is stockout (on-hand: 0). Reported in-transit is 706 units, but history confirms 287 units (P2/P6) are lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 419 units. Actual lead times range from 1 to 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.3 periods (calculated L: 2.3). I will use L=3 to ensure the backend base stock targets safety coverage for a 4-period horizon (L+1). Demand remains stable with a mean of ~117 units. The OR backend will compute base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and current order = max(0, min(base_stock - 419, cap)). Providing explicit values for mu_hat (117 * 4 = 468) and sigma_hat (std ~29, sqrt(4)*29 = 58) provides the most precise control given the known lost shipments.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) appears stable around a mean of 115-120 units per period. However, supply chain reliability is the primary concern. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with a sustained average of approximately 2-3. We have two confirmed lost shipments (P2: 133 units, P6: 154 units, Total: 287). Starting inventory is low at 21 units. System In-transit is 608, but 287 of these are lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 321 units. To ensure availability given the risk of 3-period lead times, I will set L to 'calculate' (which aligns with the observed volatility) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime of ~112 units/period. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (L+1) periods, and the high holding cost ($1.0) vs profit ($1.0) means the service level q will be 0.5, directing the system to maintain leaner stocks while accounting for supply delays.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 115 units per period. Lead times continue to be highly volatile, primarily oscillating between 2 and 3 periods, with occasional 1-period arrivals. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total in-transit units are 608. However, 287 of these units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost, as they are now 30 and 26 periods overdue, respectively. Furthermore, orders from Periods 18 (24 units), 19 (25 units), 24 (105 units), and 25 (0 units) are significantly past the normal delivery window and are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. The effective pipeline consists of the orders from Period 29 (167 units) and whatever was ordered in the previous two periods (0 units each). To maintain service level despite the high loss rate and inconsistent supply, I will set L to an explicit value of 3 to reflect the realistic upper bound of the current delivery window. I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand and volatility to capture the most recent stability in the consumption pattern (~115/period).

Carry-over insight: Supply Chain Failure: Orders from P18 (24 units), P19 (25 units), and P24 (105 units) are now overdue by 8-14 periods and are considered lost, bringing the total lost pool to 441 units. Only orders from P29 onwards are considered active in the pipeline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer significant reliability issues. The 'In-transit' balance of 608 units contains 441 units from orders placed in Periods 2, 6, 18, 19, and 24, which are now significantly overdue (8 to 31 periods) and are confirmed lost. The 'effective' pipeline inventory is only 167 units (from Period 29). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable with an average of approximately 111 units per period over the last 15 periods. Lead times effectively fluctuate between 2 and 3 periods, with recent arrivals (P27, P28) taking 2 periods. To ensure availability given the 0 on-hand status and the unreliability of the pipeline, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to cover the upper end of the observed lead time. I am using recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stable demand regime while accounting for recent volatility. The OR backend will see an effective pipeline of 167 (608 - 441) and should trigger an order to restore the base stock level.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit significant instability. As of Period 34, 441 units (ordered in P2, P6, P18, P19, and P24) are confirmed lost and must be manually excluded from the pipeline as the OR backend is unaware of these losses. The 'effective' in-transit inventory is 167 units (from Period 29), which has now hit its promised lead time of 2 periods but has not yet arrived. Given the historical mode lead time of 3 periods and the frequent stockouts, I am setting L=3 to ensure the backend targets a higher base stock. Demand has remained relatively stable, averaging approximately 117 units over the last 20 periods. By using recent_N (N=20), I provide a robust mean and variance estimate while filtering early-game noise. Setting L=3 and using recent demand stats allows the OR backend to generate an order that accounts for both the expected 3-period lead time and the high probability of delivery delays.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with a recent 10-period mean around 113. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable. As of Period 35, the 'In-transit' balance is 608 units, but 441 of these are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P18, P19, and P24). The active pipeline consists only of orders from P29 (167 units) and P28 (which arrived in P30). The on-hand inventory is 0. Since the OR backend uses 'total in-transit' to calculate orders (order = base_stock - in_transit - on_hand), the 441 lost units will prevent the system from placing new orders unless L, mu_hat, or sigma_hat are adjusted. To force the OR engine to recognize the need for more stock, I will set L to 3 (reflecting the observed reality) and use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am calculating mu_hat as (1+L) * mean_demand + lost_units (approx), effectively 'padding' the target stock level to account for the phantom inventory. 4 periods (L+1) * 115 avg demand + 441 lost units \u2248 901. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the 'In-transit' bloat.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Total confirmed lost units in pipeline remains 441 (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24). No new arrivals since Period 30 confirm the 167 units from P29 (placed 6 periods ago) are currently overdue, suggesting either a lead time spike or another loss.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show extreme unreliability. On-hand inventory is 0, and total in-transit is 873 units. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, at least 441 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24). The order from Period 29 (167 units) is now 7 periods old and should be considered lost, bringing the total lost pool to 608 units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 265 units (the order placed last period). The lead time is extremely volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with recent instances of 7+ periods signifying lost shipments. I will set L to 3 to reflect the high-end delay and use mu_hat to cover this extended window. Demand remains stable around 100-110 units/period (mean of last 5 is ~107), but I will use a slightly more conservative mu_hat via recent_N (N=10) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high risk of stockouts given the current 0 on-hand status and supply instability. Setting L=3 with mu_hat using N=10 helps the OR backend target a base stock sufficient for the lead time plus current review period while handling the high variance in supply.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Order from Period 29 (167 units) is now 7 periods overdue and considered lost. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline increased from 441 to 608. Effective pipeline inventory is current Total In-Transit (873) minus 608 = 265 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing significant reliability issues. As of Period 37, the total confirmed lost units in the pipeline are 608 (P2: 133, P6: 154, P18: 24, P19: 25, P24: 105, P29: 167). The total in-transit listed (873) includes these lost units. Therefore, the 'effective' pipeline inventory is only 265 units (the P35 order). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains stable, with an average of approximately 111.4 units over the last 10 periods (N=10). Lead times are highly variable but frequently hit 3 periods. To ensure the 'base_stock - pipeline' logic in the OR backend results in an order that accounts for the 608 lost units, I must use 'explicit' methods. I will set L to 3 (the observed upper bound of lead time). I will set mu_hat to (1+3)*111.4 = 445.6. To compensate for the lost 608 units, I will artificially inflate mu_hat to mu_hat + 608 = 1053.6. This forces the engine to order units that it thinks are needed to reach base stock, effectively replacing the ghost inventory it sees in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Order from Period 29 (167 units) is now 7 periods overdue and considered lost. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline increased from 441 to 608. Effective pipeline inventory is current Total In-Transit (873) minus 608 = 265 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-67.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, the order from Period 35 (265 units) arrived after a lead time of 2 periods, significantly improving the stock position. However, the order from Period 29 (167 units) remains overdue by 8 periods and is confirmed lost, as identified in previous insights. The total confirmed lost units in the pipeline are P2(133), P6(154), P18(24), P19(25), P24(105), and P29(167), totaling 608 units. With a current In-transit of 789 units, the effective pipeline is 789 - 608 = 181 units (which is the order just placed in Period 37). The current inventory is 166 units. Average demand over the last 15 periods is approximately 107 units. To ensure coverage across the lead time and review period (L+1=3), and given the historical unreliability of the supply chain, I will maintain L at the most frequent actual lead time of 3 to provide a larger safety buffer in the base stock calculation, while keeping demand estimates (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) aligned with recent stable observations.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Lead time for P35 was 2 periods, but P29 (167 units) is confirmed lost (8 periods elapsed). Total confirmed lost pool: 608 units. Pipeline reliability remains low.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, the system has 37 units on-hand and 789 units in-transit. A critical analysis of the pipeline shows that 608 units are considered lost (P2: 133, P6: 154, P18: 24, P19: 25, P24: 105, P29: 167), leaving an effective pipeline of 181 units (the order from P37). The order from P35 (265 units) arrived in P37 with a lead time of 2 periods, while the P29 order is now 10 periods late and confirmed lost. Demand remains relatively stable with the last five samples (excluding P39 itself) being 74, 83, 133, 99, 129, averaging 103.6. I am setting L=recent_N (N=3) which currently reflects recent arrivals of 2-3 periods. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=10) to capture the average demand of approximately 107 units/period across the current window. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to account for recent demand volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that should cover around 4 periods of demand (L+1), adjusted by the lost units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative confirmed lost units in pipeline remains 608 (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29). Inventory calculations must subtract this 608 from the raw 'In-transit' total to determine the true replenishment need.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 110-120 units per period. The supply chain continues to involve significant risk, with 608 units definitively lost (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29). These lost units must be excluded from pipeline inventory logic by the VM to prevent under-ordering. The raw in-transit is 789; after subtracting the 608 lost units, the effective pipeline is 181 units (which is the order from P37). With on-hand inventory at 0 and only 181 units expected (likely in P40 or P41 given a 3-period lead time expectation), we are currently in a stockout. I am setting L to explicit value 3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time, and using a recent 10-period window (P30-P39) for demand to capture current consumption rates. This should trigger a replenishment order to cover the (L+1) horizon.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system is at 0 on-hand inventory. The total 'In-transit' is 789 units, but historical evidence strongly indicates a high loss rate. Specifically, the following orders are confirmed lost or significantly overdue: P2 (133), P6 (154), P18 (24), P19 (25), P24 (105), and P29 (167). This totals 608 units that should be treated as lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline is only 181 units (the order placed in P37 which is within its lead time window). Demand remains stable around a mean of 110-120. I will keep L at 3 periods as it is the most frequent actual lead time observed recently (despite a recent P35 order arriving in 2). mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand stability (~117 average). sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' for N=10 to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will see the current 'In-transit' of 789, but by setting conservative parameters, we ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the likely arrival of only the P37 order.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Effective pipeline inventory confirmed as Total In-Transit (789) minus cumulative lost pool (608) = 181 units. Lost pool includes P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, and P29.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a cumulative total of 608 lost units in the 'In-transit' bucket (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29). While the raw In-transit figure is 789, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 181 units (the order from P37). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced stockouts for the last two periods. Demand is stable, averaging 111.4 units over the last 15 periods. To recover from stockouts and account for the unreliable lead time (which frequently hits 3 periods rather than the promised 2), I am setting L to 3 and using an explicit mu_hat to ensure the base stock target covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~446 units). Since 181 units are in transit and 0 on-hand, the OR engine will trigger a significant replenishment order. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 15 periods to capture recent volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a cumulative lost pool of 608 units (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and total in-transit is 789. Subtracting the 608 lost units yields an effective pipeline of 181 units, which corresponds exactly to the order placed in Period 37. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, this Period 37 order is now 3 periods overdue (it should have arrived in Period 39 or 40). However, the system history shows lead times frequently hitting 3 periods or extending into complete loss. Demand is stable, averaging ~112 units over the last 10 periods (P33-P42). To trigger a replenishment that accounts for the fact that nearly 77% of the reported 'In-transit' stock is non-existent, I will use an explicit L of 3 to reflect the current delay and set mu_hat explicitly. Since on-hand is 0 and the effective pipeline is only 181 units while demand remains at ~117/period, a new order is necessary to prevent continued stockouts as we enter the final periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Order from Period 37 (181 units) is now 3 periods overdue, confirming the pattern of lead time exceeding promised limits or potential loss. Effective pipeline is strictly (Total In-Transit - 608 cumulative lost units).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. As of Period 44, the cumulative lost pool of inventory is 608 units (Orders from P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, and P29). With a raw In-transit of 789 units, the effective pipeline is only 181 units (the order from P37). This P37 order is now 7 periods old and has not arrived, making it highly probable that it is also lost. If P37 is lost, the actual on-hand + pipeline inventory is zero. Total confirmed lost units will likely rise to 789 (608 + 181) next period if P37 remains missing. I will set the lead time to an explicit 3 periods to align with the dominant mode seen in successful deliveries, and use a recent 20-period demand window which shows a stable mean of approximately 111 units. The goal is to trigger a significant reorder to overcome the depletion caused by the string of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Order from Period 37 (181 units) is now 7 periods overdue and almost certainly lost, potentially increasing cumulative lost pool from 608 to 789 units. Effective pipeline inventory is likely near zero.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing extreme unreliability. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Total in-transit is 789 units, but historical evidence strongly suggests a significant portion is lost. Confirmed lost units through Period 44 include: P2 (133), P6 (154), P18 (24), P19 (25), P24 (105), and P29 (167), totaling 608 units. Additionally, the order from Period 37 (181 units) is now 8 periods overdue (placed P37, current P45) and must be categorized as lost. This brings the total loss pool to 789 units (608 + 181), which exactly matches the current 'In-transit' figure on the dashboard. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. To prevent further stockouts in the final periods, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time seen in successful deliveries, and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 samples to capture the stable demand regime (~108 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Order from Period 37 (181 units) is now 8 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Cumulative lost pool increased from 608 to 789 units. Effective pipeline inventory is currently 0 as all units in the 'In-transit' display are categorized as lost shipments (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, P37).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced extreme unreliability. On-hand inventory is 0. The current 'In-transit' total of 789 units consists entirely of orders that have exceeded any reasonable lead time (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, and P37). The most recent missing order from P37 (181 units) is now 8 periods overdue, confirming it is lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has remained stable throughout the game, with a mean of approximately 110 units per period. Since the effective pipeline is zero and on-hand inventory is zero, the OR engine needs to place a large order to cover the (L+1) window. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the high actual lead times observed previously, but the backend's calculation of base stock minus pipeline will be most influenced by my assessment that the effective pipeline is empty. I will use 'explicit' values to force a high order volume to recover from the stockout, targeting roughly 4 periods of demand (L=3 + 1).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from extreme unreliability. As of Period 47, there is 0 on-hand inventory and the 'In-transit' figure of 789 units is entirely composed of shipments classified as lost according to our tracked history (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, and recently P37 which is now 10 periods overdue). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand remains in a stable regime centered around 108 units (mean of the last 15 samples). To restore service and fill the empty pipeline before the game ends in Period 50, I must set the OR parameters to trigger a large replenishment order. I am explicitly setting L=3 to account for the frequent delays observed, and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture current stable demand volatility. The OR backend will see 'effective inventory' calculated as (On-hand + In-transit) - (Lost Units), which in this case is (0 + 789) - 789 = 0, leading to a substantial order to cover (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48. The primary issue is a complete breakdown in the supply chain: 789 units are listed as 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms these are all lost (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, and P37). Effective on-hand and pipeline inventory is currently 0. Demand has remained relatively stable, averaging approximately 107 units over the last 10 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (48, 49, 50) and a promised lead time of 2 periods (actual lead time often 3), any order placed now is the last chance to satisfy demand for the final period(s). I will use 'explicit' values for L and mu_hat to ensure the OR backend ignores the 'phantom' in-transit inventory and places an order large enough to cover the remaining periods. I set L=2 (promised) to trigger the calculation, and mu_hat to 321 (3 periods of demand at ~107/period) to cover periods 48, 49, and 50. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to provide a small buffer for volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has effectively collapsed. As of Period 49, on-hand inventory is 0 and the 789 units reported as 'In-transit' are all confirmed lost based on historical performance (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, and now P37 are all decades or many periods past any reasonable lead time). Effectively, current pipeline inventory is 0. Demand remains stable around a mean of 109 units (last 10 periods average: 107). To attempt to restore service for the final periods (though only Period 50 remains), I am setting the lead time estimate to its observed average (calculate) and basing demand on the recent stable regime (N=10). Because the OR backend subtracts the 'In-transit' figure from the target base stock, and the system still sees 789 'ghost' units, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to set a value high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom inventory. I calculate the target base stock (\u03bc + z\u03c3) and add the 789 units back to it to neutralize the pipeline subtraction. Target Base Stock for L=2 (3 periods coverage) \u2248 327 + 1.28*57 \u2248 400. Adding 789 lost units = 1189.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Supply chain is non-functional. 100% of reported 'In-transit' units (789 total) are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, P37). Continuous stockouts since Period 39. Final period strategy must bypass phantom inventory.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final period. The supply chain has been severely dysfunctional, with a cumulative 'lost pool' of 789 units (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, P37) that appear in the 'In-transit' figure but will never arrive. The total In-transit is currently 1174, meaning the effective pipeline (likely to arrive) is 1174 - 789 = 385 units (which matches the order placed in Period 49). Since this is the final period, any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends (L=2 promised, actual often 3). Therefore, the goal is to set parameters that prevent a waste of capital on an order that cannot be fulfilled. However, I must provide valid OR parameters. I will maintain L at the recent mode of 3 to reflect actual lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=15) to capture the stable demand regime (~105 units/period). The OR backend will see the high In-transit vs. base stock and likely order zero, which is the optimal financial move for the final period given on-hand is zero and lead time prevents new arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Final period reached. Total 'In-transit' includes 789 confirmed lost units. Effective pipeline consists only of the 385 units ordered in P49. No new orders placed this period can arrive before conclusion.
