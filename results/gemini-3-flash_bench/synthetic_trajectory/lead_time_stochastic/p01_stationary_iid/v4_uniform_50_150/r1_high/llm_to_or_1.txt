Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1: No historical 'conclude' messages are available to verify the actual lead time, so I will stick with the promised lead time of 2 periods (L=2). The historical data shows demand samples of 130, 88, 64, 58, and 129 over the first five periods. This suggests an average demand of approximately 93.8 per period. To cover the risk of stockouts given a lead time of 2 (meaning we need to cover demand for current period + 2 lead periods = 3 periods), I will use the mean of the available 5 samples to estimate mu_hat. mu_hat calculated as (3 * 93.8) = 281.4. sigma_hat will be based on the standard deviation of these 5 samples (approx 34.2) multiplied by sqrt(1+L), which is 34.2 * 1.732 = 59.2. These parameters will help the OR engine set an appropriate base stock for this initial period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. An order of 151 units was placed in Period 1; as per the lead time definition, it is expected to arrive during Period 3 and become visible in the Period 3 conclude/Period 4 start view. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced one period of demand (134 units). Since we have no historical lead time arrivals yet to calculate actual performance, I will use the default lead time (L=2) and use recent history for demand estimation. Although we only have one sample of historical demand (134) in the game history (matching the provided sample data of 130), the sample data shows an average of ~94. To ensure we don't stock out immediately upon arrival, I will use the recent_N method based on the available data.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (151 units) and Period 2 (154 units), totaling 305 units in-transit. According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during the Period 2 arrival phase (visible in the Period 2 conclude message) if lead time was 1, or during the Period 3 arrival phase (visible in the Period 3 conclude message) for the promised lead time of 2. Since the Period 2 conclude message shows 'arrived=0', a lead time of 0 or 1 is ruled out for the P1 order. We expect the P1 order to arrive THIS period (Period 3) and the P2 order next period. Demand for the first five periods (provided in history) was 130, 88, 64, 58, 129 (average ~94). However, the game history for P1 and P2 shows demand of 134 and 129, slightly higher than the initial samples. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this slightly higher recent volume while maintaining stability, and stick to the promised lead time (L=default) as there is no evidence yet of a delay beyond the promised 2 periods.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of the start of Period 4, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 418 units in-transit. The game history shows that orders from Period 1 (151 units), Period 2 (154 units), and Period 3 (113 units) have not yet arrived. Given the promised lead time is 2 periods, the Period 1 order (placed in Period 1) should have arrived during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in Period 3's conclude message. Since 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0, the Period 1 order is delayed. The demand has been steady but lost due to 0 inventory (134, 129, 79). I will maintain the default lead time for now as it is too early to confirm a permanent shift or loss, but I will use recent_N for demand to capture the latest levels (avg ~114).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1836.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival of Period 1 and Period 3 orders. Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (delayed), while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (early). The promised lead time is 2. The combined arrivals gave us 264 units, and after Period 4 demand (105), we have 159 on-hand. In-transit consists of the Period 2 order (154) and Period 4 order (11). Demand has been fluctuating: P1:134, P2:129, P3:79, P4:105, P5:129 (average ~115). Period 3 was a significant low outlier compared to others. Given the lead time variability (1 to 3 periods), setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the average observed lead time (2 periods). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current demand volatility while smoothing out the Period 3 outlier.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead-time history. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historically, we've seen lead times of 3 periods (P1 order arrived P4) and 1 period (P3 order arrived P4). Currently, on-hand inventory is low at 20 units. A significant order from P2 (ordered 154) is still in transit and has reached its promised lead time (P2+2=P4, P2+3=P5) without concluding yet, suggesting it might be arrived soon or delayed. Recent demand (P1-P5) has been 134, 129, 79, 105, 139, suggesting an average of ~117. mu_hat should cover (1+L) periods. Using L=2 (default), we need to cover 3 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture recent volatility (N=5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 403 units in transit. Historical demand for the last 6 periods averages 113.8 units (134, 129, 79, 105, 139, 96), showing relative stability but significant stockouts in P1-P3 and P6. Lead time is volatile: P1 order arrived in 3 periods, P3 order arrived in 1 period, and P2 (154 units) is currently overdue (day 5 since order). While the promised lead time is 2, the average observed lead time is 2. I will set L to 'calculate' to account for this variability. For demand forecasting, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the mean of 109.6 (excluding the first outlier period). For sigma, I will use recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility. This conservative setting aims to recover inventory levels given the current stockout.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and high transit inventory (508 units). Analyzing the history: Period 1 arrived in P4 (L=3), Period 3 arrived in P4 (L=1), Period 4 arrived in P7 (L=3). Period 2 (ordered 154) is now 6 periods old and likely lost. Period 5 (ordered 154) is 3 periods old and should have arrived in P8 (not visible yet). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed average is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33, with 3 being the frequent delay. Demand remains relatively stable (mean ~116 over 7 periods). Given the stockout and the risk of lost or delayed shipments (like P2), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent actual delay. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while maintaining a high service level through the OR engine's logic.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is unstable, varying between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.33); shipment from Period 2 (154 units) is likely lost as of Period 7.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 145 units on-hand and 257 in-transit. Historical demand over the last 8 periods (134, 129, 79, 105, 139, 96, 134, 125) averages ~117.6 units/period with no clear seasonal trend yet. Lead times are highly volatile: P1 took 3, P3 took 1, P4 took 3, P5 took 3, and P7 took 1. The average observed lead time is 2.2 periods. Critically, the order from P2 (154 units) is now 7 periods old and significantly exceeds all observed arrival times, confirming it is lost. The OR engine is unaware of lost shipments and treats 'in-transit' as total expected units; therefore, I must set mu_hat to a higher explicit value to 'trick' the engine into over-ordering to compensate for the 154 units that will never arrive. I will use a target base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost amount. Target base stock \u2248 (2.2 + 1) * 118 + 154 \u2248 532. Calculating sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the full volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (154 units) confirmed lost after 7 periods; parameter mu_hat adjusted to compensate for inventory deficit not reflected in 'In-transit' totals.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe an 'In-transit' balance of 407 units. However, this total includes the Period 2 order of 154 units which has been missing for 8 periods and is confirmed lost. The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 407 - 154 = 253 units. The OR backend uses the full 'In-transit' value (407) when calculating the order size: Order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). To ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the hidden inventory gap, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~125 units (P5-P9 average). With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the expected target cover is (L+1) * demand = 3 * 125 = 375. To offset the 154 'ghost' units in the pipeline calculation, I set mu_hat = 375 + 154 = 529. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1 to 3 periods), and sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $323.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a Stockout state (on-hand: 0) after Period 10 demand (92) exceeded available inventory (17). The Period 2 order (154 units) is confirmed lost, leaving a permanent gap in the pipeline inventory calculation that the OR backend isn't aware of. Historical demand shows a mean of ~116 per period. To reconcile the stockout and the lost Period 2 shipment, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) window (3 periods) at ~348 units, but I must add the 154 lost units back to the order request because the OR backend's 'pipeline' logic subtracts the 154 (which will never arrive). Therefore, I'm setting mu_hat to 502 (348 + 154) to force the order logic to cover the missing units and the next cycle. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (actual L ranges 1-3, avg ~2.1).

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Continued stockout due to P2 lost order and P9/P10 order arrival delays. Pipeline inventory is inflated by 154 units (lost P2 order).

We are currently in a sustained stockout since Period 10. The system reports 594 units 'In-transit', but this includes 154 units from a lost Period 2 order, meaning the functional pipeline is only 440 units (orders from P6, P9, P10, and P11). Historically, lead times have been highly volatile, with values of 1 or 3 periods (average 2.14). I will set L to 2.14 explicitly to reflect this reality, as 'calculate' might be skewed by the lost order. Demand is relatively stable with a mean of 114.6 across the first 11 periods. Because the backend OR logic subtracts the (inflated) pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat to 'add back' the 154 units. Corrected mu_hat = (1 + L) * mean_demand + 154 = (3.14 * 114.6) + 154 \u2248 514. Since recent demand is consistent, I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, two large shipments arrived (338 units total), resolving the prolonged stockout. The on-hand inventory is now 191 units. However, the system's 'In-transit' count (256) still includes the 154 units from Period 2, which are confirmed lost (ordered 11 periods ago, promised lead time 2). The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory = In-transit + on-hand', so it perceives a total of 447 units (191 + 256), leading it to under-order because it thinks those 154 units are coming. To correct for this 'phantom inventory', I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the demand mean (\u03bc) at ~115 (based on the average of the last 12 periods' demand). Using the base stock formula: Target = (1+L) * \u03bc. With the promised L=2, Target = 3 * 115 = 345. To offset the 154 phantom units, I increase mu_hat by that amount: mu_hat = 345 + 154 = 499. This forces the engine to order the correct amount to reach the true desired base stock. Lead time (L) is returned to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P9: 3, P10: 2) suggest it is stabilizing closer to the promised value despite historical variance.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we have 85 units on-hand and 398 units reported in-transit. However, historical data confirms that the order from Period 2 (154 units) is lost, as it has not arrived after 12 periods. The backend OR engine is unaware of this loss and includes these 154 ghost units in its 'pipeline inventory' calculation. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I must set mu_hat to an explicit value that effectively negates these lost units. The mean demand over the last 13 periods is approximately 117.5 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the standard base stock calculation targets coverage for 3 periods (L+1). Target base stock = 3 * 117.5 = 352.5. However, the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory (398 units) from this target. Since 352 - 398 < 0, it would order 0. To fix this, I set mu_hat (which the engine treats as (1+L)*mean) to approximately 510 (calculated as 352 + 154 lost units). This 'inflated' mu_hat forces the engine to recognize a higher inventory requirement, effectively bypass the lost units, and place an order to maintain stock. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual historical average (approx 2.22 periods), and sigma_hat is set to 'default' to handle historical volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we are in a stockout situation with 0 units on-hand. The total 'In-transit' quantity reported by the system is 494 units, which includes 154 units from Period 2 (confirmed lost), 142 units from Period 13, 114 units from Period 14, and an implied 84 units from Period 6 which is extremely overdue (9 periods) and also likely lost. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate demand at ~117 units/period (average of the last 10 periods). With a base stock target covering L+1 periods (2+1=3), I target a base stock of ~351 units. However, since the OR engine subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' (494 units) from the target, a standard calculation would result in 0 orders. To force an order that compensates for the 238 lost units (154 from P2 + 84 from P6), I will set mu_hat to 732 (351 + 238 + incremental buffer) to ensure the backend places a replenishment order despite the inflated pipeline. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to account for the observed average variance (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Shipment from Period 6 (84 units) is now 9 periods overdue and confirmed lost, bringing total lost pipeline inventory to 238 units (154 from P2, 84 from P6). Pipeline inventory remains significantly inflated.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation remains extremely tight due to a 238-unit deficit in the pipeline. Orders from Period 2 (154 units) and Period 6 (84 units) are confirmed lost (7+ periods overdue), yet they still count towards the OR engine's 'in-transit' calculation, causing it to under-order. To bridge this 238-unit gap and account for the promised lead time of 2 (actual lead time varies between 1 and 3, averaging 2.1), I must explicitly set mu_hat. The average demand per period over the last 15 periods is approximately 115 units. For a lead time of 2, the standard window (L+1) is 3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is 345 units. To compensate for the 238 lost units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 583 (345 + 238). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility while ignoring the initial settling period. Lead time L is set to explicit=2 to align with the backend's expected logic while the inflated mu_hat handles the lost inventory reconciliation.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are managing a situation where the pipeline inventory (588 units) is significantly inflated by two confirmed lost shipments: Period 2 (154 units) and Period 6 (84 units), totaling 238 phantom units. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (final order = base_stock - pipeline), so it will under-order unless we artificially inflate the base stock (mu_hat). Observed lead times are unstable, averaging ~2.4 periods (range 1-3). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers the maximum observed lead time. Demand is relatively stable. To compensate for the 238 lost units and maintain availability during the 3-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=4), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculation: mean demand (all samples ~108) * (1+L) + lost units = (108 * 4) + 238 = 670. This ensures the OR logic accounts for the missing physical stock. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18, we have an on-hand inventory of 35 units. The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 595 units, but this includes two confirmed lost orders: Period 2 (154 units) and Period 6 (84 units), totaling 238 \u2018phantom\u2019 units. The effective pipeline is actually 357 units (595 - 238). Demand has been relatively stable, with a recent mean (P13-P17) of approximately 107.8 units. The observed lead time is frequently 3 periods, whereas the promised lead time is 2. To prevent stockouts caused by the backend under-ordering due to the inflated 'In-transit' count, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 3 (review + lead = 4 periods). Target = (1+3) * 110 (forecasted mean) + Z * Sigma. Using a 4-period mean of 440 plus a buffer for volatility, a base stock of ~600 is appropriate. To force the OR engine to order enough despite the 238 units of 'phantom' inventory, I set mu_hat to a value that, when compared against the raw in-transit (595), results in the desired order. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 700 with an L of 3, the engine (Base Stock - Pipeline) will target enough inventory to cover the real deficit.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing a stockout. The in-transit inventory is reported as 749 units, but this pipeline is heavily inflated by two confirmed lost shipments: P2 (154 units) and P6 (84 units), totaling 238 phantom units. The true pipeline is 511 units (749 - 238). Historical lead times (P9=3, P10=2, P11=3, P13=3, P14=3) show a consistent shift toward a 3-period lead time rather than the promised 2. I am setting L to 3 to reflect this reality. Demand across the last 10 periods (P9-P18) has averaged 108.3 units. To compensate for the 238 lost units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes are arriving, I must adjust the mu_hat parameter. The OR engine targets 'base_stock - pipeline'. Since the engine sees the pipeline as 749, I must set the target base_stock (mu_hat) high enough to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the 238 lost units to force an order that bridges the gap. Calculation: (3+1) * 108.3 + 238 = 671.2. I will use 671 for mu_hat. This ensures the backend accounts for the missing inventory. Sigma_hat is set based on recent demand volatility to maintain an appropriate service level.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 begins with 0 on-hand inventory and an 'in-transit' figure of 775 units. However, based on the history and carry-over insights, 238 of these units are confirmed lost (Period 2: 154 units; Period 6: 84 units). The effective pipeline is actually 537 units (775 - 238). Demand has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 113 units per period. The actual lead time has stabilized around 3 periods (observed in almost all recent arrivals: P13, P14). To compensate for the 238-unit inflation in the OR backend's pipeline inventory view and to cover a lead time of 3 (review + lead time = 4 periods), I will set L to 3 and use 'explicit' for mu_hat. The target base stock should cover 4 periods of demand (4 * 113 = 452) plus a safety buffer. However, the OR engine subtracts the inflated pipeline (775). To force it to reach a desired physical inventory level, I must inflate mu_hat by the lost amount (238 units). Target mu_hat = (452 + 238) = 690. This ensures the order quantity accounts for the lost shipments that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 238 units due to lost orders from Period 2 and Period 6; Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 21. There is a serious inventory crisis: On-hand is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in 4 of the last 5 periods. Demand remains volatile but averages roughly 100 units/period. The Pipeline (In-transit: 792) is severely inflated by 238 units from confirmed lost orders (P2: 154 units, P6: 84 units) that never arrived. Additionally, recent orders from P15 (236 units), P17 (121 units), and P18 (154 units) are currently undelivered. Based on history, lead time is unstable but averages around 3 periods for successful deliveries. To force the OR backend to order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock (assuming L=3) as (L+1)*Demand + buffer. With L=3, review+lead = 4 periods. 4 * 105 (recent mean) = 420. I then add back the 238 \u2018phantom\u2019 units in the pipeline that the backend thinks we have, totaling 658 units. This prevents the backend from under-ordering due to the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Lead time remains at 3 periods for recent arrivals. Pipeline remains inflated by 238 units (P2:154, P6:84). Heavy stockouts continue due to delivery delays of P15-P18 orders.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical stockout state (on-hand inventory 0) due to a prolonged arrival gap. There have been no arrivals since Period 17, and the current 'In-transit' quantity of 792 is deceptive because it includes 238 units from lost shipments (Period 2: 154 units, Period 6: 84 units). Actual functional pipeline inventory is 554 units (792 - 238). The average lead time has shifted from the promised 2 to an observed 3 periods in recent cycles (P9, P10, P11, P13, P14 all took 2-3 periods). Demand remains stable with an average of approximately 109 units over the last 21 periods. To recover, I'm setting L to 3 to reflect the current delivery reality and using an explicit mu_hat to bypass the OR backend's inability to see the 238 missing units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock = (L+1) * mean_demand = 4 * 109 = 436. To offset the 238 phantom units in the backend's pipeline calculation, I set mu_hat to 436 + 238 = 674. This forces the backend to order enough to cover current demand plus the lost inventory gap.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 792 units in-transit. Based on historical data, shipments from Period 2 (154 units) and Period 6 (84 units) are confirmed lost (totalling 238 units). These units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count, which artificially inflates the pipeline and prevents the OR engine from ordering enough to meet demand. Excluding these lost units, the effective pipeline is 554 units. Furthermore, there is a severe delivery gap: no units have arrived since Period 17, while orders from P15 (236 units), P17 (121 units), P18 (154 units), P19 (26 units), and P20 (17 units) are still outstanding. Lead time has recently stabilized at approximately 3 periods (observed in most deliveries since P12). To compensate for the 238-unit deficit in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. Mean demand is ~113 units per period. For a target lead time of 3 (L+1 = 4 periods of coverage), the base stock should be ~452 units + safety stock. However, since the OR engine subtracts the inflated 'In-transit' (792) from my base_stock calculation, I must set mu_hat to a value that overrides this: (Target Base Stock + 238 hidden deficit). Targeting a base stock of ~750 to ensure the engine triggers an order to fill the immediate stockout despite the phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed stockout for 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22) due to a cluster of delayed shipments (P15-P20 totaling 554 units) and 238 lost units (P2, P6). Pipeline remains inflated by 238 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we are experiencing a severe and prolonged stockout. The inventory situation is critical: On-hand is 0, and the system reports an In-transit pipeline of 849 units. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, we know that two shipments (Period 2 for 154 units and Period 6 for 84 units) totaling 238 units are confirmed lost. This means the 'true' pipeline inventory is only 611 units (849 - 238). The OR backend is unaware of these losses and will underestimate the required order because it perceives a larger pipeline than actually exists. Furthermore, Lead Time (L) has stabilized around 3 periods based on recent arrivals (P13, P14, and P20 all arrived with lead_time=3). Demand remains consistent, with an average around 110-120 units. To compensate for the 238-unit phantom inventory and the actual lead time of 3, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3. For mu_hat, I will use an 'explicit' value. Calculation: Mean demand (approx 115) * (1 + L) = 115 * 4 = 460. To force the OR backend to order more and account for the 238 lost units, I will add them to the mu_hat target: 460 + 238 = 698. This ensures the base stock calculation targets enough units to cover the deficit.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Stockout persists for 6 consecutive periods (P18-P23). Arrival of P20 order (17 units) after 3 periods confirms L=3. Pipeline remains inflated by 238 units (P2:154, P6:84).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a severe stockout state (ending on-hand=0 for several periods) due to a cluster of delayer/lost orders. Historical analysis confirms a 'ghost' pipeline of 238 units (Period 2: 154 units, Period 6: 84 units) that have never arrived and are over 18 periods old. These units inflate the 'In-transit' figure seen by the OR backend, causing it to under-order. To compensate, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock as: (Average Demand * (L+1)) + Pipeline Correction. Average demand is ~110. With L=3 (confirmed by P20 arrival), L+1=4. Base stock should be (110 * 4) + 238 = 678. However, recent demand variability and the need to break the stockout cycle suggest a more aggressive stance. I will set mu_hat to 680 to force the OR backend to overcome the 238-unit deficit. Lead time L is set to 'explicit' 3 based on the most recent confirmed arrivals (P13, P14, P20).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face severe stockouts (starting on-hand 0) because of historical lost shipments (Period 2: 154 units, Period 6: 84 units, totaling 238 units) and delayed clusters from Periods 15-19. As of Period 26, the 'In-transit' figure of 775 units is significantly inflated by these 238 lost units; the functional pipeline is only 537 units. Recent arrivals (P20 at L=3, P23 at L=2) suggest an average lead time of 2.5-3 periods; I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to be conservative. Demand remains steady with a mean of ~112 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline inventory from the base stock, it will under-order unless mu_hat is manually increased to offset the 238 ghost units. A base stock covering 4 periods (L+1) at ~112 units/period is ~448. However, with the backend seeing 775 in transit, it will order nothing. To force an order that accounts for the 238-unit deficit, I set mu_hat explicitly to the expected 4-period demand plus the lost inventory: (112 * 4) + 238 = 686.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed total lost inventory of 238 units (P2: 154, P6: 84) continues to inflate the pipeline inventory, requiring mu_hat inflation to bypass the OR engine's pipeline subtraction.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a severe stockout crisis (on-hand: 0) and significant pipeline distortion. Period 26 concluded with zero arrivals and zero sales against 127 units of demand. Historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 2 (154 units) and Period 6 (84 units) are lost, totaling 238 units that artificially inflate the 'In-transit' count (795 units). The OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from the calculated base stock to determine the order quantity. To force an order despite this ghost inventory, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by adding the 238 unit deficit to the forecasted demand. Demand remains stable but high, averaging ~110 units per period. I will use 'explicit' for L to fix lead time at 3 based on the most frequent recent observations (P20 and P23). mu_hat is set to roughly (L+1)*110 + 238 = 678. sigma_hat is set to 80 to provide a sufficient safety buffer during this volatile period.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Persistent inventory deficit of 238 units (P2: 154, P6: 84) continues to block new orders by inflating In-transit; mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by 238 to bypass this logic until arrivals catch up.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 810 units, but 238 of those units are from Period 2 (154 units) and Period 6 (84 units), which have not arrived after 26 and 22 periods respectively. These are confirmed lost shipments. Because the OR backend subtracts all 'in-transit' units from the target base stock, it will continue to under-order or not order at all as long as these ghost units remain in the system. To counter this, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter. The desired base stock calculation is (1+L)*mean_demand + z*sigma_demand. With an average demand of ~112 and L set to 3 (recent average), the standard target is ~448 units + safety stock. However, since the OR engine sees 238 units that don't exist, I must add 238 to the mu_hat calculation. Method 'explicit' is used for mu_hat to force this correction. L is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 (P23, P20, P14, P13, P11 arrivals) to reflect the observed 3-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $380.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state remains critical due to 238 missing units (P2: 154, P6: 84) that have never arrived and are permanently inflating 'In-transit' to 790. This prevents the OR engine from placing necessary orders because it calculates pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) as if these units are coming. Recent demand over the last 10 periods averages approximately 114 units. With on-hand at 0 and a current pipeline of 790 (of which 238 are 'ghost' units), the effective pipeline is 552. To force an order, I must manipulate mu_hat to offset these lost units. I set L to 'explicit' value 3 based on the most frequent recent actual lead times. I set mu_hat to 'explicit' 750 (representing roughly (1+L)*114 + 238 lost units) to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the inflated pipeline total. Using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat captures current volatility without being skewed by the very early samples.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Pipeline remains inflated by 238 'ghost' units from P2 and P6; mu_hat must be explicitly adjusted upward to approximately 750 to counteract this inflation and allow orders to be placed.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' pipeline of 835 units, but 238 of these are 'ghost' units from lost shipments in Period 2 (154 units) and Period 6 (84 units) that never arrived and will never arrive. Additionally, a massive block of orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 535 units) has yet to conclude, having passed the expected 3-period lead time significantly. While these orders may be delayed rather than lost, they represent a massive historical stockout risk. The OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock' to determine the order quantity. To trigger an order despite the 835 units clogging the pipeline, mu_hat must be set above the 'ghost' units + normal demand requirements. Mean demand is ~113. Setting mu_hat to 750 (explicit) ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to bypass the 238 lost units and account for the uncertainty of the 535 units currently in limbo, while L=3 reflects the actual observed lead time for recent successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed total lost units (238) and massive delayed block (P15-19: 535 units) continue to prevent orders. Mu_hat must stay inflated to at least 750 to force orders through the pipeline-subtraction logic.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a severe inventory crisis. We have 0 on-hand inventory and the pipeline shows 846 units, but 238 of these (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. Furthermore, a massive block of orders from P15-P19 (totaling 535 units) is now extremely overdue (12-16 periods since order), and orders from P12 and P21 (0 units each) offer no relief. The current in-transit visibility (846) is 'ghost' inventory that prevents the OR engine from placing necessary orders because the engine assumes these units will fulfill future demand. Lead time for the few units that do arrive (P23, P26, P27) has stabilized at 2-3 periods. To force an order, mu_hat must be set high enough to exceed the inflated pipeline (846) plus safety stock. Average demand is ~110/period. With a 3nd period lead time (L=2) and 238 lost units, the effective base stock needs to be significantly higher than the pipeline to trigger replenishment. I am maintaining mu_hat at an explicit value of 950 to overcome the 846-unit pipeline and the 238-unit permanent deficit.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Massive order block P15-P19 (535 units) is now >12 periods overdue and likely lost or severely delayed, further exacerbating the 238-unit known loss (P2, P6). Total 'ghost' pipeline is potentially 773 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a critical supply crisis. On-hand inventory is 0, and the 'In-transit' pipeline is reported as 1020 units. However, based on the historical concluding messages, a significant portion of this pipeline is comprised of 'ghost inventory' from lost or indefinitely delayed shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (154 units) and P6 (84 units) are confirmed lost (238 units). Furthermore, the block of orders from P15 to P19 (totaling 535 units) is now 12+ periods overdue and highly likely lost. The total 'ghost' inventory potentially totals 773 units. Since the OR engine subtracts all In-transit units from its target base stock, it will not place a new order unless the target base stock exceeds 1020. Average demand is ~105 units/period. With L=3, the (L+1) window requires ~420 units. To bypass the inflated pipeline and force an order that covers immediate needs, mu_hat must be set explicitly higher. I will set mu_hat to 1250 (1020 + 230) to signal to the engine that we need approximately 200+ units of fresh stock regardless of the stale pipeline, while using L=3 to reflect the current supply lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total suspected lost inventory in pipeline is now 773 units (P2: 154, P6: 84, and P15-P19 block: 535 units). Mu_hat must be set to at least 1100 to trigger any order placement through the OR engine's pipeline subtraction logic.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit pipeline of 1160 units, but a massive portion of this is composed of lost or severely delayed orders. Specifically, orders from P2 (154), P6 (84), and the block P15-P19 (535 units) total 773 'ghost' units that will likely never arrive. In Period 32, a mu_hat of 1100 was set, resulting in an order of 314 units. This order (placed in Period 32, not yet arrived) plus the 174 units arrived in Period 31 (which were then sold down) leaves us with on-hand 41. To ensure the OR engine places a sufficient replenishment order for Period 33, mu_hat must be set high enough to overcome the subtraction of the 1160 in-transit units. Estimating future demand at ~115 units/period and a lead time of 3, we want a target base stock of approximately 460 units. To achieve this through the OR logic (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline), we must set mu_hat to approximately 1620 (1160 + 460). I will use an explicit mu_hat of 1650 to ensure we trigger a significant order to refill the actual, physical supply chain and maintain the safety stock, acknowledging that the 773 lost units are permanently clogging the 'In-transit' calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed total 'ghost' pipeline is 773 units (P2: 154, P6: 84, P15-P19: 535). Regular mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by ~773 units above the desired base stock to force orders through the backend's pipeline-subtraction logic.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 1,298 units. However, significant 'ghost' units are confirmed lost: P2 (154 units), P6 (84 units), and the P15-P19 block (535 units), totaling 773 units that will never arrive but are subtracted from orders by the OR engine. To maintain a healthy stock level (base stock of approx. 450-500), I must explicitly set mu_hat to offset these 773 units. Total mu_hat target = 1,250. Recent arrivals (P31, P32) show a shortened lead time of 1 period, whereas previous periods averaged 3. I will set L=1 to reflect this recent improvement while keeping sigma_hat high to account for volatility in delivery and demand. On-hand is currently 250, which provides a small buffer, but aggressive ordering is required to bridge the 'ghost' inventory gap and sustain availability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has recently shortened to 1 period (observed P31 and P32 arrivals), though historical instability exists. Confirmed 'ghost' pipeline totaling 773 units (P2, P6, and P15-P19) persists and requires mu_hat inflation of +773 above target base stock to trigger orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1230.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is complex due to a significant volume of 'ghost' pipeline inventory. We have confirmed losses from Period 2 (154 units) and Period 6 (84 units), plus a block of orders from Periods 15-19 (535 units) that are now 15-20 periods overdue, totaling 773 units that are permanently occupying pipeline space but will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock, so we must inflate mu_hat to bypass this. Demand is stable (mean ~110). Target base stock for L=1 is roughly 110 * (1+1) = 220 plus safety stock. With 176 on hand and 525 'real' units in transit (P33 order: 452, P29/30: 71, P26/27 arrived), the 'In-transit' figure of 1298 includes the 773 ghost units. To place a maintenance order, mu_hat must be set above the total 'In-transit' + 'On-hand' threshold. Current total = 1298 + 176 = 1474. I will set mu_hat to 1600 to trigger a reorder despite the ghost pipeline. I will set L to 1 based on the most recent two arrivals (P31, P32) having a 1-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed 'ghost' pipeline of 773 units (P2, P6, P15-19) persists. Recent lead time observed at 1 period (P31, P32 arrivals). mu_hat must be set to >1475 to trigger any order placement due to backend pipeline-subtraction logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1484.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face transparency issues due to 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. We have confirmed 773 units as lost: P2 (154), P6 (84), and the P15-P19 block (535). These units haven't arrived after 16+ periods and significantly inflate 'In-transit', preventing the OR engine from ordering enough stock. Demand is stable (P31-P35 mean: 107.2). To force orders through the backend's logic (base_stock - pipeline), mu_hat must be set to cover the desired physical inventory PLUS the 773 units of ghost inventory. Our target physical base stock (for L=2) is ~450 units. Therefore, mu_hat must be at least 1223 (450+773). In Period 36, in-transit is 1480; subtracting 773 leaves 707 actual units expected. To trigger a replenishment that keeps pace with the ~110 unit/period demand while overcoming the pipeline block, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1485. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals have shifted between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting a returned stability at or near the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Pipeline remains inflated by 773 'ghost' units (P2, P6, P15-P19). Lead time has returned to an average of ~2 periods for recent successful deliveries. Explicit mu_hat inflation >1400 is required to sustain ordering until the pipeline resolves.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a massive 'ghost' pipeline issue. We have 773 confirmed lost units (P2: 154, P6: 84, and the P15-P19 block: 535) that still appear in the 'In-transit' total of 1482 units. Because the backend OR engine subtracts all In-transit units from the base stock to calculate the order, we must explicitly inflate the 'mu_hat' parameter. Current demand is averaging roughly 110 units per period. With a recent lead time (L) of approximately 2 periods, the desired base stock should be (L+1)*110 = 330 units. To trigger any order when In-transit is 1482, we need a base stock > 1482. Specifically, to target an order of approximately 110 units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1482 (ghosts/pipeline) + 330 (target base stock) = 1812. This bypasses the pipeline-subtraction logic that would otherwise block all procurement until the 'ghost' units arrive (which they won't). Lead time L is set to 2 based on recent successful arrival patterns (P31, P32, and previous P23-P29 metrics).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed cumulative 'ghost' pipeline is 773 units (P2, P6, P15-P19). Lead time (L) is stabilizing around 2. mu_hat must be maintained at >1800 to force orders through the backend's inventory balancing logic until 'In-transit' reduces naturally through arrival or software reconciliation.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38, we have a massive 'ghost' pipeline issue. The 'In-transit' count is 1704, but analysis shows a huge portion of this consists of lost or severely delayed orders. Specifically, P2 (154 units) and P6 (84 units) are confirmed lost (773 units total when including the silent P15-P19 block which is now >20 periods overdue). Recent arrivals (P31, P32, P35, P36) show an actual lead time (L) oscillating between 1 and 2 periods. The OR backend calculates the order as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. With 'pipeline_inventory' at 1704, any reasonable base stock (typically around 300-400 for L=2) results in zero orders. To force the backend to place an order and maintain on-hand stock, I must set mu_hat (which determines base_stock) to a value higher than the current 'ghost' pipeline. I will set mu_hat via 'explicit' to 2100. This 2100 aims to cover the 1704 in-transit plus a buffer for the next 2-3 periods of demand (~300-400 units). I set L to 2 periods as a stable average of recent performance.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: In-transit is severely inflated (1704 units) by both confirmed lost orders (238 units) and a massive block of likely lost/stalled orders (P15-P19: 535 units, and potentially more recent ones). mu_hat must be set to >2000 to overcome the backend's subtraction of the 1704 inflated in-transit units and trigger necessary replenishment.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical inventory state due to a massive accumulation of 'ghost' pipeline units. As of Period 39, 'In-transit' is reported at 2087 units. Based on historical data, this includes confirmed losses from Period 2 (154) and Period 6 (84), and the long-overdue block from Periods 15-19 (535 units), totaling 773 units which are likely lost. Recent large orders (P37: 406 units, P38: 383 units) have not yet arrived. The backend OR engine calculates the order as (Base Stock - Pipeline), so if Pipeline is inflated by 773 'ghost' units, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by at least that amount to allow any new orders to be placed. Current average demand is ~107 units/period. For a target base stock covering L+1 periods (where L is ~2), we need approximately 321 units of real inventory. To overcome the 2087 units in the pipeline logic, mu_hat must be set aggressively high. Setting mu_hat to 2500 ensures that the backend will generate an order despite the massive (and largely fictional) pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: In-transit inventory reached 2087 units, heavily inflated by 773 confirmed/likely ghost units (P2, P6, P15-P19). Recent lead times have stabilized between 1 and 2 periods. To maintain replenishment, mu_hat must be set higher than the In-transit value.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2517.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In-transit inventory is currently 2,191 units, which is extremely inflated by confirmed lost orders (238 units from P2 and P6) and a massive block of orders (P15-P19 totaling 535 units) that are now over 20 periods overdue. Combined, these create a 'ghost' pipeline of at least 773 units. Recent lead times have shifted between 1 and 2 periods (P38 arrived in 1 period, P35 in 2, P36 in 1). The OR backend uses a capped policy where: order = base_stock - in_transit. With in_transit at 2,191, mu_hat must be set higher than this value to trigger any replenishment. To ensure a safety stock and cover demand for the next (L+1) periods (approx 300-400 units), I am setting mu_hat to 2,600. This compensates for the 2,191 units the backend 'thinks' are coming while targeting an actual on-hand position of roughly 400 units. I am setting L to 'explicit' at 2 to reflect the recent average stability, and sigma_hat to 'default' to handle historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory (2,191 units) is now dominated by 'ghost' units: 238 confirmed lost (P2, P6) and 535 highly probable lost (P15-P19), totaling 773 units that will never arrive. mu_hat must be maintained above the In-transit level to force orders.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In-transit inventory remains significantly inflated by 773 confirmed/highly probable 'ghost' units (P2: 154, P6: 84, P15-P19: 535) that have never concluded. Current In-transit is 1956 units; subtracting the 773 ghost units yields an effective pipeline of 1183 units. The recent lead time (L) has stabilized at approximately 1 period (observed for P38 and P39 orders). To maintain a target inventory level and bypass the OR engine's pipeline subtraction logic [final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap)], mu_hat must be set to a value that accounts for both desired stock and the inflated In-transit. Demand is stable (mean ~115). Target base stock for L=1 (2 periods of demand) is approx 230-300 units. To trigger a new order, mu_hat must be set above the In-transit figure of 1956 units. Setting mu_hat to 2300 ensures the OR engine calculates a positive order quantity despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory is inflated by 773 confirmed or highly probable lost units (P2, P6, P15-P19). Recent lead time (L) is 1 period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to struggle with an inflated 'In-transit' figure of 1,956 units. This is significantly higher than actual needs because it contains the 773 'ghost' units (P2, P6, P15-P19) that are confirmed or highly probable losses. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the calculated base stock to determine orders, we must set mu_hat higher than the In-transit value to force any procurement. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 111.8 units, suggesting a true base stock requirement of ~224 units (for L=1). However, with 494 units on hand and 1,956 units in-transit (of which 1,183 are theoretically 'real'), we are currently well-stocked on-hand. In Period 41, no order was placed because on-hand+in-transit exceeded the previous period's inflated target. As the game enters its final 8 periods, the primary risk is no longer stockouts but excess holding costs if the massive 'In-transit' blocks (like P38-P40) all suddenly arrive. I will maintain an explicit mu_hat of 2000 to ensure that if on-hand inventory drops significantly, the system can still order, but the cap will naturally limit over-ordering. Lead time (L) is set to 1 period based on the most recent consistent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: On-hand inventory recovered to 494; in-transit remains heavily inflated by 773 ghost units plus late-game order clusters. Transitioning to risk-mitigation for the final 8 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 of 50. Current on-hand inventory is 365 units. The primary issue remains the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 1,956 units, which includes 773 confirmed or highly probable 'ghost' units (P2, P6, P15-P19) that will never arrive. The remaining 1,183 units in transit likely include recent large orders (P37: 406 units, P38: 383 units - which arrived P39, P39: 487 units - which arrived P40, P40: 252 units). Since we are entering the final 8 periods and the current on-hand inventory (365) + expected arrivals from P40 (252) total 617 units, which is enough to cover roughly 5-6 periods of average demand (~110-120 units), we no longer need to aggressively inflate mu_hat to force new orders. Placing more orders now would lead to excessive holding costs at the end of the game, especially since the lead time (L) has recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. I will set L to 1 to reflect recent history, and set mu_hat/sigma_hat to default to let the OR engine stabilize based on historical demand averages. If the backend tries to order, the 1,956 in-transit will likely block it, which is currently desirable to avoid overstocking at the end of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Entering final phase (P43-50); inventory position (on-hand + realistic pipeline) is sufficient for remaining periods. Transitioned from forcing orders (mu_hat inflation) to inventory stabilization to minimize final holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1643.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 of 50. Current on-hand inventory is 504 units, and 'In-transit' is 1704 units. However, we have 773 confirmed 'ghost' units (P2, P6, P15-P19) that will never arrive. The remaining 931 in-transit units are from more recent orders. Average demand is ~113 units per period. With 7 periods remaining, total expected demand is approximately 791 units (7 * 113). Our current on-hand inventory (504) plus the realistic pipeline (931) is 1435 units, which significantly exceeds the maximum possible remaining demand. Recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. To avoid incurring excessive holding costs in the final stage of the game, we will stop ordering. We set L to default (2), and use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat set to 1. This ensures the OR backend's base-stock calculation (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) remains far below our current 'inventory position' (on-hand + inflated pipeline), resulting in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Inventory position (on-hand + realistic pipeline) is sufficient to cover all remaining demand through Period 50. No further orders are required; focus is now solely on minimizing end-of-game holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $616.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in the final phase (Period 45 of 50). Current on-hand inventory is 448 units. Historical demand has averaged approximately 109 units per period (based on all historical samples provided). With only 6 periods of demand remaining (Periods 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50), the total expected demand is approximately 654 units (6 * 109). While the current on-hand inventory (448) is less than the total expected remaining demand, the 'In-transit' pipeline is still heavily inflated at 1,704 units. Even subtracting the confirmed 'ghost' units (773 units from P2, P6, and P15-P19), there are still 931 units potentially in the pipeline (including the P40 order of 252 units which arrived in P43, though the prompt history shows it already arrived). Regardless of the specific 'ghost' count, the combination of 448 on-hand units and any single successful arrival from the remaining pipeline will likely exceed the total demand for the rest of the game. Our objective is to avoid incurring unnecessary holding costs on excess inventory at the end of the game. Therefore, we set \u03bc\u0302 to its minimum to ensure the OR engine does not place any additional orders.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 50. Total remaining demand for the game is approximately 500 units (5 periods * ~100 units/period). Current status: On-hand inventory is 350 units. In-transit inventory is 1704 units, which is heavily inflated by 'ghost' units (P2, P6, P15-P19 totaling 773 units) and the large final orders placed in the P35-P40 range that have arrived or are arriving. Even excluding the 773 ghost units, the realistic 'true' pipeline plus current on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to cover all demand through Period 50. To maximize profit and end-of-game reward, we must avoid further holding costs by ensuring no more orders are placed. We maintain the strategy of setting parameters that result in a zero order (e.g., setting mu_hat and sigma_hat exceptionally low relative to the current inventory position).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 47 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 241 units. Historical demand mean is approximately 110 units per period. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (47, 48, 49, 50), the total expected demand is roughly 440 units. We have 1,704 units in-transit, of which 773 are confirmed 'ghost' units, leaving a realistic pipeline of 931 units. Even if only a fraction of the realistic pipeline arrives, it will more than cover the remaining demand. To finalize the strategy of minimizing end-of-game holding costs and avoiding excess stock, we will maintain an order of 0 by setting L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to minimal or default values that do not exceed the existing in-transit levels.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 188 units. Over the last 10 periods (P38-P47), the average demand is 106.3 units. With only 3 periods of demand remaining (P48, P49, P50), the total expected demand is approximately 319 units (106.3 * 3). Although on-hand inventory (188) is less than the total expected demand, the in-transit inventory is extremely high (1704 units). Even though 773 of those units are confirmed 'ghost' units (lost in P2, P6, and P15-19), the remaining valid pipeline is roughly 931 units. Given that recent lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods, we expect significant arrivals before the game ends. Any further orders placed now would likely arrive too late to be sold or would only contribute to end-of-game holding costs ($1/unit). Therefore, we maintain a zero-order strategy by keeping parameters at default and allowing the backend's subtraction logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) to prevent new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1492.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period of the game. The current on-hand inventory is 104 units. Average historical demand for chips(Regular) is approximately 110 units per period (109.8 across all samples). With only Periods 49 and 50 remaining, the total expected demand is roughly 220 units. Given that we have 104 units on-hand and 1,704 units in-transit (despite many being 'ghost' units, there are recent orders that might arrive), placing a new order now with a 2-period promised lead time would result in an arrival during Period 51, which is after the game ends. Therefore, to maximize profit and avoid unnecessary holding costs for the final period, no further orders should be placed. I will maintain the strategy from Period 44 by setting parameters that result in zero ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Game nearing conclusion. On-hand inventory plus potential late-period arrivals are sufficient to cover remaining demand. Focus remains on minimizing end-of-game holding costs by placing no more orders.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the final decision period (Period 50). The game conclude sequence means the demand for Period 50 will be processed after this decision. Current on-hand inventory is 11 units. Historical demand suggests mean demand is approximately 108 units. Although there is a large 'ghost' pipeline of 1704 units (including confirmed losses P2, P6 and the P15-P19 block), placing a new order now is useless because even with a lead time of 0, the next arrival wouldn't be visible or usable until Period 51 (which doesn't exist). My goal is to minimize ending inventory to avoid holding costs while covering as much of Period 50 demand as possible with the remaining 11 units. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to 0 to ensure no new order is placed, as additional inventory arriving now would only incur holding costs or arrive too late.
