Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are [130, 88, 64, 58, 129], averaging ~94 units/period. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 47 units aims to maintain a base stock. However, given the inconsistency in lead times and the fact that 145 units (Period 2) are significantly overdue if the lead time were the promised 2 days, there is a risk of a stockout if those units are lost. However, since Period 1 took 3 days, it's highly likely the 145 units arrive in Period 5. If they do, the 112 on-hand + 145 arrival = 257 units, which is plenty for 2-3 periods of demand.

Pipeline Reliability: Looking at the 330 in-transit units, 145 (P2) are confirmed lost. The P6 order of 80 units is overdue (4 periods vs. promised 2), leaving only the P9 order (105 units) as reliable pipeline. 5.

The reliable pipeline consists of orders from P17 (120), P18 (120), P19 (110) and P21 (not yet placed), totaling 350 units. Lead-time Inference: Actual lead times have been highly variable (1-3 periods). The order from P17 (120 units) was placed 4 periods ago and has not arrived, which is concerning but matches the 3-period lead-time + 1-period visibility delay pattern. Given the current 0 on-hand status and stockouts in P18, P19, and P20, we are in a critical state. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it sees 675 units in-transit against its internal 3-period target. Adjusting for the 325 lost units, the 'real' pipeline is 350. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1) at a mean of 90, we need 270 units. Since 350 units are theoretically in-bound, following the OR's recommendation of 0 is mathematically sound even after accounting for losses, provided the P17-P19 shipments arrive.

Historically, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with a significant history of lost shipments. \n\n2. **Inventory & Lost Shipments Analysis**: The system shows 1,125 units 'In-transit'. However, my Carry-over Insights indicate that 675 units (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19) are effectively lost. The 'Reliable' pipeline consists of orders from Period 24 (100 units), Period 25 (100 units), Period 27 (125 units), and Period 28 (125 units), totaling 450 units. Orders from P24 and P25 are now 5 and 4 periods old respectively; since the maximum successful lead time observed is 3 periods, these are now highly likely lost as well. This leaves an effective reliable pipeline of 250 units (P27, P28).\n\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is 84.6 units. Period 29 starts with 61 units on-hand.\n\n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees a massive 'In-transit' figure (1,125 units) and ignores that most of it is lost. To cover demand for the next 3 periods (expected lead time + decision period), I need approximately 255-270 units.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand fluctuates between ~50 and ~150 units, with a recent average around 95 units. Inventory Position: On-hand is 104 units.

Thus, the effective pipeline is 1685 - 1365 = 320 units (representing orders from P44, P45, P46). Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely due to the inflated system 'In-transit' value and currently healthy on-hand stock.

With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50) and a consistent lead time of 2-3 periods, there is no benefit in placing further orders.

Total confirmed lost units are reaching ~1,365+, meaning the 'effective' pipeline is much smaller. Demand analysis: Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows an average of ~92 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 0 following a stockout in Period 48. Inventory & Pipeline: The orders from P44 (120 units), P45 (120 units), P46 (80 units), P47 (80 units), and P48 (0 units) constitute the effective pipeline. P44 arrived in P44. P45 arrived in P45. P46 and P47 are still in transit (160 units reliable). Since this is the penultimate period (Period 49 of 50), any order placed now must have a lead time of 0 or 1 to be useful. If the lead time is the promised 2 or the frequently observed 3, the order will arrive after the game ends. However, looking at the recent history, P40, P41, and P42 all had a lead time of 3, while P43 had a lead time of 2. There is a possibility of a 1-period lead time (observed in P39), but it is risky. Strategy: The OR recommends 0. Given that we are at Period 49, even a 1-period lead time order would arrive for the final demand resolution of Period 50. Since we are currently stocked out and the reliable pipeline (P46, P47) should arrive in Period 49 or 50, placing a small hedge order is safer than 0 to capture potential Period 50 demand, assuming the 1-period lead time is possible.",
