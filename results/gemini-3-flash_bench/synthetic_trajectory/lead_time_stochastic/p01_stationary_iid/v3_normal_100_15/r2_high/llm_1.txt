The order from P1 (350 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of P3 and be visible at the start of P4. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'.

{
  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable demand regime with a mean of approximately 98 units per period over the last 15 periods. The supplier has a high historical loss rate (approx. 40%) and volatile lead times (1-3 periods). At the start of Period 43, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent orders P40 (150 units), P41 (150 units), and P42 (100 units) are currently in-transit. Order P40, placed in Period 40, has reached the 3-period threshold (Period 42 conclude) and failed to arrive, which strongly suggests it may be lost based on past patterns. To prevent an extended stockout, I need to order to cover demand for the next 3 periods (the maximum observed reliable lead time), plus a safety buffer for the high loss rate. Expected demand for 3 periods (P43-P45) is ~300. Given that P40 is likely lost, I must rely on P41 and P42 for upcoming arrivals. Ordering 200 units ensures sufficient potential pipeline even if one of the upcoming shipments is lost.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Order P40 (150 units, placed Period 40) is highly suspect as lost after failing to arrive by the Period 42 conclude (3rd period after order). Current on-hand is 0, confirming a stockout occurred in Period 42.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 100 units per period (recent average P37-P43 is ~98). Supplier reliability remains the primary challenge, with a historical loss rate of approximately 40% and a variable lead time of 1 to 3 periods for successful arrivals. Order P41 (150 units) is currently at its 3rd period (ordered P41, arriving during P44 or later); it should arrive in the current Period 44 (visible P45) given the max observed lead time of 3. Order P42 (100 units) is also in progress. Currently, on-hand inventory is 52 units, which is insufficient to cover the current period's demand (~100 units) before arrivals occur. To manage the high loss rate and protect against the stockouts seen in Periods 41-43, I will maintain an aggressive ordering strategy. The goal is to ensure that even with a 40% loss rate, the 'effective' pipeline covers at least 3 periods of demand plus safety stock. Total in-transit is misleadingly high due to historical lost orders (P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37), so I focus on recent active orders (P41, P42, P43).",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 98-100 units per period over the long term, with the most recent 10-period average at 98.4. Supplier performance remains risky; the loss rate is approximately 40%, and successful lead times range between 1 and 3 periods. Looking at the pipeline: Order P42 (100 units) is now at 3 periods elapsed and should arrive in P45 or be considered lost soon. Order P43 (200 units) and P44 (150 units) are within the 1-3 period window. Currently, on-hand inventory is 91 units. With a target of covering 3 periods of demand (~300 units) to account for the maximum reliable lead time, and considering a 40% probability that any single order fails, I need to maintain a robust pipeline. Current high in-transit (1650) is heavily skewed by 12+ historical lost orders (approx 1200+ units), so the 'real' active pipeline is roughly 450 units (P42, P43, P44). To prevent a stockout if P42 is lost and P43 or P44 are delayed/lost, I will order 150 units, which ensures ongoing replenishment without excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).",

Analyzing the pipeline: Orders arrive with high volatility (Lead Time 1-3 periods) and a significant loss rate (~40%). Looking at recent orders: P44 (150 units) and P45 (150 units) are in transit and within the expected delivery window (P44 could arrive in P46 or P47; P45 could arrive in P46, P47, or P48). To calculate the order for P46: The game ends at P50. We need to cover demand for P46, P47, P48, P49, and P50. Total remaining demand is approximately 5 periods * 100 units = 500 units. Current inventory (284) + expected arrivals from P44 (150 * 0.6 probability) + P45 (150 * 0.6 probability) = 284 + 90 + 90 = 464 units. Given the potential for stockouts due to the 40% loss rate and the high profit margin ($19) vs. low holding cost ($1), it is optimal to maintain a buffer. I will order 150 units to ensure coverage through the final periods, accounting for the high probability that one or more pipeline shipments may be lost.",

Order P45 (150 units) is at lead time 2. Orders P46 and P47 (150 units each) are also in-transit. Since we are at Period 48 of 50, we only have three more demand cycles (P48, P49, P50). Total expected remaining demand is ~300 units. Our current on-hand (90) plus the high probability that one of the recently placed orders (P44, P45, P46) arrives is sufficient to cover the final periods.

The game ends at Period 50, so any orders placed now in Period 49 must have a lead time of 1 period to arrive in time for Period 50's demand resolution. Historically, lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, and about 40% of orders are lost. Orders placed in P46, P47, and P48 are currently in-transit. Order P44 (placed P44) is now confirmed lost as it did not arrive by P48 conclude (4 periods elapsed). Order P45 (placed P45) is also suspect as it has not arrived in 3 periods. Given Period 50 is the final period, the goal is to satisfy Period 49 demand from any same-period arrivals (unlikely given L>=1) and prepare for Period 50. However, the in-transit pipeline (P46, P47, P48) is the only realistic source of stock for the final period.
