Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For the first period of the simulation, we start with zero inventory. The provided demand history for 'chips(Regular)' over 5 periods shows values of 88, 133, 93, 108, and 110. Calculating the mean of these 5 samples gives 106.4 units per period. The standard deviation is approximately 17.5. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since there is no current evidence of lead-time drift or demand regime changes, I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * mean = 3 * 106.4 = 319.2 and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L) * std = sqrt(3) * 17.5 \u2248 30.3. This approach establishes a baseline stock level based on all available historical data to handle the initial demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The item 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 2 periods. In Period 1, an order of 136 units was placed, but it has not arrived yet (as expected with L=2). On-hand inventory is 0, and 90 units of demand were lost in Period 1. Historical demand for Period 1 to 5 provided in the prompt shows an average of roughly 105 units (88, 133, 93, 108, 110). Since we only have one period of actual game play (Period 1 demand: 90), but have the historical sample set, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the baseline demand of ~105 per period. Setting N=5 for demand and volatility based on the provided historical samples. The lead time L is set to default (2), as we have no evidence yet that the actual lead time differs from the promise.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, the demand for chips(Regular) has been: P1=88, P2=133, P3=93, P4=108, P5=110 (from provided historical data) and actual realized demand in P1=90, P2=106. The average demand is approximately 104 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (136 units) and P2 (135 units) are currently in-transit (total 271). Per the lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive during P3's arrival resolution (visible at the start of P4). Since we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in P1 and P2, we must ensure the base stock covers demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). I will use the default method for L (2) and mu_hat (calculated over all available samples, roughly 104 * 3 = 312) to allow the OR backend to stabilize the inventory level.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (136 units), Period 2 (135 units), and Period 3 (64 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests a potential delay in lead time or shipment loss. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we have missed the first expected arrival, we must maintain a robust pipeline. Demand has been relatively stable (90, 106, 102), with an average of approximately 99 units. I will use 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to adjust as soon as arrivals occur, and 'recent_N' for demand parameters using all 3 available completed periods to capture the current mean (~100) and variance.

Daily Profit: $468.00, Daily Holding Cost: $83.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $385.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we received shipments from Period 1 (lead_time=3) and Period 3 (lead_time=1). The promised lead time is 2, and the average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. Demand over the first 5 periods has been relatively stable with an average of approximately 105 units (90, 106, 102, 117, 110). Current on-hand inventory is 83, and there is one shipment of 135 units from Period 2 still in transit (which has now reached 3 periods of lead time). Given the volatility in actual lead times (1 to 3 periods), I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed performance. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, since the demand pattern is consistent and we have 5 samples, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most relevant recent mean and variance for the base-stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile: observed 1 and 3 periods against a promise of 2 periods.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) after Period 5 demand cleared the remaining inventory. Historical demand for the 5 periods is {88, 133, 93, 108, 110}, with a mean of ~106. In-transit inventory is 257 (comprising the 135 units from P2 and 122 units from P5). The P2 order (135 units) is now at lead time 4, which is significantly overdue relative to the promise of 2 periods and the previously observed max lead time of 3. This suggests a potential lost shipment or a very unreliable supply chain. Given the stocked-out status and the lead time volatility (1, 3, and now 4+ periods), I will set L to 3 (the max confirmed lead time) to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for longer uncertainty. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the stable but slightly fluctuating demand pattern around 106 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is highly unstable: observed 1, 3, and currently 4+ periods (P2 order still missing). Supply chain reliability is low.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 with a critical stockout (0 on-hand inventory). In-transit inventory is 379 units, but arrival reliability is very poor. Historically, P1 (136 units) arrived in P4 (LT=3) and P3 (64 units) arrived in P4 (LT=1). Crucially, the order from P2 (135 units) is still missing after 5 periods which suggests it is likely lost or severely delayed. Orders from P5 (122 units) and P6 (122 units) are within the promised 2-period lead time window. Demand shows a mean of ~94 units across 6 periods, but has softened recently (56 units in P6). However, because we have 0 on-hand and are relying on a potentially broken pipeline (missing P2 order), I will set L to 3 to increase the pipeline safety stock target, and use Recent_N for demand to capture the current trend (avg ~90). This will nudge the OR backend to place a larger order to recover from the stockout and the lost P2 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: P2 order (135 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost; lead time is unreliable.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, we are facing an inventory stockout (On-hand: 0). The demand history (Periods 1-7) averages ~93 units per period. The supply chain is highly unstable: orders from Period 2 (135 units) are now 6 periods old and definitively lost. Orders from Period 5 and 6 (122 units each) are still in transit (3 and 2 periods old respectively). Given the promised lead time (L=2) and the observed volatility (L=1, L=3, and lost orders), I am setting L=3 to encourage the OR backend to maintain a larger pipeline to buffer against these delays. For mu_hat, I use the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current demand rhythm (Period 3-7 mean ~91), adjusted for the review+lead window (1+3). For sigma_hat, I use the same window to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Supply chain failure confirmed - Period 2 order (135 units) is now 6 periods overdue and lost; periodic stockouts are occurring due to lead time instability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $291.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of lead times reveals extreme instability and order loss: Period 1 (3 periods), Period 2 (lost/missing after 7 periods), Period 3 (1 period), Period 5 (3 periods), and Period 7 (1 period). The average of observed successful lead times is (3+1+3+1)/4 = 2.0. However, the loss of the Period 2 order (135 units) has caused significant stockouts. Demand appears stable, with samples Period 1-8 showing: 90, 106, 102, 117, 83, 56, 99, 88 (Mean \u2248 93). Given the reliability issues, I will set L to the promised 2 periods to avoid over-ordering through the 'cap' mechanism, but use explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*Mean = (1+2)*93 = 279. To protect against the high variance and potential for lost orders, I am setting an explicit sigma_hat of 60 (significantly higher than the sample std of ~18) to force a higher base stock level and build a safety buffer on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain continues to be highly unreliable: 20% of orders lost (P2 order), others swinging between 1 and 3 periods lead time. Demand remains stable around 93 units/period.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with lead times oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, and one confirmed lost order (Period 2). The average demand across all 9 periods is approximately 92.7 units. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory with 269 units in-transit (orders from Periods 6, 8, and 9). Period 6's order (122 units) is now at its 4th period of lead time and should ideally arrive in Period 10 or 11. To account for the high lead time variability and the risk of stockouts seen in Period 9, I am setting L to 3 (the max observed successful lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. mu_hat is set using a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand level of ~84 units/period, and sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value to protect against the high volatility in both demand and supply arrival times.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Supply volatility remains the primary risk; stockouts occurred in P9 due to arrival gaps despite sufficient total in-transit quantity. Order P2 (135 units) is officially categorized as a permanent loss.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 starts with 0 on-hand inventory and 374 units in transit. The supply chain for 'chips(Regular)' is significantly unstable: Order P2 (135 units) is confirmed lost, and lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (Average LT = 2, but reliability is low). Periods 9 and 10 resulted in stockouts due to the gap in arrivals. Demand has shown a slight increase in Period 10 (130) compared to the long-term average (approx 93), and the most recent 5-period average is approximately 93.4. Given the stockouts and the lost shipment, I must ensure the OR backend accounts for the missing units by setting L to 'explicit' at 3 (reflecting the historical max delay) to inflate the base stock requirement, and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the slightly higher recent demand (93.4) versus the full history (104, though skewed by early high samples). Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the volatility seen in the demand samples (std dev ~23). The goal is to rebuild on-hand inventory to prevent further lost sales while accounting for the fact that 135 units in the 'in-transit' total are never arriving.

The main challenge is severe lead-time instability and order loss. Period 2's order is confirmed lost. Recently observed lead times (Periods 4 and 8) show a pattern of 'split arrivals' where orders placed later (L=1) arrive with orders placed earlier (L=3), leading to intermittent stockouts. Orders were placed in P9 (12 units), P10 (105 units), and P11 (39 units), totaling 156 units expected soon. Since 'promised' L=2 is unreliable and the system suffered stockouts in P10 and P11, I will use L=3 to increase the base stock calculation, providing a larger buffer against arrival gaps. For demand, the recent 5-period average (recent_N=5) captures the current consumption rate well.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Supply chain remains unstable with 0 on-hand inventory due to arrival gaps; setting L=3 explicitly to buffer against frequent 3-period lead times and lost units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain environment for chips(Regular) continues to be highly unstable. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, and the order from Period 2 (135 units) has been confirmed as lost. Recent arrivals (Period 12) show 12 units arriving in 3 periods (P9) and 105 units arriving in 2 periods (P10), which is better than previous delays but still reflects inconsistency. Demand remains relatively stable, averaging approximately 99 units over the last 12 periods, though we have experienced significant stockouts due to supply gaps. To buffer against the high probability of 3-period lead times and the risk of lost shipments, I am maintaining an explicit lead time of L=3. For demand forecasting, I will use a recent_N of 5 periods (Periods 8-12) to capture the current mean of ~89.4 units per period, which provides a safer base stock calculation to cover the (L+1) window. This strategy aims to build a small inventory buffer to prevent future stockouts caused by arrival jitter.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Currently in Period 14, looking at Period 13's conclude. The system ended with 0 on-hand inventory because Period 11's order (39 units) and Period 12's order (27 units) haven't arrived yet. Historical lead times have been {3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2}, showing high volatility around the promised L=2, with one confirmed lost shipment (Period 2). Demand is stable: the mean of all 13 periods is 96.3, and the mean of the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 101.4. Given the frequent stockouts caused by lead time instability (3 periods observed 3 times), I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the slight uptick in recent mean demand (101.4 * 4 = 405.6). This combination increases the 'pipeline target' to protect against the unreliable supply chain while demand remains relatively steady.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Lead time remains inconsistent with a modal value of 3 periods (3 out of 6 arrivals). Sustained stockouts (P1, P2, P3, P5, P6, P7, P9, P10, P11, P13) are driven by supply gaps rather than demand spikes.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) continues to be the primary concern, while demand remains relatively stable. Historically, we see a mean demand of approximately 98 units per period (sample mean: 97.4). However, lead times are inconsistent, often hitting 3 periods (P1, P5, P9, P11) or resulting in lost shipments (P2). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 397 in-transit. In-transit units include: P12 (27), P13 (73), P14 (40), and the lost P2 (135). Discounting P2, effectively 262 units are in-transit. Since we are entering Period 15 with 0 on-hand, and the modal arrival lead time is 3 periods, I will set L to 3 to provide a larger safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) with N=10 to capture the most recent stability (avg ~96), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit high volatility and unreliability. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory because arrivals (27 units in P15) are insufficient to cover demand (98 in P15). Looking at the history, lead times for successfully delivered orders are frequently 3 periods (P1, P5, P9, P11, P12) despite the promise of 2 periods, and the P2 order is confirmed lost. Since P13 (73 units), P14 (40 units), and P15 (14 units) are still in transit, we expect arrivals to resume, but the gaps have caused persistent stockouts. I will continue to set L explicitly to 3 to provide a safety buffer against these frequent 3-period arrivals. Demand remains relatively stable; using the last 10 periods (P6-P15) to calculate mu_hat captures the current mean of ~95.8 units/period. The pipeline inventory (384) is high, so the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a smaller order this period to avoid overstock once the cluster of in-transit orders finally arrives.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed high frequency of 3-period lead times (5 out of 8 current arrivals). Supply chain remains the primary driver of stockouts.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly volatile with a modal lead time of 3 periods (observed in orders from P1, P5, P9, P11, P12, and P13), frequently exceeding the promised lead time of 2. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 343 units in transit. Stockouts are frequent due to arrival gaps rather than demand surges. I am setting L=3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period lead times and to protect against the high risk of stockouts. Demand (mean ~99.4) remains relatively stable based on the last 16 periods, so I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime. By setting L=3, the mu_hat calculation will cover (3+1)=4 periods of demand, effectively increasing the base stock target and increasing the likelihood that the in-transit inventory covers the arrival gaps.

Daily Reward (R_t): $288.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit high volatility, with lead times ranging between 1 and 3 periods, and the order from Period 2 (135 units) officially deemed lost. In Period 17, 72 units arrived, but this was insufficient to meet a demand of 104, leaving on-hand inventory at 0. Historical demand is consistently averaging around 96-100 units per period. Because of the frequent 3-period lead times observed (P1, P5, P9, P11, P12, P13, P14), I will maintain L=3 explicitly to ensure the OR backend accounts for a longer pipeline requirement. This helps prevent the frequent stockouts caused by arrival gaps. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~99.5 units) and sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect current volatility. This approach balances the high service level required (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) against the unreliable supply arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Lead time distribution remains skewed towards 3 periods (6 of last 10 arrivals); on-hand inventory remains chronically exhausted due to arrival timing gaps rather than demand spikes.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be the bottleneck, with lead times frequently extending to 3 periods (6 out of the last 10 arrivals). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 425 units in-transit. The Period 2 order (135 units) remains lost and has been factored out of effective pipeline math. Demand is stable, averaging 106.67 units over the last 3 periods and approximately 98 units over the last 10. To mitigate the frequent 3-period lead times and the associated stockouts, I am maintaining L=3. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the slightly higher recent demand (approx. 98/period) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This approach creates a larger buffer to bridge the gaps between irregular arrivals.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to demonstrate high volatility, with a modal lead time of 3 periods and significant arrival gaps resulting in chronic stockouts (P18-P19). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 436 units in transit. The promised lead time of 2 is unreliable; history shows lead times of 1, 2, and frequently 3 periods, plus one lost order (P2). Demand is stable, averaging ~98 units per period over the last 10 periods. To protect against the frequent 3-period arrivals and the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I am setting L=3 explicitly. For demand, I will use a recent_N of 10 to capture the current mean of ~98.4 units, which results in a mu_hat of ~393.6 (4 periods of demand). This aggressive parameterization aims to build enough pipeline/safety stock to bridge the gaps caused by erratic arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Chronic stockouts (P18-P19) confirmed due to arrival gaps. Lead time remains modal at 3 periods (7 of last 12 arrivals).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be the primary constraint for chips(Regular). Historically, 50% of the arrivals (8 out of 16 delivered batches) have experienced a lead time of 3 periods, while 25% arrived in 1 period, 12.5% in 2 periods, and one order (P2) was lost entirely. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 443 units in-transit (ordered in P17, P18, P19, P20). Specifically, the P17 shipment (80 units) is expected to arrive during P21 (L=3). Demand remains relatively stable with the most recent 10-period mean at approximately 108.5 units. Given the frequent stockouts caused by 'arrival gaps' (Periods 18, 19, and 20), I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high probability of a 3-period lead time. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the slightly higher demand variance observed in recent periods while keeping the OR backend responsive to the current demand level (~100-110 units).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be the primary bottleneck. On-hand inventory is currently 0, despite a high in-transit volume (443 units). Looking at arrival history, lead times for Period 18, 19, and 20 orders have not concluded yet (if they were 1 or 2 periods, they would have arrived by now). Looking at the historical actual lead times: P1(3), P3(1), P5(3), P7(1), P9(3), P10(2), P11(3), P12(3), P13(3), P14(3), P16(1). The mode is clearly 3 periods, and the current gap (P18-P21 with no arrivals) suggests the recent orders are likely following that 3rd-period arrival pattern or are delayed. To prevent the OR backend from underestimating the required pipeline stock, I am setting L=3 explicitly and calculating mu_hat based on the recent demand regime (mean demand approx 105 over the last 10 periods). Sigma_hat is set to recent volatility to ensure the service level accounts for demand spikes and arrival uncertainty.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of crisis. No inventory has arrived since Period 17, resulting in five consecutive periods of 100% stockouts (P18-P22). Based on historical data, orders from P18 (74 units), P19 (11 units), and P20 (7 units) are currently 'In-transit' but overdue relative to the promised 2-period lead time. Previous history shows a modal lead time of 3 periods, but the current gap suggests either a cluster of 3-4 period arrivals or further lost shipments (like the P2 order). The pipeline currently holds 443 units, which is high, but the on-hand inventory is 0. I will maintain L=3 as the planning horizon to account for the frequent delays. Demand is stable (mean ~102), so I will use a recent_N of 10 to capture the current demand level. The OR backend needs to maintain a higher base stock to bridge these arrival gaps, and L=3 will force a larger safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Critical supply chain breakdown confirmed with 5 consecutive periods of zero arrivals (P18-P22) despite orders being placed; current on-hand inventory remains 0.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a catastrophic breakdown. Between Period 18 and Period 22, no arrivals occurred despite significant in-transit inventory. In Period 23, only 7 units (from Period 20) arrived, which was immediately sold, leaving on-hand inventory at 0. Currently, 436 units are in-transit, including orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 that are now significantly overdue (L > 4). Because the OR backend's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, the presence of these 'zombie' units (orders that are likely lost or severely delayed) prevents the system from placing new orders. To force the OR backend to order and recover from the chronic stockout, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat of 650. This value is roughly 50% higher than the current pipeline, intended to overcome the pipeline deduction and the 0.95 service level cap, ensuring a fresh order is placed despite the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Extreme supply chain failure. Cumulative zero arrivals from P18-P22 and negligible arrival in P23 (7 units) confirm that most of the 436 units in-transit are likely lost or severely delayed beyond 5+ periods. Pipeline inventory is now misleading the OR engine.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has effectively collapsed, with massive order losses and extreme lead-time deviations. Period 24 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 arrivals. Currently, 648 units are theoretically in-transit, but historical evidence suggests severe unreliability. Specifically, orders from Period 15 (14 units), Period 17 (80 units), Period 18 (74 units), and Period 19 (11 units) are all overdue (>4 periods), amounting to 179 units likely lost. The OR engine subtracts all 648 units of 'in-transit' when calculating new orders; to force the engine to place necessary orders despite this phantom pipeline, I am setting L to 5. This increases the base stock target (covering 6 periods of demand) to physically exceed the inflated in-transit figure. Demand remains stable near 100 units/period. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=24, I capture the full range of recent demand while pushing the target high enough to overcome the pipeline-inventory deduction caused by the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Massive pipeline inflation confirmed. At least 179 units in-transit (Orders P15, P17, P18, P19) are significantly overdue and likely lost, causing the OR engine to under-order due to the high reported 'in-transit' value.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of extreme distress. Total in-transit inventory is reported as 648 units (roughly 6.5 periods of demand), yet on-hand inventory has been 0 or near-zero since Period 18. Analysis of arrivals shows significant losses: Order P2 (135 units) is 24 periods overdue; Orders P15, P17, P18, P19 (total 179 units) are at least 6 periods overdue. More recently, orders from P21-P23 were for 0 units. The OR engine is currently paralyzed by 'ghost' pipeline inventory\u2014it sees 648 units in-transit and assumes no new orders are needed to meet the base stock. To force the OR engine to order despite this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values. I am targeting a base stock that covers 4 periods (L=3 + 1) of demand (approx 100/period) plus a safety buffer, totaling 600 units. Since on-hand is 0, the engine will order [600 - in_transit]. By setting mu_hat to a very high value (1200), I effectively bypass the pipeline deduction to trigger maximum possible orders (capped by the safety logic) to replenish the actual physical stock, as the current 648 in-transit units are largely non-existent.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed that at least 314 units of reported 'In-transit' inventory (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) are lost or permanently delayed. Pipeline inventory is currently a false metric, leading to chronic stockouts.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is in a state of severe failure. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced chronic stockouts due to massive arrival gaps. Historical evidence confirms that 'In-transit' inventory is a false metric: critical orders from Period 2 (135), Period 15 (14), Period 17 (80), Period 18 (74), and Period 19 (11) are likely lost, totaling at least 314 units that will never arrive. Because the backend OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock, it has been under-ordering for over 10 periods. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value of 1800. This highly inflated value is designed to force the OR engine to place large orders (like the 465 units in P26) despite the phantom pipeline inventory. This 'over-ordering' is the only way to overcome the math of the capped policy and physically get units into the store. I will maintain L=3 as the modal actual lead time to ensure the target reflects the longer cycles observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Pipeline inventory is confirmed compromised; at least 314 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) are lost. Continued use of highly inflated explicit mu_hat (1800+) is required to force the OR engine to order past the phantom pipeline and restore on-hand inventory.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of catastrophic failure with extreme lead-time volatility and significant lost inventory. On-hand inventory is 0 and has been effectively 0 for the last 10 periods. The 'In-transit' value of 1586 is highly misleading because it includes at least 314 units from orders placed in Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, and 19 that are clearly lost or permanently delayed. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'phantom' pipeline from its order calculation, it will continue to under-order or not order at all, despite persistent stockouts. As observed in Period 27, I am using a massive explicit mu_hat (calculated as (1+L)*forecast + phantom_pipeline) to bypass this deficit. Since demand is stable around 100 units/period and the 'phantom' pipeline is roughly 314-400 units, and assuming L=3 (review+lead = 4), a base stock of roughly 1900-2000 is needed to force an order of ~400-500 units. I am maintaining the explicit mu_hat at 1800 to continue forcing deliveries until physical arrivals actually stabilize on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Phantom pipeline inventory now likely exceeds 400 units given lack of arrivals from P24-P27 orders. Explicit mu_hat must remain >1800 to overcome the OR engine's subtraction of these lost units from the order quantity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, a major arrival of 465 units (from the Period 26 order) finally restored on-hand inventory to 346 units. This confirms that while lead times are volatile (2 periods for this arrival), orders are not consistently lost, but rather heavily bunched. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1357 units is still heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory'\u2014specifically the likely lost orders from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, and 19, which total several hundred units. If I revert to default parameters, the OR engine will see 346 on-hand + 1357 in-transit = 1703 'available' units, which vastly exceeds any reasonable base stock for a 2-3 period lead time, causing it to stop ordering entirely (order = 0). To prevent another stockout once the current 346 units are depleted, I must maintain an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 1900 to ensure the engine calculates a base stock high enough to trigger new orders despite the 1357 units in-transit. I will use L=3 to reflect the most frequent actual lead time observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Large arrival of 465 units (P26 order) confirms lead time volatility rather than total cessation of supply; however, 'In-transit' remains inflated by ~400+ likely lost units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19), requiring continued use of explicit elevated mu_hat to force ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-319.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has shifted from a period of extreme failure to sudden large arrivals. In Period 28, 465 units arrived (from P26), and in Period 29, 473 units arrived (from P27), both with a lead time of 2 periods. This has pushed on-hand inventory to 719 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1108 units is significantly inflated by older, lost shipments. Based on history, orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling ~314 units) are almost certainly lost. Additionally, orders between P21-P25 yielded almost nothing, suggesting further phantom inventory. Currently, 719 on-hand units cover approximately 7 periods of demand (~100 units/period). With 1108 units reported in-transit, the OR engine would normally stop ordering entirely, leading to a future stockout once the phantom units fail to arrive. I will maintain a high explicit mu_hat (1200) to ensure the system keeps a healthy buffer, accounting for the fact that ~400-500 of those in-transit units do not exist. I'm lowering mu_hat from the previous 1800+ because we finally have significant on-hand stock and recent arrivals confirm some lead-time stability (L=2).

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Significant arrivals from P26 and P27 confirm that recent lead time has stabilized at 2 periods. However, 'In-transit' remains inflated by approximately 450+ units from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24 which are significantly overdue and likely lost. High on-hand inventory (719) currently provides a buffer, but explicit parameters are still needed to counteract the phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has recently shown signs of stabilization with three consecutive arrivals (P26, P27, P28) all adhering to a lead time of 2 periods. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 872 units is significantly inflated by historical lost orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24), totaling approximately 450+ phantom units. On-hand inventory is currently high (845 units) due to the arrival of forced large orders from P26 and P27. The OR engine will subtract the full 872 in-transit units from its target inventory calculation; to ensure it continues to order enough to meet demand (avg ~100 units/period) despite this phantom pipeline, I must maintain an elevated mu_hat. Given the current surplus, I am slightly reducing the explicit mu_hat from previous periods to avoid excessive overstocking while still accounting for the ~450 lost units. Setting mu_hat to 800 (calculated as (1+L)*100 + 500 buffer) to ensure the OR engine sees a target high enough to place small maintenance orders if needed, or at least not stop ordering for too long. L is set to 2 as recent performance suggests the promised lead time is currently being met.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Lead time has stabilized at 2 periods for the last 3 arrivals (P26, P27, P28 orders). Phantom pipeline remains at approximately 450 units (sum of P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized over the last three arrivals (Orders P26, P27, P28) with a consistent lead time of 2 periods, which matches the promised lead time. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 872 units is significantly inflated by approximately 450 units from historical orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) that are long overdue and confirmed lost. These phantom units mislead the OR backend's replenishment logic. With a current on-hand inventory of 761 and an average demand of ~100/period, we have about 7 periods of cover. However, to prevent future stockouts once the on-hand inventory depletes, we must counteract the phantom pipeline. I will continue using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the true required base stock for a 2-period lead time as (1+L)*mean_demand + safety_stock \u2248 3*100 + 1.64*sqrt(3)*15 \u2248 350. To force an order when (base_stock - (true_pipeline + phantom_pipeline)) < 0, I must set mu_hat to approximately (True_Base_Stock + Phantom_Units). Given 350 + 450 = 800, and current on-hand is high, I will set mu_hat to 800 to ensure the engine doesn't stop ordering once on-hand drops, while avoiding excessive holding costs now.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with the last three processed orders (P26, P27, P28) arriving with a consistent lead time of 2 periods. However, the system currently reports 872 units in-transit. Based on historical data, at least 451 units of this 'in-transit' inventory are from significantly overdue orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) which are confirmed lost. This 'phantom' pipeline inventory causes the OR engine to under-order. With 679 units on-hand, we have enough stock to cover approximately 6-7 periods of demand (avg ~100/period). To prevent the OR engine from stopping orders entirely once this buffer is depleted, I am maintaining an explicit mu_hat of 600 (representing (1+L) * demand, where L is stabilized at 2). This value is high enough to ensure we don't 'zero out' on orders due to the phantom pipeline, while the current high on-hand stock naturally caps excessive replacement ordering for now via the base-stock formula.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Lead time stabilization at 2 periods confirmed (P26, P27, P28 arrivals). Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory remains approximately 451 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods, as seen in the arrivals from periods 26, 27, and 28. However, there is a significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory of approximately 451 units (from periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 24) that are long overdue and effectively lost. The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock. To prevent the engine from hitting its ordering cap or under-ordering once on-hand inventory depletes, I must counteract these 451 phantom units. Current on-hand is 556, and demand is stable around 100 units/period. The target inventory for a 2-period lead time should cover 3 periods of demand (~300 units). With 556 on-hand, we don't need to order immediately, but we must ensure that once inventory drops, the 'In-transit' figure\u5e76\u4e0d prevent new orders. I will use an explicit L of 2 and an explicit mu_hat that accounts for the phantom units (approx 300 target + 451 phantom = 751). Since current on-hand (556) is above our real target, 'default' or 'recent_N' parameters would result in zero orders, which is appropriate for now given the high holding costs. I will set mu_hat to a level that allows the engine to recognize the need for stock once on-hand falls below the safety level, while acknowledging the 451 units currently 'bloating' the pipeline.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods for the most recent arrivals (P26, P27, P28). However, the system reports a phantom 'In-transit' pipeline of approximately 451 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) which are significantly overdue and likely lost. This phantom inventory misleads the OR engine into under-ordering. Currently, we have 479 units on-hand, which covers approximately 4.8 periods of demand (avg ~100/period). To maintain this safety buffer while accounting for the ~451 phantom units, I am using an explicit mu_hat. The goal is to reach a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the phantom units: (3 periods * 100) + 451 = 751. Since on-hand is 479 and reported in-transit is 872, the OR engine sees 1351 'available' units. To force any order at all, the mu_hat would need to exceed 1351. However, since we have a healthy on-hand balance of 479, we do not need to order immediately. I will set mu_hat such that the base stock target is below our current perceived inventory to prevent over-ordering while we bleed off the excess on-hand stock and monitor if any more 'lost' units arrive.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods, as seen in the arrivals for Orders P26, P27, and P28. However, the 'In-transit' quantity of 872 units is significantly inflated by approximately 451 units from likely lost/long-overdue orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). The current on-hand inventory is 386 units, which is sufficient to cover about 4 periods of demand (avg ~95/unit). Given the inflated pipeline, the OR engine will not place new orders if using standard parameters. I will maintain a slightly elevated mu_hat via the 'recent_N' method (N=10) to reflect recent demand volatility (~100 units/period) while acknowledging that we are currently in a 'destocking' phase from the large arrivals in P28-P30. I will keep L at 2 (promised/recent) as the delivery speed has normalized. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR backend this period due to high on-hand levels, which is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom pipeline'\u2014approximately 451 units (from orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24) that are significantly overdue and likely lost. These units are still counted as 'In-transit' by the OR engine. With on-hand inventory now at 294 units and a lead time of 2 periods, the stock will be exhausted in ~3 periods. To prevent a stockout, new orders must be placed now. However, because the backend subtracts the 872 in-transit units (which includes the 451 lost units plus recent orders) from the base stock, a standard L=2, mu_hat=300 policy would result in an order of 0. I am using an explicit mu_hat of 1200 to counteract the phantom inventory. Calculation: Target base stock (3 periods * 100) + Phantom units (451) + Buffer = ~800-900. By setting mu_hat to 1200, the OR engine (calculating base stock as mu_hat + safety stock) will generate an order of roughly (1200 + safety) - 872 \u2248 400+, which is necessary to replenish physical stock as the current 294 units dwindle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $226.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods for the most recent batch of orders (P26, P27, P28). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 929 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that are significantly overdue and likely lost. Specifically, P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24 (totaling approx. 451 units) are long overdue. Additionally, naturally occurring arrivals from P29-P36 are zero because no orders were placed during that period of high on-hand stock. The on-hand inventory has now depleted to 190. To ensure the OR engine places a sufficient order despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting an explicit L=2 and an explicit mu_hat of 1200. This high mu_hat (target stock level) forces the formula (final order = base_stock - pipeline) to produce a positive value despite the 929 in-transit units. Given the demand mean is ~100, a goal of having ~400 units in the system (4 periods of cover) is healthy; by setting mu_hat high, we signal the need to maintain replenishment as the buffer erodes.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: In-transit inventory remains critically inflated by approximately 451 units of lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Explicit parameters must be used to bypass the OR engine's pipeline subtraction to avoid terminal stockouts as on-hand inventory depletes.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Based on history, orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24 (totaling 451 units) are long overdue and confirmed as lost. If these units are not bypassed, the OR engine will subtract them from any new order, leading to a stockout as the current on-hand inventory (76) is nearly exhausted. Demand is stable (avg ~100). To ensure a fresh order is placed, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that incorporates the expected total inventory needs PLUS the lost 451 units. Calculations: Target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand (avg 100) is ~300. Adding the 451 lost units to bypass the OR engine's subtraction gives a required base stock of roughly 751. I will set mu_hat to 800 to ensure a robust order is generated despite the inflated in-transit metric.

Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a high volume of 'phantom' pipeline inventory. As identified in previous periods, at least 451 units (from orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) are significantly past their delivery window and likely lost. The system currently reports 929 units in-transit, which includes these lost units. If the OR engine subtracts the full 929 from its base stock calculation, it will order 0, leading to eventual stockouts as the 88 units on-hand are depleted. Recent demand has stabilized around ~100 units/period (mean of last 5 periods: 95; last 10: 97.5). To counteract the ~451 phantom units and ensure the engine continues to place orders for 'real' units, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 850. This represents roughly 3-4 periods of demand plus a buffer to offset the subtracted lost shipments, keeping the pipeline moving. L is set to 2, as recent arrivals (P26, P27, P28, P38) have mostly arrived within 1-2 periods, suggesting the lead time is currently closer to the promise than the previous 3-period delays.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 929 units in-transit. However, historical analysis confirms that approximately 451 units of the 'In-transit' quantity are lost shipments (Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24) that will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the full 929 units from the target base stock, which results in zero or insufficient orders if we use standard parameters. With average demand around 100 units/period and a lead time of 2-3 periods, we need a target base stock that accounts for both the genuine lead time and the 451 units of phantom inventory. To ensure the backend places an order for approximately 400 units (to cover 3-4 periods of demand plus safety), and given the phantom pipeline subtraction, mu_hat must be set to an explicit value (Target Pipeline + Phantom Pipeline). An explicit mu_hat of 850 (approx 400 real + 450 phantom) will force an order of ~300-400 units, restoring on-hand inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Phantom pipeline inventory remains fixed at approx 451 units. On-hand inventory hit zero in P40 due to lack of ordering in P39; explicit mu_hat must be maintained to force orders despite high reported in-transit levels.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a critical 'phantom pipeline' issue where approximately 451 units reported as 'In-transit' (from orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) are lost and will never arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (929 units) from the calculated base stock, it will stop ordering entirely unless parameters are artificially inflated. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and a stockout occurred in Period 41. To force the OR backend to place an order, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 2100. This value is calculated to exceed the phantom pipeline (451) plus the legitimate pipeline (approx 478) plus the desired safety stock for a (L+1) horizon. With demand averaging ~100/period and L=2, a normal base stock would be around 400-500. By setting mu_hat to 2100, we ensure the backend sees a 'requirement' that exceeds the 929 units currently in transit, triggering a fresh order to replenish on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed stockout (on-hand=0) due to OR engine under-ordering against a 'phantom pipeline' of ~451 lost units. Explicit mu_hat inflation >1800 remains mandatory to maintain supply.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face a massive 'phantom pipeline' issue. Approximately 451 units from early periods (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' total reported to the OR engine. Currently, 'In-transit' is 1677, but 451 units are phantom, making the 'effective' pipeline 1226. Demand is stable around 100 units/period. The OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock; to ensure an order is actually placed when on-hand is 0, mu_hat must be set high enough to exceed the reported in-transit amount plus lead-time demand. With an on-hand of 0 and an in-transit of 1677, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 2500. This value is intentionally inflated to force an order that compensates for the phantom inventory and covers the expected demand during the lead time. Setting L to 3 periods provides a safety buffer as lead times have historically fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Phantom pipeline inventory is confirmed at ~451 units. Effective in-transit is total in-transit minus 451. Explicit mu_hat must remain significantly elevated (>2000) to force orders past this inflated pipeline value and prevent stockouts.

The OR engine subtracts this entire 'In-transit' figure from its calculated base stock; consequently, if mu_hat is not artificially inflated to exceed the phantom pipeline plus the desired inventory levels, it will order 0 units, leading to the current stockout (on-hand = 0). Demand is stable (avg ~98 units), requiring ~300 units for (L+1) coverage. To force an order of approximately 300-400 units given 2467 units in-transit (most of which are recent large orders that haven't arrived yet, plus the 451 lost units), I must set mu_hat to a value that overcomes this subtraction. Since we had a stockout in P40-P43 and 'In-transit' has spiked due to recent high-volume orders (P42=748, P43=790), I will maintain a high explicit mu_hat of 3200 to ensure the backend continues to place orders despite the total pipeline reading. This reflects the need to provide sufficient arrivals in P45-P46 to end the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Phantom pipeline inventory is confirmed at ~451 units. Effective in-transit is total in-transit minus 451. Explicit mu_hat must remain significantly elevated (>2500) to force orders past this inflated pipeline value and prevent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. There is a 'phantom pipeline' of approximately 451 units (from orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24) that the OR engine counts as 'In-transit' but will never arrive. Because the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock, it will stop ordering entirely if mu_hat is set naturally. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To force the OR engine to place an order, mu_hat must be set to a value greater than the sum of the phantom pipeline (451) and the recently placed legitimate in-transit orders (P42, P43, P44 totaling 2297). Total In-transit is 3226. To ensure a replenishment order is emitted despite this massive (mostly phantom) pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to 3500 and L to 3 to provide a safety buffer for the final 5 periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Period_45: Phantom pipeline inventory remains confirmed at ~451 units. Effective supply chain management requires maintaining heavily inflated explicit mu_hat (>3300) to counteract the subtraction of these lost units from the order calculation and prevent terminal stockouts in the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1003.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 50. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom pipeline' of approximately 451 lost units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) which artificially inflates reported 'In-transit' and causes the OR engine to under-order. In Period 45, we received a massive delivery of 1538 units (from P42 and P43), resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 1431 units. The current reported 'In-transit' is 2131. My estimate for the 'effective' in-transit (real units likely to arrive) is 2131 - 451 = 1680. Current on-hand (1431) plus effective in-transit (1680) equals 3111 units. Given that there are only 5 periods remaining (46, 47, 48, 49, 50) and average demand is ~100 units/period, we have enough total stock to cover all remaining demand (~500 units) without further ordering. However, to prevent the OR engine from placing unnecessary orders that would incur heavy holding costs, I must set parameters such that the target base stock is slightly below our current on-hand position, while still maintaining some safety. I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the demand for the remaining periods (approx 5*100) but accounts for the engine's calculation logic. Using 'explicit' allows us to stabilize the replenishment signal for the end-of-game phase.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 of 50. Demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging ~98 units per period (last 10 periods avg: 98.1). The supply chain remains the primary challenge due to the 'phantom pipeline'\u2014approximately 451 units from historical orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' calculation. Current on-hand inventory is high (1349 units), which covers approximately 13 periods of demand. Given we are at Period 47 and the game ends at Period 50, we have sufficient inventory to satisfy all remaining demand (estimated ~300-400 units) without further ordering. Ordering more now would only incur unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit/period) without generating additional profit. To prevent the OR engine from placing any more orders, I will set mu_hat to 0. This effectively sets the target base stock to 0, ensuring no new orders are triggered while we bleed down the existing surplus inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Sufficient on-hand inventory (1349) exists to cover all remaining demand until Period 50. Transitioning to zero-order strategy to minimize terminal holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-789.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 1237 units. Total demand observed over the last 47 periods has averaged approximately 97 units per period. With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), the total expected demand is roughly 300 units. Our current on-hand inventory of 1237 is more than four times the maximum plausible demand for the remainder of the game. Therefore, additional orders would only increase terminal holding costs without providing any additional profit. We continue the zero-order strategy initiated in Period 47 to maximize the final reward.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 49 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 1113 units. Based on historical data, the average demand for 'chips(Regular)' is approximately 100 units per period (the last 5 periods show 107, 82, 112, 124, and the User's sample list shows values around 90-110). With only 2 periods remaining (Period 49 and Period 50), the total expected demand is roughly 200 units. Since on-hand inventory (1113) far exceeds this, no further orders are necessary. Ordering more would only incur additional holding costs at the end of the game without generating more profit. We maintain the zero-order strategy initiated in Period 47.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision period of the simulation. The objective is to maximize total reward (Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory). Currently, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU has an on-hand inventory of 1,035 units. Historical demand has consistently averaged around 90-110 units per period. With only one period remaining (Period 50), the maximum demand we can realistically expect is approximately 130 units. Since 1,035 units are already on-hand, we have more than enough inventory to satisfy all remaining demand. Ordering more units at this stage would only increase terminal holding costs without increasing sales, as any units arriving now or in the future cannot be sold before the simulation ends. Consequently, the optimal strategy for the final period is to place no order. We set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values of 0 to ensure the base-stock logic results in a zero order quantity.
