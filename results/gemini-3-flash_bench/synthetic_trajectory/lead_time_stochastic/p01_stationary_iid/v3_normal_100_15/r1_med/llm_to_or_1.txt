Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. We have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (Period_1 to Period_5 relative to the start of the data) shows values of 88, 133, 93, 108, 110. The mean of these 5 samples is 106.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 17.0. Given L=2, the total lead time + review period is 3 (L+1). My objective is to set initial parameters based on these 5 historical samples to cover the demand during the lead time. I will use L=2 (promised), mu_hat based on the average of the 5 samples, and sigma_hat based on the standard deviation of the 5 samples using the 'recent_N' method where N=5.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and an order of 136 units was placed. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, we expect this order to arrive during Period 3 (visible at Period 4 start). Demand in Period 1 was 111, resulting in 111 lost sales due to zero on-hand inventory. For Period 2, we have 136 units in transit. Historical demand samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110) plus the Period 1 observation (111) show a stable mean around 107. Since we are at the very beginning of the simulation (Period 2), I will use the 'default' methods to allow the backend to use all available historical data points and the promised lead time of 2. This setup targets a base stock level covering (L+1) = 3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2. Orders placed in P1 (136 units) and P2 (134 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase (after this decision) and will be visible in the P3 conclude message read at P4. Current on-hand is 0, meaning demand in P1 and P2 was lost (lost sales). Total in-transit is 270. Historical demand is [88, 133, 93, 108, 110] (pre-game) and [111, 126] (P1-P2), averaging ~109.9. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture recent levels. Since no orders have concluded yet, I'll use 'default' for lead time (2 periods). Sigma will use 'default' to capture historical volatility.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order was placed with a promised lead time of 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 3's arrival phase and is visible in the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0 for chips(Regular). This implies the actual lead time is likely > 2 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts for 3 consecutive periods (sold=0 despite demand). Total in-transit is 353 units (P1: 136, P2: 134, P3: 83). Since no orders have arrived yet, I will set the lead time parameter L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay. For demand, the historical samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110) suggest a mean of approximately 106. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent variance and mean across the extended lead time (L+1 = 4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $401.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first historical arrival data in the 'Period 4 conclude' message. Two orders arrived: P1 (ordered at P1, lead time 3) and P3 (ordered at P3, lead time 1). The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2, which matches the promised lead time. The demand across the first 5 periods (including historical data provided in the prompt and subsequent concludes) is: 88, 133, 93, 108, 110 (samples provided) vs observed demands in play: 111, 126, 90, 124. The mean demand is approximately 110 units per period. Currently, on-hand (95) + in-transit (239) = 334. With a lead time of 2, the pipeline needs to cover 3 periods (L+1). Expected demand 3 * 110 = 330. We are currently right at the target. I will use 'calculate' for L to incorporate the variability seen (1 and 3 periods), 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 110), and 'default' for sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $330.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we have 10 units on-hand and 379 in-transit. Promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times observed are 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), averaging 2. Demand over the first 5 periods (including historical samples 88, 133, 93, 108, 110 and recorded demand 111, 126, 90, 124, 85) shows a stable mean around 107 units per period. The standard deviation is approximately 17. Given the variance in actual lead times (1 to 3 periods), I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times. For demand, since there's no clear regime shift yet, I'll use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture the most recent fluctuations while maintaining a stable forecast.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 due to 100% stockout in Period 6. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over 6 periods (including game history and the samples provided: 88, 133, 93, 108, 110, 111, 126, 90, 124, 85, 91) suggests a mean of approximately 105 units per period. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have varied (Period 1 order took 3 periods, Period 3 order took 1 period). Multiple orders (from Periods 2, 4, 5, and 6) are still in-transit (total 451 units). Although no arrival was recorded in the Period 6 conclude message, we expect shipments to arrive soon. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to average the observed noise and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent stability in the mean (approx 104 units). This ensures the OR engine targets a base stock level covering (L+1) periods of demand while accounting for current stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability around a mean of 106 units (Periods 1-7: 111, 126, 90, 124, 85, 91, 123). On-hand inventory is 0, with 346 units in transit. Lead time analysis: Promised L=2. Observed actual lead times: P1 order arrived in P4 (L=3), P3 order arrived in P4 (L=1), and P4 order arrived in P7 (L=3). P2 (134 units), P5 (140 units), and P6 (72 units) are still in transit. Given that P2 was ordered 6 periods ago, it is highly likely lost. P5 and P6 are still within a plausible window if actual L=3. I will set L to 'calculate' (average of 3, 1, 3 is ~2.3) to account for the variability. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand volatility while smoothing out noise. The pipeline inventory (346) is high, but if P2 is lost (134 units), the effective pipeline is 212 units, which is roughly 2 periods of demand, necessitating a replenishment order soon.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile with observations of 1, 2, and 3 periods (avg ~2.3). Shipment from Period 2 (134 units) is likely lost as it has surpassed 6 periods since ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $290.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the on-hand inventory is 54. Historical demand (Periods 1-8) averages 104.5 units per period. The shipment from Period 2 (134 units) is now 7 periods old and is confirmed lost, as the promised lead time is 2 and the maximum observed lead time is 3; this unit count is stuck in 'in-transit' but will never arrive. Lead times for concluded orders have been 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods (average 2.5). Using L=3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and provide a safety buffer against the volatility shown. \u03bc\u0302 is set using the mean of all 8 periods (~104.5) multiplied by (1+L), and \u03c3\u0302 is calculated from the standard deviation of all samples (~16.6) scaled by sqrt(1+L). This helps the OR engine maintain a base stock that covers the 4-period risk horizon (current period + 3 lead periods) despite the lost shipment skewing the in-transit data.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 2 (134 units) is officially confirmed lost (7 periods since order, max observed L=3). Actual lead time is frequently 3 periods, exceeding the promised 2.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, current on-hand inventory is 44 units with 300 units in transit. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable mean around 104 units (Periods 1-9: 111, 126, 90, 124, 85, 91, 123, 86, 107). Lead time analysis from concluded periods reveals significant volatility and drift: observed lead times are 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 periods. The average lead time is (3+1+3+3+1)/5 = 2.2 periods, which is higher than the promised 2 periods. Furthermore, the shipment from Period 2 (134 units) is confirmed lost, effectively reducing our pipeline inventory. To protect against stockouts given the replenishment delay and lost units, I am setting L to 2.2 (explicit) to reflect the true delivery average and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the consistent demand baseline. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' to account for recent demand volatility and lead-time variance impacts on the safety stock requirement.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. The shipment from Period 2 (134 units) is confirmed lost, leaving 318 units in-transit (from Periods 6, 9, and 10). Lead times have been highly volatile, with observations of 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), 1 period (P3, P8), and now P6's order is at least 5 periods overdue, suggesting another lost shipment. I will set L=3 as an explicit buffer, as the promised '2' is unreliable and 3 is the most frequent long-end arrival. For demand forecasting, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the current mean (~98 units/period), as the initial samples were slightly higher but have stabilized. By setting L=3, the OR backend targets a pipeline (base_stock) covering 4 periods of demand (L+1), helping to build safety stock against the high variance and risk of loss.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 6 (72 units) is highly likely lost (surpassed 5 periods since order, max observed L=3).

LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory is listed at 423 units, but historically, shipments from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (72 units) are likely lost, as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a wide margin (9 and 6 periods respectively). Adjusting the effective pipeline by subtracting these suspected lost units (206 units total) leaves 217 units truly in-transit (Orders from P9, P10, P11). The observed lead times are [3, 1, 3, 3, 1], averaging 2.2, though 3 periods is the more frequent upper bound. Demand across the last 11 periods is fairly stable, averaging ~103 units. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the stockout (current on-hand is 0) and accounts for the 3-period lead time risk, I will set L to 3 and use the last 11 samples for mu_hat. This targets a base stock that covers 4 periods of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 6 (72 units) is officially confirmed lost (6 periods since order, max observed L=3). Effective pipeline inventory is (In-transit - 206 units).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 101.5 units and a standard deviation of 15.6. Lead times are volatile, varying between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with 3 periods being frequent. Total confirmed lost shipments are 206 units (134 from P2 and 72 from P6). Currently, in-transit inventory is 329, but subtracting the 206 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of only 123 units (ordered in P11 and P12). With on-hand inventory at 21 and demand averaging ~100/period, the current effective total (144) is insufficient to cover the (L+1) window of 3-4 periods. Therefore, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 and explicit mu_hat/sigma_hat to account for the lost inventory effectively being subtracted from the backend pipeline calculation, ensuring a sufficient order is placed.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, On-hand inventory is 0. The carry-over insights confirm that 206 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are lost. Total In-transit is 511, meaning effective pipeline inventory is 305 units (511 - 206). Recent demand has been relatively stable around 104 units (avg of last 13 periods). Lead times (L) have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with an average around 2.2. Setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the longest observed delay and ensure sufficient coverage. For demand prediction (mu_hat), recent_N with N=7 captures the most relevant recent mean (approx 103 per period), which at L=3 translates to a mu_hat covering 4 periods of demand (~412 units). This strategy aims to rebuild stock while accounting for lost shipments and lead time volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand is stable, with the last 5 periods (P10-P14) averaging 104 units and the overall historical average being 105. Actual lead times observed (3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3) average 2.375 periods, suggesting L=3 is a safer planning horizon given the frequent 3-period delays. Crucially, 206 units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost and remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 406. This means the effective pipeline is only 200 units (the P12 order of 18 units and the P13 order of 182 units). To account for the lost stock that the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 and an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand over (L+1) = 4 periods is 105 * 4 = 420. However, because the backend subtracts the full 406 in-transit (including the 206 ghosts) from the target base stock, I must inflate mu_hat by 206 to compensate. Inflated mu_hat = 420 + 206 = 626. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 569 units in-transit. However, historical data confirms that shipments from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (72 units) are lost. This means the effective pipeline inventory is 569 - 206 = 363 units. The expected arrivals for this period are the orders from Period 13 (182 units) and potentially Period 15 (181 units) if lead time is short, though 3 periods is the more frequent max delay. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' is stable, with a mean around 104 units over the last 15 periods. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the frequent maximum observed lead time, and using a recent 10-period window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while accounting for lead time volatility. This conservative lead time setting helps the OR backend maintain a higher base stock to buffer against frequent 3-period delays and lost shipments.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 106 units over the last 10 periods (P7-P16). There are no seasonal indicators or calendar events to suggest a shift. However, lead time is consistently unreliable: although promised at 2, it frequently takes 3 periods (observed in orders from P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12, and P13). Furthermore, 206 units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost. The current pipeline inventory is 387, but subtracting the lost 206 units yields an effective pipeline of 181 units (specifically, the order from P15). With 75 units on-hand and 181 expected from P15 (likely arriving in Period 18 or 19 given L=3), the total effective inventory is 256. To ensure coverage across the review period plus the actual observed lead time of 3 (total 4 periods), and to account for potential lost shipments, I am setting L to 3. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the steady-state demand while ignoring early initialization noise.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 105 units over the last 17 periods. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0). The most critical issue is identifying real pipeline inventory due to lost shipments. Historical records and carry-over insights confirm that orders from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (72 units) are lost. Therefore, the current 'In-transit' of 387 units actually contains 206 phantom units. The true pipeline is 181 units (the order from Period 15). Lead times are volatile, but '3 periods' is the most frequent occurrence (seen in orders from P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12, P13). Setting L to 3 reflects this reality. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' in its calculation, and the OR engine is unaware of lost shipments, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to signal a higher demand requirement, effectively offsetting the phantom inventory. I am targeting a base stock that covers the next (L+1) = 4 periods of demand (~420 units), plus a safety buffer for the high Lead Time variability. With the backend seeing 387 in transit and 0 on hand, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order that fills the gap left by the 206 lost units.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows stable demand with a mean of ~105 units over the last 15 periods. Lead times are volatile (range 1-3 periods), but the modal lead time is 3 periods. We must account for lost shipments from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (72 units), totaling 206 units. These units are still in the backend's 'In-transit' count (556 units) but will never arrive. The effective pipeline inventory is 350 units (556 - 206). To ensure the backend places an order that actually covers demand, I will set L to 3 (the observed maximum) and use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. My target base stock is (L+1) * mean_demand = 4 * 105 = 420. However, the backend subtracts the phantom 206 units from its calculation (Total Pipeline = 556). Therefore, I must inflate mu_hat to 626 (420 + 206) so that the resulting order equals (626 - 556) = 70 units, or as restricted by the backend's internal caps based on sigma. I'll use recent_N (N=15) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory ghosting confirmed: 206 units (P2: 134, P6: 72) are lost but remain in In-transit. mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by 206 to compensate for this pipeline error.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from inventory 'ghosting'. Specifically, 206 units (134 from P2 and 72 from P6) are lost but remain in the 'In-transit' figure (649 units). This leads the OR engine to believe the pipeline is fuller than it actually is, causing under-ordering. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The forecast calculation: Mean demand is ~104 units/period. With a Lead Time (L) of 3, the target should cover 1+L (4) periods of demand: 4 * 104 = 416. I add the 206 lost units back to this base stock calculation (416 + 206 = 622) to force the order logic to ignore the 'ghost' inventory. Actual lead times have stabilized at 3 periods (observed in most recent concludes), so L is set to 3. Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of recent demand (~14) scaled for the (1+L) horizon.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit inventory of 649. However, based on the carry-over insights, 206 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are lost but still counted in the 'in-transit' figure. This creates a risk of under-ordering because the OR backend's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock. The actual effective pipeline is 649 - 206 = 443. To offset this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Demand has been stable (~104 units/period). With a lead time of 3 (the most frequent actual lead time), the target pipeline inventory should cover 1+L = 4 periods of demand. Using mean demand (104) * 4 = 416. To counteract the backend subtracting the 206 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 416 + 206 = 622. I set L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect the true observed delivery time. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to allow for a safety stock buffer given the lead time volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 649 units in-transit, but 206 of these (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost shipments that will never arrive. This creates a state of 'inventory ghosting' where the OR backend's order logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) is mathematically crippled because it believes it has 206 units that don't exist. To override this, I must set mu_hat to a value that accounts for the expected demand over (L+1) periods PLUS a 206-unit injection to force the backend to place an order that restores real-world stock levels. Historically, demand is stable around 104 units/period. With an estimated lead time of 3 periods, the review window is 4 periods. Base mu_hat would be ~416. Adding the 206 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat to 622. Since the current on-hand is 0 and the current in-transit (649 - 206 lost = 443 real) is still insufficient given the long lead times, this explicit parameter ensures a corrective order is triggered. L is set to explicit 3 based on the most common actual lead time observed.

The system is facing a severe stockout. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods (P18-P22) has averaged 94.6 units. Lead times have consistently hit 3 periods when orders actually arrive. Most importantly, carry-over insights confirm that 206 units in the 'In-transit' figure are permanently lost (P2: 134, P6: 72). The current 'In-transit' of 649 actually only contains 443 viable units (orders from P15, P18, P19). Since the OR engine calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit), it will under-order by exactly 206 units unless mu_hat is inflated to compensate for this 'ghost' inventory. I will set L to 3 (the observed max lead time) and use explicit mu_hat to ensure the backend places an order that accounts for the 206 lost units. Forecasted demand for (1+L) = 4 periods is approximately 380 units; adding the 206 unit compensation results in 586. This forces the system to recognize the deficit.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been unmet for several periods (sold=0 since Period 18). Total in-transit inventory is 649 units. However, consistent history (Carry-over insights) confirms that 206 units (ordered in P2 and P6) are lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' figure. The remaining 443 units (ordered in P15, P18, P19) are significantly overdue based on the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods (P15 order is now 9 periods old, P18 is 6 periods old, P19 is 5 periods old). This indicates a period of severe logistics failure or extended lead times. Demand remains stable, with the mean of the last 10 periods approximately 100.9 units. To force the OR engine to order despite the 'ghost' inventory and overdue shipments, I will use an explicit lead time L=3 (most common observed) and set mu_hat explicitly. Since the backend subtracts pipeline inventory (649) from base_stock, I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand (~400 units) PLUS the ghost inventory (206 units) PLUS a buffer to account for the likely loss of higher-period-lag orders (P15), aiming for a value that triggers an order despite the 649 'in-transit'. I will set mu_hat slightly above the total in-transit to ensure the pipeline is replenished.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment delays extending beyond observed 3-period max: Orders from P15 (181 units), P18 (169 units), and P19 (93 units) are now 9, 6, and 5 periods old respectively with no arrival. Lead time is currently unreliable.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is currently experiencing severe disruptions. At Period 25, we have 0 on-hand inventory and an In-transit balance of 879 units. However, historical performance reveals massive systemic losses: orders from P2 (134), P6 (72), P15 (181), P18 (169), and P19 (93) are all well beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods and are considered lost. This totals 649 'ghost' units in the pipeline (879 - 649 = 230 actual units in-transit, which matches the P24 order). Demand remains stable around 100 units/period. Because the OR backend uses pipeline_inventory (In-transit + On-hand) to calculate the order, it 'thinks' we have 879 units, resulting in no new orders. To fix this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to artificially inflate the target base stock. Target stock for (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~400 units) + the 649 lost units = 1049. I will set L=3 as the observed maximum to ensure the backend uses an appropriate review window. This forces the system to order despite the inflated In-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Massive pipeline failure: Total lost units reached 649 as of P24 (P2: 134, P6: 72, P15: 181, P18: 169, P19: 93). Current In-transit is 74% 'ghost' inventory. Lead time is highly unreliable, with recent orders effectively lost or delayed indefinitely.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe failure. Total units in-transit (pipeline) is 1077, but history confirms a massive 'inventory ghosting' effect where orders never arrive. Based on the 3-period maximum observed lead time, we've lost shipments from Period 2 (134), Period 6 (72), Period 15 (181), Period 18 (169), and Period 19 (93), totaling 649 lost units. Crucially, the order from Period_24 (230 units) did not arrive in Period_25, putting us at 0 on-hand. With the promised lead time of 2 and observed variation up to 3, the backend's base-stock calculation will naturally under-order because it believes the 1077 units in-transit are real assets. To force an order and restore stock, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target inventory level (base stock). Average demand is ~104. For a 3-period lead time (L+1=4), the base need is ~416. To counteract the 649 'ghost' units in the pipeline and get the OR engine to place an order, I must set mu_hat significantly above the current total in-transit. I will set mu_hat to 1300 to ensure the engine tries to cover the 649 lost units plus current period needs. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to reflect the consistent upper-bound delay seen in successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss is accelerating. Cumulative ghost inventory (lost orders remaining in in-transit) is 649 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). In-transit is no longer a reliable measure of future stock.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing massive failures. No units have arrived since Period 16, resulting in 10 consecutive periods of zero sales and stockouts. The backend OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' inventory from its order calculation. Currently, In-transit is 1326 units, but history strongly suggests most of these are lost ('ghost' inventory). Specifically, orders from P2 (134), P6 (72), P15 (181), P18 (169), and P19 (93) are long overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 649 units. Furthermore, the absence of arrivals from P24 and P25 suggests the failure is ongoing. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the high 'In-transit' figure, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that offsets this ghost inventory. Average demand is ~100. For L=3, the base stock would normally be ~400. To bypass 649 units of ghost inventory and ensure a maximum order (capped by the engine), I will set mu_hat to 1200 (sufficient to trigger the safety cap) and L to 3 (reflecting the maximum observed lead time).

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss totaling 649 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) confirmed. Zero arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (P17-P26). Pipeline inventory is compromised.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of catastrophic failure. There have been zero arrivals for 11 consecutive periods (P17-P27). As of the start of Period 28, the In-transit inventory is 1326 units. However, historical evidence shows that 649 units from orders P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19 are definitively lost or 'ghosted.' Furthermore, orders from P24 (230 units), P25 (198 units), and P26 (249 units) are now overdue or at high risk of loss given the 11-period arrival drought. On-hand inventory is 0. To force the OR backend to place new orders despite the massive (but largely fake) In-transit pipeline, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the 'effective' pipeline. The total current In-transit (1326) minus confirmed lost (649) leaves 677 units theoretically in transit. However, since we haven't seen an arrival in 11 periods, even these 677 are suspect. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 1500 to overcome the pipeline inventory subtraction (final order = base_stock - pipeline) and trigger a significant replenishment order, while setting L to 3 to reflect the maximum observed functional lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Zero arrivals confirmed for 11 consecutive periods (P17-P27). Cumulative lost/ghost inventory remains at least 649 units, with subsequent orders from P24-P26 (677 units) also showing no signs of arrival despite the promised L=2.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, a shipment of 249 units (ordered in Period 26) finally arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, breaking a 11-period arrival drought. This confirm that the pipeline is not entirely broken, though it remains highly unreliable and heavily congested with 'ghost' inventory. Total 'ghost' inventory (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, and P24-25) is now estimated at 1077 units (Total In-transit 1286 - P28 arrival 0 - P26 arrival 249 - P28 order 209 = 828, but looking at the history: P2(134)+P6(72)+P15(181)+P18(169)+P19(93)+P24(230)+P25(198) = 1077 units). Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (Order = BaseStock - OnHand - InTransit), I must use 'mu_hat' with the 'explicit' method to bypass this logic. I will set mu_hat to (forecasted demand for L+1 periods) + (ghost units) to force the engine to place an order. Mean demand is ~104. Lead time L=2. Required stock for 3 periods = 312. Explicit mu_hat = 312 + 1077 = 1389. This should trigger an order of approximately 200-250 units to maintain stock levels given the 147 units on hand.

Carry-over insight: Arrivals resumed in P28 (P26 order arrived L=2). However, cumulative ghost inventory remains high (~1077 units) across multiple missing periods (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25), requiring explicit mu_hat inflation.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable with a mean of approximately 105 units. However, the system faces a massive pipeline inaccuracy ('ghost inventory'). Currently, In-transit shows 1,286 units, but a reconciliation of historical orders reveals that a significant portion is lost: P2 (134), P6 (72), P15 (181), P18 (169), P19 (93), P24 (230), and P25 (198). These orders (totaling 1,077 units) are well beyond the confirmed max lead time of 3 periods and have not arrived despite the P26 order arriving in P28. Only the P28 order (209 units) is likely 'live'. To prevent the OR backend from zeroing out orders due to this 'ghost' pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target base stock by 1,077. This effectively offsets the non-existent units the backend thinks are coming. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of actual observed arrival times (ranging 1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost/severely delayed orders) is confirmed at 1,077 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). P26 arrived on time (L=2), suggesting recent logistics might be recovering, but the pipeline history remains corrupted.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the on-hand inventory is 189 units. The observed demand remains stable, averaging approximately 100 units per period. The primary challenge is the corrupted pipeline inventory (In-transit), which shows 1156 units. Based on historical tracking, 1077 of these units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost or severely delayed shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). However, recent performance shows that the logistics chain has stabilized, with orders from P26 and P28 arriving exactly on the promised lead time of 2 periods. To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I must offset the 1077 units of ghost inventory. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the expected demand for the review+lead period (3 periods * 100 units/period = 300) PLUS the 1077 ghost units, totaling 1377. This forces the base stock calculation to ignore the phantom 1077 units currently sitting in 'In-transit'. I will use L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Logistics recovery confirmed: P26 and P28 both arrived with lead_time=2. Ghost inventory persists at 1077 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Logistics have stabilized with recent arrivals from P26 and P28 both confirming a lead time of 2 periods. However, the system is suffering from significant 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Total lost units are confirmed at 1,077 (P2: 134, P6: 72, P15: 181, P18: 169, P19: 93, P24: 230, P25: 198). This ghost inventory represents 88% of the current In-transit (1218 total). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts the full pipeline from its target base stock; therefore, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 1,077 lost units and ensure an order is actually triggered. Average demand remains stable at approximately 98 units per period. Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*mean + ghost_offset = (1+2)*98 + 1077 \u2248 1371. L is set to 2 per recent performance. Sigma_hat is set to default as volatility is stable.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost orders remaining in in-transit) updated to 1,077 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). Orders from P26 and P28 confirmed on-time arrival (L=2).

Logistics have mostly stabilized with recent lead times of 2 periods (P26, P28) and even 1 period (P31). However, there is a massive 'ghost' inventory problem: 1,077 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are definitively lost (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, and 25) because they have far exceeded any observed lead time. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost inventory and refusing to order more (base_stock - pipeline), I must explicitly inflate 'mu_hat' by the amount of the ghost inventory (1,077). This forces the backend to place orders for actual demand despite the inflated 'In-transit' number. I keep L at the calculated average (~2.3) and sigma_hat at recent volatility to maintain service levels.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Logistics have stabilized with recent lead times of 1-2 periods (P31, P32 arrived in 1 period; P26, P28 arrived in 2 periods). However, the 'In-transit' balance of 1304 units is severely corrupted by 1,077 units of 'ghost' inventory from lost/undelivered orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). The actual pipeline is approximately 1304 - 1077 = 227 units. To compensate for the OR backend's use of the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I must explicitly inflate 'mu_hat' by the ghost amount (1077) so the base_stock calculation results in a real order being placed. Demand remains stable around 100 units/period (mean of last 10 periods: 95.3). I am setting L=explicit (1.5, actual observed average of recent stable arrivals) and mu_hat=explicit to cover expected demand plus the 1077 unit pipeline correction.

Carry-over insight: Logistics stability confirmed for 4 consecutive orders (P26, P28, P31, P32) with lead times between 1-2 periods. Cumulative ghost inventory remains 1,077 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Logistics have stabilized over the last 5 relevant orders (P26, P28, P31, P32, P33) with lead times between 1 and 2 periods. However, a significant portion of the 'In-transit' inventory is confirmed lost or 'ghost' inventory. Specifically, the orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, and P25 totaling 1,077 units (134+72+181+169+93+230+198) have not arrived and are well beyond the observed 3-period maximum lead time. To compensate for this, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. My current target base stock (assuming L=2, so 3 periods of demand) is approximately 320 units. Current On-hand is 0. Total In-transit is 1,304. Subtracting the 1,077 units of 'ghost' inventory leaves an effective pipeline of 227 units (this includes the P33 order of 148 units). To trigger the OR engine to order enough to reach a 320-unit base stock despite the 1,304 in-transit figure, I must set mu_hat = (Target Base Stock) + (Ghost Inventory). Target Base Stock = 3 periods * ~105 demand/period = 315. Explicit mu_hat = 315 + 1077 = 1392. sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of recent stable demand (~15) over 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Logistics recovery: last 5 arrivals (P26-P33) show L=1 or 2. Total accumulated ghost inventory (lost orders) is 1,077 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Logistics have stabilized with recent arrivals from Periods 31 and 32 showing lead times of 1 period. However, a significant 'ghost' inventory of 1,077 units (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, and 25) remains in the In-transit count despite being effectively lost. This ghost inventory tricks the OR backend into under-ordering because it believes the pipeline is full. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a stabilized demand of ~102 units (mean of the last 15 periods) and a lead time of 2. With L=2, the base stock formula is (1+L)*demand. This equals 3*102 = 306. I then add the 1,077 lost units to this target to offset the ghost pipeline, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 1,383. This forces the engine to place an order that treats the 1,077 units as non-existent. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed performance (~1.8 recently), and sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' to capture current demand volatility.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from 1,077 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, and P25) which remain in the 'In-transit' calculation but will never arrive. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these units. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - (In-transit - ghost_inventory)', and I am constrained by the formula 'order = base_stock - In-transit', I must set mu_hat = (actual_forecast * (1+L)) + ghost_inventory. Demand is stable around 100 units/period (avg of last 10 periods: 100.3). Using L=2 (confirmed recovered lead time), mu_hat = (100 * 3) + 1077 = 1377. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect current volatility. Expected arrival for P33 (148 units) and P35 (110 units) should clear stockouts soon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $295.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 101 units per period. The primary challenge is the significant quantity of 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 1,077 units. These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (1,304 units), but will never arrive. The true pipeline inventory consists of the P33 order (148 units) and any orders placed in P35-P37 (P35 arrived in P37, P36-37 were 0). Thus, the effective In-transit is roughly 1,304 - 1,077 = 227 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) to be ~303 units (3 * 101). Since the system will subtract the 1,304 in-transit from the base_stock, I must set mu_hat such that (mu_hat - 1304) results in a meaningful order. To maintain a safety stock and cover the current on-hand of 29 units, I will set mu_hat to 1,510. This effectively signals a need for approximately 200 units of real inventory (1510 - 1304 \u2248 206 units), which covers ~2 periods of demand plus safety margin.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 100 units across the last 10-15 periods. Recent arrivals (P26, P28, P31, P32, P35) confirm that lead times have stabilized around 1-2 periods, although the 'In-transit' figure is severely inflated by 1,077 lost units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). To handle Period 39, I must compensate for this 'ghost' inventory. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' to calculate orders. Since 1,077 units in that pipeline will never arrive, the 'mu_hat' (demand across L+1 periods) must be explicitly inflated by this amount so the OR engine doesn't under-order due to the false impression of high incoming stock. With a stabilized lead time L=2, I will set mu_hat to (3 periods of demand) + 1,077 units. Calculation: (3 * 100) + 1077 = 1377.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 101 units per period. Recent logistics performance is encouragingly consistent, with the last arrival (P38 order) arriving in Period 39 (L=1). However, the 'In-transit' pipeline is severely inflated by historical lost shipments. Total ghost inventory is confirmed at 1,077 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). To ensure the OR engine correctly orders to cover the (L+1) horizon, mu_hat is explicitly set to include this ghost inventory (1077) plus the forecasted demand for the next 3 periods (3 * ~101). This compensates for the fact that the OR backend subtracts the full 1304 in-transit units (which include the 1077 lost units) from the target stock. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the recent mix of 1 and 2 period lead times.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Logistics stability is now well-established with arrivals from Period 35 (L=2) and Period 38 (L=1). The primary issue remains the 'ghost inventory' of 1,077 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25) that are stalled or lost in-transit but still counted by the OR backend. With In-transit at 1,321 units and 1,077 confirmed as 'ghosts', the actual pipeline is only 244 units (1,321 - 1,077). To force the OR backend [base_stock - pipeline] to order correctly, I must inflate mu_hat by the ghost amount. Average demand remains steady near 100 units/period. The prompt's L=2 is being met or exceeded (L=1 or 2), so I will use calculate for L to leverage recent performance. Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*100 + 1077 (approx 1377 for L=2) ensures the OR engine accounts for the missing physical stock.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to exhibit a massive mismatch between 'In-transit' inventory (1402 units) and physical reality, caused by 1,077 units of 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). While logistics have stabilized (recent lead times of 1-2 periods), the OR backend is blind to these losses. Without intervention, it sees the 1,077 units as incoming stock and will not place new orders despite zero on-hand inventory. To force an order, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. I am increasing mu_hat by the total ghost inventory (1,077) plus the projected demand for (L+1) periods. Using a mean demand of ~100 per period and L=2, base demand is 300. Adding 1,077 results in a target mu_hat of ~1377. This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) calculates a positive order requirement by neutralizing the 1,077 units of dead 'In-transit' weight.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent logistics performance has stabilized with lead times between 1-2 periods (as seen in P28, P31, P32, P35, and P38). However, the system is burdened by a 'ghost inventory' of 1,077 units\u2014lost orders that still appear in the in-transit tally but will never arrive. These are: P2 (134), P6 (72), P15 (181), P18 (169), P19 (93), P24 (230), and P25 (198). Total lost = 1077. Current In-transit is 1403; actual reliable pipeline is 1403 - 1077 = 326 units. Since the OR backend uses in-transit to calculate the order (order = base_stock - in-transit), I must explicitly inflate mu_hat by 1,077 to offset this ghost inventory and ensure the backend actually places an order. I will use recent_N for L (3) to reflect the 1-2 period stability, and recent_N for sigma_hat (10) to capture current demand volatility (~100 units/period with standard deviation around 15). Demand remains stable around 100 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost orders remaining in in-transit) updated to 1,077 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). Logistics remains stable for current orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling only 17 units in Period 43 (due to arrival of P40 order). Cumulative ghost inventory remains high at 1,077 units (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25), causing the 'In-transit' figure of 1,386 to be highly misleading. The 'true' pipeline inventory is approximately 1,386 - 1,077 = 309 units. Demand has remained stable, averaging approximately 92 units per period over the last 10 periods. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficiently to meet demand, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it to the expected demand for (L+1) periods (approx 300 units) PLUS the ghost inventory (1,077 units) to neutralize the subtraction of ghost units from the base stock. This results in a mu_hat of 1,377. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time which has recently been between 1-3 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent demand volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are approaching the game end (Period 50). The primary challenge continues to be the 'ghost' inventory\u2014units that are in-transit but effectively lost. As documented in carry-over insights, there are 1,077 confirmed lost units (from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). Current In-transit is 1,326, meaning approximately 81% is unusable. Recent logistics (P40-P41) show lead times of 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to satisfy demand for the remaining 5 periods, I must explicitly inflate 'mu_hat' by the amount of ghost inventory (1,077 units) to neutralize the pipeline error. Demand remains stable around a mean of 100. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat (1077 + (1+3)*100) and 'recent_N' for other parameters to capture current logistics and demand volatility.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 Analysis: Demand for 'chips(Regular)' is stable, with a recent mean of approximately 95-100 units. Logistics shows a sustained recovery with lead times between 1-3 periods, though we remain cautious about the 'ghost' inventory. Currently, In-transit is 1500 units, but 1077 units are confirmed lost/ghost inventory (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25), leaving an effective pipeline of 423 units. On-hand is 0. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite the 1077 ghost units inflating the perceived pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 'explicit' and value it at (Forecasted Demand for 3 periods + Ghost Inventory Offset). Forecasted demand: ~100/period. Base mu_hat (L=2) = 100 * (1+2) = 300. Adjusted mu_hat = 300 + 1077 = 1377. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture current demand volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean around 100 units per period. Recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting that logistics have largely normalized since the major disruptions. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1500 units is heavily corrupted by 1,077 units of 'ghost inventory' (missing orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, and P25) that will likely never arrive. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value. The calculation is: Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=2, mean=100, and a critical service level (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), the target base stock is approximately 400. To offset the 1,077 phantom units in the pipeline calculation (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline), I must provide an explicit mu_hat of 1,477 (400 + 1,077). This ensures the backend emits an order despite the 1,500 'In-transit' units. I use L=2 (promised) and default sigma_hat to maintain standard volatility buffers.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. Demand is stable (mean ~97). However, the system has a significant amount of 'ghost' inventory\u2014units that are 'In-transit' but will never arrive. Based on historical analysis, the cumulative ghost inventory is 1,077 units (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). The OR engine subtracts all In-transit units from the target base stock. If we don't account for these ghosts, the engine will stop ordering, leading to stockouts in the final periods. Current In-transit is 1,501. True pipeline is 1,501 - 1,077 = 424 units. To force the OR engine to order enough to cover the remaining periods, I will set an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand per period is ~100. For L=2, we need to cover 3 periods (current + lead time) = 300 units. To offset the 1,077 phantom units, mu_hat needs to be approximately 300 + 1077 = 1377. I will use 1380 to ensure a small buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to manage the stock for chips(Regular) facing a significant challenge: 1,077 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, and P25) are indefinitely in-transit/lost, distorting the OR engine's pipeline calculation. In Period 49, on-hand inventory is 0 and reported in-transit is 1,501. Subtracting 1,077 ghost units leaves an effective pipeline of 424 units (orders from P44, P45, P47). Recent demand (P44-P48) has been stable around 99 units. Since the OR backend subtracts in-transit from the base stock calculation, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 1,077 lost units and ensure an order is triggered. With L=2, the base stock formula is (L+1)*demand. Using mean demand of 100, target base stock is ~300. To force the engine to place an order when it sees 1,501 (false) in-transit, I set mu_hat to 1,377 (1077 lost + 300 target). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual seen lead times (avg ~2.3).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we observe that on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 1501 units. However, based on the Carry-over Insights, at least 1,077 units in that pipeline are 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, 25). These will never arrive. Furthermore, recent orders from P45 (175 units) and P47 (1 unit) satisfy the promised lead time of 2, but recent history (P40-P42) shows lead times have stretched to 3 periods. This means the 175 units from P45 are likely to arrive in the next period (P51). To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory of 1,077 units which prevents the OR engine from ordering enough, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target level. I calculate base demand (mean of last 10 periods \u2248 97) and multiply by (1+L) where L=2, then add the 1,077 lost units back into the requirement. Sigma is set based on recent demand volatility (approx 15).
