Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for chips(Regular). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P1-P5) averages 105.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 18.0. Since on-hand inventory starts at 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to establish a base stock to cover demand during the review and lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). Using the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat will calculate parameters based on the full 5-period sample history, which is appropriate as no regime shift or seasonal trend is yet visible.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The promised lead time is 2. The order for 136 units placed in Period 1 has not arrived yet, which is expected as L=2 (it should arrive in Period 3's resolution phase and be visible in Period 4's start). Demand in Period 1 was 90, which is close to the sample average (105.4). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the first shipment is still in transit, we are currently experiencing stockouts (90 units lost in P1). For the OR parameters, I will use the promised lead time (L=2). I'll use all 5 available historical samples (Period_1 to Period_5 data provided in the prompt) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as there is no evidence of a regime shift yet. Using N=5 for recent_N captures the baseline demand provided (Mean ~105, Std Dev ~18).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (136 units) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 3 'conclude' message (viewable in Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because starting inventory was 0 and no same-period (L=0) arrival occurred. Historical demand for the first 5 samples is [88, 133, 93, 108, 110], mean \u2248 106.4. The OR backend uses (1+L) * mean. With L=2, mu_hat should be approximately 3 * 106.4 = 319.2. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 2) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand profile while waiting for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (136 units), Period 2 (135 units), and Period 3 (34 units). According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. Consequently, on-hand inventory remains 0, and all demand has been lost so far. We must adjust the lead time parameter to 'explicit' (3) to account for this observed delay and ensure the base stock calculation covers the extended pipeline. Demand has been relatively stable (90, 106, 102), so I will use all available samples (N=3 from history plus the 5 samples provided in the prompt for a total of 8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for chips(Regular) appears longer than promised; Period 1 order (L=2) did not arrive by Period 3 conclude, suggesting L=3+.

Daily Profit: $117.00, Daily Holding Cost: $53.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we received two shipments: the Period 1 order (arrived in 3 periods) and the Period 3 order (arrived in 1 period). This confirms the lead time is volatile, averaging (3+1)/2 = 2, which matches the promised lead time. However, the Period 2 order (135 units) is currently overdue as it has been 3 periods since it was placed and it did not arrive in the Period 4 conclude message. Current inventory is 53 on-hand with 245 in-transit (Period 2 order of 135 and Period 4 order of 110). Demand has been relatively stable across the 5 observed periods (88, 133, 93, 108, 110 - note: history list shows 110 for P5, while game history log shows 117 for P4). I will use recent_N to capture the current demand mean and standard deviation over the last 5 periods and maintain L at the promised value of 2 as the average observed lead time is currently 2.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed for chips(Regular): P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period; P2 order (135 units) is currently overdue (3+ periods).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we face an out-of-stock situation with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand over the last 5 periods has been relatively stable, averaging 106 units per period (Std Dev ~16.7). However, lead time is highly volatile: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P2 (ordered 135 units) is now 4 periods late (overdue). P4 (110 units) and P5 (17 units) are also in transit. To account for this volatility and the missing P2 order, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I am using the mean of all 5 samples (106) multiplied by (1+L=4) for a total of 424. For sigma_hat, I will use the standard deviation of all samples to capture the historical variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for chips(Regular) is highly unstable: Observed L values are 3 and 1, with P2 order now 4 periods overdue, suggesting potential for lost shipments or severe delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory situation for chips(Regular) is critical. On-hand inventory is 0. The system tracks 390 units in-transit, but the arrival pattern is highly unstable. Specifically: P1 (ordered P1, arrived P4, L=3), P3 (ordered P3, arrived P4, L=1), and P2 (ordered P2, still missing after 5 periods). Since P2 is now 3 periods past its promised delivery, I will treat it as potentially lost and focus on more recent orders (P5, P6). The lead time is extremely volatile, with observed values of 3 and 1; I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average available data, while acknowledging the high variance. Demand has dipped recently (Period 6 demand was 56), so I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the trend while maintaining enough stock to recover from the stockout. Mean demand over the last 5 periods (P2-P6) is approx 93. With L expected around 2-3, mu_hat needs to cover (L+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Order from Period 2 (135 units) is now 5 periods overdue, significantly exceeding observed lead times of 1 and 3; treating as a lost shipment for planning purposes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face significant supply chain instability. The order from Period 2 (135 units) is now 6 periods overdue while the promised lead time is 2. Based on previous arrivals (L=3 for Period 1, L=1 for Period 3, L=3 for Period 4), and the fact that Period 2 is missing for twice the longest observed lead time, I am officially treating the Period 2 order as lost. Current In-transit (280) includes: P2 (135 - assumed lost), P5 (17), P6 (128). Excluding the lost P2 units, the effective pipeline is only 145 units. On-hand is low at 11 units. Average demand over 7 periods is approx 93 units/period. To protect against the high lead-time volatility (range 1-3) and ensure sufficient inventory despite the lost shipment, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 for planning. Demand has been relatively stable, so I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current demand baseline of ~93. Setting L=3 (explicit) will force the OR backend to target a base stock level covering 4 periods (L+1), which helps compensate for the lost Period 2 stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 2 order (135 units) for chips(Regular) is now 6 periods overdue; confirmed as a lost shipment for pipeline calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the on-hand inventory is 0. History shows significant lead time variability and a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (135 units). Calculating 'In-transit' as purely pipeline inventory is risky because the 135 units from Period 2 are almost certainly lost (7 periods overdue). The current total in-transit listed is 338 units, but removing the 135 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 203 units (from Periods 6 and 8). Observed lead times are 3, 1, 3, 3; the mode and mean suggest an actual lead time (L) of 3. For demand, the last 8 periods have been relatively stable around 93 units per period. I will set L=3 explicitly to reflect reality rather than the promised 2. mu_hat will use the last 5 samples to capture the recent mean (approx 89) multiplied by (1+L=4), and sigma_hat will use recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock given the frequent stockouts caused by lead time instability.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the chips(Regular) SKU faces significant supply chain instability. Historical lead times (L) have been 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 periods. Significantly, the Period 2 order (135 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is definitively treated as a lost shipment. The Period 6 order (128 units) is 4 periods overdue and also potentially lost, though less certain. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized recently: the last 5 periods (P5-P9) have an average demand of 84 units (83, 56, 99, 88, 94). Given the erratic lead times (mean ~2.2), I will use an explicit L of 3 to provide a buffer against the frequent 3-period delays and the risk of lost shipments. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime of ~84 units/period, scaled by (1+L). sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Period 2 order (135 units) is confirmed lost (8 periods overdue). Period 6 order (128 units) is 4 periods overdue, exceeding the maximum observed successful lead time of 3 periods; monitoring for potential loss.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains dynamic with a recent spike (Period 10: 130), but the mean over the last 5 periods (avg: 93.4) is relatively stable compared to the overall mean (avg: 96.5). The primary issue is lead-time instability and lost orders. We have witnessed arrivals at L=1 and L=3. Period 2 (135 units) is definitely lost (8 periods overdue). Period 6 (128 units) is now 4 periods overdue; given that the maximum observed successful delivery was within 3 periods, this is highly likely lost. The current in-transit (336 units) includes Period 6 (128), Period 9 (17), and Period 10 (56). If we discount the 128 units from P6, the effective pipeline is only 73 units. Since 'on-hand' is 0, we are facing stockouts. I will use 'explicit' for L=3 to account for the longer observed delivery window and 'recent_N' (N=5) for demand to capture the recent volatility. Setting L=3 (review + lead = 4 periods) helps the OR backend target a higher stock level to buffer against these logistics failures.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Period 6 order (128 units) for chips(Regular) is 4 periods overdue, exceeding the maximum observed successful lead time (3 periods); treating as a likely lost shipment for planning.

We have 'In-transit' inventory of 374 units, but significant portions are likely lost: P2 (135 units, 10 periods ago) and P6 (128 units, 6 periods ago) are confirmed and likely lost respectively. This leaves a functional pipeline of only 111 units (from P9, P10, and P11). Historically, observed lead times are 1 or 3 periods (average 2). However, given the zero on-hand inventory and the pattern of frequent stockouts due to lost shipments, I will use L=3 to increase the base stock level and build a safety buffer. For demand, the recent mean (Periods 1-11) is 98 units per period. I'll use a recent N=10 to capture this consistent demand while weighting the OR backend toward a higher safety stock to compensate for the shipment reliability issues.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Pipeline integrity check\u2014135 units (P2) and 128 units (P6) are both over 5 periods overdue and treated as lost, reducing effective pipeline from 374 to 111 units. Average successful lead time remains ~2 periods, but volatility suggests planning for L=3 to mitigate stockout risk.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU chips(Regular) has 0 on-hand inventory and the baseline demand is averaging approximately 100 units. A critical issue exists with pipeline integrity: orders from Period 2 (135 units) and Period 6 (128 units) are 11 and 7 periods overdue, respectively. These are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' of 319 units is inflated by these 263 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 56 units (from Period 11 and 12 orders). Observed successful lead times (LT) vary (1, 2, 3 periods), with recent arrivals showing LT=3 and LT=2. Because the profit/holding ratio is 1.0, the target service level is 50%, but due to high LT volatility and stockout history, I am using an explicit L=3 to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation (\u03bc * (L+1)) covers enough future demand. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while ignoring the early-game noise.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Correction: Orders from P2 (135 units) and P6 (128 units) are confirmed lost; effective pipeline is (Total In-transit - 263). Lead time is highly volatile (1-3 periods), requiring L=3 for safety.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, On-hand inventory is 0. The Current In-transit is 399 units, but this includes two confirmed lost orders: Period 2 (135 units, now 12 periods overdue) and Period 6 (128 units, 8 periods overdue), totaling 263 lost units. The 'effective' pipeline is therefore 136 units (399 - 263). Observed successful lead times are 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, showing high volatility ranging from 1-3 periods. To mitigate the frequent stockouts seen in history and account for this volatility, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. Demand is relatively stable with a mean of ~100 units/period (last 5 samples: 130, 104, 82, 97, and the seeded samples). I will use recent_N=13 to capture the full active period history for demand mean and volatility. Setting L=3 will signal the OR backend to aim for a higher inventory position to buffer against lead time uncertainty.

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean around 100 units per period. The primary challenge is the extreme lead-time volatility and lost shipments. Historical lead times have been 1, 2, or 3 periods. However, orders from Period 2 (135 units) and Period 6 (128 units) are now 13 and 9 periods overdue respectively, making them definitive lost shipments. The current In-transit balance is 361, but removing the 263 lost units results in an effective pipeline of only 98 units (P12: 18, P13: 80). With 0 on-hand inventory and the last arrival (P11 order) only covering 38 units against a demand of 110, we are in a stockout. To recover and hedge against future volatility (L=1 to 3), I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. Since the 'cap' logic in the OR backend uses L, increasing L to 3 allows for a higher order volume to replenish the stockout while accounting for the lost pipeline. I use recent_N for mu_hat (N=14) to capture the stable demand mean (~98) while smoothing out recent fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Integrity: P2 (135) and P6 (128) orders are lost. Effective pipeline as of P15 is 98 units. Lead time remains volatile between 1-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean of approximately 98 units across all samples and 100 units over the last 5 periods. Lead time is volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (observed successful L: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3). To mitigate frequent stockouts caused by this volatility, L is set to 3. A significant pipeline issue persists: orders from P2 (135 units) and P6 (128 units) are confirmed lost (14 and 10 periods overdue respectively). The current reported 'In-transit' of 370 units includes these 263 'phantom' units. The actual effective pipeline is only 107 units (orders from P13, P14, P15). Consequently, on-hand (0) + effective pipeline (107) = 107 units. To reach a base stock level covering (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~400 units), the OR backend must order approximately 293 units. Since the backend uses total 'In-transit' (370) in its logic, mu_hat must be adjusted to account for the 263 units error to trigger a sufficient order. Setting mu_hat to 663 (400 baseline + 263 correction) informs the system that our needs significantly exceed the reported pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Correction: 263 units (P2: 135, P6: 128) are lost; actual pipeline is Total In-transit minus 263.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean around 100 units/period (recent 5-period average is 99.4). The primary challenge is supply instability. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 484 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms that 263 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 221 units (484 - 263). The most recent orders (P15: 27 units, P16: 194 units) are still within the expected lead time. Lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1-3 periods. To minimize stockouts given the zero on-hand balance and historical delays, I am setting L=3 to ensure the backend base stock covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=10) to capture the stable demand mean while acknowledging recent fluctuations. sigma_hat will use the default method to ensure a sufficient safety buffer during this period of supply uncertainty.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a full-history mean of approximately 100 units per period (last 5 periods avg: 102.8). The lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P16 order arrived in 1 period, but many others took 3). I am continuing to use L=3 to protect against stockouts during longer delivery cycles. Regarding pipeline integrity: orders from Period 2 (135 units) and Period 6 (128 units) are confirmed lost (16 and 12 periods overdue, respectively). The current reported 'In-transit' of 290 units includes these lost 263 units, meaning the actual effective pipeline is only 27 units (the P15 order). With 90 units on-hand and only 27 effective units in transit, the current total inventory (117) covers just over one period of demand. To restore the inventory position to the base stock level required for a (1+L) lead time of 4 periods (~400 units), the parameters must account for the phantom pipeline. Setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 663 (400 for required base stock + 263 to offset the lost units in the OR engine's calculation) will trigger a sufficient order.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory for chips(Regular) is currently 0 with a total in-transit of 483 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 263 units (P2: 135 and P6: 128) are confirmed lost shipments. This reduces the effective pipeline to 220 units (483 - 263). Observed lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with L=3 being the most frequent successful lead time for recent arrivals. To protect against stockouts given this volatility and the recent failed replenishment cycles, I am setting L=3 explicitly. Demand remains relatively stable around a mean of 100. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=18 to capture the full history's mean while adjusting for the L=3 period look-ahead (equivalent to 4 periods of demand coverage). Setting L to 3 ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the extended lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, the inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand inventory and the last two periods resulting in lost sales. The pipeline contains 483 units, but according to historical carry-over insights, 263 units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost shipments. This reduces the effective pipeline to 220 units (ordered in P15, P16, P18). Demand has been relatively stable, averaging approximately 100 units per period (last 5 periods: 98, 98, 104, 116, 112). Successful lead times observed since Period 10 are: 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1 (averaging 2.5). Due to the high volatility and the presence of lost shipments, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to provide a safety buffer. For demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current mean of ~106 units per period. Using these settings ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the frequent 3-period lead times and the current demand level, while effectively seeing the corrected (lower) pipeline inventory.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 On-hand with 483 units In-transit. Historically, orders from Period 2 (135 units) and Period 6 (128 units) are confirmed lost (now 18 and 14 periods overdue respectively), totaling 263 lost units. This makes the effective pipeline 220 units (483 - 263). The most recent order was Period 18 (193 units), which at L=2 would arrive in Period 20 and be visible now, but it hasn't arrived. Historically, lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. To account for this volatility and the frequent stockouts, I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer protection interval. Demand is relatively stable with a mean of ~102 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for mu_hat to capture the recent sustained demand level and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock against the observed lead time variance.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Correction: 263 units (P2: 135, P6: 128) are permanently lost; effective pipeline is always Total In-transit minus 263. Order from P18 (193 units) is currently at L=2 and has not arrived, reinforcing the need for L=3 planning.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging approximately 100 units per period (last 10 periods mean: 102.5; last 5 periods mean: 108.6). Lead time is highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with significant lost shipments. As of Period 21 conclude, the order from Period 18 (193 units) is at L=3 and has not arrived, which further confirms the need to plan for L=3 to mitigate frequent stockouts. The inventory position is currently critical: On-hand is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 483 units includes 263 units from Period 2 (135 units) and Period 6 (128 units) that are confirmed lost shipments (now more than 15 periods overdue). Adjusting for these losses, the effective pipeline is only 220 units (483 - 263). Using L=3 (explicit) and mu_hat=400 (explicit, 100 units/period * (3+1)), the OR backend's base-stock calculation will account for the lead time extension. By setting L=3, we ensure the backend targets a pipeline that covers the current period plus the extended 3-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Effective pipeline confirmed as (Total In-transit - 263) due to permanently lost shipments from P2 and P6. Lead time L=3 remains the necessary safety buffer due to P18 order exceeding L=2.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience zero on-hand inventory and persistent stockouts. The demand remains stable around a mean of ~100 units. The critical issue is the pipeline integrity and lead time volatility. There are 263 units permanently lost (from Period 2 and Period 6), which the OR backend continues to count as 'in-transit'. Therefore, the effective pipeline is actually 483 (Total In-Transit) - 263 (Lost) = 220 units. These 220 units comprise orders from Period 15 (27 units) to Period 18 (193 units). The Period 18 order (193 units) is now 4 periods overdue (ordered in P18, not arrived by P22 conclude), which matches the maximum observed lead time or suggests further delays. I will set L=3 explicitly to account for this volatility and provide a higher safety buffer. Since the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 263 lost units. Calculation: Target Base Stock for L=3 is (1+3) * 104 (mean) + safety. Total units needed = 416 + safety. To ensure the backend orders enough despite the 263 false units in pipeline, I set mu_hat = (Ideal Base Stock) + 263. Estimated Ideal Base Stock is approx 530. Thus, mu_hat = 793.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 100 units per period (last 10 periods average: 101.4). Lead time is volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with several shipments confirmed lost (P2: 135 units, P6: 128 units). The total in-transit quantity is 696, but after deducting the 263 lost units, the effective pipeline is 433 (P18: 193, P23: 213, P24: TBD). The P18 order (193 units) is now 6 periods overdue (ordered P18, currently P24) and has not arrived, which strongly suggests it might also be lost, despite the promised L=2. To prevent massive stockouts given zero on-hand inventory and suspected pipeline degradation, I am setting L=3 to increase the base stock calculation, providing a safety buffer for the high lead-time volatility. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a 50% service level; however, the pipeline correction is handled by the 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat values to ensure the engine accounts for the 'lost' units. I am using mu_hat to cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand (~400 units).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Integrity Alert: Order from P18 (193 units) is now 6 periods overdue, suggesting a third lost shipment for chips(Regular) in addition to P2 and P6. Total units likely lost: 456.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the inventory situation for chips(Regular) is critical. On-hand inventory is 0. The total In-transit is 696 units, but history shows significant shipment losses. Specifically, orders from P2 (135), P6 (128), and now P18 (193) are severely overdue (P18 is at L=6 with no arrival, matching the pattern of lost shipments). Total lost units = 135 + 128 + 193 = 456. Subtracting these from the 696 in-transit units leaves an effective pipeline of 240 units (likely the P23 order of 213 plus smaller remnants). Successful lead times have been volatile (1-3 periods). I will set L=3 as a safety buffer to account for this volatility. For demand, the average since Period 1 remains stable around 100 units/period with standard deviation near 16. Setting \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to 'default' will allow the backend to use all historical samples (24 periods), which accurately reflects the steady demand regime. This strategy aims to ensure the 'effective' pipeline covers (L+1) periods of demand while clearing the 'phantom' inventory from the OR calculations.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Integrity Alert: Order from P18 (193 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods overdue), bringing total lost inventory to 456 units (P2, P6, P18). Effective pipeline = Total In-transit - 456.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable around a mean of 100 units per period. The primary challenge is extreme lead time volatility (1 to 3 periods) and frequent lost shipments. As of Period 26, the 'In-transit' balance of 483 units is heavily compromised by lost orders: P2 (135 units), P6 (128 units), and now P18 (193 units) are significantly beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods and are considered lost. Total lost units = 135 + 128 + 193 = 456. Effective pipeline = 483 - 456 = 27 units. With On-hand = 127 and Effective Pipeline = 27, the total effective inventory is 154 units. To maintain safety against the observed L=3 volatility, I am setting L=3 and using mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the stable demand regime. Explicit mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * average_demand = 4 * 100 = 400. This will trigger a substantial order to replace the lost 456 units that the OR backend still believes are coming.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Integrity Alert: Order from P18 (193 units) confirmed lost (8 periods overdue). Total lost inventory for chips(Regular) is now 456 units (P2: 135, P6: 128, P18: 193). Effective pipeline = Total In-transit - 456.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging 100 units/period (last 5 periods: 86, 100, 86, 81, mean=88.2). However, supply reliability is extremely poor. We have three confirmed lost shipments: P2 (135), P6 (128), and now P18 (193), totaling 456 units. The current reported in-transit of 483 units includes these 456 lost units, meaning the actual effective pipeline is only 27 units. Observed successful lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods. To avoid further stockouts given the low effective pipeline (27) and depleting on-hand inventory (46), I am setting L=3 to ensure a higher base stock level. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (1+3 * 100 = 400) to reflect recent stable demand, and sigma_hat is set to explicit based on historical volatility. The OR backend needs to place a significant order this period to compensate for the 456 lost units that are still being counted in its pipeline inventory calculation.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Integrity Alert: Total lost inventory for chips(Regular) is 456 units (P2: 135, P6: 128, P18: 193). Effective pipeline = Total In-transit - 456.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to suffer from extreme pipeline unreliability and stockouts. As of Period 28, the on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity is 483 units. However, previous Carry-over Insights (confirmed through Period 27) identify three permanently lost shipments: P2 (135 units), P6 (128 units), and P18 (193 units), totaling 456 lost units. This means the effective pipeline is only 27 units (483 - 456), which likely reflects the tail end of previous orders or noise. Demands are stable around 100 units/period (mean of last 20 samples is approximately 99). With a high ratio of lost shipments and observed successful lead times ranging from 1 to 3, setting L=3 is necessary for safety. Setting mu_hat using the last 20 samples (recent_N=20) captures the stable demand regime while accounting for the extended lead time (1+L=4). sigma_hat is also calculated over 20 samples to provide a sufficient buffer against lead-time volatility. This configuration forces the OR backend to place a substantial order to replenish the effectively empty pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging approximately 100 units per period (recent samples: 86, 100, 86, 81, 96, 119). The primary challenge is the inconsistent lead time (ranging from 1 to 3 periods) and a high rate of lost shipments. Based on the carry-over insights, three orders are confirmed lost: Period 2 (135 units), Period 6 (128 units), and Period 18 (193 units), totaling 456 units. The current in-transit inventory is 483 units, but after subtracting the 456 lost units, the effective pipeline inventory is only 27 units. With 0 on-hand inventory, the system is severely under-stocked. I will set L=3 as a safety buffer to account for lead time volatility. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a base stock level that targets covering 4 periods of demand (L+1), accounting for the current stockout and the lost pipeline inventory. Since mu_hat is used to calculate base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, I will set mu_hat to target a pipeline of approximately 400 units (4 periods * 100 units) to ensure the next order corrects for the 456 lost units effectively.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a stable mean around 102 units with standard deviation of approximately 17 (calculated from the last 20 samples). The current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit of 483 units is heavily compromised by lost shipments: P2 (135), P6 (128), and P18 (193) are confirmed lost, totaling 456 units. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 27 units. Observed lead times are highly volatile (1-3 periods). To mitigate the persistent stockout situation and compensate for the OR backend's unawareness of lost shipments, I will set L to 3 (recent worst-case observed) and use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure adequate ordering. I will calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * mean_demand = 4 * 102 = 408. sigma_hat is set to 35 (approx sqrt(4)*17.5) using 'explicit' to provide a sufficient safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Integrity Alert: Three shipments (P2, P6, P18) totaling 456 units are confirmed lost. Effective pipeline is (Total In-Transit - 456). Lead time is volatile (1-3 periods); planning with L=3 is necessary for service level stability.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable around 100 units per period (Avg ~101). However, the supply chain is highly unreliable. As previously identified, three shipments (P2: 135 units, P6: 128 units, P18: 193 units) totaling 456 units are confirmed as lost because they are significantly overdue (8+ periods). The current In-transit of 483 units includes these 456 dead units, leaving an effective pipeline of only 27 units. On-hand inventory is 0. To prevent persistent stockouts, the OR engine needs to order units to cover future demand. Setting L=3 explicitly accounts for the maximum successful observed lead time and creates a larger safety buffer. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=20 ensures the parameters reflect the stable demand regime while the OR engine (capped policy) attempts to rebuild the pipeline against the remaining 27 valid units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' is stable, averaging ~100 units/period (recent average is 100 over the last 15 samples). Lead time is volatile (1-3 periods). Pipeline Integrity: Three shipments (P2: 135, P6: 128, P18: 193) totaling 456 units are confirmed lost. The current In-transit is 483 units, but 456 of those are lost, meaning the effective pipeline is only 27 units (483 - 456). Since the backend OR engine's formula for the order is (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), it will incorrectly consume the lost units as available supply. To force the OR engine to order enough to cover the (L+1) horizon (approx 400 units), I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the lost pipeline using: explicit_mu = (L+1) * mean_demand + lost_units. With L=3, mean=100, and lost=456, the target base stock is ~856. This ensures the engine places an order of ~400 units (856 - 483 = 373).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is facing significant supply chain instability. Historical evidence confirms three lost shipments: Period 2 (135 units), Period 6 (128 units), and Period 18 (193 units), totaling 456 units that remain in 'In-transit' but will never arrive. The current 'In-transit' total of 722 includes these 456 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 266 units (27 from P15 and 239 from P32). On-hand inventory is 0. Observed lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L=3 as a conservative safety measure to prevent stockouts during this volatile period. Demand remains steady with a mean around 100 per period. Even with the effective pipeline of 266, a base stock calculated for L=3 (requiring 4 periods of coverage) will likely trigger an order because the OR engine's pipeline count includes the lost 456 units. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory of 456 units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes is coming, I would ideally lower the pipeline or raise the target, but as I can only adjust \u03bc\u0302, \u03c3\u0302, and L, I will use L=3 and 'default' stats to maximize the order target to account for current zero on-hand and the large lost shipment gap.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with a recent mean around 101 units per period. The primary challenge is the high lead-time volatility (range of 1-3 periods) and the presence of three confirmed lost shipments (P2: 135 units, P6: 128 units, P18: 193 units), totaling 456 units. These lost units artificially inflate the 'In-transit' figure (483), making the OR backend think there is ample pipeline stock. The effective pipeline is actually only 27 units (483 total - 456 lost). To bridge this, I use L=3 to ensure the backend targets a higher safety stock and accounts for 4 periods of demand (L+1). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the stable demand regime while providing the backend with accurate recent volatility. Setting L to 3 manually forces the base stock calculation to cover the inventory gap caused by the lost shipments.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging 101.4 units over 34 periods. The primary challenge is the high rate of lost shipments: Period 2 (135), Period 6 (128), and Period 18 (193) are confirmed lost, totaling 456 units. The observed in-transit inventory is 483 units, but subtracting the 456 lost units reveals an effective pipeline of only 27 units. On-hand inventory is 39 units. The lead time is volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, so I am using L=3 to ensure a sufficient safety buffer (1+L=4 periods of demand). To maintain the target base stock (approx. 400-450 units based on 4 periods of demand + safety), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=20 to capture the most stable recent demand regime while allowing the OR engine to order enough to replenish the depleted effective pipeline.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 100 units across the last 35 periods (recent 10-period avg ~98). Lead time continues to be highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a history of lost shipments. Three shipments are confirmed lost (P2: 135, P6: 128, P18: 193), totaling 456 units. The current In-transit balance is 483 units; after accounting for the 456 lost units, the effective pipeline is only 27 units. With 0 on-hand inventory and an effective pipeline of 27, a significant order is required to restore the base stock level. I will use L=3 to provide a safety buffer against lead-time volatility and lost shipments, ensuring the OR backend targets enough inventory to cover the review period plus the maximum likely lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to recent historical levels (last 20 samples) to capture current demand behavior.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with an average around 100 units per period. The primary challenge remains the inventory pipeline. We have confirmed three lost shipments (P2: 135 units, P6: 128 units, and P18: 193 units), totaling 456 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 483 units includes these 456 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 27 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. To prevent further stockouts and account for lead time volatility (which ranges from 1 to 3 periods), I am setting L=3 to provide a safety buffer. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure the OR backend's calculation is based on the effective pipeline rather than the inflated 'In-transit' value. mu_hat is calculated as (1 + L) * expected_demand, which is (1 + 3) * 100 = 400. sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture current volatility while maintaining stability.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units per period. Three historical shipments (Period 2, Period 6, and Period 18) totaling 456 units are confirmed lost, as their delay significantly exceeds the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. The current In-transit inventory is 483 units; after subtracting the 456 lost units, the effective pipeline is only 27 units. With 0 on-hand inventory, the system is currently in a stockout state. To restore service levels and account for observed lead-time volatility (1-3 periods), I am setting L=3 to ensure a sufficient safety buffer. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) with N=20 to capture the stable recent regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This configuration allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers 4 periods of demand (L+1), effectively triggering a large recovery order.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean around 100 units. However, supply reliability is the primary concern. Three past shipments (P2, P6, P18) totaling 456 units are confirmed lost. The current in-transit inventory is 483 units. Subtracting the lost units (456) leaves an effective pipeline of only 27 units. With 0 on-hand inventory, the system is severely under-stocked relative to demand. Lead times have fluctuated between 1-3 periods; I will set L=3 as a conservative safety measure to ensure the service level is maintained despite these delays. For demand, I'll use a recent 20-period average to capture the stable mean and volatility, which will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for both the lead time and the risk of stockouts during that period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 100 units per period. The primary challenge is the significant loss of inventory in the pipeline. Three shipments from P2, P6, and P18 (totaling 456 units) are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' of 483 units includes these 456 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline inventory is only 27 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficiently large order to cover demand, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for lead-time volatility (historical lead times vary from 1-3 periods). I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 100 = 400 units. To compensate for the 456 lost units that the OR backend incorrectly thinks are still coming, I will set sigma_hat to an 'explicit' value of 456 units. This artificial inflation of sigma_hat forces the base stock calculation (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) to increase significantly, triggering an order that bypasses the 'ghost' pipeline inventory and refills the actual stock levels.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with an average of approximately 100 units per period. The primary challenge is supply chain volatility and loss. Historically, shipments from Period 2 (135), Period 6 (128), and Period 18 (193) are confirmed lost, totaling 456 units. The current 'In-transit' of 483 units effectively contains only 27 units of valid pipeline inventory (483 - 456). With 0 on-hand inventory, the system needs to order significantly to cover the lead time. While the promised lead time is 2, historical arrivals vary between 1 and 3 periods. Applying L=3 provides a safety buffer against this volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=20) and sigma_hat (N=20) to capture current demand levels without being skewed by very early data, while setting L explicitly to 3 to account for the frequent delays observed and to provide protection against the high loss rate.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is facing a critical inventory shortage with zero on-hand units and 483 units in-transit. Based on 'Carry-over Insights', 456 units (P2: 135, P6: 128, P18: 193) are confirmed lost. Subtracting these from the current 483 in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of only 27 units. Demand is stable, with the most recent 10-period average around 99 units. Since the effective pipeline (27) plus on-hand (0) is drastically below the expected demand over the lead time, the OR backend must place a significant order. I set L=explicit (3.0) to account for observed lead-time volatility (1-3 periods) and provide a safety buffer. For demand, I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the stable mean of ~100 units/period. Sigma is set to default as the standard deviation has remained relatively consistent.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean around 100 units per period. The primary challenge is the significant quantity of lost shipments in the pipeline. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, orders from P2 (135), P6 (128), and P18 (193) are confirmed lost, totaling 456 units. The current reported 'In-transit' of 483 units includes these 456 units, meaning the actual effective pipeline is only 27 units (483 - 456). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we are in Period 43 of 50, we must replenish immediately to cover the remaining periods. I will use L=3 to ensure a sufficient safety buffer against the observed lead-time volatility (range 1-3 periods). I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the current stable demand mean (~99), and sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect recent volatility. The OR backend will see an 'in-transit' of 483, so by setting mu_hat and L correctly, I signal the need for more stock while the backend's policy helps mitigate over-ordering given the high holding cost.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 98 units per period over the last 10 periods (P34-P43). Inventory is currently zero on-hand, and although there is a recorded In-transit of 483 units, the Carry-Over Insights confirm that 456 of these units (from P2, P6, and P18) are permanently lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is only 27 units (483 - 456). Lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, requiring a planning lead time (L) of 3 to ensure service levels and avoid stockouts. I will use 'explicit' values for L and mu_hat to account for the lost inventory adjustment that the default backend calculations wouldn't perceive, setting mu_hat = (1+3) * 98 = 392. sigma_hat will be set using the 'default' method as demand volatility has been relatively consistent.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around a mean of ~100 units per period. In-transit inventory currently shows 483 units. However, based on the history and carry-over insights, 456 of these units (from Period 2, Period 6, and Period 18) are confirmed as lost. This means the effective pipeline inventory is actually only 27 units (483 - 456). With 0 on-hand inventory and the game ending in Period 50, we need to secure enough stock for the remaining 6 periods (45-50). Given the lead time volatility (1-3 periods), I will set L=3 to ensure a sufficient safety buffer. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a base stock level that accounts for the lost items and the target period range. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.0 each), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock roughly (L+1) * mean. With L=3 and mean=100, the target base stock is ~400. The OR backend will order 'base_stock - (In-transit - Lost)', which translates to '400 - 27 = 373'. This should ensure availability for the final stretch of the game.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been steady around 100 units/period. The pipeline inventory shows 483 units, but according to historical carry-over insights, 456 units (from Periods 2, 6, and 18) are permanently lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 27 units (483 - 456). Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. To ensure a high service level and account for this volatility, I am setting L=3. For demand, the last 10 periods show a stable mean of approximately 100, so I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime. Setting L to the explicit value of 3 ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the 3-period lead time plus the review period, effectively bridging the gap created by the lost shipments and inconsistent arrival times.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 of 50. Total in-transit is 483 units. Based on historical 'Carry-over insights', three shipments from P2 (135 units), P6 (128 units), and P18 (193 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 456 units. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 483 - 456 = 27 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Historical demand is relatively stable around a mean of ~100. Given the game ends at Period 50 and the effective pipeline is only 27 units (not enough to cover lead time + remaining periods), a significant order is needed to satisfy demand for the final three periods (P48, P49, P50). I will use L=3 for safety due to historically volatile lead times (1-3 periods). I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 4 periods worth of demand (L+1) minus the 27 units already (effectively) in-transit. Mean demand (~100) * 4 = 400. 400 - 27 = 373. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure the OR engine targets this specific need, and a standard sigma_hat for volatility.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. Demand is stable around 100 units/period (mean ~98.5). On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 483 units. Historically, 456 units (from P2, P6, and P18) are confirmed lost, as documented in carry-over insights. Subtracting these from the total in-transit (483 - 456) leaves only 27 'real' units in the pipeline. With a promised lead time of L=2 and actual lead times varying between 1-3, we expect these 27 units to arrive within the next 1-2 periods. To maximize profit in the final 3 periods, we must ensure we have enough inventory to cover demand for the remainder of the game (Periods 48, 49, and 50). Total expected demand for 3 periods is ~300 units. Since current real pipeline (27) + on-hand (0) is drastically insufficient, the OR engine needs to place an order. I will set L=3 as a safety buffer for lead-time volatility and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=20) to capture the stable demand regime (~100 units). Sigma_hat is set to 20 to reflect historical volatility.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are nearing the end of the simulation (Game History ends at Period 48, with the current decision for Period 49). On-hand inventory is 0, and units sold have been 0 since Period 36 due to zero ordering. The in-transit inventory is 483 units. According to historical carry-over insights, 456 units (from P2, P6, and P18 orders) are confirmed lost. This means the effective pipeline is (483 - 456) = 27 units. However, we are at Period 49 of 50. Since the lead time is volatile (averaging 2, but often 3), any order placed now (P49) would arrive in Period 51 or 52 at the earliest (N+L resolution), which is outside the 50-period horizon. Thus, placing an order now will likely only incur costs without generating revenue. However, the OR backend logic requires parameters to manage the 'base stock' level. Demand has remained stable around 100 units/period (mean of last 10 samples: 102.9). I will set L=3 to align with historical safety planning, and use recent_N=10 for demand to reflect the steady state. I will not place a massive order because the game ends next period and arrivals take at least 1-2 periods.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 100 units per period. The primary challenge is the significant loss of inventory in the pipeline and the inconsistency of lead times. Current history confirms three shipments are permanently lost: P2 (135), P6 (128), and P18 (193), totaling 456 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 483 units includes these 456 lost units, meaning the actual effective pipeline is only 27 units. On-hand inventory is 0. To restore the supply chain and meet future demand, I must trigger a large order by setting parameters that reflect the missing stock. I am setting L=3 to provide a safety buffer against lead time volatility (observed 1-3 periods). mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 20 periods to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 100/period), which at L=3 should target a base stock around 400. Since the backend subtracts the 'official' pipeline (483) from the base stock, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 950 to ensure the resulting order is large enough to cover the actual demand and the deficit left by the lost shipments.
