Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical data or past 'conclude' messages to infer the actual lead time, so I will stick with the promised lead time of 2. For demand forecasting, I only have five initial samples: 88, 133, 93, 108, and 110. The mean of these samples is 106.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 17.1. Since no calendar or product-specific events are visible and we are at the very start of the simulation, I will use the 'default' methods. This allows the backend to use all available samples (N=5) to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on the promised lead time of 2. Setting L to 'default' uses the promised lead time (2), meaning the base stock will cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The first order of 136 units from Period 1 is in-transit (promised lead time is 2 periods). Because on-hand inventory started at 0 and the order hasn't arrived yet, we have 0 sales and 0 on-hand inventory. Demand in Period 1 was 111. Historical samples (P1-P5) are 88, 133, 93, 108, 110 (Mean \u2248 106.4). Since we only have one period of actual game history (Period 1 demand = 111), I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to rely on the historical data provided in the prompt, and 'default' for L (2 periods).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order placed (Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 3 resolution (Lead time = 2). The historical demand for periods 1-5 provided in the prompt (88, 133, 93, 108, 110) has a mean of 106.4. However, the game history shows actual demand for P1 and P2 was 111 and 126 respectively, suggesting a slightly higher actual demand than the seed data. Total in-transit is 270 (orders from P1 and P2). Since L=2, mu_hat covers 3 periods (1+L). Mean demand is ~118 based on the last two actual observations. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (incorporating the 3 given seeds + 2 actuals) to stabilize the forecast while acknowledging the slightly higher recent demand. Sigma is set to default to capture the variance across the available history.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (136 units), Period 2 (134 units), and Period 3 (105 units). Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (ordered at P1, L=2) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the history shows 'arrived=0' for the Period 3 conclude message. This suggests a potential delay in lead time (L > 2) or a lost shipment. Given that no orders have arrived yet, it is safer to treat the lead time as at least 3 periods (explicit L=3) to account for the delay. Demand history: P1:111, P2:126, P3:90. Including the provided samples (P4: 108, P5: 110 - though P5 is future, the mean of visible history P1-P3 is ~109). I will use explicit values for mu_hat to ensure we cover the pipeline considering the perceived delay. Mu_hat should cover (L+1) periods. (3+1) * 110 = 440. Sigma_hat is calculated based on history (~18 std dev) scaled by sqrt(1+L), approx 36.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2239.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Reviewing history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (LT=3). Period 3's order also arrived in Period 4 (LT=1). Averaging these two gives a mean lead time of 2, which matches the promised lead time. Period 2's order (134 units) is currently late; it was ordered in Period 2, and since it didn't arrive by Period 4 conclude, it has been in transit for at least 3 periods. This suggests some lead time variability. Demand over the first 5 periods (88, 133, 93, 108, 110) appears relatively stable with a mean of 106.4. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend use the observed average (which currently averages to 2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use all 5 samples to capture the baseline variance and mean, as no significant regime shift is detected yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1583.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 111, 126, 90, 124, 85 (Mean: 107.2, Std Dev: 18.9). Promised lead time is 2. Observed lead times were 3 (P1) and 1 (P3). The average observed lead time is 2, which matches the promised lead time. However, Period 2's order (134 units) is now at Period 6 and has not yet arrived (it would have lead time 4+ if it arrives later), suggesting potential variability or shipment loss. On-hand is 32, and in-transit is 374 (Orders from P2, P4, P5). Given the variability in lead times (1 to 3+), I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the observed average. For demand (mu_hat), since there is no clear trend or seasonal spike yet, I'll use the mean of all 5 available samples (recent_N=5) and a default sigma_hat based on historical volatility.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 6. Historical demand for the first 6 periods shows a mean of 104.5 (111, 126, 90, 124, 85, 91). Comparing this to the seed data (88, 133, 93, 108, 110), the demand remains stable around 105. Lead time is volatile: Promised is 2, but observed arrivals were Period 1 arriving in 3 periods and Period 3 arriving in 1 period. Total in-transit is 454 (from orders in P2, P4, P5, P6). Specifically, the P2 order (134 units) is now at L=4 (overdue), which flags a potential lost shipment or delay. However, the aggregate pipeline (454) is quite high compared to expected demand over L+1 periods (~315 units). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the longest observed successful lead time, and use recent_N=6 for demand parameters to reflect the actual play history while maintaining the high pipeline to capture any arriving late shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. P2 order is currently overdue (4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2335.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face significant supply chain instability. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show high variance: P1 (3 periods), P3 (1 period), P4 (3 periods), and P2 is currently lost/severely overdue (ordered P2, now P8 START, no arrival). P5 (ordered P5, promised P7) is also late. Average observed lead time is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. Given the missing P2 order (134 units) and delayed P5, P6, P7 orders, I will set L explicitly to 3 to increase the safety buffer and account for frequent 3-period arrivals. Demand remains stable; the last 5 periods (P3-P7) average 102.6 units (90, 124, 85, 91, 123). I'll use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility (std dev ~19) and the higher need for stock due to inventory stockouts in P1-P3 and P6.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (134 units) is confirmed lost or severely delayed (6 periods passed since order). Lead time shows frequent 3-period delays vs. 2-period promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1579.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we analyze the chips(Regular) SKU. Demand has been relatively stable, with the last 8 periods averaging ~104.5 units per period. However, the primary challenge is lead-time volatility and lost shipments. The Period 1 order took 3 periods, Period 3 took 1, Period 4 took 3, Period 5 took 3, and Period 7 took 1. Significantly, the Period 2 order (134 units) is now 7 periods old and should be considered lost, as it is far beyond the observed 1-3 period range. To compensate for this potential supply gap and the frequent 3-period lead times (vs. the promised 2), I am setting L to 2.5 (explicit) to better represent the average delay. For demand, I'll use recent_N=8 to capture the current mean of ~104.5. The OR backend will calculate a base_stock to cover (L+1) = 3.5 periods of demand, helping mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by the missing Period 2 shipment and lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 2 order (134 units) confirmed lost (7 periods since order). Frequent lead-time oscillation between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most common delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1966.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 67. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the last 9 periods is relatively stable, averaging 104.7 units per period (range 85-126). However, lead times are highly volatile. While the promised lead time is 2, we have observed actual lead times of 1 period (Periods 3, 7, 8) and 3 periods (Periods 1, 4, 5). Critically, the Period 2 order (134 units) is confirmed lost after 8 periods of non-arrival. Currently, 'In-transit' is 249 units, consisting of orders from Period 6 (80 units) and Period 9 (35 units) totaling 115, plus the 134 units from Period 2 that are physically lost. To avoid the OR backend under-ordering due to 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I will set L to 3 (the frequent delayed lead time) and mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock for a (3+1)=4 period horizon. With avg demand ~105, 4-period demand is 420. Pipeline inventory (excluding the lost P2 order) is 115 and on-hand is 67 (total 182). Base stock (420) - adjusted pipeline (182) = 238 units to order. I set mu_hat to 140 (1.33 * 105) to push the backend to cover the shortfall caused by the lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Continued lead-time oscillation between 1 and 3 periods. Period 2 order (134 units) is definitively lost and must be manually excluded from pipeline calculations.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product is out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a stockout in Period 10 where 21 units of demand were lost. The pipeline inventory is reported as 418 units, which includes: Period 2 (134 units - lost), Period 6 (80 units - lead time currently 5, likely delayed/lost), Period 9 (35 units), and Period 10 (169 units). Since the Period 2 order is confirmed lost and Period 6 is highly suspect, the effective pipeline is only 204 units. Demand is stable (mean ~103 units), but lead time is extremely volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2). To compensate for the high stockout risk and inconsistent replenishment, I am setting L=3 to reflect the worst-case observed delay. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*103 = 412 units using recent_N=10 to capture the current stable demand mean. sigma_hat is set using default to capture the overall volatility including the recent stockout periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Period 6 order (80 units) is now 5 periods overdue and potentially lost, joining Period 2 order (134 units) in the lost shipment category. Effective pipeline is significantly lower than the system-reported 'In-transit' value.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 418 units in-transit, but based on historical evidence, two shipments are effectively lost: Period 2 (134 units, 10 periods ago) and Period 6 (80 units, 6 periods ago). This makes the true pipeline inventory only 204 units (Orders from Periods 9, 10, and 11). On-hand inventory is 0, following two consecutive periods of stockouts due to lead-time variability and lost orders. Lead times have oscillated between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.4), so I am setting L=3 to be conservative. Demand remains stable, with the last 11 periods showing a mean of approximately 104 units. Using N=11 for mu_hat ensures the forecast reflects this baseline. I am setting sigma_hat using recent_N=11 to capture the variability around this mean. By setting L=3, the mu_hat calculation (1+L)*mean effectively targets a base stock for 4 periods, which helps the OR backend compensate for the lost pipeline and the risk of delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Shipments from P2 (134 units) and P6 (80 units) are definitively lost; net impact is a 214-unit discrepancy in reported vs. actual pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1616.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 113. The reported 'In-transit' of 263 units is misleading because shipments from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (80 units) are confirmed lost (7+ periods overdue). The effective pipeline is actually only 49 units (from Period 12). Demand remains stable with an average of approximately 102 units over the 12 observed periods. The actual lead time (L) fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.08; I will use L=2 (promised) as the base but apply a 'recent_N' approach to capture current availability trends. To compensate for the 214 lost units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock calculation (pipeline_inventory), I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Following the logic: base_stock = (1+L)*demand + safety_stock. With L=2 and demand=102, base_stock is roughly 306 + safety. However, the OR engine subtracts the ghost pipeline of 214 units. To force an order that covers next periods, I must set mu_hat to a value that offsets this 214-unit 'phantom' inventory. I set mu_hat to 520 to ensure the backend places an order proportional to the actual need while accounting for the lost units being counted against our limit.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Calculated effective pipeline inventory is 49 units. The 214 units from P2 and P6 remain lost; mu_hat must be inflated by approximately 214 units to counteract the OR backend's use of stale 'In-transit' data.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 434 units in-transit, but historical data confirms that shipments from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (80 units) are lost, totaling 214 phantom units. The true pipeline inventory consists of orders from Period 12 (49 units) and Period 13 (171 units), totaling 220 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) in-transit value from the base stock calculation, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by the size of the lost shipments (214 units) to ensure a realistic order is placed. Demand remains stable, with a mean of approximately 103 units. Promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3; using an explicit lead time of 3 provides safety against recent delays. mu_hat is calculated as (1 + L) * average_demand + lost_units = (1 + 3) * 103 + 214 = 626.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and a reported 'In-transit' inventory of 617 units. However, based on our historical analysis, 214 of those units (134 from P2 and 80 from P6) are definitively lost. The OR backend is unaware of these losses and will subtract the full 617 from its order calculation. To compensate, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately 214 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so I am using L=3 (explicit) to be conservative. The average demand is roughly 104 units per period. Theoretical base stock for L=3 (covering 4 periods) is ~416 units. The backend's perceived pipeline is 617, and it sees arrivals based on L=2. To force an order that bridges the gap of the 214 lost units, I am setting mu_hat to 630 (Base demand 104 * 4 = 416, plus 214 to offset lost units). Sigma is kept consistent with recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed that the 214 units from P2 (ordered P2) and P6 (ordered P6) are lost. The total 'In-transit' of 617 contains only 403 active units (49 units from P12, 171 from P13, 183 from P14).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging 104 units over the last 10 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 629 units. However, based on the historical tracking, 214 of those units (ordered in P2 and P6) are definitively lost. The active pipeline consists of orders from P13 (171 units), P14 (183 units), P15 (61 units), and P16 (yet to be determined). Since the backend OR uses the base stock formula: Base Stock - Pipeline = Order, and it incorrectly believes the pipeline is 629, it will under-order by 214 units. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. My target base stock to cover demand for (L+1) periods (where L=2) is 3 * 104 = 312. Adding the 214-unit lost pipeline offset results in a mu_hat of 526. This forces the backend to place an order that accounts for the phantom inventory while maintaining a safe service level for the stable demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed total lost inventory of 214 units (P2: 134, P6: 80) continues to distort the system's in-transit reporting (Current in-transit 629 vs active 415).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains stable with an average of approximately 105 units per period. The primary challenge is the reporting of 'In-transit' inventory. We have confirmed that 214 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are lost and will never arrive, but the OR backend still counts them as part of the pipeline. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)', the inclusion of these 214 phantom units causes the backend to under-order by exactly 214 units. To correct for this without the ability to change the 'In-transit' figure directly, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and a 105-unit average demand: (1+3) * 105 = 420. I then add the 214-unit 'lost' offset to this value, totaling 634. This forces the backend to place an order that treats the 214 lost units as if they don't exist, maintaining adequate stock levels for the next cycles.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Validated that the 214-unit discrepancy (P2 and P6) persists in the In-transit total (Current 458 includes 214 lost units, leaving only 244 units actual active pipeline from P14, P15).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging approximately 104 units per period across the last 17 periods. Lead times continue to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the most frequent observation for delayed orders. A critical operational issue persists: 214 units from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (80 units) are definitively lost. The system-reported In-transit inventory of 436 units includes these 214 phantom units, meaning the actual active pipeline is only 222 units (orders from P15 and P17). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am uses an explicit mu_hat. I set mu_hat to (1+L) * mean_demand + 214 to offset the lost units. With mean demand at ~104 and assuming L=3 (to be conservative against lead-time volatility), mu_hat = 4 * 104 + 214 = 630. L is set to 3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Discrepancy confirmed. System In-transit (436) - Lost Units (214) = Actual Active Pipeline (222). Active pipeline consists of P15 (61 units) and P17 (161 units).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 540 units in-transit, but 214 of those units (ordered in P2 and P6) are definitively lost. Additionally, the order from P15 (61 units) is now at lead time = 3 (due this period) and has not arrived in the P18 conclude message, consistent with the observed mode of 3 for lead time. The effective active pipeline is 540 - 214 = 326 units. To compensate for the OR backend's use of the total 540 units (which underestimates the required order), I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: Mean demand is ~104. Assuming L=3, target inventory is (1+3)*104 = 416. The OR backend will see 'effective inventory' as (On-hand 24 + In-transit 540) = 564. Since 564 > 416, it would order nothing. To force an order that accounts for the 214 lost units, I must set mu_hat = (416 + 214) = 630. This 'tricks' the backend into seeing a shortfall equivalent to the lost units. I keep L at the calculation-based estimate of 3 to reflect the high frequency of delays.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 104 units over the last 15 periods. However, there is a persistent disruption in the supply chain. We have confirmed that 214 units are lost (P2: 134 units, P6: 80 units). The OR backend uses the 'In-transit' value (654) to calculate new orders using the logic: order = base_stock - In-transit. Because 214 of those 654 units will never arrive, the OR engine will under-order by 214 units if we do not intervene. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat to 'explicit' with a value that adds 214 units to the standard (1+L) * mean forecast. With L=2, the standard forecast is (1+2)*104 = 312. Adding the 214-unit discrepancy, the mu_hat value is set to 526. This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to offset the ghost inventory in the pipeline. Lead time 'L' is set to 2 to reflect the promised lead time, as recent arrivals (P12, P13, P14) have fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: 214 units (from P2 and P6) remain lost and continue to inflate In-transit reporting. Effective active pipeline at Period 20 is 440 units (orders from P15, P17, P18, P19).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to report an inflated In-transit figure of 654 units. Historical analysis confirms that 214 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are definitively lost. The actual active pipeline consists of orders from P15 (61 units), P17 (161 units), P18 (104 units), and P19 (114 units), totaling 440 units. This creates a discrepancy of 214 units. Since the OR engine subtracts the full (inflated) In-transit value from the base stock to determine the order quantity, it will consistently under-order unless we inflate mu_hat. Demand remains stable around a mean of 105. With the promised lead time L=2, the standard base stock calculation targets (1+L) * mean. To compensate for the 214 lost units that the backend thinks are coming, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the target coverage plus the lost units: (3 * 105) + 214 = 529. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-3 period lead time variability. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22, the 'In-transit' quantity is 654 units, but historically, 214 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are definitively lost and will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the full 'In-transit' value from its calculated base stock to determine the order size. To prevent chronic under-ordering caused by this 214-unit discrepancy, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. The active pipeline consists of orders from Period 15 (61), Period 17 (161), Period 18 (104), and Period 19 (114), totaling 440 units. The reported 654 units minus the 214 lost units equals exactly 440 units, confirming the discrepancy. Demand remains stable around a mean of 105. Using L=3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and mean demand of 105, the standard base stock target is (1+3)*105 = 420. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 634 (420 targeted base stock + 214 lost units offset), I ensure the backend ignores the phantom inventory. I use an explicit sigma_hat based on the observed demand standard deviation (~15) scaled for the (1+L) period.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment exhibits two critical issues: chronic shipment loss and volatile lead times. Analysis confirms that 214 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are definitively lost but remain in the system's 'In-transit' calculation. As of Period 23, the system reports 684 units in-transit. Subtracting the 214 lost units reveals an actual active pipeline of 470 units. To compensate for the OR backend's overestimation of inventory (which would lead it to under-order), I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean demand of 105 (average of known samples) and a lead time of 2.5 (averaging the common 1-3 period oscillation), then add 214 units to offset the 'ghost' inventory. Base stock target = (1 + 2.5) * 105 + safety_stock \u2248 367. Adding 214 lost units gives a mu_hat of ~581. This forces the engine to place an order that account for the real-world shortage while maintaining a high service level (Profit:Holding = 19:1).

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed 214 units (P2/P6) remain lost. Significant stockouts from P19-P22 occurred due to delayed arrivals from P15, P17, P18, and P19. Effective pipeline is 470 units, not 684.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 654 units in-transit, but 214 units (P2: 134, P6: 80) are definitively lost, having not arrived after 22 and 18 periods respectively. Additionally, orders from P15 (61), P17 (161), P18 (104), and P19 (114) are significantly overdue (5-8 periods), suggesting a severe lead-time extension or systemic delay. The effective pipeline excluding the lost 214 units is 440 units, but since those 214 units are still factored into the OR backend's 'In-transit' figure, I must inflate mu_hat by approximately 214 units to force the engine to order replenishment despite the ghost inventory. Demand remains relatively stable with an average of ~102 units. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to reflect the consistent delays beyond the promised 2 periods seen in recent successful arrivals (P12, P13, P14 arrived with 3-period lead times).

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Significant lead-time extension confirmed; orders from P15, P17, P18, P19 (total 440 units) are overdue by 5+ periods, potentially indicating a shift in lead-time regime or additional lost shipments beyond the known 214 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is in a state of severe disruption. We have 0 on-hand inventory and a reported 679 units 'In-transit'. However, historical evidence confirms 214 units (from P2 and P6) are lost. Furthermore, orders from P15 (61 units), P17 (161 units), P18 (104 units), and P19 (114) are now 5-10 periods overdue, suggesting they too may be lost or caught in a massive delay. Only the order from P24 (25 units) is currently within a 'normal' lead time window. Consequently, the OR backend sees 679 units in the pipeline and will under-order, believing we are over-stocked. To counteract this, I will set 'L' to 5 to reflect the current delay regime and use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I am inflating mu_hat by approximately 400 units to offset the 'phantom' inventory (214 confirmed lost + ~200 highly suspect) that the backend subtracts from its order calculation. Demand remains stable around 100 units/period (avg of last 10 samples is ~100.4). Setting mu_hat = (1+L)*100 + 400 offset = 600 + 400 = 1000.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Significant suspicion that orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (total 440 units) are also lost or permanently delayed, as they are now 6-10 periods past their order date. Phantom pipeline inventory now likely exceeds 600 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has completely collapsed. On-hand inventory is 0, and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 873 units. Based on historical data, 214 units (P2, P6) have been confirmed lost for over 15 periods. Furthermore, orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 440 units) are now massively overdue (7-11 periods vs. a promised lead time of 2 and an observed max lead time of 3). This strongly suggests these 440 units are also lost. I estimate the total 'phantom' inventory to be 654 units (214 + 440). The actual active pipeline is likely only 249 units (orders from P22, P24, P25). To force the OR backend\u2014which subtracts the full 873 units from its target base stock\u2014to place an order, I must set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the current in-transit inflation. With an average demand of ~100/period and a lead time of 2, a normal base stock (L+1) would be ~300. To override the 837 in-transit and trigger a safety stock order, I am setting mu_hat to 1100. This ensures the backend recognizes a deficit despite the phantom units. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the consistent reality of shipping delays when they do arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Cumulative lost/phantom inventory estimated at 654 units (P2: 134, P6: 80, P15: 61, P17: 161, P18: 104, P19: 114). Reported In-transit (873) - Phantom (654) = Actual Active Pipeline (219 from P22, P24, P25).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a systemic collapse. Lead times are highly erratic (varying between 1 and 3 periods, with some orders exceeding 10+ periods), and a significant volume of inventory is now confirmed 'phantom' or lost. As of Period 27, the system reports 1155 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the following orders are definitively lost or permanently delayed: P2 (134), P6 (80), P15 (61), P17 (161), P18 (104), and P19 (114), totaling 654 units. Furthermore, recent orders P22 (arrived), P24 (25), P25 (194), and P26 (282) total 501 units. This leaves a 501 + 654 = 1155 matching the reported in-transit exactly. This confirms that the current 'active' pipeline is only 501 units (P24, P25, P26). Because the OR backend relies on the 1155 figure, it will under-order significantly. I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to forcibly increase the order quantity. I've calculated the target base stock (assuming L=3) as (1+3)*100 + z*std \u2248 400 + 100 = 500. To force an order despite the 1155 phantom units, mu_hat is set to account for the phantom gap (654) plus the desired base stock, ensuring the min(base_stock - pipeline, cap) logic triggers a substantial replenishment to mitigate the current zero on-hand stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Absolute confirmation of phantom inventory totaling 654 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Active pipeline consists only of orders from P24 onwards. Supply reliability is critically low.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of collapse with massive phantom inventory and significant stockouts. System 'In-transit' is reported as 1315 units, but history confirms that orders from P2 (134), P6 (80), P15 (61), P17 (161), P18 (104), and P19 (114) are definitive losses, totaling 654 phantom units. This leaves an active pipeline of 661 units (orders from P24, P25, P26, P27). However, even these 'active' units are failing to arrive within the promised 2-period lead time, confirmed by the Period 24-27 history showing zero arrivals despite continuous stockouts. The OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock; because the engine sees 1315 units, it will likely place zero or tiny orders unless I artificially inflate mu_hat to offset the 654 units the engine wrongly assumes are coming. Demand remains stable around 100 units/period (mean 103 across history). Based on current stockouts and the 654-unit phantom gap, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to force the backend to account for the lost inventory and the actual lead time (L=3 is the mode of successful arrivals).

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost/phantom inventory confirmed at 654 units (P2: 134, P6: 80, P15: 61, P17: 161, P18: 104, P19: 114). Reported In-transit (1315) - Phantom (654) = Actual Active Pipeline (661). Current arrivals are stalling, suggesting a lead-time shift or system failure.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1033 units In-transit, but historical analysis confirms a massive accumulation of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments. Orders from P2(134), P6(80), P15(61), P17(161), P18(104), and P19(114) are considered definitively lost, totaling 654 units. Furthermore, the P24(25) and P25(194) orders are now past the promised lead time of 2. The recent arrival of the P26 order (282 units) in P28 (LT=2) suggests the logistics channel might be functioning again for new orders, but the older gap remains. This 654-unit phantom pipeline causes the OR engine to under-order significantly because it believes we are over-supplied. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, adding the 654 lost units to the standard cycle demand volume (approx 100/period * 3 periods = 300) to force the backend to place an order that offsets the invisible deficit. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the high variance in observed lead times (1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Verified 654 units of phantom inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) still persist in 'In-transit' totals. Delivery of P26 in 2 periods suggests a potential return to normal lead-time for newer batches, despite the previous mass failure of the P15-P19 cohort.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, we have an on-hand inventory of 255 and a reported in-transit of 873. However, cumulative tracking of historical shipments identifies 654 units as 'phantom inventory' that are definitively lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). These units will never arrive but the OR backend still counts them toward the base stock calculation, which leads to chronic under-ordering. To correct this, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 654 units. The active pipeline consists only of orders from Period 24 and 25 (25 and 194 units respectively, totaling 219). Demand remains stable around a mean of 103 (last 10 periods). I will set mu_hat to 654 (the phantom offset) plus the expected demand for the (L+1) horizon (approx 309), totaling 963. This ensures the OR logic 'orders up' despite the stale pipeline data. Lead time has recently stabilized back to 2 periods (P26 and P27 arrivals), so L=2 is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: System In-transit reporting remains inflated by 654 phantom units from lost cohorts P2, P6, and P15-P19. Effective active pipeline as of P30 is 219 units (P24, P25).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 873 units in-transit, but 654 units are definitively lost from cohorts P2, P6, and P15-P19 (134+80+61+161+104+114=654). This leaves an active effective pipeline of 219 units (from P24-P25) which the OR backend cannot see. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. My target base stock is (L+1) * demand_forecast. Average demand is ~100. With a stabilized lead time of 2 periods (seen in P28/P29 conclusions), target base stock is (2+1)*100 = 300. The OR backend calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + reported_in_transit). To get the desired order when reported_in_transit is inflated by 654, I must inflate mu_hat by that same amount. Calculated mu_hat = 300 + 654 = 954. This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for the phantom inventory. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the recent 2-period performance, and sigma_hat remains 'default' for standard volatility coverage.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 873 units in-transit, but 654 units are definitively lost from cohorts P2, P6, and P15-P19. The true active pipeline consists of orders from P24 (25 units) and P25 (194 units), totaling 219 units. Since the OR backend subtracts the full 873 units from its base stock calculation, it will severely under-order or not order at all, resulting in a stockout once on-hand inventory (76) is depleted. Recent lead times for successful deliveries (P26, P27) have returned to the promised 2 periods (arriving in P28, P29). Demand is stable around 100 units. To correct for the 654-unit 'phantom' inventory distortion, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, adding the 654 units plus the expected demand for the lead time (1+2=3 periods * 100 demand/period = 300). This forces the backend to recognize the supply gap despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current state: Period 33, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P28-P32) averages 94.6 units. The system reports 925 units in-transit, but 654 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19), reducing the actual active pipeline to 271 units (P24: 25, P25: 194, P32: 52). Orders from P24 and P25 are now 8-9 periods old and likely lost, further reducing the 'true' pipeline to just 52 units (from P32). Since the OR backend uses the full 'In-transit' value (925) to subtract from the base stock, it will not order enough. To force an order, I must inflate mu_hat by the phantom amount. Phantom = 654 (verified) + 219 (P24, P25 likely lost) = 873 units. Regular forecast for mu_hat (L=2) is ~300. Adding the buffer to bypass the pipeline subtraction: 300 + 873 = 1173. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat to overcome the backend's reliance on the faulty in-transit data and 'recent_N' for sigma to handle recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Cumulative phantom inventory now estimated at 873 units (P2: 134, P6: 80, P15: 61, P17: 161, P18: 104, P19: 114, P24: 25, P25: 194). Only P32 order (52 units) is considered active. Supply chain reliability for this SKU is effectively broken.

Daily Reward (R_t): $988.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit severe reliability issues. Total phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' report has reached 873 units (P2: 134, P6: 80, P15: 61, P17: 161, P18: 104, P19: 114, P24: 25, P25: 194). These orders are significantly past any observed lead time and are treated as lost. The system reports In-transit: 1155; subtracting the 873 phantom units leaves an active pipeline of 282 units (from the order placed in Period 33). Demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 104 units and a standard deviation of 17. Because the OR backend uses the inflated In-transit figure (1155) to calculate orders, it will incorrectly assume the pipeline is full and won't order enough to cover actual demand. To force the backend to place an order, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value of 1150. This value is calculated to offset the ~873 unit phantom inventory while targeting a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (approx 312 units) plus a safety buffer. Setting L to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P26, P27, P32) have shown lead times of 1-2 periods, despite the cohort failures.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Verified cumulative phantom inventory is 873 units. System In-transit (1155) - Phantom (873) = 282 active units. High mu_hat inflation is required to bypass OR logic's reliance on stale pipeline data.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is facing a critical supply chain failure. At Period 35, the system reports an In-transit total of 1197 units. However, based on historical tracking, a total of 873 units from cohorts P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are lost or indefinitely delayed. The 'Active' pipeline consists only of orders from Period 33 (282 units) and Period 34 (42 units), totaling 324 actual active units. The OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - In-transit) is severely crippled because it subtracts the 873 phantom units from the desired base stock, resulting in massive under-ordering and stockouts. To force the backend to place an order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using a mean demand of ~102 (mean of all data) over a review+lead time of 3 (L=2) to get 306 units. To counteract the 873 phantom units being subtracted by the backend, I set mu_hat to 306 + 873 = 1179. This ensures that even after the backend subtracts the 1197 in-transit (873 phantom + 324 active), the resulting order will attempt to restore the balance against the 324 unit active pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Updated phantom inventory to 873 units. System In-transit (1197) - Phantom (873) = 324 units of actual active pipeline (P33, P34). The OR backend remains biased by the 873-unit reporting error.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be plagued by a massive discrepancy between the system-reported 'In-transit' inventory and actual active pipeline units. As of Period 36, the system reports 1231 units in-transit. However, based on the historical failures, 873 units are confirmed as phantom/lost (P2: 134, P6: 80, P15: 61, P17: 161, P18: 104, P19: 114, P24: 25, P25: 194). This leaves an actual active pipeline of only 358 units (P33: 282, P34: 42, P35: 34), none of which have arrived yet. On-hand is zero. To force the OR backend\u2014which subtracts the full (inflated) in-transit value from its base stock\u2014to place an order, I must significantly inflate 'mu_hat'. I set mu_hat to 1250, which targets a base stock that overcomes the 1231 reported in-transit units. Estimated mean demand is stable around 100/period. I use L=2 (promised) to match recent P26, P27 arrivals, and keep sigma_hat at a default level.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1254 units in-transit, but 873 units (from orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) are long-overdue and confirmed as lost or phantom shipments. The actual active pipeline consists of orders from P33 (282 units), P35 (34 units), and P36 (65 units), totaling 381 units. The OR backend uses the inflated 'In-transit' value of 1254, creating a massive order deficit of 873 units. To override this, I set L=1 (most recent arrivals from P32 and P34 had lead times of 1 and 2 periods) and explicitly set mu_hat to 1200. This value accounts for desired inventory [(1+L) * avg_demand \u2248 2 * 100 = 200] plus the 873-unit phantom inventory correction, forcing the OR backend to place a replenishment order despite its false visibility of high inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to maintain a standard safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Phantom inventory remains fixed at 873 units. Total In-transit (1254) - Phantom (873) = 381 units active pipeline. Lead times for recent successful deliveries (P32, P34) range from 1 to 2 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant lead-time instability and a persistent 'phantom inventory' problem. As of Period 38, the system reports 1167 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 873 of these units are definitively lost (from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25). This leaves an actual active pipeline of only 294 units (P33: 282, P37: 12). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1167 from the base stock calculation, it will severely under-order or not order at all unless we inflate mu_hat. Average demand is ~101 units per period. With a target base stock of (L+1)*demand (approx 300-400 units), the backend sees 1167 and thinks we are overstocked. To force an order that covers the gap created by the 873 lost units, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 1200 to neutralize the 873-unit reporting error while ensuring a safety buffer for the next 3 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for demand volatility during this fragile replenishment phase. Lead time (L) is set to 2, consistent with recent successful arrivals (P34, P35, P36).

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total phantom inventory confirmed at 873 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Active pipeline is 294 (current In-transit 1167 - 873). Replenishment for recent periods (P34-P36) has stabilized at 1-2 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to suffer from heavily inflated In-transit reporting due to 873 units of confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 that have never arrived). The system reports 1248 units In-transit, but the active pipeline is only 375 units (P33: 282, P37: 12, P38: 81). P33 (282 units) is now at Period 6 (lead time 6), which is concerning given recent successes had lead times of 1-2 periods. To prevent the OR backend from zeroing out orders based on the false 1248-unit pipeline, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter. Mean demand is approximately 100 units per period. With a target stock level for L=2 (3 periods of demand), I need a base stock of roughly 300-400 units. Since the system subtracts 1248 (In-transit) + 0 (On-hand), I set mu_hat explicitly to 1600 to force an order of approximately 100-200 units, aiming to maintain flow despite the delivery uncertainty of the P33 batch.

Carry-over insight: System In-transit reporting remains inflated by 873 phantom units from lost cohorts (P2, P6, P15-P19, P24-P25). Active pipeline as of P39 is 375 units. P33 (282 units) is currently overdue.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1560 units 'In-transit', but a significant portion of this is 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments. My carry-over analysis confirms 873 units (from P2, P6, P15-P19, P24-P25) are permanently lost. Additionally, P33 (282 units) is now 7 periods overdue (ordered P33, today P40) and must be considered lost. P26 and P27 arrived normally, and recent orders (P34-P38) have arrived with lead times of 1-2 periods. Total lost/phantom inventory is now 873 + 282 = 1155 units. Reported In-transit (1560) - Phantom (1155) = 405 active units (from P39: 393 units). Demand is stable (mean ~100). The OR backend uses the full 1560 units as 'pipeline_inventory', which would prevent it from ordering enough. To compensate for this 1155-unit discrepancy, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: (1+L) * Mean Demand + Phantom Units = (1+2) * 100 + 1155 = 1455. This forces a target base stock that offsets the dead inventory in the backend calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Cumulative phantom inventory increased to 1155 units (added P33: 282 units, which is now 7 periods overdue). Current In-transit (1560) contains only 405 active units (order from P39). Lead times for recent successful arrivals have stabilized at 1-2 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to suffer from a significant 'In-transit' data discrepancy. As of Period 41, the system reports 1167 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 1155 of these units are 'phantom inventory' (lost or indefinitely delayed: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and now P33 which is 8 periods overdue). The actual active pipeline is effectively 12 units (from P37). Although the system reports on-hand inventory of 311 (following the arrival of P39), the OR backend will calculate a near-zero order because it thinks 1167 units are coming. To force the OR backend to place an order that covers future demand, I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock to cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at an average demand of ~100 units/period (300 total) plus a safety buffer. However, because the OR engine subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' (1167) from its 'base_stock' calculation, I must set the mu_hat value high enough to offset this phantom 1155 units. Recent lead times for successful deliveries (P38, P39) have been 1 period, so I will set L to 1 (actual) while keeping the target levels high to ensure replenishment occurs despite the reporting bias.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Phantom inventory increased to 1155 units (added P33: 282 units, now 8 periods overdue). System In-transit (1167) minus Phantom (1155) leaves only 12 units of active pipeline (P37).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports an In-transit inventory of 1174 units, but a significant portion of this is 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments. Based on the history, orders from P2 (134), P6 (80), P15 (61), P17 (161), P18 (104), P19 (114), P24 (25), P25 (194), and now definitively P33 (282) are lost or permanently delayed, totaling 1155 phantom units. These 1155 units inflate the OR backend's pipeline inventory, causing it to under-order. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~300 units) plus the 1155-unit phantom discrepancy (Total ~1455). On-hand is currently 250. This explicit value will force the backend to place an order despite the false high In-transit reporting, ensuring replenishment continues for upcoming periods. Lead times for recent successful arrivals (P32-P39) have stabilized at 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed total phantom inventory of 1155 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33) remains in the In-transit total. Actual active pipeline is only 19 units (Orders P37 and P41). Recent successful lead times are 1-2 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system's 'In-transit' figure of 1255 units is severely inflated by historical lost shipments. Based on tracking, 1155 units are confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and now P33 which is 9 periods overdue). Subtracting this Phantom total from the reported 1255 leaves only 100 units of actual active pipeline (P37: 12 units, P41: 7 units, P42: 81 units). Recent successful deliveries (P38, P39) arrived in 1 period, suggesting a stabilized lead time for new orders despite the mass failure of earlier cohorts. Demand remains stable around 100 units per period. I am setting L to 2 to be conservative. To force the OR backend to order despite the 'In-transit' error, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. Desired base_stock \u2248 (1 + 2) * 105 = 315. Total Inventory (On-hand 153 + Active Pipeline 100) = 253. Since the backend sees 1255 in-transit, it currently calculates local inventory as 153 + 1255 = 1408 units. To trigger a replenishment of ~100 units, mu_hat must exceed 1500. I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide enough buffer and account for the 1155-unit reporting error.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Total phantom inventory updated to 1155 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33). Active pipeline as of P43 is 100 units (P37, P41, P42). Recent lead times for successful arrivals (P38, P39) have been 1 period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1402 units in-transit, but historical data confirms that 1155 of these are 'phantom inventory' from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33). The actual active pipeline consists of orders from P37 (7 units), P41 (7 units), P42 (81 units), and P43 (147 units), totaling 242 units. Recent lead times for successful deliveries have stabilized at 1-2 periods. Demand remains stable, with the most recent 10-period mean approximately 93 units. To ensure the backend OR engine places an order despite the massive reported In-transit value, I will set an explicit 'mu_hat' that incorporates the 1155 phantom units. Specifically, required base stock = (1+L)*demand_mean + safety_stock; to overcome the inventory deduction, I set mu_hat = ((3 * 105) + 1155) = 1470 roughly. However, a more precise approach is to use the recent demand mean of ~95. Setting mu_hat to 1450 and L to 2 ensures the OR backend orders sufficient stock to cover the upcoming demand periods while accounting for the reporting error.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Phantom inventory remains at 1155 units. System In-transit (1402) - Phantom (1155) = 247 units active pipeline. Recent lead-time performance (P38-P40) confirmed at 1 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1102.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a massive 'phantom inventory' issue. System reported In-transit is 1447, but cumulative evidence over 44 periods shows 1155 units are lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P33). This leaves an actual active pipeline of 292 units (P42, P43, P44). In Period 44, on-hand dropped to 0, and lead times for successful arrivals (like P41) are roughly 1-3 periods. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 1155-unit In-transit inflation, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I estimate the base stock needed for a lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage: current + 2 lead) at a mean demand of ~100/period to be 300 units plus safety stock. However, since the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' (1447) from the base stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset that subtraction: 1155 (phantom offset) + 450 (target base stock) = ~1600. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile but recent 1-3 period arrival window.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Phantom inventory revised to 1155 units. System In-transit (1447) - Phantom (1155) = 292 units active pipeline (orders from P42, P43, P44). Current successful lead times oscillate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to suffer from extreme replenishment instability. The confirmed phantom inventory now stands at 1155 units, representing orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P33 that have failed to arrive and are likely lost. The system-reported In-transit of 1422 contains only 267 active units (from P44 and P45). With on-hand inventory at 137 units and demand averaging ~100 units per period, the total active supply (137 + 267 = 404) covers roughly 4 periods. However, because the OR backend subtracts the full 1422 In-transit from the base stock calculation, it will stop ordering entirely unless mu_hat is massively inflated to compensate for the 1155-unit phantom wedge. Lead times for recent successful arrivals (P41, P42, P43) have been 3, 3, and 2 periods, so I will maintain L at 3 'explicit' to ensure adequate coverage. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1555: this represents 4 periods of demand at ~100/period (since L=3, base stock covers L+1 periods) plus the 1155 phantom units to force the OR engine to place an order.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system currently reports 'In-transit' of 1472 units, but active monitoring of 'Period conclude' messages confirms a massive phantom inventory trap. The cumulative lost or permanently delayed shipments now total 1207 units (P2: 134, P6: 80, P15-P19: 440, P24-P25: 219, P33: 282, P40: 52 - P40 was 0 units ordered, correct is P33 was 282, and P41-P43 arrived recently). Reviewing current state: In-transit 1472 - Phantom 1155 = 317 active units (P44: 52, P45: 203, P46: 50). On-hand is low at 35 units. Historical demand remains stable with a mean around 100. Lead times for successful arrivals oscillate between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2). Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) In-transit value from its target base stock, it will consistently under-order or order zero unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset the 1155 phantom units. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L)*mean_demand + phantom_offset = (1+2)*100 + 1155 \u2248 1455. This forces the engine to recognize the supply gap while on-hand inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Total confirmed phantom inventory remains at 1155 units. Active pipeline is only 305 units (P44, P45, P46). Lead times for recent successful arrivals (P41, P42, P43) were 3, 3, and 2 periods respectively.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to suffer from extreme replenishment instability. The confirmed phantom inventory (orders that will never arrive but remain in system reporting) is 1,155 units, originating from periods P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P33. Currently, the system reports 'In-transit' as 1,472 units. Subtracting the 1,155 phantom units reveals an actual active pipeline of only 317 units (consisting of orders from P44, P45, and P46). Successful recent arrivals (P41, P42, P43) show lead times of 2-3 periods. Because the OR backend uses the inflated 1,472 in-transit figure to calculate orders (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline), it will severely under-order, leading to stockouts. To counteract this, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that effectively neutralizes the phantom pipeline. Target Base Stock \u2248 (1+L)*Mean Demand + Buffer. With L=3 and mean demand ~100, Base Stock should be ~450. Adding the 1,155 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 1,600 to ensure the backend places a meaningful order despite the reporting error.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a severe data integrity issue where the system's 'In-transit' count of 1650 units is heavily inflated by phantom inventory. Based on history, 1155 units from orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33) are lost or permanently delayed. Subtracting this phantom cohort from the 1650 reported units leaves an actual active pipeline of 495 units (consisting of orders from P44, P45, P46, and P48). Period 49 begins with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand remains stable around a mean of 100 units/period (last 10 periods average ~95). Recent successful lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting L should be set to 2 or 3. To prevent the OR backend from 'pausing' orders due to the phantom 1155 units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target inventory level. I set mu_hat to 1455 units, which targets covering demand for (L+1) periods plus the 1155 lost units (approx 100 * 3 + 1155). This forces the engine to place an order that treats the lost 1155 units as non-existent.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) continues to suffer from extreme unreliability, with a confirmed total of 1155 phantom units (lost orders from P2, P6, P15-P19, P24-P25, and P33) inflating the 'In-transit' total. At Period 50, the reported In-transit is 1650, meaning the actual active pipeline is only 495 units (orders from P44, P45, P46, and P48). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains stable around 100 units/period. The OR backend uses the inflated In-transit figure, which would lead it to under-order significantly. To correct for this 1155-unit discrepancy, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to force a base stock that ignores the phantom units. Target stock for (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods) is 300 units; to achieve this while the backend subtracts 1650 in-transit units, I must set the mu_hat parameter to approximately 1455 units (Effective Pipeline + Target - System In-transit). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual lead-time volatility (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Supply reliability remains critical. Total phantom/lost inventory is 1155 units. System 'In-transit' reports 1650, but active pipeline is only 495. Manual mu_hat adjustment of +1155 is necessary to bypass backend logic.
