Demand Analysis: Historical demand is P1: 111, P2: 126, P3: 90, with additional samples provided (Avg ~107). \n4. Strategy: The OR baseline recommends 0 because it sees 376 units in the pipeline (which theoretically covers ~3.5 periods of demand) and assumes L=2. However, because the lead time is clearly longer than 2 sessions or shipments are failing, the pipeline is not reliable.

Total inventory position is 367 units, which covers over 3 periods of average demand.\n\n3.

No, P45 arrived in Period 45. The active orders are P46, P47 totaling 250 units). Current On-hand is 0. Since the game ends at Period 50 and lead time is typically 1-3 periods, an order placed now in Period 49 might arrive for Period 50 if lead time is 1, but will definitely not benefit the simulation if it arrives later. However, since P46 and P47 are still in the pipeline (250 units total) and expected demand is ~100 units/period, there are sufficient units arriving to cover Period 49 and 50 demand.
