The average demand across these samples is approximately 116 units per period. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 4. Following the logic to cover (L+1) periods (Periods 1, 2, and 3) plus a safety margin, I need to account for immediate and upcoming demand. Since I am starting with 0 inventory and 0 in-transit, I must place a substantial order. Based on the historical average (~116) and the need to cover the lead time gap, I will order enough to cover approximately 3 periods of demand plus a small buffer to handle the volatility seen in the early samples (range 75-138). I'll target a stock position of roughly 400 units to ensure service levels are met while balancing the $1.00 holding cost.",

To determine the order for Period 2, I consider the (L+1) window, which covers Periods 2, 3, and 4. Total demand for these 3 periods is estimated at ~390 units (using ~130/period). I already have 400 in transit, which should cover demand through Period 4. However, because I have 0 on-hand inventory and the Period 1 order won't arrive until Period 3, I am already facing stockouts in Period 1 and likely Period 2. To build a small safety buffer and ensure I don't run dry if the lead time is slightly longer or demand slightly higher, I will place a moderate order to maintain the pipeline.

This is a recovery from the lower dip in P21-P22 (~86), but lower than the P15-P20 peak (~136). I will forecast ~110 units per period. (c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: Lead time is volatile but has historically peaked at 3 periods for successful deliveries. Orders from P17 (120), P18 (150), and P19 (310) are definitively lost (age 8-10 periods). The 'In-transit' of 1260 units includes these lost units (580 units) plus P20 (received but perhaps not cleared from system view), and massive orders from P25 (350) and P26 (150). P25 was ordered in P25 and should arrive in P28 (L=3). (d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. Pipeline consists of P25 (350) and P26 (150). Total expected pipeline is 500 units. Lost orders should be disregarded. (e) Final Order Logic: To cover 4 periods (Current + 3 LT) at ~110 units/period, I need ~440 units. With 500 units incoming (P25+P26) and 0 on-hand, the pipeline already covers the immediate 4-period window. However, given the extreme volatility and frequent order losses, holding a small extra buffer is safer than a stockout, but an order of 0 is appropriate today to see if P25 arrives as expected.",
