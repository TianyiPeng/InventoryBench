Following the rule that an order placed in Period N arrives in Period N+L and is visible in N+L+1, an order placed today (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 (after its decision phase) and become usable for demand in Period 3 and visible at the start of Period 4. Therefore, I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3. Average demand is 116 units. Total demand for 3 periods is ~348. To buffer against demand variance (max observed 138), I will aim for a slightly higher stock target. Target = 3 * 130 = 390. Since on-hand + in-transit = 0, I will order 390 units.",

Therefore, it should be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. No inventory arrived during Period 1, so sales were 0 despite demand. Historical data for Periods 1-5 shows an average demand of approximately 116 units per period. Current pipeline (in-transit) is 390 units. Assuming a lead time of 2, these units cover demand for Periods 3, 4, and 5 (~348 units). However, I need to account for Period 2 demand (which will be lost as on-hand is 0) and ensure coverage for Period 6. Since I am at the start of Period 2, an order placed now (N=2) will arrive in Period 4 (N+2).
