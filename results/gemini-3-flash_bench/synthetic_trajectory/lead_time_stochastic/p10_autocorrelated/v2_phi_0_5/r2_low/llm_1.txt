Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 75, 138, 134, 122, and 111, averaging approximately 116 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now in Period 1 will arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 4 (visible to me in Period 4's decision phase). Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I am guaranteed to stock out in Periods 1, 2, and 3 regardless of my action. To minimize future stockouts, I need to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods).

The effective pipeline is thus 560 units. Based on historical data, the lead time has varied between 1 and 3 periods.

However, I have stockouts in P13 and P14, and potentially P15 since no arrivals occurred in P14. The P13 order (290 units) is expected to arrive in P16 (LT=3). To cover P16, P17, and P18 while recovering from the current stockout and building a safety buffer given the high volatility of lead times, I need to maintain a robust pipeline.

On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units) as P27 demand (43) exceeded P26 ending inventory (42). The pipeline situation is complex: the systemic 'In-transit' of 1090 contains 640 units from historically confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P19). The active pipeline consists of orders from P24 (100), P25 (100), P26 (100), and P27 (150). Based on the most common successful lead time of 2-3 periods, the P24 order is expected to arrive during P28 (appearing in P29 start). I need to maintain stock to cover at least 3-4 periods of demand (~430 units) due to delivery unreliability. Currently, active in-transit units (450) and on-hand (0) roughly match this, but given the high loss rate (~45%), I will place a conservative order of 110 units to ensure continuity and buffer against another potential lost shipment.",

Harris (Normal) chips.
Current Period: 42.

**Analysis:**
1.  **World Knowledge & Product Description:** "Chips(Regular)" is a high-turnover snack staple. Demand is generally consistent but sensitive to the beginning of the month (payday) or local events.
2.  **Demand Regime:** Recent demand (P36-P41) has averaged 98.3 units/period (90, 120, 95, 117, 99, 69). The most recent period (69) suggests a minor dip, but the broader regime is ~100.
3.  **Lead Time & Missing Orders:** Promised lead time is 2. Recent arrivals (P38-P40) show a lead time of 1 period. However, historical loss rates are high (~45%). 
    *   Defunct List: P2, P6, P15, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33 (Total 1,000 units).
    *   Specific Check: The order from Period 37 (170 units) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived. Given the recent 1-2 period trend, P37 is confirmed lost. 
    *   New Defunct Total: 1,170 units.
4.  **Inventory & Pipeline:** 
    *   Current On-hand: 115 units.
    *   Systemic In-transit: 1,390 units.
    *   Active Reliable Pipeline: Order from P40 (100 units) and P41 (120 units). Total = 220 units.
    *   Total Reliable Position (On-hand + Active Pipeline): 115 + 220 = 335 units.
5.  **Final Order Logic:** 
    *   Target coverage: 3 periods (L+1, where L=2) at ~100 units/period = 300 units.
    *   Current Reliable Position: 335 units.
    *   The current position (335) safely covers the next 3 periods of expected demand. However, given the extreme loss rate of shipments, maintaining a small buffer is necessary to prevent stockouts like those seen in P37/38.

Based on history, we identify 1170 units as defunct/lost (P2, P6, P15, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33, and now P37, as P37's 170 units are 5 periods old and haven't arrived).
