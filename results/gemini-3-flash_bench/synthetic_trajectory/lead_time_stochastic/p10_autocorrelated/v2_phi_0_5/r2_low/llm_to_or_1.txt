Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no history yet, and we need to initialize the policy. The promised lead time is 2. Historical demand samples provided are [75, 138, 134, 122, 111]. The mean of these 5 samples is 116. Since L=2, the total expected demand over the lead time plus current period (L+1) is 3 * 116 = 348. The standard deviation of the samples is approximately 25.4. For (L+1) periods, sigma_hat = sqrt(3) * 25.4 \u2248 44. Since we have specific historical data and are starting fresh, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available samples) to seed the OR backend with the relevant local distribution until actual game demand is observed.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 158 units with a promised lead time of 2. These are currently 'In-transit' and should arrive during Period 3 (visible in the Period 3 conclude/Period 4 start). Demand in Period 1 was 90, but we sold 0 because on-hand started at 0. Historical demand samples (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) show significant volatility. The mean of these 5 samples is 116. Since we have very few observations (only 1 period of the actual game), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 covering the provide historical samples to establish a baseline demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). I will stick to the default lead time of 2 until we have arrival data to verify actual performance.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (158 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3 resolution, becoming visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 309 units in-transit (P1: 158 + P2: 151). Historical demand samples are [75, 138, 134, 122, 111], while actual observed demand in periods 1 and 2 were 90 and 79 respectively. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting a conservative inventory policy. Since we have only 2 observation points since start and the system is still stabilizing, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (incorporating the provided sample data + new observations) to calculate mean demand. L is set to default as we haven't seen any arrivals to contradict the promised lead time of 2.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (158 units), Period 2 (151 units), and Period 3 (13 units). Following the Lead Time Definition: an order placed in Period 1 (N) with L=2 should arrive during Period 3 (N+L) resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the shipment from Period 1 is delayed/lost. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and have lost all demand so far (90+79+84 units), we must aggressively restock. I will set the lead time (L) to 3 to account for the observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), the average demand over the first three periods is approximately 84.3 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current demand level while setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the extended pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time exceeds promised 2 periods; Period 1 order (placed P1) did not arrive by P3 conclude, indicating L >= 3.

Daily Profit: $141.00, Daily Holding Cost: $30.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Examining the delivery history: the P1 order arrived at the end of P4 (lead time = 3), and the P3 order also arrived at the end of P4 (lead time = 1). The P2 order (151 units) is still missing. Averaging the two concluded deliveries (3 and 1) gives an average lead time of 2, but the missing P2 order suggests inconsistency or potential loss. Given the high stock-out risk earlier and the current on-hand inventory of 30, it's safer to stick to the promised L=2 for the calculation while monitoring P2. Demand has shown an upward shift in the last two periods (141 and 111 vs previous ~80s). I will use recent_N=2 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. For L, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (3 and 1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period_4: Average demand increased from ~84 to ~126 (+50%). Lead time variability confirmed: P1=3 periods, P3=1 period.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 with 0 on-hand inventory and 346 units in transit. Inventory reached zero in Period 5 because we only filled 30 units of a 107-unit demand. Demand Analysis: There is a clear regime shift starting at Period 4. The first three periods averaged 84.3 units, whereas the last two averaged 124 units (141 and 107), confirming a significant increase. I will use recent_N (N=2) to capture this higher demand regime. Lead Time Analysis: The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show high volatility (P1=3, P3=1). The Period 2 order (151 units) is now overdue (it should have arrived at the end of P4 or P5). Given the inconsistency and the stockout, I will set an explicit lead time of 3 to force a higher base stock, ensuring we cover a longer protection interval (L+1=4 periods) to recover from the stockout and bridge the arrival of the in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed stockout in P5 due to erratic lead times; P2 order (151 units) remains overdue as of P5 conclude, suggesting higher L variance.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 with 0 on-hand inventory and 496 units in transit. Historical demand shows a regime shift starting Around Period 4; the mean demand for Periods 1-3 was 84.3, while Periods 4-6 show an average of 117.7 (+40%). We use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime. Lead times are highly volatile: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, but P2 (ordered Period 2) is now 4 periods overdue (as of Period 6 conclude, it still hasn't arrived), and P4 and P5 are also pending. Because of this extreme uncertainty and the fact that we have been in a stockout for two consecutive periods (P5, P6), I am setting an explicit lead time L=3 to ensure the base stock formula accounts for longer cycles, and setting a high explicit sigma_hat of 60 to reflect the volatility in both demand and supply arrival. This conservative approach aims to build enough safety stock to handle the unreliable arrival of 'In-transit' units.

Carry-over insight: Lead time crisis: P2 order (placed Period 2) is missing/extremely delayed (L > 4 as of P6 conclude). Combined with P1 (L=3), the average lead time is significantly higher and more volatile than the promised 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 units on-hand. Lead time behavior is extremely erratic: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, P4 arrived in 3 periods, and the P2 order (151 units) is still missing (L > 5), which suggests it may be lost or significantly delayed. To compensate for this instability and the stockout, I am increasing the expected Lead Time (L) to 4 periods (explicitly) to raise the base stock level and pipeline buffer. For demand, the average since Period 4 (when demand shifted up) is roughly 107 units. Using recent_N=4 captures this higher demand regime (P4-P7: 141, 107, 105, 75). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility in the new regime. These parameters aim to increase the target inventory level to better handle lead time uncertainty and prevent future stockouts once the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Lead time crisis persists: P2 order (placed P2) is still missing as of P7 conclude (L > 5). P4 order arrived in 3 periods, confirming sustained lead time variance/drift beyond the promised 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-21.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe a complex fulfillment environment. While the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times have been 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods for concluded orders. Critically, the order from Period 2 (151 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost, although the OR backend still counts it as 'in-transit' (In-transit=356, but P6=150 + P8=55 + P2=151 = 356). To handle the missing P2 stock, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3.0 to reflect the observed mode. For demand, the average since the regime shift (P4-P8) is approximately 101.4 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent mean. Given the profit ($1) equals the holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock target is effectively the mean demand over the lead time plus review period (1+L). Using N=5 for sigma_hat helps account for the high demand volatility seen recently (ranging from 75 to 141).

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Order placed in Period 2 (151 units) confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed (L > 6); Pipeline inventory reflects 151 units that will never arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the supply chain remains unstable. Historical data shows that the order from Period 2 (151 units) is effectively lost (L > 7), while other orders have arrived in 1 or 3 periods. To account for the lost inventory that the OR backend still considers 'in-transit', I must extend the operational Lead Time (L) to prevent the policy from under-ordering. I set L to 4 to provide a safety buffer against the pipeline gap. Demand analysis: After a brief spike (P4-P6), the last three periods (P7-P9) show a return to a lower average demand (~81 units). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this return to the mean. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture historical volatility, which is heightened by the recent demand swings.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Demand has stabilized back to an average of ~81 units (Periods 7-9) after the Period 4-6 spike; Lead time remains highly inconsistent (ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with one confirmed loss).

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~81 units over the last 4 periods (P7-P10: 75, 79, 88, 61), following a significant spike in P4-P6. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this lower, stable demand regime for mu_hat. Regarding lead times, the history shows extreme variance: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P8=1, while the P2 order is confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. The average observed lead time for successful deliveries is 2.2 periods. To account for this lead time drift and the lost P2 order (151 units), which is still counted in the 'In-transit' total of 337 but will never arrive, I will set L to 3 explicitly. This effectively increases the base stock to cover the pipeline gap and guards against the observed delivery delays. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current volatility of the stabilized demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at ~76 avg (P7-P10) from previous peak; Lead time variance persists (range 1-3 periods).

However, the carry-over insights confirm that the order placed in Period 2 (151 units) is lost. This means our functional pipeline is actually 186 units (337 - 151). Demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 74 units over the last 5 periods (P7-P11: 75, 79, 88, 61, 69). Lead times remain highly volatile, with observed arrivals occurring at 1 and 3 periods (average 2, but inconsistent). Because the OR backend has no awareness of the lost 151 units, it will see the pipeline as 337 units and likely order nothing, extending our stockout. To force an order and account for the missing stock, I will set 'L' to 'explicit' at 2 (the promised average) but significantly inflate 'mu_hat'. By setting mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~75 units over (L+1)=3 periods, plus 'ghosting' the 151 units we know aren't coming, I aim to reach a target inventory level that triggers replenishment. Target base stock should be approximately (3 * 75) + 151 = 376 units to offset the 'In-transit' calculation error. I will use 'explicit' values to bypass the backend's faulty pipeline logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable at ~74 units (P7-P11). Stockouts continue due to the 'lost' Period 2 shipment (151 units) remaining in the system's pipeline inventory count.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a critical inventory deficit. The 'In-transit' count of 340 units includes a 151-unit order from Period 2 that is definitively lost (L > 10 periods), as well as a 150-unit order from Period 6 which is now 7 periods overdue (L > 6), likely lost or severely delayed. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 'pipeline_inventory' (340 units) from the calculated base stock, it will fail to place new orders even though on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand has stabilized around an average of 86 units (Periods 7-12) despite a spike in Period 12 (133). Observed lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods for successful deliveries. To force the OR engine to order despite the 'ghost' pipeline units, I will set L to 'explicit' at 4 (the high end of observed successful lead times) and set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the 301 'lost' units (151 from P2 + 150 from P6). Calculation: (1+4) * 86 + 301 \u2248 731. This compensates for the pipeline inventory that will never arrive, ensuring a replenishment order is triggered.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Pipeline inventory (340 units) is significantly corrupted by lost/severely delayed orders from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (150 units). Demand average for Periods 7-12 is ~86 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 12-13) has spiked significantly to an average of 135.5 units, compared to the previous stable average of ~81 units (Periods 7-11). This represents a new demand regime shift. On-hand inventory is 0, and the system shows a stockout in Period 13. The pipeline inventory (529 units) is heavily corrupted by two lost shipments: Period 2 (151 units, L=11) and Period 6 (150 units, L=7), totaling 301 'phantom' units. To account for this, the OR parameters must be set aggressively. I am using 'explicit' L=3 to reflect the high-end of observed lead times (range 1-3). I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent demand surge (~135+) and increased volatility, while effectively ignoring the phantom pipeline by allowing the base_stock calculation to target a much higher level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: Average increased from ~81 to ~135 (+66%) over the last 2 periods. Total 'phantom' pipeline inventory reached 301 units (P2 order: 151, P6 order: 150) as of Period 13 conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 12, with demand averaging approximately 129 units over the last three periods (133, 138, 117). The system is facing a severe inventory crisis: on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts. More critically, the 'In-transit' figure of 529 is heavily contaminated by 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Based on history, the orders from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (150 units) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed (exceeding even the outlier lead times of 3). This means 301 units of the 529 \u2018In-transit\u2019 will likely never arrive. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this inflated pipeline, I must set the mu_hat (target level) extremely high. I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat based on the current high demand (~130) and an inflated lead time estimate (L=3 to cover the 1-3 period variability), plus an additional offset equal to the lost units (301) to neutralize the pipeline error. Target base stock = (1+3)*130 + 301 \u2248 821.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 confirmed: Average increased to ~129 (+50% from previous baseline). Total phantom pipeline inventory remains at 301 units (P2: 151, P6: 150) as of P14 conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe supply chain crisis. We have 0 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' figure of 714 units. Analysis reveals that 301 of these units are 'phantom' inventory (P2 order: 151, P6 order: 150) that have likely been lost, as they are 14 and 10 periods overdue respectively. Furthermore, a demand regime shift occurred at Period 12, with the average demand rising to ~127 units (compared to the previous ~81). Current in-transit units that may actually arrive include orders from P13 (189 units) and P15 (224 units). Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit (including the 301 lost units) from the base_stock, we must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to artificially inflate the target level. I am setting mu_hat = (1+L) * Demand + Phantom_Inventory. With L typically around 3, target demand over (1+3) periods is ~508. Adding 301 units to offset the phantom inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of 809. I will also set L to an explicit 3 to reflect the consistent recent lead time observed from P4, P5, P8, P12, and P15, and use a high recent_N for sigma_hat to account for demand volatility during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 confirmed: Average increased from ~81 to ~127 (+57%). 'Phantom' pipeline inventory (lost orders) remains at 301 units (P2: 151, P6: 150), causing the OR backend to under-order unless mu_hat is manually inflated.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 12, with the average demand for Period 12-16 being approximately 133 units (133, 138, 117, 118, 161). The current observation window shows a sustained increase from the previous baseline of ~80. However, the system's pipeline inventory is severely corrupted by 301 'phantom' units (Period 2: 151 units, Period 6: 150 units) which are over 10 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the target base stock, it will significantly under-order unless we compensate. To override this, I am setting an explicit mu_hat that covers future demand (3 periods: (L+1)) PLUS the 301 lost units. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~400. Adding 301 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 701. This ensures the OR logic (target - pipeline) produces a net order that reflects real demand needs. I'm using L=2 (default) as the recent observed lead times for successful deliveries (P12, P13) were 3 periods, suggesting a safer stock level is needed, and the backend formula incorporates L into the safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Systemic pipeline corruption: 301 units (P2: 151, P6: 150) are confirmed lost and must be offset by manually inflating mu_hat. Current demand regime (P12-P16) average is ~133 units.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 12 remains stable, with an average of approximately 132 units per period (Periods 12-17). However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 578 units is severely compromised by 301 'phantom' units (Period 2: 151 units, Period 6: 150 units) that are confirmed lost as they are far past the observed lead time variance (L=1 to 3). Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory from the calculated base stock, these 301 phantom units prevent necessary ordering. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1)=3 period window using the current mean (~132) plus a safety buffer for high demand volatility (sigma ~ 50), then I add the 301 phantom units. Target Base Stock = (3 * 132) + (1.645 * 50) \u2248 478. Adjusted mu_hat = 478 + 301 = 779. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the pipeline corruption. Lead time is set to 2 to reflect the promised value, while sigma_hat is set to 50 (approx 0.4 * mean) to account for high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Systemic pipeline corruption persists: 301 units (P2: 151, P6: 150) are confirmed lost and must be offset by manually inflating mu_hat to ensure ordering. Demand regime (P12-P17) average is ~132 units.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory issues: 301 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost/missing, which prevents the OR engine from ordering enough units to meet demand. I must manually inflate mu_hat to offset these lost units. The current demand regime (Periods 12-18) shows a stable average of ~133 units [(133+138+117+118+161+124+138)/7]. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. To force an order despite the 301 phantom units, I am using an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: Base Stock Target \u2248 (L+1) * 133 + buffer. With L=3 (to be safe), target = 4 * 133 = 532. However, the pipeline shows 779 units (including 301 phantoms and recent large orders from P15, P17, P18). P15 (224 units) and P18 (201 units) haven't arrived yet. To ensure the backend doesn't halt orders due to the 301-unit phantom inflation, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current regime and the inventory gap.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 12, with demand for the last 8 periods averaging approximately 126 units (P12-P19). Lead times continue to be highly volatile, with recent arrivals taking 1-3 periods and significant evidence of lost shipments. Specifically, the orders from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (150 units), totaling 301 units, are long overdue (18 and 14 periods respectively) and are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' units from the target base stock, these 301 'phantom' units prevent the system from placing necessary orders. At Period 20, on-hand inventory is 0. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 301-unit pipeline corruption, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast + Offset. With L=2, (1+2)*126 = 378. Adding the 301-unit offset to account for phantom inventory results in 679. I will round this to 700 to ensure a robust order is placed to break the stockout cycle. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent higher-demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic pipeline corruption: 301 units (P2: 151, P6: 150) are confirmed lost and must be offset by manually inflating mu_hat to ensure ordering. Demand regime (P12-P19) average is ~126 units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant 'phantom pipeline' issues. Orders from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (150 units) are confirmed lost (L > 18 and L > 14 respectively), totaling 301 units. These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (779 units), causing the OR backend to believe inventory levels are higher than they truly are, which results in under-ordering. To force the backend to place orders despite this 301-unit inflation, I must manually inflate 'mu_hat'. The current demand regime (P12-P20) averages approximately 125 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2 (setting L=2 for a 3-period coverage window), the base stock should be around 375 units plus safety stock. By setting 'mu_hat' to an explicit value of 750, I effectively offset the 301 lost units and ensure the backend triggers a replenishment order to provide 0.95 service level (Profit $1 vs Holding $1 results in a 0.5 critical ratio, but the OR backend uses the formula q = p/(p+h) = 0.5; the 'cap' mechanism uses a 0.95 safety factor). Demand has slightly softened to ~99 avg over the last three periods, but remains in the high-demand regime relative to P1-P11.

Carry-over insight: Persistent phantom pipeline: 301 units (P2: 151, P6: 150) are lost and inflating 'In-transit' count. Demand regime P12-P20 average is ~125 units.

This pipeline is severely corrupted by 'phantom' inventory: the P2 order (151 units) and P6 order (150 units) are long-lost (confirmed across 15+ periods), for a total of 301 units. Additionally, the P15 order (224 units), P17 order (53 units), and P18 order (201 units) are currently delayed or in-transit. Since the OR backend uses the formula [base_stock - pipeline_inventory], the 301 phantom units will prevent any new orders from being placed unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset them. To ensure the backend places an order to meet the current demand (avg 125/period, L=2, so base stock target should be ~375+ safety stock), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target mu_hat as: [(1 + L) * Forecasted Demand] + Phantom Inventory. With L=2 and Forecast=125, the base mu_hat is 375. Adding the 301 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 676. This forces the system to recognize the need for physical stock despite the inflated in-transit count.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P12-P21) average is 121 units (most recent 3 periods show a slight cooling to 95, 95, 90). The phantom pipeline (lost orders P2 and P6) remains 301 units, requiring sustained mu_hat inflation.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a critical 'phantom inventory' issue. Orders from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (150 units), totaling 301 units, are long overdue (20 and 16 periods respectively) and confirmed lost based on historical lead time patterns (max observed L=3). These 301 units are still counted in 'In-transit' inventory (779 units), preventing the OR backend from placing new orders. Demand has cooled slightly from the P12-P20 peak of ~125 to an average of ~91 units over the last 4 periods (P19-P22: 102, 95, 90, 89). Despite the cooling, the priority is to clear the phantom inventory to allow replenishment. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, using a value that satisfies: base_stock > pipeline_inventory. Equation: (1+L)*forecast + 301. With an expected lead time of 2 and average recent demand of 115 (blended forecast), mu_hat = (1+2)*115 + 301 = 646. This forces the system to consider the lost units as satisfied demand that needs replacement.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling: Average demand decreased from ~126 to ~91 (-28%) over Periods 19-22. Phantom pipeline remains at 301 units (P2: 151, P6: 150).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system state reflects a critical combination of stockouts and significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Two historical orders (Period 2: 151 units, Period 6: 150 units, total 301 units) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed, causing the 'In-transit' count (779) to be over-inflated. The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders; therefore, if the pipeline is inflated by 301 non-existent units, the system will under-order by that amount. Demand has recently cooled slightly from its peak (~130 units) to an average of ~98 units over the last 5 periods (P19-P23: 102, 95, 90, 89, 113). To force an order despite the phantom 301 units, I must set mu_hat (which represents total demand over Lead Time + Review Period) to a value that covers the expected pipeline (779 - 301 = 478 effective pipeline) plus desired stock for the next (L+1) periods. With L set to 3 (most common actual lead time), L+1 = 4. Expected demand (4 * 98) = 392. To overcome the 301 phantom units and ensure the backend actually triggers an order, mu_hat must be set to at least (Actual 4-period requirements + 301) = 392 + 301 = 693. I will use 720 to provide a small buffer for variance and the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: Average for P19-P23 is ~98 units, down from the P12-P18 average of ~132 units. Phantom pipeline remains strictly at 301 units (P2: 151, P6: 150).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Demand has spiked again in Period 24 (155 units) after a brief cooling period, bringing the P19-P24 average to approximately 107 units. However, the critical issue is 'pipeline corruption': 301 units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, and several subsequent orders (P15: 224 units, P17: 53 units, P18: 201 units) are now overdue (L > 3), contributing to an inflated 'In-transit' count of 779 units. To force the OR engine to place an order despite this 779-unit phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat (the target level) to exceed the sum of phantom inventory and desired stock levels. To cover (L+1) periods of demand (~3 * 107 = 321) plus the 301 phantom units, a base stock level of at least 622 is needed. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 650 to ensure an order is triggered to break the stockout. Lead time is set to 2 (promised), as manual inflation of mu_hat handles the delay logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility continues: after cooling to ~91, P24 saw a spike to 155 units. Pipeline corruption remains at 301 lost units (P2, P6). Multiple recent orders (P15, P17, P18) are now overdue (L > 6 for P15), suggesting a potential second wave of lost shipments or extreme lead-time drift.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of severe collapse. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 779 units is almost entirely composed of 'phantom' or severely delayed stock. Confirmed losses include P2 (151 units) and P6 (150 units). Furthermore, recent orders from P15 (224 units), P17 (53 units), P18 (201 units), and others have failed to arrive, with P15 now reaching a lead time of 10 periods (L=10). Because the OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' from the target base stock, it has stopped placing new orders (zero orders from P19-P25). To force the system to resume ordering despite the corrupted pipeline, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 3 (reflecting the last successful deliveries) and dramatically inflating mu_hat. The true demand has shifted again: Periods 24 and 25 saw a spike (155, 139), making the recent 5-period average (P21-P25) approximately 117 units. I am setting mu_hat to 1300 to bypass the 779 units in-transit and 0 on-hand, ensuring the backend triggers a maximum replenishment order immediately.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain collapse confirmed: P15 (ordered P15) is now overdue by 8+ periods (L=10 as of P25 conclude). Combined with P2 and P6 losses, the total phantom pipeline inventory is at least 502 units (151+150+224 from P15). Demand has spiked again at P24, with a 2-period average of 147 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of near-collapse with a significant 'phantom pipeline' of lost orders. As of Period 26 conclude, orders from P2 (151 units), P6 (150 units), P15 (224 units), P17 (53 units), and P18 (201 units) are extremely overdue (8-24 periods), implying they are lost. This creates 779 units of 'phantom' inventory in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit 1153 - Recent P26 order 374 = 779). The OR engine subtracts all 1153 units of pipeline from the base stock calculation, which results in zero units ordered unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset these losses. Current demand (P24-P26) averages 131 units. To force an order that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) despite the 779 lost units, I must set mu_hat to approximately (Demand * 3) + Lost Units = (131 * 3) + 779 \u2248 1172. I will set mu_hat to 1200 to ensure the system places an order to replenish the zero on-hand stock. Lead time L is set to explicit 2 to maintain the standard review window while handling the drift via the inflated mu_hat.

Carry-over insight: Systemic pipeline corruption confirmed: Total 'phantom' pipeline (lost orders) estimated at 779 units (P2: 151, P6: 150, P15: 224, P17: 53, P18: 201). These units will likely never arrive but are counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend. Demand regime (P24-P26) average corrected to ~131 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of systemic collapse. As of Period 27 conclude, internal tracking and 'Carry-over insights' confirm that at least 779 units (from periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 18) are effectively lost, yet they remain in the 'In-transit' count (1200 units). Because the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders, it will never place an order while these 'phantom' units dominate the pipeline. Consequently, we have been stocked out for 10 consecutive periods, as evidenced by 'sold=0' and 'ending on-hand inventory=0'. To force the backend to bypass this 1200-unit pipeline and actually order stock, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom pipeline plus the desired safety stock. Demand over the last 4 periods (P24-P27) has averaged ~110 units. Using L=3 as a conservative estimate for actual lead time, the target inventory (base stock) should be around 1400 units to ensure an order is triggered despite the 1200-unit pipeline corruption. Thus, mu_hat is set to 1400 to force replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom/lost pipeline inventory from P2, P6, P15, P17, and P18 is 779 units; however, the state of the In-transit count (1200) suggests earlier orders (like P1, P5) or others may also be permanently stalled. Sustained stockout since P18.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28 conclude, a major shipment of 374 units (ordered P26) finally arrived after a long stockout. However, the system's 'In-transit' count remains at 1026 units, while the true actionable pipeline is significantly lower. Based on history, orders from P2 (151), P6 (150), P15 (224), P17 (53), and P18 (201) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 779 'phantom' units. Subtracting these from the 1026 'In-transit' leaves only 247 units (likely the P27 order of 47 and P28 order of 200) that are actually expected to arrive. Demand has plummeted from a ~130 average to just 10 in Period 28, following a sequence of 101, 43, 10. This suggests a major regime shift or a transition into a low-demand season. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this drop. I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat to offset the 779 phantom units; if I don't, the OR backend (seeing 1026 in-transit vs a low base stock) will stop ordering entirely. I will set mu_hat to approximately (Actual Forecast * (1+L)) + Phantom units = (50 * 3) + 779 \u2248 929. This ensures the system remains capable of ordering if demand recovers while preventing excessive over-ordering given the current high on-hand stock (364).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: Demand dropped significantly (101 -> 43 -> 10). Total phantom pipeline inventory (lost orders) confirmed at 779 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-233.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significant cooling phase, with Period 28 recording only 10 units and Period 29 showing 89 units. The average for the last three periods (P27-P29) is ~47 units, a sharp drop from the previous high-demand regime (~130 units). Supply chain volatility remains extreme: we recently received orders from P26 and P27 with a lead time of 2 periods, but the 'phantom pipeline' of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18) continues to corrupt the 'In-transit' count, which stands at 979. Excluding these 779 units, the 'real' in-transit is likely 200 units (from P28). On-hand inventory is healthy at 322 units. Given the low current demand and high on-hand stock, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the downswing, and sigma_hat using recent_N of 5 to account for the recent volatility. No further orders are currently needed, and the backend capped policy will likely suppress ordering given the current stock levels and 'In-transit' bloat.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: Average demand dropped from ~130 to ~47 (-64%) over Periods 27-29. Phantom pipeline remains at 779 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has transitioned from a severe supply chain crisis to a period of inventory recovery and demand stabilization. Significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains (779 units from lost orders in P2, P6, P15, P17, P18), which the OR backend incorrectly counts as incoming supply. However, recent orders from Period 26, 27, and 28 have arrived on time (L=2), restoring on-hand inventory to 451 units. Demand has stabilized following the Period 27 drop, with the latest three periods (P28-P30) averaging approximately 57 units (10, 89, 71). Given that current on-hand inventory (451) is sufficient to cover more than 7 periods of current demand, and the 'In-transit' count (779) is composed entirely of lost orders that will trigger a massive under-order once on-hand is depleted, I will set parameters to prevent further ordering while inventory is high. I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the post-drop demand regime (Avg ~53). No order is expected to be placed by the backend because on-hand (451) >> base_stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27 confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~130 to ~53 units. Supply chain has stabilized with L=2 for the last 3 arrivals, though the 779-unit phantom pipeline persists.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a massive 'phantom pipeline' of 779 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, and P18) that are permanently lost but remains visible as 'In-transit' to the OR backend. This causes the backend to under-order because it believes these units will arrive. However, recent supply chain performance has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods for the last three arrivals (P26, P27, P28). On-hand inventory is currently high at 394 units due to recent large orders arriving alongside a demand cooling. Demand has shifted from a high regime (~130 units) to a new, lower regime starting around P27; the last five periods (P27-P31) average ~54 units. With on-hand inventory (394) and high phantom pipeline (779), the current base stock will prevent further ordering. I will adjust parameters to reflect the new, lower demand regime (N=5) and set L to 2 to match recent observations. To eventually clear the phantom pipeline effect, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat based on the lower demand, although the internal logic will likely result in an order of 0 this period as we wind down the excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27 confirmed: New average demand is ~54 units (Periods 27-31). Supply chain lead time has returned to the promised 2 periods (L=2) for recent deliveries.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 27. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P27-P32) is approximately 48.7 units (43, 10, 89, 71, 57, 22), confirming a stabilization at a lower level compared to the previous peak. Lead times have also stabilized back to the promised 2 periods for the most recent three successfully delivered orders (P26, P27, P28). However, the systemic issue remains: the 'In-transit' count is 779 units, which precisely matches the sum of identified lost/phantom orders (P2: 151, P6: 150, P15: 224, P17: 53, P18: 201). Because the OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' from its target base stock, it will continue to order 0 units as long as 'on-hand + 779' exceeds the target. With 372 units currently on-hand, there is sufficient stock for the next few periods (covering ~7-8 periods of current demand). To prevent permanent stockouts once on-hand is depleted, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' and significantly inflated to exceed the phantom 779 units. Given L=2, the total coverage needed is (L+1) * demand. Target base stock should be (3 * 50) + safety stock (approx 200). To trigger an order despite the 779-unit phantom pipeline, mu_hat must be set at least high enough so that base_stock > 779 + on-hand. Since we currently have excess inventory (372 units), I will set mu_hat conservatively to avoid excessive holding costs while monitoring the depletion of on-hand stock.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 27. The average demand for the last seven periods (P27-P33) is approximately 51.6 units (43, 10, 89, 71, 57, 22, 67). The supply chain appears to have stabilized with recent lead times hitting the promised 2 periods (P28, P29, and P30 concludes showed L=2). However, the 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains a critical issue. The system reports 779 units in-transit, which are confirmed lost orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 18. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' from the target base stock, it will not place any new orders as long as 305 (on-hand) + 779 (phantom in-transit) exceeds the base stock. To prevent future stockouts when on-hand inventory is depleted, I must inflate mu_hat to offset these 779 lost units. The required base stock should be (L+1)*Demand_Avg + Z*Sigma + 779. With Demand_Avg ~ 52 and L=2, the normal mu_hat would be ~156. Adding 779 results in a target mu_hat of ~935. This ensures the OR engine 'sees' a need to order despite the corruption.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~52 units/period since P27. Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 779 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18) and must be manually offset by inflating mu_hat.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~52 units since the regime shift at Period 27 (P27-P34 average: 51.6 units). Recent lead times have returned to the promised 2 periods (L=2). However, there is a systemic issue with the 'In-transit' accounting. As documented in previous periods, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, and P18 (totaling 779 units) are effectively lost but still appear in the pipeline inventory count. The current 'In-transit' observation is exactly 779, confirming that these lost units are the only items the OR engine sees as 'incoming'. Because the backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to calculate new orders, it will conclude that no new inventory is needed (since pipeline 779 > base_stock). To force the engine to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be inflated to offset these 779 phantom units. Current on-hand inventory is 243, which provides ~4-5 periods of coverage. I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to include the 779 phantom units plus the forecasted demand for (L+1) periods (approx 52 * 3 = 156), totaling 935. This ensures the backend recognizes a need for replenishment as on-hand inventory depletes, while sigma_hat remains based on recent demand volatility (N=8).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 27 has stabilized around an average of 52 units per period (P27-P35: 43, 10, 89, 71, 57, 22, 67, 62, 58). The 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains at 779 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, and P18), which the OR backend perceives as incoming stock. With 185 units on-hand and 779 units in 'phantom' in-transit, the system counts 964 units of pipeline inventory. To trigger any new orders, the base stock (mu_hat) must exceed this phantom total. Since the current demand is low (~52/period) and on-hand inventory is sufficient for the next 3 periods, I am maintaining a strategy of inflating mu_hat only enough to offset the phantom units if inventory was low, but since on-hand is currently 185 (approx 3.5 periods of supply), I will set mu_hat to cover the current stabilized demand plus the phantom offset to ensure the replenishment logic remains active once on-hand drops further.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 27, following a significant drop from the ~130 level. The average demand for the most recent 10 periods (P27-P36) is approximately 61 units per period. The supply chain has also stabilized, with the last three recorded deliveries (Periods 28, 29, and 30) arriving exactly on the promised 2-period lead time. However, the 'In-transit' count is severely corrupted by 779 units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18) that will never arrive. Because the backend calculates the order as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and the pipeline inventory (779) is much higher than any reasonable base stock, the system will never place a new order unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset these phantom units. To ensure the system orders enough to cover the current demand regime (~61 units/period), mu_hat is set using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Demand + Phantom Units = (1 + 2) * 61 + 779 = 183 + 779 = 962. This allows the OR engine to 'see' through the lost inventory and maintain a sufficient on-hand balance.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 after a demand spike in Period 37 (120 units) and Period 36 (90 units). The demand regime for Periods 27-35 was approximately 52 units, but the last two periods suggest an upward shift (Avg = 105). The system still carries a 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 779 units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). These units will never arrive but are subtracted from the base stock calculation by the OR backend. To force a new order when in-transit (867) > base stock, mu_hat must be significantly inflated. I will set mu_hat to cover the phantom inventory (779) plus the lead-time demand for the current regime (~105 demand * (L+1=3) = 315), totaling 1094. This ensures the OR engine places an order to restock on-hand inventory. Lead time for recent successful arrivals has stabilized at 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: Average demand increased from ~52 to ~105 (+100%) based on the last 2 periods. Phantom pipeline inventory remains 779 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards at Period 36, with recent demands of 90, 120, and 95 (average ~102). This is a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~54. The supply chain has a massive 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 779 units (from lost orders in P2, P6, P15, P17, P18) that the OR backend considers 'In-transit' but will never arrive. Current 'In-transit' is 1094, meaning 779/1094 units are lost. To force the backend to place orders despite this 779-unit inflated pipeline, mu_hat must be set to a value exceeding the phantom inventory plus expected demand. For Period 39, with a lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage), expected demand is ~306 units. To offset 779 lost units, mu_hat is set explicitly to 1100 (approximately 779 + 306). L is set to 'default' as recent successful deliveries (P28, P29, P30) arrived with L=2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed: Average shifted from ~54 to ~102 (+89%). Supply chain stabilized at L=2 for recent deliveries, but 779 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory remain.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 36, with the average demand for the last four periods (P36-P39) being approximately 105.5 units (90, 120, 95, 117). This confirms the 'Period 39' carry-over insight of a ~102-105 unit regime. Lead times have stabilized significantly in recent periods (P26, P27, P28, P38 all arrived within 1-2 periods), however, the 'phantom pipeline' of 779 lost units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18) still exists in the 'In-transit' count (873 units). Subtracting the 779 lost units, the 'real' pipeline is roughly 94 units (close to the P37 order of 88 + P39 order of 6). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 779 phantom units as available stock and thus under-ordering, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2: $(1+L) \times Demand \approx 3 \times 105.5 = 316.5$. To offset the 779 units already in 'In-transit', I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 779' provides enough order signal. However, since the OR engine's order logic is `base_stock - pipeline`, I will use an explicit `mu_hat` that incorporates the expected demand plus the phantom inventory buffer to force the order. I set mu_hat to 1095 ($316 + 779$) to ensure the 'real' base stock remains around 316 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 36 has stabilized at a higher level, with an average of approximately 104 units (P36-P40: 90, 120, 95, 117, 99). The phantom pipeline inventory (lost orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18) totals 779 units. These 779 units are counted in the 'In-transit' total of 867 but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this inflated pipeline count, I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The formula used is: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Phantom_Units. With L=1 (recent performance) or L=2 (promised), I will use L=2 for safety. Calculation: (1 + 2) * 104 + 779 = 312 + 779 = 1091. This ensures the base stock (mu_hat + safety stock) outweighs the 867 units currently in transit.

The demand regime shifted around Period 36, increasing from ~52 to approximately 100 units per period. The average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P36-P41) is ~98.3. Pipeline corruption remains a critical issue: as of Period 41 conclude, the 'In-transit' count is 1074 units, but based on historical analysis, 779 units are definitively lost (P2: 151, P6: 150, P15: 224, P17: 53, P18: 201). Additionally, the order from P37 (88 units) is now overdue (L > 4), suggesting it might also be lost or severely delayed. To force the OR backend to order despite these 'phantom' units inflating the pipeline count, mu_hat must be set to a value that covers (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the total lost inventory (~867 units). With L=2 and mean demand ~100, the baseline mu_hat would be 300; adding the 867 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1167. This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat - pipeline) triggers a sufficient order to meet actual consumption.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total phantom pipeline inventory increased to 867 units as Period 37 order (88 units) is now overdue by 4+ periods (L > 4), likely lost alongside previous 779-unit total.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory, where units marked as 'In-transit' are lost and will never arrive. As of Period 42, the total estimated lost inventory is 867 units (P2: 151, P6: 150, P15: 224, P17: 53, P18: 201, P37: 88). This causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order size because it believes there is sufficient stock arriving. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand shifted around Period 36 to a higher regime (P36-P41 average ~98 units), though P42 inexplicably recorded 0 demand. To force the backend to place orders despite the 1167 'In-transit' units, mu_hat must be significantly inflated. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 1500 to overcome the phantom pipeline and ensure a safety buffer, while keeping L at the promised 2 periods as recent successful deliveries (P38, P39) arrived quickly.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 867 units as of Period 42 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P37). High mu_hat inflation is required to bypass 'In-transit' corruption.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised by phantom pipeline inventory. As of Period 43 conclude, 867 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P37) are confirmed lost/overdue and likely will never arrive, yet they remain in the OR backend's 'In-transit' calculation. The current 'In-transit' count is 1500, meaning approximately 42% (633 units) are actually expected to arrive, while 58% (867 units) are phantom. In the last three periods (P41-P43), demand dropped to zero, but the historical regime for Period 36-40 was ~104 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1500 'In-transit' units, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than 'In-transit + On-hand'. With On-hand at 0 and In-transit at 1500, plus a buffer for demand, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 1800. This overcomes the phantom inventory trap and ensures the store is restocked to meet potential recovering demand. Lead time L is set to 2 as recent successful deliveries (P38, P39) arrived in 1 period, returning to the promised performance level.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 867 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P37). Continuous mu_hat inflation is required to bypass 'In-transit' corruption. Demand has been zero for the last three periods (P41-P43), suggesting either a local demand collapse or a tracking anomaly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-125.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from extreme pipeline corruption and erratic lead times. Current on-hand inventory is 166 units, but the 'In-transit' count (1593) is heavily inflated by lost orders. Confirmed losses/phantom inventory include: P2 (151), P6 (150), P15 (224), P17 (53), P18 (201), and P37 (88), totaling 867 units. This phantom inventory prevents the OR backend's base-stock logic from ordering unless mu_hat is manually inflated to exceed the (on-hand + in-transit) sum. Demand showed a temporary zero-period anomaly (P41-P43) but returned to 41 units in P44. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime (~80-100 units) plus the total 867 units of phantom inventory to ensure consistent replenishment. Observed lead times for recent arrivals (P26, P27, P28, P38, P39, P41) were 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3 respectively, making L=2 a reasonable estimate.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 867 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P37). Demand returned to 41 units in P44 after a 3-period zero-demand reporting gap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-338.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility. After a reporting gap with zero demand in P41-P43, demand returned to 41 units (P44) and spiked to 127 units (P45). Calculating the average of the last 10 periods (excluding the zeroes) results in approx. 82 units. The lead time has stabilized between 2 and 3 periods for recent successful arrivals. However, the 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains the primary challenge: 867 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P37) are recorded as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost. With current on-hand inventory at 465 units and a 'corrupted' in-transit total of 1167 units, the OR backend sees 1632 units available, which is far above the base stock requirement. To force the OR engine to place orders for the final periods (knowing we must cover roughly 82 units/period), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To bypass the 867-unit phantom gap, I calculate the target base stock (Demand * (L+1)) and add the phantom units: (82 * 3) + 867 = 1113. This ensures the backend recognizes a need for stock despite the fake pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Total phantom pipeline inventory (lost units) remains at 867 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P37). All ordering decisions must manually offset this value to bypass the 'In-transit' corruption.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-305.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we are managing a severe supply chain distortion. The 'In-transit' inventory of 1167 units is heavily 'corrupted' by lost shipments (867 units from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P37). Because the OR backend subtracts the 'In-transit' count from its target base stock, it will stop ordering entirely unless we manually bypass these 'lost' units by inflating mu_hat. Demand has stabilized into a regime of approximately 82 units per period (averaging P44: 41, P45: 127, P46: 80). Since the total horizon is 50 periods and current on-hand is 385 (covering ~4.7 periods of demand), we have sufficient stock for the remaining 4 periods. However, to ensure the backend continues to function correctly and doesn't get stuck in a permanent under-ordering state due to the phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover the phantom units plus a safety buffer. For L, although the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3; 'calculate' is used to reflect this historical reality. Sigma_hat is set to 30 to account for recent demand volatility (41 to 127).

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Confirmed that phantom pipeline inventory (lost units) of 867 units remains in 'In-transit', requiring mu_hat inflation to avoid ordering paralysis. Recent demand average (P44-P46) is ~82.6 units.

Daily Profit: $78.00, Daily Holding Cost: $307.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-229.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 48, demand is in a stable post-spike regime averaging approximately 82 units (P44-P47). The supply chain remains heavily corrupted by 867 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (lost orders: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P37) that reside in 'In-transit' but will never arrive. Although current on-hand inventory is 307 units, the backend pipeline count (1167) causes it to believe the system is overstocked, preventing new orders. To counteract this, I will set L to 'default' (2) and mu_hat using 'explicit' at 1,200. This value is derived by taking the required base stock for (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods * 82 units = 246) and adding the 867 units of phantom inventory to trigger the backend to order if on-hand levels drop further. Since we are near the end of the game (P48 of 50) and current on-hand (307) covers expected demand for the remaining 3 periods, no large new orders are strictly necessary, but mu_hat inflation ensures the OR engine doesn't paralyze if demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Total phantom pipeline inventory remains at 867 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P37). Current demand regime (P44-P47) average is 81.5 units, significantly lower than the previous spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-71.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a regime following a return from a reporting anomaly (Periods 41-43), with a recent average (Periods 44-48) of approximately 88.8 units. The supply chain is still afflicted by a massive 'phantom pipeline' of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P37) totaling 867 units. These units are visible in the 'In-transit' count (1167 total) but will likely never arrive. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this inventory as valid and refusing to order, I must manually inflate mu_hat. By setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 1167 (current pipeline) + 300 (to cover roughly 3 periods of 100 units/period demand), I ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the phantom pipeline, triggering necessary procurement. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual historical average, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current volatility in demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are managing a situation where the In-transit inventory (1278 units) is heavily corrupted by 867 units of confirmed 'phantom' pipeline (lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P37). The actual physical pipeline consists of orders from P44 (300 units) and P49 (111 units). The P44 order (ordered 300) is now due (L=2 promised, currently entering L=6 if lead time is measured from order to observation). However, recent lead times for successful arrivals (P41, P42, P43) have been 2-3 periods. The current demand regime (P45-P49) shows an average of ~109 units (127, 80, 78, 118, 141), confirming a shift upward from the P44 low. To ensure the OR engine orders despite the 867 phantom units in 'In-transit', I must manually inflate mu_hat. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 1200 (approx. (1+2)*110 + 867) to bypass the corruption and target a base stock that accounts for the current demand of ~110 units while treating the lost 867 units as non-existent. L is set to calculate to reflect the historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 867 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P37). Demand regime (P45-P49) average is ~109 units. Order from P44 (300 units) is currently overdue (L=6), adding risk of further pipeline corruption.
