Given the variance in the historical samples (low of 75, high of 138), I will aim for a slightly higher inventory position to avoid stockouts while being mindful of the $1 holding cost.

Actually, reviewing the history, the 200 units in-transit must be a display of a pending order or a system update; looking closely at the 'Action' history, no orders were placed in P13, P14, P15, or P16. Therefore, the 200 'In-transit' units are likely erroneous or represent a very old lost order (from P6). With 222 units on hand and a demand forecast of ~130, I have coverage for about 1.7 periods.

However, the broader trend (P37-P46) suggests a mean of ~130 units. Period 47 showed a significant dip (76 units), which might be noise or a downward shift. I will forecast a conservative mean of 120 units for the final periods.\n\n2. **Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand inventory is 0.

The reliable active pipeline consists of orders from P44 (150 units), P45 (150 units), P46 (150 units), and P47 (150 units).\n\n3. **Lead Time Inference**: Observed lead times recently have been 2-3 periods (P40-P43 arrived in 3 periods). \n   - The P44 order (150 units) is due in Period 46 or 47; its absence at the start of P48 suggests it may arrive during P48 or P49 (LT 4 or 5), or it is lost. \n   - The P45 order (150 units) is due in Period 47 or 48. \n\n4. **Final Strategy**: Since we are at P48, only orders placed now (P48) can arrive by P49 (LT 1) or P50 (LT 2). Orders placed in P49 could only arrive in P50 if LT=1. Orders placed in P50 will never arrive before the game ends.
