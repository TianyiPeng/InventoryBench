To satisfy demand for the lead time duration (P1, P2, and P3) and ensure stock is available for P4, I must account for 4 periods of demand. Given the average demand of 116 units/period, the total requirement for the lead time plus one review period is approximately 464 units. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, I will place an initial order of 464 units to establish a pipeline and reach a target stock level that covers potential variance while balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.",

The Period 1 demand (131) aligns with this average. To maintain a safety stock and cover demand for the (L+1) window (Periods 2, 3, and 4), I need to assess total pipeline needs. Cumulative expected demand for Periods 1-4 is roughly 464 units (116 * 4). Since 464 units are already in transit to arrive in Period 3, I have enough coming to cover the initial start-up phase. However, to ensure I don't run out in Period 5 (which requires an order now at Period 2 due to L=2), I will place an order for one period of average demand (approx 120 units).

However, the system suffers from frequent 'lost' shipments (P17-19, P24-25, P29, P30, P33, P37). The shipment from P40 (250 units) is expected to arrive during P41 or P42 (L=1 or 2). Since P41 conclude showed no arrival, the P40 order is highly likely to arrive in Period 42. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0.

To cover demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods) at a rate of 135 units/period, I need a target inventory of roughly 405 units. My current reliable pipeline (400) almost covers this, but given the high profitability ($4) vs holding cost ($1) and the frequent loss of shipments, a small replenishment is necessary to maintain a buffer and ensure availability in P43-P44.",

I expect P44 and P45 arrivals to occur during Period 48 or 49.

Total demand remaining is ~380 units. Reliable pipeline (P44-P47) is 500 units. Adding more orders now is risky due to holding costs and the game ending at P50; however, to prevent a stockout in P48/49 if P44/45 are lost, a small safety order is prudent.
