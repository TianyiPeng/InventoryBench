Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (seeds) are: 80, 120, 120, 93, 177. The mean of these samples is 118, and the standard deviation is approximately 36.8. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To ensure adequate stock covers both the current period and the lead-time periods (L+1 = 3), I will use the 'default' methods which will calculate the base stock using the mean and standard deviation of all available historical samples. There are no observed lead times yet, so L will default to the promised value of 2. The backend OR logic will calculate mu_hat as (1+2)*mean and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+2)*std.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Our first order of 180 units was placed in Period 1 and is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Consequently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 180 units in transit. Demand in Period 1 was 102 units, which was lost as we had no stock. Historical demand samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) suggest a mean of approximately 118 units per period. With L=2, the total demand over the (L+1) horizon (Period 2, 3, and 4) is roughly 118 * 3 = 354 units. Our current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is only 180 units. Therefore, we need to set parameters that encourage the OR engine to place a significant order this period to cover the upcoming demand before the stock arrives. We will use the 'default' method for L (2 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and sigma, as the small sample size is best captured by using all available history.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (180 units) and Period 2 (177 units) are in-transit, totaling 357 units. According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (making it visible in the Period 4 start message). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales for Period 1 and 2. Recent demand (102, 147) is higher than the initial historical samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177). I will use a short-window recent_N (N=3) to capture this upward movement in demand and volatility, ensuring the base stock level targets the current trend rather than the flatter history. Lead time L is set to default (2), as we have not yet reached the point where the first order is overdue.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (180 units) were expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclusion. However, the history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3. Currently, 534 units are in-transit (180 from P1, 177 from P2, 177 from P3). The lack of arrivals for the Period 1 order (placed at P1, expected arrival P3, observation P4) suggests a delay or a lead time longer than the promised 2. However, it is only 1 period past the expected arrival for the P1 order. The demand has been volatile: 102, 147, 73 (and external samples 80, 120, 120, 93, 177). Average demand is approximately 114. Given the stockout (on-hand is 0), the priority is ensuring enough pipeline to cover the lead time. I will maintain the base lead time of 2 for now but use recent history for demand estimation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2523.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order (180 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3). Period 3's order (177 units) also arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). Period 2's order of 177 is notably missing/overdue (promised L=2, now at P5). The current on-hand inventory is 213, with 177 units in-transit (from Period 2). Demand has been: P1=102, P2=147, P3=73, P4=144. Average demand is approx 116.5. Lead times are volatile (1 and 3). Given the missed shipment from P2, I will set L to 3 to be conservative. I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current average and sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2267.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we have 89 units on-hand and 352 units in-transit. Looking at the history, the lead time has been inconsistent: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), while Period 3's order also arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. Demand over the last 5 periods has been: 102, 147, 73, 144, 124 (Mean \u2248 118). Period 2's order of 177 units is currently overdue (placed in P2, promised P4, currently P6), or potentially lost. Period 5's order of 175 units is expected in P7 or P8. Given the current on-hand inventory (89) is less than the recent average demand (~118), and there's a risk of shipment loss or delay, I will set L to the promised 2 periods but use a recent_N window of 5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current consumption rate. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a conservative safety buffer given the supply instability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1691.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is depleted (0 units) following a stockout in Period 6. Historical demand for the first 6 periods shows an average of ~114.5 units per period. Lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3's arrived in 1 period, averaging 2 periods which aligns with the promised lead time. Currently, 358 units are in-transit (orders from Period 2, 5, and 6). To recover service level and account for the current stockout, I will use recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture the recent mean of ~114 units/period and the observed variance. L is set to default (2).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout after demand (97 in P6, 64 in P7) exceeded on-hand inventory. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are volatile (3 periods for P1 order, 1 period for P3 order). This suggests a 'calculate' method for L to capture the historical average. Historical demand samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) and game history (102, 147, 73, 144, 124, 97, 64) show a mean of approximately 114 units. Given the recent stockouts, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average 101.2) to stay responsive to current levels, while ensuring the z-score logic handles service level. Pipeline inventory (427) is high due to recent orders still in transit, but on-hand is zero, requiring a conservative base stock parameterization to ensure we recover from the stockout as shipments arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $936.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the on-hand inventory is 185 units. Analysis of the arrivals shows significant lead-time variability: P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), P3 arrived in P4 (L=1), P5 arrived in P8 (L=3), and P7 arrived in P8 (L=1). Every second order arrives in 1 period, while the ones in between take 3 periods. This suggests an average lead time of 2 periods, but with high variance. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has fluctuated: P1-P4 averaged 116.5, while P5-P8 averaged 86. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the lower demand trend. For L, I will use 'calculate' to let the engine use the average of the observed lead times (which are 3, 1, 3, 1, avg=2.0). Sigma_hat will be set to 'default' to account for the overall demand volatility observed across the history.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is inconsistent, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2). Demand regime slowed down starting Period 5, averaging ~86 units compared to ~116 earlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $969.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a steady demand regime since Period 7, with the last three periods averaging 61.6 units (compared to the overall average of ~97). The lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, though the most recent arrival (ordered P8, arrived P9 conclude) confirmed a lead time of 1. Because the promised lead time is 2, and we see arrivals at L=1 and L=3, the average L is indeed 2. Currently, on-hand (209) plus in-transit (189) totals 398 units. At the current demand rate (~62/period), this covers over 6 periods of supply. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the lower demand of ~62 units/period, and set L=2. The high pipeline relative to demand will cause the OR backend to naturally taper ordering to avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for the variable lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a lower level from Period 7-9: avg 62 units (approx 45% reduction from initial stages). Lead time remains erratic (1 vs 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2571.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that demand has been highly variable recently, with a sharp spike to 139 units in Period 10 after a period of lower demand (averaging ~62). The initial demand regime (Periods 1-5) averaged ~118 units, while Periods 6-10 averaged ~84.2 units. The lead time is confirmed as inconsistent, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Recent arrivals: P8 order arrived P9 (LT=1), P5 order arrived P8 (LT=3), P7 order arrived P8 (LT=1)). Current on-hand inventory is 70 units, and there are 189 units in transit (177 from P2, 6 from P6, 6 from P9). Notably, the P2 order is significantly overdue (9 periods since order), suggesting it might be lost. To avoid over-ordering based on potentially lost stock, I am treating the pipeline cautiously. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent average of ~84 units and 'calculate' for L to account for the erratic 1-3 period lead time variability. This approach maintains a buffer for the recent demand spike while acknowledging the lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Period 6-10 average demand is 84.4 units, a decrease from Period 1-5 average of 118 units, despite a Period 10 spike. Lead time is confirmed as volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods. Order from Period 2 (177 units) is now 9 periods old and likely lost.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are at zero on-hand inventory. The lead time is confirmed as volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2), although we have seen a 1-period delivery for the Order 8. The shipment from Period 2 (177 units) is now 10 periods old and effectively lost; it must be excluded from pipeline calculations (which the backend treats as 'in-transit'). Since the 'In-transit' count is 330 units (Order 6=6, Order 9=6, Order 11=141, and likely the lost Order 2=177), we recognize that 177 units of the current pipeline are phantom. To compensate for the lost stock and ensure the next orders cover the demand across the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (total 3 periods), I will use 'recent_N' for demand based on the last 5 periods (P7-P11 average approx 94) to capture the recent volatility/regime. Using L=2 (default) reflects the average promised and observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Order placed in Period 2 (177 units) is lost (10 periods elapsed). Pipeline inventory currently contains 177 'phantom' units that will never arrive.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory is 0. The current in-transit inventory of 372 includes a likely lost shipment of 177 units from Period 2 (now 11 periods overdue). Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 372 - 177 = 195 units. Historical demand analysis shows a shift from Period 6 onwards. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 94 units, but including P7-P12 (a more stable lower regime context), it averages 89 units. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this lower demand regime. Lead time behavior is volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of 2, so using 'calculate' (all-time average) is the most robust approach to dampen these fluctuations. I choose N=6 for sigma_hat as well to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Refined effective pipeline: Total In-transit (372) contains 177 units from Period 2 confirmed as lost. Effective pipeline is 195 units. Demand regime (P7-P12) average is 89 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 426 units in-transit. However, historical data and carry-over insights confirm that the order of 177 units from Period 2 is lost (12 periods elapsed without arrival). Therefore, the effective in-transit quantity is 249 units (426 - 177). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (Periods 10-13) averages 111.25 units, showing an upward trend compared to the earlier mid-game lull. Because the OR backend cannot account for lost shipments, it believes the pipeline is fuller than it is. To compensate for the 177-unit shortfall in the backend's calculation, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (1+L)*demand + sigma buffer. With L=2 (promised), effective lead time is 3 periods. 3 periods * 111.25 units = 333.75. To force the OR engine to order despite the 'phantom' 177 units, I will set mu_hat to approximately 334 + 177 = 511. This ensures the OR logic 'base_stock - pipeline' (where pipeline = 426) results in an order that accounts for the lost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed effective pipeline is In-transit - 177 (lost Period 2 order). Current demand trend (P10-P13) has increased to ~111 units/period.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 38. The In-transit total is 457 units, but this includes 177 units from Period 2 confirmed as lost several periods ago. Therefore, the actual effective pipeline is 280 units (457 - 177). Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat to adjust for this 177-unit shortfall. Demand has trended higher recently (P10-P14 average ~110), so I am forecasting demand at 110 units/period. Over the lead time (L=2) and review period (1), this constitutes (1+2)*110 = 330 units. To compensate for the 177-unit phantom inventory in the OR pipeline calculation (which would cause under-ordering), I add 177 to my base stock requirement. Targeting 330 + 177 = 507 for mu_hat. I will use 'calculate' for L as the average lead time (alternating 1 and 3) remains 2. Sigma_hat is set to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed effective pipeline is In-transit - 177 units (confirmed lost Period 2 order). Recent demand (P10-P14) has stabilized at a higher average of ~110 units/period.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 25 units on-hand and 487 units in-transit. However, the order from Period 2 (177 units) is confirmed lost, as it is now 14 periods overdue. The 'Effective Pipeline' is therefore 487 - 177 = 310 units. Recent demand (Periods 10-15) has been somewhat volatile but averages 101.5 units, which is a shift from the previous lower regime. The observed lead times alternate between 1 and 3 periods, maintaining an average close to the promised 2. Using N=6 for demand (capturing the recent shift to ~100) and the default lead time (which captures the average behavior) will lead to a base stock target that accounts for 3 periods of demand ((1+L) * mu). The OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will use the full 487 in-transit. To compensate for the 177 'phantom' units that will never arrive, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock should be (1+L) * demand_forecast + sigma_offset. With L=2 and forecast=102, target is ~306. Since the OR engine subtracts 487, but the real pipeline is 310, it will under-order unless mu_hat is inflated. To make (mu_hat - 487) = (306 - 310), mu_hat needs to be approximately 483. This forces the engine to recognize the need for more stock despite the phantom inventory.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 0 and a reported in-transit of 483 units. However, previous insights confirm that the 177 units ordered in Period 2 are lost, making the effective pipeline inventory 306 units (483 - 177). The lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average is 2). Demand has recently stabilized at a higher level; the average demand from Period 10 to 16 is ~106.4 units per period. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' as reported, I must compensate for the 177-unit 'phantom' inventory by increasing the mu_hat parameter to ensure an order is triggered. Setting L=2 (promised/average) and mu_hat using 'explicit' to account for (1+L)*demand + lost units: (1+2)*106.4 + 177 \u2248 496. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the inflated pipeline total.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Effective pipeline confirmed as total In-transit - 177 units (confirmed lost P2 order). Demand regime (P10-P16) average is 106.4 units.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Period 10-17) shows a shift towards an average of approximately 109 units per period, with Period 17 sales being 116 units. The lead time continues to be erratic, frequently alternating between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting a 3-period buffer is necessary to avoid stockouts. A critical factor is the 'lost' order from Period 2 (177 units). While the backend sees 'In-transit: 355', the true pipeline is only 178 units (355 - 177). To compensate for this 177-unit shortfall in the backend's base-stock logic (which doesn't know about the lost status), I will set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock for L=2 (meaning L+1=3 periods of demand) plus the compensation for the lost shipment: Mean demand forecast (110) * (2+1) = 330 units. Adding the 177 lost units to ensure the order is actually placed: 330 + 177 = 507. This adjusts the backend's calculation so the resulting order covers the 3-period demand horizon despite the phantom inventory entry.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 8. Total in-transit is 477. However, 177 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost (16 periods spent in-transit), making the effective pipeline 300 units (Orders from P15, P17, P18). Lead times remain highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue using an explicit lead time of 2 (the promised average) while adjusting mu_hat to handle the uncertainty. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime since Period 10. The average demand from Period 10 to Period 18 is 106.88 units per period. I will use N=9 for mu_hat to reflect this current regime. Because of the volatility and the risk of lost orders or 3-period lead times, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to provide enough safety stock and ensure the OR backend covers the pipeline lead-time cycle, while accounting for the 177 'phantom' units that the OR engine incorrectly believes are arriving.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high stockout risk with 0 on-hand inventory. The available in-transit total of 561 units includes 177 units from Period 2 that are confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 384 units (561 - 177). Lead times have been highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods; I will use L=3 to ensure the base stock covers the longer end of the uncertainty. Demand has entered a higher-intensity regime starting around Period 10. The average demand from Period 10 to 19 (last 10 periods) is approximately 111 units per period. Using N=10 for mu_hat will capture this sustained higher demand level while smoothing out the noise from the Period 19 spike (145 units) and the lower Period 15 (61 units). I will set sigma_hat using N=10 to account for the increased volatility seen in recent periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and 561 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the order placed in Period 2 (177 units) is definitely lost (19 periods elapsed). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 561 - 177 = 384 units. Recent lead times consistently alternate between 1 and 3 periods (average 2), but a string of recent orders (P18, P19) has not yet arrived, suggesting we are in a 'long' cycle (LT=3). I will set L to 3 to ensure coverage across the potential delay. Demand from Period 10-20 has averaged approximately 110.5 units per period. I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture this regime (mu_hat). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will see an effective pipeline of 384 units against a base stock target designed to cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand, compensating for the stockout at Period 20.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Effective pipeline remains In-transit minus 177 units (confirmed lost P2 order). Demand regime (P10-P20) is stable at an average of 110.5 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are facing an recurring stockout (on-hand: 0). The core issue is the lead-time volatility (alternating between 1 and 3 periods) compounded by a confirmed lost shipment (177 units from Period 2). The 'In-transit' figure of 561 includes those 177 'phantom' units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 384 units (561 - 177). Demands from P18-P21 (averaging 107 units) have depleted our on-hand stock because orders from P18, P19, and P21 have not arrived yet. Since the promised lead time is 2 but the actual lead time fluctuates, I will set L to 'calculate' (average of historical observations) to acknowledge this variability. Demand for the recent regime (P10-P21) is stable around 107 units. To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders to cover the demand across the lead time despite the 'phantom' units sitting in the pipeline total, I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set a robust base stock that accounts for the current 0 on-hand situation and the pipeline delay.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23, on-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 561 units, which includes 177 units from Period 2 confirmed as lost (10+ periods elapsed). The effective pipeline is 384 units (561 - 177). No shipments have arrived in the last 5 periods (P18-P22), despite orders placed in P15, P17, P18, and P19. Lead times are highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with recent evidence suggesting a clustering of arrivals followed by dry spells. The demand regime from P10-P22 is stable at an average of 105.5 units (P10-P20 was ~110, recent P21-P22 was slightly lower). Using recent_N=13 for mu_hat captures this stable regime across (1+L) periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=13 to account for the consistent volatility around this mean. Lead time L is set to calculated to reflect the alternating 1 and 3-period pattern, though the current lack of arrivals suggests we are heading towards the upper end of that range.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to manage the base stock policy for chips(Regular). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total In-transit inventory is 561 units. However, consistent history (see Carry-over Insights) confirms that the 177 units ordered in Period 2 are lost, as they have not arrived for 21 periods. Additionally, the orders from Period 15 (78 units), Period 17 (94 units), Period 18 (122 units), and Period 19 (84 units) have not arrived yet. Since the normal lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, these are now overdue (P15 is 8 periods old, P17 is 6 periods old, etc.). This suggests a major logistics delay or further losses. The effective pipeline (units expected to arrive) is 561 (In-transit) - 177 (Lost P2) = 384 units. However, the last arrival was on Period 17. The demand regime from Period 10 to Period 23 averages approximately 103 units per period (1344/13), with a noticeable dip in the most recent periods (P20-P23 avg = 85). Given the current stockout and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the priority is a high service level once arrivals resume. Since we have 384 units 'legally' in transit (excluding lost P2), even if delayed, they should eventually cover more than 3 periods of demand (approx 310 units). If I order more now, I risk a massive inventory holding cost when the delayed shipments finally arrive all at once. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent slightly lower demand (P20-23) to avoid over-ordering during this massive delay phase, setting L = 3 (the max observed) and calculating mu_hat based on the last 14 periods (P10-P23) to balance the stable 110 avg with the recent dip. This will likely result in a recommendation of 0 or few units to avoid exacerbating a future glut, as the 384 effective units in transit exceed the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Logistics crisis confirmed. No arrivals since Period 17. Effective pipeline is 384 units (In-transit 561 - Lost P2 order 177). Orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 are severely delayed (5-8 periods since order).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a severe logistics crisis. No shipments have arrived since Period 17, and the on-hand inventory has been zero since Period 19. The 'In-transit' quantity of 561 includes a 177-unit order from Period 2 that is definitively lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 384 units. However, none of these 384 units (ordered between P15 and P19) have arrived, despite being 5-9 periods old (well past the promised lead time of 2 and historical maximum of 3). This indicates a systemic failure in the supply chain or a massive lead-time extension. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the large (but stagnant) pipeline, I am setting L to 10 (reflecting the current delay) and using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Recent demand (P19-P24) averages ~96 units. To ensure the system overcomes the 384-unit effective pipeline and targets a base stock that triggers an order, I've calculated a target mu_hat of 1200 (approx. 110 units * 11 periods). This is intended to force a replenishment order to break the deadlock, as existing pipeline units are clearly unreliable.

Carry-over insight: Logistics crisis persists: zero arrivals for 8 consecutive periods (P18-P25). Lead time is now effectively >8 periods. Total stagnant pipeline (excluding lost P2 order) is 384 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a severe logistics crisis for chips(Regular). There have been zero arrivals since Period 17 (9 consecutive periods), despite a promised lead time of 2. The effective in-transit pipeline is 539 units (calculated as total In-transit 716 minus the 177 units from Period 2 confirmed lost). The oldest active orders are now 11 periods past the order date (P15). Because the on-hand inventory has been zero for 7 periods and the pipeline is significantly higher than the target base stock (which would be around 330-440 units even with L=3), the OR engine's capped policy will likely prevent any order unless we artificially inflate the lead time parameter L. However, placing more orders into a blocked system just increases holding risk if they all arrive at once. I am setting L to 10 (explicit) to reflect the current observed delay, which forces the OR backend to reconsider the pipeline's adequacy. Demand has been stable around 100-110 units; mu_hat uses recent_N=15 to capture this post-startup regime.

Carry-over insight: Logistics crisis update: Zero arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (P18-P26). Effective lead time is now at least 11 periods (P15 order still outstanding).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a severe logistics crisis with zero arrivals since Period 17. The actual lead time has now extended to at least 12 periods (the order from Period 15 remains outstanding). The pipeline inventory of 854 includes one confirmed lost order (Period 2, 177 units) and several aging orders (P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P26). Because on-hand inventory is 0 and no arrivals have occurred for 9 consecutive periods, the base stock calculation must be manipulated to account for the effectively increased lead time and the 'phantom' units in the pipeline. I am setting L explicitly to 12 to reflect the current delay, though arrivals are currently stalled. Recent demand (P20-P26) averages 94.3 units. I will set mu_hat to cover this demand level over the extended lead time (L+1=13) to ensure that when the logistics thaw occurs, the system attempts to build sufficient inventory. I will maintain a high sigma_hat to account for the extreme lead-time volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: Logistics blackout persist: zero arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (P18-P27). Effective lead time is now at least 12 periods (P15 order still outstanding). Effective pipeline is current In-transit (854) - Lost P2 order (177) = 677 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a severe logistics blackout with no arrivals since Period 17 (11 consecutive periods of zero arrivals). The actual lead time has far exceeded the promised 2 periods; the oldest outstanding order (placed in P15) is now 13 periods old. Inventory is at 0, and total In-transit is 1017 units. However, identifying 'phantom' inventory is crucial: 177 units from P2 are confirmed lost. The remaining pipeline (840 units) consists of orders that are significantly delayed but not yet confirmed lost. Because on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is steady (average ~104 units over the last 15 periods), I must continue to place orders to ensure that whenever the logistics 'dam' breaks, there is enough supply to meet the accumulated and future demand. I will set L=13 (explicit) to reflect the oldest pending order, and mu_hat based on the stable demand regime (~104) across this extended lead time to ensure the base stock target accounts for the massive delay.

Carry-over insight: Logistics blackout extends to 11 periods (no arrivals since P17). Effective lead time is at least 13 periods (P15 order outstanding). Total effective pipeline is In-transit (1017) - Lost P2 order (177) = 840 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics blackout that lasted from Period 18 to Period 27 has finally broken. In Period 28, an order placed in Period 26 arrived with a lead time of 2 periods. This suggests that while previous orders (P15, P17, P18, P19, P25) are still delayed or potentially lost, new orders might be flowing through the system more normally. The current on-hand inventory is 45 units. The total 'In-transit' is 1023, but we must subtract the confirmed lost P2 order (177) and the suspect P15-P25 block (approx 540 units) to assess real pipeline utility. However, since P26 recently arrived, I will set L to 2 (observed most recently). Demand remains stable around 100-110 units. I will set mu_hat based on the last 15 periods to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 105 units/period) and sigma_hat likewise to manage the volatility during this recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Logistics blackout broken at Period 28: Order from Period 26 arrived with lead time=2. Large backlog of orders (P15-P25) remains outstanding and likely compromised, but new logistics flow appears restored to L=2 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The 11-period 'logistics blackout' ended in Period 28. Notably, an order from Period 26 arrived in Period 28 (L=2) and an order from Period 27 arrived in Period 29 (L=2). This suggests the logistics system has returned to its promised lead time of 2 periods, while the older backlog (Orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P25 totalling 519 units, plus the long-lost P2 order of 177 units) remains unconfirmed and highly suspect. Current In-transit is 860 units; if we subtract the P2 lost order (177) and the suspicious P15-P25 block (519), the 'effective' pipeline is likely significantly lower. However, with L=2 restoration, I will set L to 2 and mu_hat based on the stable demand regime (avg ~110 units). I'm focusing on the most recent 5 periods (P25-P29) which show an average demand of 107.8 units, consistent with the long-term stable average of ~110 units.

Carry-over insight: Logistics restored to L=2 as of Period 28 (P26 and P27 orders arrived on time). Pipeline integrity remains compromised: 696 units (177 from P2 + 519 from P15-P25) have not arrived despite the system resuming normal flow for newer orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1398.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics crisis has partially resolved. Orders from Period 26, 27, and 28 have all arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, confirming the restoration of normal logistics (L=2). However, a significant portion of the pipeline remains compromised. The Total In-transit is 716 units. Based on historical data, this contains 177 units from Period 2 (confirmed lost) and 519 units from the Period 15-25 blackout (78+94+122+84+155). Since the logistics flow resumed for newer orders while these older orders remain missing, they are highly likely lost or indefinitely delayed. The 'effective' pipeline is therefore 716 - 177 - 519 = 20 units (specifically, the remainder from subsequent orders). On-hand inventory is 160 units. Demand is stable, averaging 106.3 units over the last 20 periods (P11-P30). To maintain the target service level given the lost stock, I am using L=2 (restored) and setting explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat values that account for the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. By setting mu_hat such that the base stock (approx 340-360) minus the full in-transit (716) results in no order, the OR backend will correctly wait until on-hand levels drop or pipeline clears. However, to ensure we resume ordering exactly when needed, I calculate mu_hat = (1+L) * mean + 'lost units' to offset the backend's subtraction. Effective base stock target is ~330 (3 periods * 110). To compensate for 696 lost units in the pipeline field, mu_hat is set to 1026.

Carry-over insight: Logistics restored to L=2 as of Period 30. Total 'phantom' pipeline inventory is 696 units (177 from P2 and 519 from P15-P25). These units are visible in In-transit but will not arrive.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has recovered from a major logistics blackout. Recent orders (P26, P27, P28) have arrived with a consistent lead time of 2 periods, confirming the restoration of normal flow. However, there is a significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory: 696 units are currently in-transit but are considered lost or irrecoverably stalled (177 from P2 and 519 from P15-P25). The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders, so these 696 units must be offset. Current In-transit is 933; subtracting 696 leaves an effective pipeline of 237 units (consistent with the P31 order of 217). Demand has been relatively stable, averaging ~102 units over the last 5 periods. I will set L to 'default' (2) to match the restored rhythm, and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable trend. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the phantom inventory, I will explicitly set mu_hat to a value that includes the 696 lost units as an 'inflation' factor: Target=(1+L)*Mean; Parameter_Value = Target + Lost_Units = (3 * 102) + 696 = 1002.

Carry-over insight: Total 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains 696 units (177 from P2 and 519 from P15-P25). These units are visible in In-transit but will not arrive. Logistics flow for new orders is stable at L=2 as of Period 30.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime from Period 10 to the present, with an average of approximately 104 units per period (P10-P32). The logistics situation has normalized to a lead time of roughly 1-2 periods after a significant blackout period. However, the system's pipeline inventory is heavily inflated by 696 'phantom' units (177 from P2 and 519 from the P15-P25 period) that are documented as lost in the CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS but still appear in the 'In-transit' total. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am setting L=1 (reflecting recent arrivals) and using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a 2-period demand window (L+1 = 2) at a mean of 104 units. Since the OR engine's logic is 'order = base_stock - (In-transit + On-hand)', and In-transit is 754 (including 696 phantom units), the effective current inventory is roughly (754-696) + 203 = 261 units. To maintain enough stock for a 2-period cycle (approx 208 units), no significant new order is needed right now, but I must set parameters such that the system doesn't completely halt orders forever once the phantom units are the only thing 'in-transit'. Setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom pipeline inflation: Target Base Stock should be (L+1)*Demand + safety. With mean=104, L=1, target is ~208 + safety. To offset the 696 phantom units in the calculation, I will provide a mu_hat that ensures the base_stock calculation remains functional.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 110 units per period (average P10-P33). On-hand inventory is currently 125 units. The critical factor remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. As noted in the carry-over insights, 177 units from Period 2 and 519 units from the Period 15-25 blackout period (totaling 696 units) are lost and will not arrive, despite appearing in the 'In-transit' count (716 units). This means the actual effective pipeline consists of only 20 units (716 - 696). Logistics for new orders has been restored with an observed lead time of 1-2 periods (most recently 1). To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock, I must use the 'explicit' method for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to account for the massive 696-unit pipeline discrepancy. I set L=2 (promised), mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand (~330 units) plus the 696 phantom units (~1026 total) to neutralize the backend's deduction of the phantom stock. For sigma_hat, I use a volatility estimate based on recent demand (~20 std * sqrt(3)).

Carry-over insight: No new significant pattern detected. Logistic flow remains stable at L=1-2 for recent orders while 696 units in pipeline remain confirmed lost.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with an average of approximately 104 units over the last 15 periods (P20-P34). Logistics have stabilized at a lead time of 1-2 periods for new orders (e.g., P31 arrived in 1 period, P32 arrived in 1 period). However, there is a significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 696 units (177 from P2 and 519 from P15-P25) that are visible in the In-transit total (959) but are confirmed lost and will not arrive. To account for this, I must set the L parameter to the recent stable lead time (L=2) and use an 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the OR engine's standard pipeline calculation which would otherwise subtract these 696 phantom units from the order. I target a base stock of (L+1) * Mean + Buffer. With Mean=104 and L=2, (3 * 104) = 312. Adding a small volatility buffer for a service level of ~95%, I set mu_hat explicitly to 380 to ensure the OR logic, which sees a massive (but fake) pipeline, still places necessary orders to maintain on-hand availability.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to follow a restored lead time of L=1-2 periods for new orders, despite a large volume of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Specifically, 696 units (177 from P2 and 519 from the P15-P25 period) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, though they appear in the total In-transit count (959). The 'real' pipeline inventory is 263 units (959 minus 696). Demand has been relatively stable, averaging approximately 90 units over the last 10 periods (P26-P35), though single-period spikes occur. On-hand inventory is currently 0. I will set the lead time parameter to 2 (the promised value and recent upper bound) and use a recent N of 10 to forecast demand, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~270-300 units). Since the OR engine subtracts the full pipeline (959) from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat to offset the 696 phantom units, or else the system will never place another order. Targeting a base stock of roughly 300 units for protection, I set mu_hat explicitly to ~1000 to trigger a sufficient order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2317.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a fairly consistent regime. Over the last 10 periods (P27-P36), the mean demand is 108.2 units, while the most recent 5 periods show a slightly lower mean of 95 units. Given the profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred. The logistics situation has returned to a more stable lead time pattern (L=1-2) since the major blackout ended at Period 28. However, 696 units in the pipeline (177 from P2 and 519 from P15-P25) are officially categorized as 'phantom' inventory that will not arrive. Subtracting these from the current In-transit of 822 units leaves an effective pipeline of 126 units (the order placed in Period 36). With 115 on-hand, the total effective inventory is ~241 units. I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand forecasting to capture the post-blackout stabilization and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average of recent successful arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1799.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P10-P37) continues to be stable, averaging approximately 100 units per period with occasional spikes (e.g., P26, P36). The logistics system for new orders has stabilized to a lead time of 1-2 periods. However, significant pipeline integrity issues remain: 696 units are structurally lost in the 'In-transit' count (177 from P2 and 519 from the P15-P25 period), leaving an effective pipeline of 20 units (In-transit 716 - 696). With 120 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 20, the current coverage is approximately 140 units. Since L=2, the backend seeks to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~300 units). To trigger an order that compensates for the 'phantom' units, I set L=2 and mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the current 100-unit/period demand regime. This ensures the base stock targets ~300+ units, correcting the deficit caused by the lost shipments.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains stable with a recent average of approximately 101 units per period (P31-P38). The logistics flow has stabilized with an actual lead time (L) generally between 1 and 2 periods (P34 arrived in 2, P36 arrived in 1). The critical issue remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory: out of the 716 units currently 'in-transit', 696 units are confirmed lost (177 from P2 and 519 from the P15-P25 period range). The effective pipeline is therefore only 20 units (716 - 696). With on-hand inventory at 8 units and an effective pipeline of 20, the effective inventory position is only 28 units, which is insufficient to cover the expected demand (mu_hat) for the lead time plus review period (L+1). I set L=2 to be conservative. mu_hat is set to 303 (approx. 101 * 3) using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the recent demand regime. sigma_hat is set to 35 using recent_N (N=8) to account for recent volatility. This will trigger the OR backend to place a significant order to replenish stock after the previous 'blackout' and subsequent clearing of old stock.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 716 units in-transit. However, based on the historical logs and carry-over insights, 696 of these units are 'phantom' (177 from P2 and 519 from the P15-P25 logistics blackout). These units will likely never arrive, meaning the 'effective' pipeline is only 20 units (716 - 696). Logistic flow for new orders has stabilized at a lead time of roughly 1-2 periods. Since P37-P39 saw 0 orders and P35-P39 had no arrivals (except leftovers), the stockout at P39 (8 sold vs 68 demand) reflects the depletion of previous cycles. I need to trigger a reorder to cover the current demand regime. The average demand from P30-P39 is 93.4 units per period. I will set L=2 (promised) and use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand of ~93 units, and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to account for recent variability.

Carry-over insight: No new significant pattern detected. Logistic flow remains stable at L=1-2 for recent orders while 696 units in pipeline (P2: 177, P15-25: 519) remain confirmed lost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 716 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 696 of these units are confirmed lost (177 from Period 2 and 519 from the Period 15-25 blackout). Therefore, the 'effective' pipeline is only 20 units (716 - 696). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The effective inventory position is thus 20 units. Since Period 30, the logistics flow for new orders has stabilized with an actual lead time (L) of 1-2 periods. Demand over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) has averaged approximately 91 units per period. To ensure availability and account for the 20 units in-transit that haven't arrived yet, I will set L to the promised 2 periods, and use the recent 10-period demand mean to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will trigger the OR backend to order sufficient stock to reach the base stock level, effectively ignoring the 696 phantom units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and hasn't received a shipment since Period 37, while demand averaged 104 units over the last 5 periods. A critical factor is the 716 units currently 'in-transit', which include 696 confirmed lost units (177 from Period 2 and 519 from the Period 15-25 blackout). The OR backend's capped policy relies on pipeline inventory (in-transit) to determine order size; because the 696 lost units are still counted in the backend's pipeline, the engine will likely under-order or not order at all. To force an order that addresses the current stockout and expected demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the need to bypass the phantom pipeline. Based on a 3-period lead-time + review period logic and a demand mean of ~100, a base stock of ~400 is needed. Subtracting the phantom 696 from the base stock logic would result in zero orders, so I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the engine to order replenishment despite the phantom units. I am setting L to 2 (the promised and recently observed average) and mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the shortfall created by the stalled pipeline.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics environment has been characterized by two major disruptions: a lost order of 177 units from Period 2 and a second lost cluster of 519 units from Periods 15-25 (total 696 phantom units). At Period 43, the observed 'In-transit' is 1018 units. Subtracting the 696 phantom units yields an effective pipeline of 322 units (the order placed in Period 42). Current on-hand is 0, following four periods of stockouts due to a pause in ordering. Demand has remained relatively stable; the average of the last 15 periods (P28-P42) is approximately 97 units. With a restored logistics lead time (L) of 2, the inventory position needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). Target inventory = 3 * 97 = 291 units. Since our effective inventory position (0 on-hand + 322 effective in-transit) is 322, which is already above 291, placing an additional order via high mu_hat is unnecessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=15) to capture the current stable demand regime while relying on the backend's base-stock calculation to recognize we are currently sufficiently stocked once the Period 42 order arrives.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 1018 units. However, 696 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' inventory (Period 2: 177, Periods 15-25: 519) that will never arrive. The effective pipeline is therefore 322 units (1018 - 696). Recent logistics flow (P28-P37) shows lead times between 1 and 2 periods, but the most recent orders from P42 have not yet arrived (L=2 expectancy). The demand has stabilized in a regime averaging approximately 100 units per period (P31-P43 average: 100.3, P41-P43: 111). I am setting L to 2 to cover the promised lead time and aligning mu_hat with the 100 unit/period regime. Sigma_hat is set to capture the volatility of approximately 25 units per period. The backend will subtract the total (nominal) pipeline of 1018 units from the calculated base stock; to ensure an order is actually placed to cover the 'phantom' gap and current stockout, mu_hat and sigma_hat are adjusted to target a high enough inventory level to offset the 696 lost units that the OR engine incorrectly believes are coming.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data shows a persistent logistics issue where several historical orders (696 units in total: 177 from Period 2 and 519 from Periods 15-25) are effectively lost and will not arrive, despite appearing in the In-transit total. This 'phantom' inventory must be accounted for by the user. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and despite an In-transit total of 1347, the effective pipeline is only 651 units (1347 - 696). The demand regime since Period 10 has been relatively stable, averaging approximately 100-110 units. However, recent demand (P41-P44) has shown higher volatility, averaging around 121 units. Lead time for healthy orders has stabilized between 1 and 2 periods since the restoration in Period 28. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock to cover the upcoming 3 periods (L+1) while disregarding the lost units, I will set L to 2 and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=15) to capture the current stable average (~101), but I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 to maintain a safety buffer against the intermittent 3-period lead times seen historically. The large 'orders' placed in P42 and P44 should address the stockout once they arrive, but given the on-hand is 0, we must ensure the base stock is high enough.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) from Period 30 to 45 averages 99.3 units, indicating a stable regime around 100 units. The logistics situation has stabilized since Period 28, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2). The pipeline inventory currently shows 1045 units, but 696 of these are confirmed 'phantom' units (177 from P2, and 519 from P15-P25) that failed to arrive after the logistics blackout and must be discounted. This leaves an effective pipeline of 349 units (the P44 order of 329 plus any residual recent arrivals if applicable, though P44 is the primary active order). With On-hand at 221 and the P44 order expected soon, we are well-positioned for the current lead time window. I will set L to 2 (promised), mu_hat using the recent 16-period average (~100 units/period), and sigma_hat based on the same period to capture volatility. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that covers the L+1 window while acknowledging the true available pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2779.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a recent average (P40-P46) of approximately 112 units per period. The supply chain has stabilized after a major blackout; recent orders are arriving with lead times of 1-3 periods (P42 arrived in 3 periods). However, there is a significant discrepancy in pipeline inventory. The reported In-transit is 1045 units, but history shows 696 of these are 'phantom' units (177 from P2 and 519 from P15-P25) that will likely never arrive. Subtracting these from 1045 leaves an effective pipeline of 349 units, which includes the order of 329 from P44. With on-hand inventory at 71 units and 329 units expected (from P44), the total effective inventory is 400. Assuming a lead time of 2, the base stock should cover 3 periods of demand (~336 units). Since 400 > 336, the current inventory position is sufficient to cover upcoming demand. I will set L to 2 and use a recent_N of 7 to accurately capture the current stable demand regime (~112 units) while acknowledging the lead time recovery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1349.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 48 with an on-hand inventory of 0 and a total in-transit of 1045 units. Based on historical data and Carry-Over Insights, the pipeline contains 696 'phantom' units (P2: 177, P15-P25: 519) that are confirmed lost and will not arrive. Thus, the effective pipeline is 1045 - 696 = 349 units. This effective pipeline consists of the order from P44 (329 units). Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (P48) with a lead time of 1-2 periods will arrive in P49 or P50, whereas orders with a lead time of 3+ periods will not contribute to revenue but might incur holding costs if the game were longer (not applicable here as we maximize total reward until the end). Recent demand (P44-P47) averages ~124 units. Total demand remaining for Periods 48, 49, and 50 is approximately 372 units. Currently, only the P44 order (329 units) is expected to arrive. Therefore, a small top-up is needed. I will use 'explicit' L=2 to reflect the restored lead time, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data (N=15) to capture current demand volatility (~108 avg), ensuring the OR backend targets approximately 3 periods of demand coverage.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, on-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 1045 units. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, 696 units in the pipeline are 'phantom' (177 from P2 and 519 from the P15-P25 logistics blackout) and will never arrive. This leaves an effective pipeline of 349 units (1045 - 696). The only viable active order is from Period 44 (329 units). Since there have been no arrivals for 3 periods, and the P42 order arrived in 3 periods (Period 45), the P44 order is likely arriving this period (P49) or very soon. Demand remains stable around a mean of 105 units (recent P40-P48 avg = 109). We set L=2 as the baseline, though actual transit times vary between 1 and 3. We use recent_N for mu_hat (N=9) to capture the current demand regime. With effective pipeline (349) and no on-hand stock, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock target, accounting for the 696 lost units that I cannot manually subtract from the backend's internal tracking.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a mix of phantom pipeline inventory and erratic lead times. Current In-transit is 1045 units, but history confirms that 696 of these units (from P2 and the P15-P25 blackout) are lost and will never conclude. Thus, the effective pipeline is 349 units (including the P44 order of 329). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains stable around a mean of ~100-110 units (recent P40-P49 avg = 105.8). Lead times for surviving orders oscillate between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2). For Period 50, I will set L=2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat to ensure we cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) while the backend accounts for the 1045 in-transit units. Since the OR engine subtracts the full 1045 from our target, I must adjust mu_hat upward to neutralize the 696 'phantom' units. Target stock for 3 periods = 3 * 106 = 318. Required mu_hat = 318 + 696 = 1014. Sigma_hat is set using recent volatility to maintain service levels during this logistics instability.
