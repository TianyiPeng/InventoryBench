Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 80, 120, 120, 93, and 177, averaging approximately 118 units per period. The system provides a promised lead time (L) of 2 periods. To calculate the target inventory level, I need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand to account for the time until an order placed now arrives and the demand that occurs during that arrival period. Estimated demand for 3 periods is ~354 units (118 * 3). Currently, I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Therefore, I will place an initial order of 360 units to establish a baseline pipeline and meet the expected demand once arrivals begin.",

Currently, in Period 2, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order has not yet arrived. The 'in-transit' balance of 360 units represents the Period 1 order. Historical demand for Period 1 was 102 units, and the provided samples show a range of 80-177 units, averaging approximately 118 units per period. My objective is to maintain enough stock to cover demand until the next possible order can arrive (lead time L=2 + decision period = 3 periods of demand). Total demand for 3 periods (P2, P3, P4) is estimated at ~354 units (3 * 118). With 360 units already in transit arriving in P3, and considering that another order placed now in P2 would arrive in P4 (L=2), I need to ensure P5 demand is also covered. Estimating P5 demand at ~118 units, the total pipeline requirement through P5 is ~472 units. Since 360 are already in transit, ordering an additional 120 units strengthens the safety stock against the higher end of the historical demand range (up to 177) and compensates for the initial stockout in P1/P2.",

(b) Demand Analysis: Demand has been highly variable across the last 5 periods (73, 70, 128, 101, 112, 68, 67, 138), averaging ~95 units. The most recent spike to 138 confirms a high-volatility regime. (c) Lead Time & Lost Orders: Based on carry-over insights, 840 units in transit are confirmed/highly likely lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P30, P33, P37). The current total in-transit is 1040, but subtracting the 840 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of only 200 units (from P40 and P41). Actual lead times for non-lost orders range from 1 to 3 periods. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. Effective in-transit is 200. Total effective inventory position is 200 units. (e) Order Logic: To cover a Lead Time of 3 plus the next period (L+1=4) and maintain safety stock against high volatility, I aim for an inventory position of ~450 (4 periods * 105 mean + 30 safety). Current effective position is 200. Planning to reach 450 requires ordering 250 units, but given the frequency of lost shipments, I will spread the risk by ordering slightly less than the full gap while maintaining aggressive replenishment.",
