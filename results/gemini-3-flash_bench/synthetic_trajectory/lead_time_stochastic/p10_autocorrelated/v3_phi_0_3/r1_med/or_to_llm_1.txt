Historical demand data shows samples: 80, 120, 120, 93, 177 (average ~118). Inventory is currently 0. The OR recommendation suggests ordering 180 units based on its base-stock policy. Since we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, we need to establish a pipeline to cover the 2-period lead time plus the review period (total 3 periods of demand). 180 units roughly covers 1.5 periods of average demand, which might be slightly conservative given the lead time.

OR Recommendation: OR suggests 30 units, likely seeing the 372 in-transit units as covering the base stock. However, the P2 order of 172 units is overdue. If P2 is lost or significantly delayed, we face a stockout.

Strategy: The OR recommendation of 61 units is based on the recent lower demand average.

Historical demand shows significant volatility: while a recent window (P7-P9) averaged ~62 units, the last two periods (P10-P11) saw a rebound to an average of 131 units. This suggests the demand remains high or at least highly variable. Regarding lead times: the promised lead time is 2 periods, but history shows 1 and 3 periods are common. Crucially, the P2 order (172) and P6 order (120) are confirmed lost, meaning the 353 'In-transit' figure is misleading; 292 of those units are likely lost. The only reliable in-transit units are from P11 (61 units). The OR recommendation of 21 units is based on the inflated pipeline inventory (353) and doesn't account for the high loss rate. Re-calculating: Current reliable pipeline (61) + On-hand (0) = 61. Expected demand for lead-time coverage (3 periods) at ~115/period is ~345.

The P15 order (95 units) is expected to arrive during Period 18 and be visible for P19 usage, but P18 concluded with 0 on-hand, meaning the P15 order likely arrived during P18 but was fully consumed by P18's demand (98) and backlogs. \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P14-P18) averages ~103 units/period (103, 61, 136, 116, 98).

However, based on the historical logs and Carry-Over Insights, this includes 292 defunct units (P2: 172, P6: 120) that are effectively lost. The 'reliable' pipeline consists of orders from P15 (95), P17 (102), P18 (120), P19 (110), P20 (69), P21 (50), and P22 (110), totaling 656 units.\n\n2. **Lead Time Inference**: The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historically, most successful arrivals have shown a 3-period lead time (P1, P5, P11, P12, P13, P14). However, there has been a significant delivery gap since P17. No units arrived in periods 18 through 22. Given that the P15 order (95 units) was placed 8 periods ago and has not arrived, there is a high risk that the logistics chain is either experiencing extreme congestion (clustering) or further losses.\n\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P18-P22) has averaged ~104 units/period. The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees the massive (but partially defunct) pipeline of 948 units as sufficient to cover the base stock level.\n\n4. **Strategy**: Although the 'reliable' pipeline of 656 units theoretically covers over 6 periods of demand, none of it has arrived for 5 consecutive periods despite orders being placed. Ordering more now would only aggravate holding costs if a massive cluster arrives at once, but with 0 on-hand, we are already losing sales. However, until the 'logjam' of the 656 units in-transit breaks, adding more units to an unreliable pipeline is inefficient.

Orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 427 units) are now 6-10 periods old; given the promised lead time of 2 and observed lead time of 1-3, these are highly likely lost or severely delayed. The only reliable 'live' pipeline is the P25 order of 50 units. Demand Analysis: The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 96 units/period. The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically driven by the inflated 'in-transit' figure of 769, which the OR agent cannot distinguish as defunct. Lead Time Inference: While the promised lead time is 2, actual arrivals have clustered or gone missing. The most recent cluster (P23) showed arrivals with lead times of 1, 2, and 3 periods. Strategy: I must ignore the ~719 units (292 confirmed lost + 427 likely lost) in the pipeline to avoid perpetual stockouts. With 0 on-hand and only 50 units recently ordered, I need to place a substantial order to cover the next 3 periods of demand (~300 units) to account for lead time variability and current stockout state.",

Over a longer recent window (P40-P46), the average is ~112 units/period. \n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation of 0 is ignored because it counts the massive defunct pipeline (1349 units) as active inventory. We need to cover demand for the lead time (L=2-3) plus the current period (Review=1). Total demand to cover (L+1) = 4 * 112 = 448 units.

With 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), and considering a lead time of roughly 2-3 periods, orders placed now serve the final periods of the game.\n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees the massive (but mostly defunct) in-transit total.
