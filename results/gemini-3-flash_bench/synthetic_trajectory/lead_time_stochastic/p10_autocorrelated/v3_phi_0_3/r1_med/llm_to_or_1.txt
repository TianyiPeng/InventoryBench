Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period_1. This being the first decision, there is no historical arrival data to calculate the actual lead time, so I will use the promised lead time of 2 periods. Historical demand data for Period_1 to Period_5 is provided [80, 120, 120, 93, 177], suggesting a mean of approximately 118 units per period. Since this is the very first period and on-hand inventory is 0, the goal is to set a base stock level that covers the 2-period lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods). Using the mean of 118, a 3-period demand (mu_hat) would be around 354. I'll use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the OR engine to use the available historical samples for its initial calculation. I will start with L=2.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 180 units which are currently in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning the order placed in Period 1 (yesterday) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and lost 102 units of sales in Period 1. Since we have very few historical data points (P1 demand was 102 compared to the pre-game samples of 80, 120, 120, 93, 177), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for the demand forecast to capture the recent volatility and the high sample from Period 5 of the history (177). The backend will handle the lead time L=2 by default. The target is to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand to minimize stockouts given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Observations from Period 1 and Period 2 show zero sales despite positive demand (102 and 147 respectively) because the initial on-hand inventory was 0 and the lead time is at least 1 period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (180 units) and P2 (177 units) are currently in-transit (Total: 357). According to the lead-time definition, the P1 order (arriving at L=2) should arrive during Period 3's resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of Period 4. Demand for the first two periods (102, 147) and the pre-game history (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) suggests an average demand around 120-130 range. Period 2 saw an uptick to 147. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the most recent mean which includes the slightly higher recent samples (120, 120, 93, 177, 147, avg=131.4). L is set to default (2).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 were expected to arrive during the Period 3 resolution phase and be visible in the Period 3 conclusion. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0', and also for Period 1 and 2. This is actually expected for Period 1: an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives during P3 and is reported at the start of P4. Therefore, we should see the first arrival (from P1) in the 'Period 4 conclude' message, which will be available to us at the start of Period 5. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and 434 units are in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3: 180+177+77=434). Historical demand mean for these chips is significantly higher (avg ~118) than the initial samples suggest. Since we are out of stock and awaiting the first shipment, I will use recent_N to forecast demand based on the actual observed demand (102, 147, 73) to stabilize the pipeline. I'll maintain L=default (2) as no evidence yet suggests a deviation from the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $463.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the actual lead times are inconsistent: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3's order arrived in 1 period, despite a promised lead time of 2. On-hand inventory is 113, and there is a large in-transit order of 177 from Period 2 (which is now overdue if L=2, or right on time if L=3). Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 102, 147, 73, 144, 118 (approximate based on game history and provided samples). The mean demand is roughly 117 units. Given the lead time volatility, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed 3 and 1. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full history so far as there is no clear trend or seasonality yet. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. The base stock will aim to cover demand during the lead time plus the current period (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 102, 147, 73, 144, 124 (Mean \u2248 118, Std \u2248 29). Total 'In-transit' is 374, which consists of orders from P2 (177) and P5 (197). Lead time analysis: Order P1 arrived in P4 (LT=3), P3 arrived in P4 (LT=1). The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2.0, matching the promised 2 periods. However, the order from P2 (177 units) is currently overdue (placed P2, promised P4, currently P6), suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. Despite 0 on-hand inventory, there is a large pipeline. I will set L to 'calculate' to use the observed average. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the mean of all 5 periods (approx 118), and for volatility (sigma_hat), I'll use the standard deviation of all samples to maintain a safe service level while waiting for the P2/P5 arrivals.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 despite significant demand. Looking at history, lead times are volatile: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3's arrived in 1. Promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 2 (177 units) has not yet arrived after 4 periods (P3, P4, P5, P6), suggesting it may be significantly delayed or lost. Orders from P5 (197) and P6 (153) are still within the expected lead time window. Total in-transit is 527. Average demand over all recorded samples (P1-P6 and pre-game P1-P5) is approximately 116 units. However, recent demand (P1-P6) has been slightly higher (~114) with a range of 73-147. Given the stockout and the uncertainty of the P2 order, I will set L to 3 (recent max) and use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture recent volatility. I will keep \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 sensitive to the last 5 periods to ensure the base stock calculation adequately covers the 0 inventory position while accounting for the high 'in-transit' sum which includes a potentially lost order.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. P2 order (177 units) is currently overdue by 2 periods (at P6 conclude).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 527 units in-transit. Based on 'conclude' messages: P1 arrived in 3 periods; P3 arrived in 1 period; P2 (177 units) ordered in Period 2 is now 6 periods old and hasn't arrived, suggesting it is likely lost. This absence has caused stockouts since Period 5. Subsequent orders P5 (197) and P6 (153) were placed with a promised lead time of 2. P5 should have arrived by Period 7's resolution phase (to be seen now), but it hasn't. This indicates the actual lead time is likely 3+ periods or shipments are unreliable. Historical demand across 7 periods averages 107 units. For Period 8, I will set L to 3 to account for the observed delay in P1 and the likely delay in P5. Mu_hat will use recent_N=5 (avg ~100) multiplied by (1+L=4) to target a base stock reflecting the current demand regime and longer lead time, helping the OR engine recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (177 units) confirmed lost (6 periods since order, promised 2). P5 order (197 units) is overdue (3 periods since order, promised 2). Effective lead time trend shifting from 2 to 3+ periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analyzing the shipment history: P2 (ordered Period 2) is missing for 6 periods and is considered lost. P5 (ordered Period 5) arrived at the end of Period 8 with a lead time of 3 periods. This confirms the carry-over insight that lead times are frequently 3 periods rather than the promised 2. Demand has shown a downward trend from a peak of 144-147 in periods 2-4 to 59-64 in periods 7-8. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this recent lower demand regime (avg ~86). For lead time L, I will use an explicit value of 3 to account for the observed delays, which helps the OR engine set a higher safety stock target for the increased risk. Sigma will use historical data (default) to maintain a buffer for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 3 periods (P1=3, P5=3, P3=1, P2=lost). Demand regime shift detected around Period 6: average decreased from ~118 to ~86 (-27%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10. Observation of history shows that actual lead times for successful deliveries (P1, P3, P5) have been 3, 1, and 3 periods respectively, making the average lead time 2.33. However, given the lost shipment (P2) and the volatility, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to be conservative and cover the pipeline. Demand shifted downwards starting Period 6. The mean demand for P6-P9 is (97+64+59+62)/4 = 70.5. Using L=3, the mu_hat should cover (1+3) = 4 periods of demand. 4 * 70.5 = 282. I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat to capture this lower regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=4 to account for the reduced volatility in the new regime. On-hand is 76 and In-transit is 330 (which includes P6 order of 153 units, now overdue at day 4 since order).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand history shows a regime shift: Periods 1-5 mean was ~118, while Periods 6-10 mean is ~84 (ignoring the spiked P10 of 139, which appears seasonal or an outlier, the avg is 84.2). Lead time is volatile; P1 and P5 both took 3 periods, while P2 was lost. Thus, L should be set to 3 periods. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the recent 5 periods (P6-P10) to capture the lower demand regime while factoring in the recent P10 spike (avg 84.2). sigma_hat will also be calculated over these 5 periods to account for the increased volatility seen in P10. Setting L=3 with recent_N=5 ensures the OR engine targets a base stock based on the current lower demand trend but with a safety buffer for the observed 3-period lead time.

We are currently at Period 12. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand history shows a recent regime after Period 5 where demand has been more volatile: Period 6-11 demand: 97, 64, 59, 62, 139, 123. The mean demand over these last 6 periods is approximately 90.67, significantly lower than the early periods. Lead time analysis: P1=3, P3=1, P5=3. P2 was lost. P6 (153 units) and P11 (65 units) are currently in-transit. P6 was ordered 6 periods ago, making it highly likely to be lost. The in-transit total of 395 units includes P2(177), P5(197), P6(153), and P11(65) - however, P2/P5 have already 'concluded' or were lost. Actually, based on 'In-transit: 395', and arrivals already recorded, P6 (153), P11 (65), plus some prior lost/stale orders likely account for this. I will assume a lead time (L) of 3 based on the most common actual arrival timeframe. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~91). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=6 to reflect the higher recent volatility (std dev of ~35 during this period). Target base stock needs to cover L+1 = 4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 6-11 avg demand 91 units vs Period 1-5 avg 118 units. Lead time remains erratic but typically 3 periods when not lost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 6-12) shows a mean of approximately 90 units, compared to the initial periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 421 units in-transit (orders from P6, P11, and P12). The P6 order (153 units) is significantly overdue (7 periods since order), matching the behavior of the lost P2 order. I will treat the P6 order as likely lost. Effective lead time for successful deliveries (P1, P5) has been 3 periods. I will set L=3 as an explicit estimate to account for systemic delays. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the lower 90-unit average. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use N=7 to reflect recent variance. This setting targets a base stock that accounts for the 3-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=4), while the backend will subtract the remaining pipeline (P11, P12) from the target.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (153 units) is likely lost (7 periods since order, promised 2), consistent with P2 loss pattern. Pipeline contains unreliable artifacts.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 starts with 0 on-hand inventory. Historically, lead times have drifted from the promised 2 periods to 3 periods (P1=3, P5=3), and several orders have been lost (P2, P6). The order from Period 6 (7 periods ago) is confirmed as lost based on the 'Carry-over Insights'. The pipeline inventory of 421 includes orders from P11 (65 units), P12 (26 units), and likely the phantom P6 order. Since lead time is frequently 3, P11 should have arrived at the end of P13/start of P14, but P13 conclude shows 0 arrived, suggesting further delays or losses. Demand has shifted from ~118 down to ~91 (P6-P13 average). I will use L=3 to reflect the actual logistical delay and base mu/sigma on the recent 8-period demand regime (P6-P13) to avoid over-ordering based on old, higher demand levels, while maintaining a high base stock to recover from current stockouts.

Carry-over insight: P11 order (placed Period 11) is overdue (3 periods passed, nothing arrived at P13 conclude), reinforcing the lead time delay or potential for consecutive losses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $260.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a significant lead time extension and potential order losses. P11 arrived with a lead time of 3 periods (at P14 conclude), whereas P6 and P2 orders are confirmed lost. My current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shifted from an average of ~118 in periods 1-5 to ~96 in periods 6-14 (mean of recent 9 samples). Given the erratic lead times (observed 3, 1, 3, 3) and the high likelihood of shipments going missing, I am setting the lead time (L) to 3 periods to account for the most common delay. I will use the last 9 samples for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (avg 96/period) while accounting for the extended lead time (L+1=4). sigma_hat will also be calculated using the recent 9 samples to reflect current volatility. This conservative approach aims to replenish stock despite frequent losses and delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: P11 order arrived in P14 (lead time = 3), reinforcing that the operational lead time is 3 periods despite a promise of 2. Consecutive losses (P2, P6) suggest that the pipeline inventory is highly unreliable.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The operational lead time (L) has consistently been 3 periods (P1=3, P5=3, P11=3, P12=3) despite the promised 2. I will set L to 3. Demand shifted at Period 6 from an average of ~118 to ~91. Recent demand (P11-P15) shows a slight upward trend (123, 87, 96, 103, 61), averaging 94. To account for the longer lead time and current demand level, I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand. On-hand is 0, and the pipeline (390 units) contains orders from P6 (likely lost based on history) and P15. Setting L to 3 and using the last 5 periods for mu/sigma ensures the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~376 units), which helps mitigate the high risk of lost shipments and the observed 0 inventory state.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17 with an on-hand inventory of 0. Historical analysis confirms a demand regime shift around Period 6: the average demand for Periods 6-16 is 93.3 units, compared to 118 in Periods 1-5. Lead time is consistently 3 periods for successful arrivals, but there have been significant losses (P2 and P6). Currently, in-transit inventory is 415 units, consisting of orders from P15 (60 units) and P16 (25 units), plus likely 'ghost' inventory from P2 and P6 that the OR backend doesn't know are lost. To compensate for the backend overestimating the pipeline (due to lost orders) and facing a lead time of 3 periods, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) and mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (1+L)=4 periods of demand at the recent average of 93.3, which equals 373.2. I'll use a conservative sigma_hat based on the last 11 periods of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 415 is misleading; at least 330 units (P2=177, P6=153) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. Only 85 units (P15=60, P16=25) are viable arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 0. The current In-transit (399) is highly distorted by historical losses (P2=177, P6=153, total 330 units) that have not arrived for 11+ and 16+ periods respectively. Only 69 units (P15=60 and P17=9) are currently viable in-transit units, since P16 arrived in P17 (lead time 1). Lead times are erratic but average 3 when they arrive (P1=3, P5=3, P11=3, P12=3), while occasional outliers are 1 (P3, P16). I will use L=3 to be safe given the stockouts. Demand shows a regime shift since P6, with a more recent uptick in the last two periods (136, 116). Averaging the last 12 periods (P6-P17) gives approximately 95 units per period. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the ghost pipeline (330 lost units), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to provide a base stock that covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand (~380 units), ignoring the 330 units that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: In-transit inventory includes 330 confirmed lost units (P2=177, P6=153) which will never conclude, requiring explicit parameter adjustment to bypass OR pipeline logic. Recent demand (P16-17) suggests an upward volatility spike compared to the P6-P15 average.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time analysis: Recent arrivals (P11, P12, P16) show L varies between 1 and 3 periods, but with 3 being the most frequent for standard replenishment (L=3). Inventory crisis: The 'In-transit' count of 423 is extremely misleading because it includes 330 units from P2 and P6 that are confirmed lost (7+ periods past order date). Viable pipeline is only 93 units (P15=60, P17=9, P18=24). Since the OR engine calculates order = base_stock - pipeline, the phantom 330 units will cause it to order 0 unless we adjust \u03bc\u0302. Demand analysis: P6-P15 average was ~91, but P16-P18 shows an upward spike (136, 116, 98), averaging ~117. To solve the 330-unit pipeline phantom, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. calculation: target_base_stock = (L+1)*demand + safety_stk. With L=3, demand=117, safety_stk ~ 1*std(estimated 30), base_stock should be ~500. To force the OR backend to order when it thinks pipeline=423, I set mu_hat = 830 (so 830 - 423 = ~400 order). L is set to explicit 3 to reflect actual delivery times.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units confirmed at 330 (P2=177, P6=153); these lost orders permanently bloat the OR engine's pipeline inventory. Demand regime has returned to Period 1-5 levels (~117 units/period) after a dip between P6-P15.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high inventory distortion. On-hand inventory is 0, and 'In-transit' shows 676 units. Based on historical analysis (Carry-over insights), 330 units are confirmed lost (P2=177, P6=153) and will never arrive. The remaining 346 units in pipeline are P15=60, P16=0(rectified), P17=9, P18=24, and P19=253. Note that P15=60 (placed Period 15) is now at Period 20 start and has not arrived, making it overdue (L=5). The demand regime has returned to levels seen in Periods 1-5 (~117 units/period), with Period 19 reaching 145. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (676 units) from its target, and 330 of those are 'phantom' units, the OR engine will severely under-order or not order at all. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that absorbs the 330-unit pipeline error. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mu + Safety Stock. Using L=3 (most common actual lead time), target = (4 * 120) + (1.28 * 40 * 2) \u2248 600. To force the OR backend (which sees 676 in transit) to place a necessary order, I will set mu_hat to a very high explicit value (950) so that (950 - 676) results in a meaningful order to cover the current demand spike and the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units consolidated: 330 units (P2=177, P6=153) are effectively dead and will permanently distort pipeline calculations. P15 (60 units) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting further lead time degradation or loss.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a massive distortion in pipeline inventory. There are 969 units currently marked as 'In-transit'. Based on history: P2 (177) and P6 (153) are 100% lost (330 units). P15 (60) is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost. P17-P18 orders (33 total) are at risk but potentially still in the 3-period window. P19-P20 orders (546 total) are the only reliable upcoming stock. However, the OR engine's 'Pipeline' logic (total in-transit) sees 969 units and will stop ordering because it thinks supply is excessive. Currently, on-hand is 0. Demand has returned to the high regime (~118-120 units/period). To force the backend to place an order and override the ~400+ 'phantom' lost units (330 + 60 + likely P17-P18), I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' high value. A 3-period lead time requires (L+1)=4 periods of coverage. 4 periods * 120 demand = 480. To offset the 400 lost units bloating the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 880 to ensure the order calculation (880 - 969 + safety stock) triggers a replenishment. L is set to explicit 3 to reflect the consistent arrival pattern of successful orders (P1, P5, P11, P12).

Carry-over insight: P15 order (60 units) confirmed lost (5 periods since order, promised 2). Total confirmed lost phantom units in pipeline increased from 330 to 390 (P2=177, P6=153, P15=60). Demand regime remains at Period 1-5 levels (~118 units).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a critical situation with zero on-hand inventory and an inaccurately high 'In-transit' count. Historical 'conclude' messages confirm that P2 (177), P6 (153), and P15 (60) orders are lost, totaling 390 'phantom' units that bloat the pipeline and prevent the OR engine from ordering enough stock. Demand has returned to a higher regime (averaging ~115 units over the last 6 periods). Lead times are consistently around 3 periods. To force the OR engine to bypass the 390 phantom units and address current stockouts, I am setting L to 3 and using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~115 * 4 = 460) and then add the 390 phantom units to the forecast (460 + 390 = 850). This target ensures that even when the backend subtracts the 969 in-transit units (which includes the 390 lost ones), it still sees a deficit. A mu_hat of 850 with a moderate sigma_hat will trigger necessary replacement orders to restore the physical flow of goods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 969 units in-transit, but 390 of these (from P2, P6, P15) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. Additionally, the orders from P17 (9 units), P18 (24 units), P19 (253 units), and P20 (293 units) are currently undelivered. Although P17 and P18 are only slightly overdue, the OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline) is heavily suppressed by the 969-unit pipeline value, which is inflated by the 390 lost units. Demand has returned to an average of approximately 118 units per period (similar to the P1-P5 regime). To counteract the 'phantom' pipeline inventory preventing new orders, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. The calculation (1+L)*demand is adjusted to cover the expected demand across the lead time (L=3) plus a significant 'offset' to bypass the 390 lost units. Calculation: (1+3)*118 + 390 = 472 + 390 = 862. This forces the OR engine to recognize it needs more stock despite the bloated in-transit numbers. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen in recent periods (ranging from 88 to 145).

Carry-over insight: P17 (9 units) and P18 (24 units) are now 5 and 4 periods old respectively; while small, their absence alongside the large P19-P20 orders (546 units total) suggests a recurring lead-time bottleneck or systemic loss. Demand remains stable around 118 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from lost shipments and inaccurate pipeline inventory tracking. As of Period 24, the In-transit count of 676 includes 399 units confirmed lost (P2=177, P6=153, P15=60, P17=9). The P18 order (24 units) is also 6 periods old and highly likely lost. The P19 order (253 units) is currently 5 periods old; while it hasn't arrived yet, the P20 order arrived in P23 (L=3), suggesting P19 is either severely delayed or lost. These 'phantom' units (approx 423-676 units) bloat the OR engine's pipeline, causing it to under-order. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime and the pipeline distortion. Demand has returned to the initial levels (~118 units/period). With a lead time of 3, the target base stock should cover 4 periods (L+1). Target = 118 * 4 = 472. However, because the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from base stock, I must inflate mu_hat by the amount of lost inventory to ensure a positive order is generated. Current valid On-hand is 231. Total visible pipeline is 676. Real pipeline is likely < 253. I will set mu_hat to 1200 to force the engine to recognize the need for replenishment despite the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: P18 order (24 units) and P19 order (253 units) are now 6 and 5 periods old respectively, likely lost or significantly delayed, adding to the list of phantom units (P2, P6, P15). Total confirmed/highly probable lost units in pipeline: 423 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $239.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces severe pipeline distortion due to recurring lost shipments. Confirmed/highly probable lost units in the 'In-transit' count (918) include P2 (177), P6 (153), P15 (60), P17 (9), P18 (24), and P19 (253), totaling 676 units. This leaves only the P20 arrival (already concluded) and P24 (242 units) as valid future inventory. The OR engine's pipeline inventory subtracts the full 918 from its order calculation, which would lead to zero orders and a stockout. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~110 units per period (returning to the P1-P5/P16-P20 levels). With an effective lead time (L) of 3, the target base stock is (1+3) * 110 = 440 units, plus a safety factor for volatility (~150 units). To force the backend to place an order despite the 918 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat to a value that exceeds (918 + safety margin). 440 (target) + 918 (to offset pipeline) = 1358. I will set mu_hat to 1400 to ensure we capture the next delivery cycle and override the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed/highly probable lost units in pipeline reached 676 units (P2=177, P6=153, P15=60, P17=9, P18=24, P19=253). This permanent bloat requires explicit mu_hat inflation to force any new orders. Demand has stabilized around 110 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a massive distortion due to lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P20 are either confirmed lost or significantly past the observed 3-period lead time). The 'In-transit' count of 1310 is heavily bloated by these units (totaling approximately 969 units: 177+153+60+9+24+253+293), which prevents the OR engine from ordering enough to meet current demand. Demand has stabilized around 100-110 units locally, but the pipeline bloat requires an 'explicit' inflation of mu_hat to force new orders. With on-hand inventory at 53 units and demand averaging ~100, we are at immediate risk of stockout. I am setting L=3 based on consistent delivery history for successful orders. I set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (L+1) demand window (~400 units) PLUS the pipeline offset (~969 units) to ensure the backend actually places an order for roughly 300-400 units to secure future availability.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed/highly probable lost units in pipeline reached approximately 969 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20). Actual lead time for successful deliveries remains 3 periods. Demand regime currently stable at approximately 100 units/period.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a massive breakdown in supply reliability. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1389 is highly misleading because an estimated 969 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20) have almost certainly been lost or are infinitely delayed, as they have far exceeded the typical 3-period lead time observed for successful deliveries. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around 100-110 units per period. Because the OR backend's capped base-stock logic subtracts the entire (bloated) pipeline inventory from the target stock level, it will not place any new orders unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to exceed the phantom pipeline units. I am setting L to 3 (the observed operational lead time) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 1500. This 1500 is calculated to overcome the ~1389 units in-transit, forcing the model to order a quantity that covers both the projected demand for the next (3+1) periods and the replenishment gap left by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure: ~70% of in-transit units are confirmed lost, requiring mu_hat inflation to bypass OR engine's pipeline subtraction logic. Actual lead time for surviving orders is 3 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from extreme systemic failure with massive order losses. Current in-transit units (1544) are almost entirely 'phantom' units that will never arrive. Highly probable lost orders: P2(177), P6(153), P15(60), P17(9), P18(24), P19(253), P24(242), P25(392). Total probable lost units in the pipeline is approximately 1310. The OR backend subtracts the full 1544 from the base stock. To trigger a new order, mu_hat must be inflated to exceed this phantom pipeline. At an actual lead time (L) of 3, base stock is (1+L)*demand. Target base stock for current demand (~110) should be ~440. To overcome a 1544 unit pipeline, mu_hat must be set explicitly to cover both the target inventory and the lost units: mu_hat = 440 + 1310 = 1750. Actual lead time for surviving orders is consistently 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure: ~85% of in-transit units (1310/1544) are confirmed or highly probable losses (including large P24 and P25 orders). Pipeline is now effectively broken. Actual L=3 for surviving orders. Demand stable ~110 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain exhibits a high rate of shipment loss and erratic lead times, typically averaging 3 periods for successful deliveries. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline contains 1715 units. Based on historical data, approximately 1544 units are highly probable losses (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25). This massive 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR backend's default logic (base_stock - pipeline) from placing new orders. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 110 units (recent_N=5 avg = 105, longer avg ~110). To force an order despite the 1715-unit pipeline bloat, I am explicitly setting mu_hat to 2000. This value exceeds the total pipeline and allows the system to target a safety stock level that covers the 0 on-hand situation. I set L=3 as it is the most reliable lead time for surviving orders.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure: Approximately 90% of in-transit units (1544/1715) are confirmed or highly probable losses. The pipeline is structurally broken. mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to offset phantom units and allow for new procurement.

Daily Reward (R_t): $395.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely compromised. At Period 30, the 'In-transit' pipeline is reported at 1,889 units. However, based on history, a vast majority of these are phantom units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25). My analysis suggests approximately 1,710 units of the reported 1,889 are lost. The OR engine operates on the logic: order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline). Since it sees a pipeline of 1,889, it will order nothing unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to exceed that pipeline. Demand is stable around 110 units. With L=3, a normal mu_hat would be ~440. To force an order of ~150-200 units (to cover 1-2 periods of demand while waiting for the P28/P29 shipments), I must set mu_hat roughly equal to (Lost Units + On-hand + Desired Order). 1710 + 45 + 155 = 1910. I will set mu_hat to 1950 and sigma_hat to 100 to ensure the safety stock calculation doesn't interfere too aggressively with procurement. L is set to 3 reflecting actual lead time for successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure: ~90.5% of in-transit units (1710/1889) are confirmed or highly probable losses (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25). Pipeline is structurally non-functional, requiring heavy mu_hat inflation for any procurement. Actual L=3.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing massive systemic failure. Approximately 1,320 units in-transit (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25) are effectively lost or permanently delayed, yet they remain in the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than actual demand to ensure the (base_stock - pipeline) calculation produces a non-zero order. Current demand is stable around 100-110 units. With an actual lead time of 2-3 periods (recent orders P26, P27, P28 arrived in 2 periods), a healthy base stock should be ~440 units (4 periods * 110). However, since the OR engine sees 1,740 units in transit, it will order 0 unless mu_hat is inflated. I am increasing mu_hat to 2100 to force a target base stock that exceeds the 'phantom' pipeline, ensuring consistent procurement and stock availability for the next few periods while on-hand inventory is present (213 units).

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure confirmed: ~1,320 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25) are confirmed or highly probable losses. OR pipeline inventory is permanently distorted by these phantom units. Recent lead time for successful arrivals has stabilized at 2 periods (P26, P27, P28).

LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive systemic failure, with approximately 1,600 units in the pipeline (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25) confirmed or highly likely lost. These 'phantom units' bloat the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation, preventing it from placing new orders. Recent successful arrivals (P26, P27, P28) show a stabilized lead time of 2 periods. Demand is stable around 100-110 units. To bypass the broken pipeline logic, I must explicitly set 'mu_hat' to a value that exceeds both the phantom pipeline and the required base stock. Current in-transit is 1919; roughly 1600 are lost. Real pipeline is ~300. To ensure the engine orders enough to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) (~330 units) despite the 1919 'in-transit' figure, mu_hat must be set significantly higher than its usual calculation. Setting mu_hat to 2250 (In-transit ~1919 + 3 periods of demand ~330) to force procurement.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for surviving orders has stabilized at 2 periods (confirmed by P28, P29, P30 concludes). Systemic losses total approx 1,600 units, necessitating extreme mu_hat inflation to counteract pipeline bloat.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100-110 units in the recent regime. However, the supply chain is severely disrupted. The In-transit figure of 1,976 units is dominated by confirmed or highly probable losses from periods P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, and P25, totaling approximately 1,600 'phantom' units. The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from its base stock calculation. Therefore, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass this calculation. Recent successful deliveries (P26, P27, P28, P31) show that lead time has actually improved to 1-2 periods for surviving orders. To ensure the engine places an order despite the 1,976 in-transit units, I set mu_hat to 2,500 (representing expected demand plus the ~1,600 phantom units to be offset) and L to 2 to reflect the recent stabilized lead time.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure: ~1,600 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25) are confirmed or highly probable losses. Any successful order placement requires mu_hat inflation to counteract this pipeline bloat. Recent successful deliveries (P28-P32) indicate a lead time of 1-2 periods for orders that aren't lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $126.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a massive pipeline distortion issue. Total in-transit inventory is 2079 units, but at least 1660 units are confirmed or highly probable losses from early and mid-game periods (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25). If we do not adjust mu_hat, the OR backend's formula [base_stock - pipeline_inventory] will result in zero orders because it believes over 2000 units are coming. Recent successful deliveries (P31 arriving in P32, P32 arriving in P33) show an actual lead time of 1 period for surviving orders, even though the promise is 2. Demand is stable around 110-120 units. To force an order that covers next-period demand plus a buffer, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to 2100 (representing approx 1700 phantom units + 400 for 3 periods of expected demand). This bypasses the pipeline bloat and allows the capped policy to function. L is set to 1 based on recent successful arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for successful non-lost orders has stabilized at 1-2 periods (observed P31-P33). Total pipeline phantom units (lost orders) estimated at ~1,660 units, necessitating continued mu_hat inflation to allow the OR engine to place new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is suffering from massive systemic lead-time failures, with approximately 1,600-1,800 units in the pipeline confirmed as lost (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25). This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR engine from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To move inventory, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock target beyond the phantom count. Recent demand has stabilized around 110 units/period. For non-lost orders, the effective lead time has shortened to 1-2 periods (observed in P31-P33). I am setting L=1 (explicit) to reflect this recent agility for successful deliveries, while setting mu_hat to 2,500 to 'pierce' through the ~2,079 phantom in-transit units and ensure a small order is triggered if needed, though current on-hand (265) provides a short buffer.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure remains critical: ~85-90% of in-transit inventory consists of lost phantom units. Recent lead time for successful deliveries has shifted from 3 periods down to 1-2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive systemic failure, with approximately 1,660 units from historical orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25) confirmed or highly probable losses. These 'phantom units' bloat the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation, preventing it from placing necessary new orders unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated. Recent successful arrivals (P26, P27, P28, P31, P32) show a lead time of 1-2 periods for orders that aren't lost, so L=2 is used. Demand is currently stable around 100-110 units. To bypass the ~1,660 phantom units across a (1+L)=3 period horizon, mu_hat is set to roughly (3 * 110) + 1,660 = 1,990. Sigma_hat is set at 150 to provide a sufficient buffer for demand volatility without triggering excessive holding costs on actual inventory.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure baseline: ~1,660 units in the 'In-transit' view are confirmed/highly probable losses. This requires explicit mu_hat inflation reaching values near 2,000 to force the OR backend's order logic to overcome the pipeline bloat. Effective lead time for non-lost orders is currently 1-2 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive systemic failure, with approximately 1,600-1,800 units in the 'In-transit' inventory identified as confirmed or highly probable losses (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25, and now likely P33). At Period 37, 'In-transit' shows 2,261 units, which is dangerously bloated by these phantom orders. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline inventory (2,261) from the base stock calculation, any order placement requires using an 'explicit' mu_hat value that exceeds the phantom units plus the required buffer. Recent demand has stabilized around 110 units, but recent deliveries (P31, P32) show a lead time of 1 period for surviving orders, while older successful ones were 2-3 periods. I will use L=1 to reflect the most recent successful delivery speed. To trigger a new order despite the 2,261 phantom pipeline units, I set mu_hat to 2,400. This should force the OR engine to overcome the pipeline deduction and secure stock for the remaining 13 periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory is now ~85% phantom units (lost orders P2-P25 and potentially P33). Actual lead time for surviving non-lost orders has shortened to 1-2 periods (observed P31-P32).

Daily Reward (R_t): $256.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised by 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that haven't arrived for many periods beyond the promised lead time (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25). The OR engine subtracts all 'In-transit' units (2175) from its target base stock. Since approximately 1,600-1,800 of these units are confirmed or highly probable losses, the OR engine will never place a new order unless we artificially inflate the demand parameter (mu_hat) to exceed the phantom bloat. Recent demand has stabilized around 100-110 units per period. I am setting mu_hat to 2200 to neutralize the 2175 in-transit units and target a small buffer. Lead time for non-lost orders has stabilized at 2 periods (observed in P31, P32, P35 concludes).

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure baseline update: In-transit inventory contains ~1,800 units of 'phantom' stock (lost orders P2-P25). Sustained mu_hat inflation > 2000 is required to force procurement. Lead time for successful deliveries remains stable at 2 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from extreme pipeline bloat due to approximately 1,800 units of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25, and potentially P33). The In-transit count of 2,180 is ~82.5% phantom stock. To trigger any procurement from the OR backend (which subtracts the full 2,180 from the base stock), mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds the phantom units plus desired on-hand stock. Recent demand (P31-P38) averages 97 units, but the previous regime was ~118. I will continue to use mu_hat = 2200 as a 'forcing function' to counteract the pipeline distortion. Actual lead time for surviving orders is consistently 2 periods (as seen in P37 conclude), so L is set to explicit 2. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure baseline update: In-transit inventory contains ~1,800 units of 'phantom' stock (lost orders P2-P25). Sustained mu_hat inflation > 2000 is required to force procurement. Lead time for successful deliveries remains stable at 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $164.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from extreme pipeline distortion due to approximately 1,800 units of 'phantom' stock\u2014orders from early to mid-game (P2-P25) that are confirmed or highly probable losses. As of Period 40, the 'In-transit' count is 2196, but on-hand is 0. If we use the OR engine's default logic, it will subtract the 2196 units from any base stock calculation, resulting in zero new orders. Recent successful deliveries (P35, P38) show that non-lost orders have a lead time of 1-2 periods. Demand has returned to the initial regime of ~110-120 units. To bypass the backend's subtraction of 2,196 phantom units and ensure we order enough to cover approximately 330 units (3 periods of demand at 110/period), I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 2,550. This value (2,550 - 2,196 = 354) should trigger an order of approximately 350 units, effectively resetting our inventory position to bridge the next few periods.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure remains the dominant factor: ~1,800 units of in-transit inventory are 'phantom' stock (lost orders). Successful arrivals (P35, P38) indicate a functional lead time of 1-2 periods for new orders. Continued mu_hat inflation > 2000 is necessary until phantom units are either purged or the game ends.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to maximize reward. Currently, the SKU is facing a 'stockout' state with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' inventory of 2557 units is significantly distorted by 'phantom units'\u2014orders placed many periods ago (specifically P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25, and P33) that have not arrived and are highly likely lost. I estimate approximately 2100-2200 units in the pipeline are lost. To trigger a new order from the OR backend, which subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, I must provide an 'explicit' mu_hat that exceeds the sum of the desired base stock and the phantom pipeline bloat. Recent arrivals (P38, P39) suggest a functional lead time of 1-2 periods for orders that actually survive. I will set L=2 to be safe. Recent demand fluctuates around 100-110 units. To bypass the ~2200 phantom units and aim for a target inventory of ~300 (covering ~2-3 periods of demand), I set mu_hat to 2600. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to manage the volatility and ensure a high service level given the supply unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure update: In-transit inventory contains roughly 2100-2200 'phantom' units (lost orders). Successful deliveries recently show a lead time of 1-2 periods. Continued extreme mu_hat inflation (>2500) is required to force procurement against the broken pipeline logic.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from extreme systemic supply failure. The 'In-transit' inventory of 2727 units is over 90% 'phantom' stock (lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25, P33, etc.). The OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) results in zero orders because it believes nearly 3,000 units are coming. To force procurement and prevent stockouts, I must provide an 'explicit' mu_hat that exceeds several periods of demand plus the phantom inventory. Current demand is stable at ~105 units/period. Recent successful arrivals (P38, P39) confirm a functional lead time of 1-2 periods for non-lost orders. I will set L to 2, and mu_hat to 3100 to ensure the backend logic (3100 - ~2727) results in a meaningful net order of approximately 300-400 units to cover near-term demand.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory contains roughly 2400-2500 'phantom' units (confirmed/highly probable lost orders). Successful deliveries recently show a lead time of 1-2 periods. Continued extreme mu_hat inflation (>3000) is required to bypass the broken pipeline logic.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by a systemic supply chain failure where a significant majority of 'In-transit' units are confirmed or highly probable losses (phantom units). As of Period 43, the In-transit count is 3,139. Based on the history of successful deliveries, the viable pipeline likely only consists of orders from Periods 40, 41, and 42 (summing to 382+170+412 = 964 units). The remaining ~2,175 units in the pipeline are 'phantom' stock that the OR engine will incorrectly subtract from the order quantity. To force the OR engine to place an order, mu_hat must be explicitly set to a value that exceeds this phantom bloat plus the safety stock and lead-time demand. Average demand has stabilized around 110 units. With a functioning lead time of 2 periods (L=2) and roughly 2,175 phantom units, a mu_hat of 3,500 is required to ensure the 'base_stock - pipeline' logic results in a positive order that covers current needs. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to ensure a high service level cap.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure update: In-transit inventory contains approximately 2175 'phantom' units (confirmed/highly probable lost orders up to Period 37, excluding recent P40-42). Recent successful deliveries show a lead time of 1-2 periods. Extreme mu_hat inflation (>3500) is required to bypass the broken pipeline logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from systemic losses. The in-transit inventory of 3,245 units is approximately 90% 'phantom' or lost stock (orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33). Specifically, P40 arrived in Period 43 (L=3), but many intervening orders (P33, etc.) are significantly overdue. To force the OR backend to place orders despite this massive (but fake) pipeline inventory, I must explicitly set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline. Demand is stable around 100-110 units. With roughly 2,900+ units in the pipeline likely lost, a mu_hat of 4,000 is necessary to ensure the engine targets an order to maintain service levels. Calculated lead time for surviving orders is approximately 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure update: In-transit inventory contains approximately 2,900-3,000 'phantom' units (confirmed/highly probable lost orders). Recent successful deliveries (P38, P39, P40) show a lead time of 1-3 periods. Extreme mu_hat inflation (>4000) is required to bypass the broken pipeline logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face massive supply chain disruption with approximately 85-90% of the in-transit inventory being 'phantom' stock (lost orders, primarily dating back to Period 2 through Period 37). Specifically, orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25, P33, P34, and P36 have likely failed, creating a cumulative pipeline bloat of approximately 3,100 to 3,200 units. To place any new orders, the OR backend's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) must be bypassed by inflating mu_hat to a level that exceeds the phantom pipeline. Recent successful arrivals from P40 and P41 show that the lead time for non-lost orders is currently 3 periods. Demand has remained relatively stable around the historical average of 100-110 units. With the game ending at Period 50, I will maintain high mu_hat inflation at 4,500 to ensure replenishment orders are triggered despite the broken pipeline statistics.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure update: Total phantom units (lost orders) in pipeline estimated at ~3,150. Lead time for successful arrivals is currently 3 periods (observed P43-P44 concludes). Extreme mu_hat inflation (>4000) remains mandatory to force procurement.

Daily Profit: $324.00, Daily Holding Cost: $1139.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-815.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 50. The game is nearing its conclusion. Current on-hand inventory is high (1139 units) following a large arrival of 900 units from Periods 42 and 43. The system remains plagued by 'phantom' in-transit inventory\u2014approximately 3,150 units from previous lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25, P33, P35, etc.) that the OR engine incorrectly subtracts from its base stock calculation. To ensure the engine continues to place orders if demand spikes in the final periods, we must maintain extreme mu_hat inflation. However, with 1139 units on hand and only 4 periods remaining, and a lead time of 2-3 periods, any order placed now (P46) would arrive in P48 or P49. We already have orders from P44 (491 units) and P45 (668 units) in the pipeline, which are likely to arrive before the end. Total viable inventory (On-hand 1139 + P44 491 + P45 668) is ~2300 units, which is far more than the expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (~440 units). Consequently, we should stop ordering to avoid excessive holding costs. To force an order of 0, we can use the default settings since the pipeline distortion (3334 units) will naturally result in a zero order as it exceeds any reasonable base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure remains at ~3,150 phantom units. With 4 periods remaining and high on-hand levels plus pending viable P44-P45 orders, the inventory position is now sufficient to cover all remaining demand till Period 50.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-389.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 of 50. On-hand inventory is 989 units, which is significantly high. Demand over the last 10 periods (P37-P46) has averaged approximately 104 units per period. With only 4 periods remaining (P47, P48, P49, P50), the total expected demand is approximately 416 units. Our current on-hand inventory of 989 units is more than double the total remaining demand for the game. Any further orders would only increase holding costs without contributing to sales. The 'In-transit' figure of 3334 is heavily inflated by the systemic supply losses documented in the carry-over insights (P2, P6, P15, etc.), but regardless of pipeline viability, current physical stock is sufficient to meet a 99%+ service level through the end of the simulation. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure a zero order is placed.

Carry-over insight: Ending game phase: Current on-hand inventory (989) covers >2x the remaining total game demand (~416); zero further procurement required.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-429.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 877 units. Based on historical data, the average demand is approximately 100-110 units per period. With only 3 periods of demand remaining (Periods 48, 49, and 50), the total expected demand is roughly 300-330 units. The current on-hand inventory (877) significantly exceeds this requirement. Any additional orders placed now would arrive too late and only increase holding costs, negatively impacting total reward. Therefore, I am setting parameters to ensure the OR engine places no further orders for the remainder of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-442.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 790 units. Historical demand has stabilized around a mean of 110 units per period (the P44-P48 average is ~118, while the long-term average is lower). With only two periods remaining in the game (Period 49 and Period 50), the total expected demand is approximately 220-250 units. My current on-hand stock of 790 units is more than triple the remaining demand, ensuring a 100% service level without further procurement. Any additional orders would only increase holding costs and reduce total reward, especially given the high volume of 'phantom' units (approximately 3,150 units) currently in the 'In-transit' pipeline that already bloat the OR engine's logic. L is set to default (2), and mu_hat is set to a minimal value (1) to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in zero new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-455.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final period of the game. The current on-hand inventory is 723 units, which is more than sufficient to cover any potential demand for this final period (historical peak demand is 154). No further orders are needed as the game concludes at the end of this period. Total reward for the final period is maximized by avoiding unnecessary procurement and utilizing existing stock, as any ending inventory at the end of Period 50 will incur holding costs without the possibility of future sales. The 'In-transit' inventory remains heavily inflated by the cumulative historical losses (~3,000+ units), but this no longer affects our strategy since we are opting for zero procurement.
