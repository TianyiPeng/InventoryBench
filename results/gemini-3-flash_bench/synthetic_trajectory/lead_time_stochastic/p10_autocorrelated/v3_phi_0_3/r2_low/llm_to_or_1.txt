Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P1-P5 from historical data) is [80, 120, 120, 93, 177], with a mean of 118 and a standard deviation of approximately 37. Since this is the very first decision phase and we have no observed delivery history or confirmed regime shifts, the default parameters based on the full historical sample are appropriate. The inventory starts at 0, and the pipeline is empty, so the OR backend will calculate a base stock level to cover (1+L) periods, which is 3 periods of expected demand (approx 354 units).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The order placed in Period 1 (180 units) will arrive during Period 3 (due topromised lead time L=2). Consequently, on-hand remains 0 for this period, and we missed demand in Period 1. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows Period 1: 80, Period 2: 120, Period 3: 120, Period 4: 93, Period 5: 177, but the live Period 1 observation showed demand of 106. The mean of all historical samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177, 106) is approximately 116. Given L=2, the backend uses (L+1) = 3 periods for its base stock calculation. I will use 'default' methods to establish a baseline as there is not yet enough evidence of a sustained demand shift or lead time deviation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (180 units) and Period 2 (168 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the 2-period lead time rule, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 4 start message. Therefore, current on-hand is 0 and we have experienced lost sales because initial inventory was 0. Historical demand shows 106 and 111 in the first two periods, which is slightly higher than the pre-game samples (avg ~98). Since we have no confirmed arrivals yet, we cannot infer an actual lead time deviation. I will use the default lead time (2) and recent_N for demand to capture the slightly higher initial activity.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (180 units) were expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0, meaning the Period 1 order is delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. This has resulted in a stockout (0 units sold vs 107 demand in Period 3). The pipeline currently contains orders from P1 (180), P2 (168), and P3 (46), totaling 394 units. Demand has been stable across periods 1-3 (106, 111, 107), which is higher than the initial history provided (avg ~100 vs ~118). I will set L to 3 to account for the observed delay and use the last 3 periods of demand (avg 108) to set mu_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased demand and longer lead time while we wait for the pipeline to clear.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time for chips(Regular) is at least 3 periods (Period 1 order did not arrive by Period 3 conclude).

Daily Profit: $138.00, Daily Holding Cost: $88.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the 'Period 4 conclude' message which confirms a significant lead-time variability. Specifically, the order from Period 1 arrived after 3 periods, while the order from Period 3 arrived after only 1 period. The order from Period 2 (168 units) is still in-transit. This inconsistency suggests that the 'promised' lead time of 2 is unreliable. I will set L to 2 (the promised average) but use the 'calculate' method to let the backend incorporate the observed 1 and 3-period lead times. Demand has shown an upward trend: [106, 111, 107, 138], with Period 4 being a notable jump. With the current on-hand inventory (88) and one large shipment (168) still in-transit, I will use recent_N (N=4) to forecast demand based on the latest data trends, ensuring the base stock level accounts for the recent spike to 138 units.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed for chips(Regular): observed instances of 1 period and 3 periods, deviating from promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand (103) in Period 5 exceeded availability (88). Current in-transit is 347 units (from Period 2, 4, and 5). Looking at arrival history: Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods (Period 4), and Period 3 order arrived in 1 period (Period 4). The Period 2 order (168 units) is still missing after 4 periods (ordered P2, currently P6 start), which suggests it might be lost or significantly delayed, as it should have arrived by Period 5 if lead time was 3. Demand over the last 5 periods has been [106, 111, 107, 138, 103], with an average of 113. Given the stockout and the missing Period 2 shipment, I need to increase the lead time parameter to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer window (L+1=4 periods). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the full history available which shows stable demand around 113.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Possible lost shipment for P2 order (168 units) - not arrived by P5 conclude (4 periods elapsed).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 452 in-transit. History shows significant lead time instability: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and the P2 order (168 units) is likely lost as it hasn't arrived after 4 periods (P2 to P6 conclude). Recent demand has dropped significantly in Period 6 (42 units) compared to the previous average (~113). Because of the high lead time uncertainty and the likely lost shipment, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to ensure the backend accounts for a longer pipeline. For demand, I'll use recent_N=3 to capture the recent volatility and the sharp drop in Period 6, which helps prevent over-ordering if the demand is indeed shifting downwards.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Loss of Period 2 order (168 units) highly probable (5 periods since order, promised 2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods (P3-P7) averages ~94.6. The order from Period 2 (168 units) is definitively lost (6 periods elapsed, L=2 promised). We have observed lead times of 1, 3, and 3 periods, suggesting an average lead time closer to 2.5-3.0 periods rather than 2. The pipeline inventory (414 units) includes the lost P2 order (168 units), meaning the effective pipeline is only 246 units (P5, P6 orders). Given the lost shipment and ongoing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for three consecutive periods), I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of the last 5 samples (~95) multiplied by (1+L). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N to capture the recent volatility. The OR backend will subtract the 414 units (pipeline) from the target, but since 168 are lost, my high L=3 target should help trigger a replenishment order to cover the gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Permanent loss of Period 2 order (168 units) confirmed; effective pipeline inventory is 168 units lower than reported.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 47 units. Historical demand shows a mean of ~103 units across 8 periods (106, 111, 107, 138, 103, 42, 83, 94). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have been volatile (3, 1, 3, 3). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (168 units) is confirmed lost, as 7 periods have elapsed since it was placed. The backend 'pipeline inventory' likely still includes this lost 168, so the real pipeline is 273 - 168 = 105 units (consisting of Period 6's order of 105 units). To compensate for the lost shipment and prevent stockouts, I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and using mu_hat/sigma_hat with recent_N=5 (capturing the most recent demand fluctuations). To force the OR backend to ignore the phantom 168 units in the pipeline and place a curative order, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it to the desired base stock plus the volume of the lost order: (1+3)*103 + 168 = 580. This ensures the calculation (base_stock - 273) results in an order that accounts for the missing stock.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the supply chain for chips(Regular) continues to be highly unreliable. We have seen lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, and the order from Period 2 (168 units) is officially considered lost. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure is 476, but this includes the lost 168 units from P2, making the effective pipeline 308 units (P6: 105, P9: 203). To compensate for the lost stock and the 3-period lead time observed in most successful arrivals (P1, P4, P5), I am setting L to 3. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging ~102 units over the last 9 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility (avg ~84 in last 5, but with high variance due to stockouts). By setting L=3, the mu_hat calculation (1+L)*mean will target a base stock covering 4 periods of demand, which helps buffer against the frequent stockouts and delivery delays seen so far.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 476 in-transit. Based on history, the Period 2 order (168 units) is confirmed lost, as it has not arrived after 8 periods. The true pipeline inventory is actually 308 (476 total in-transit - 168 lost). Historical Lead Time (L) observations are 3, 1, 3, 3 periods. The average is 2.5, but the system is consistently hitting a lead time of 3 periods in recent cycles (P4, P5, P8 conclude messages). I will set L to 'explicit' value of 3 to reflect this shift from the promised 2. Demand mean is approximately 93 units per period (sum of P1-P10 demand/10). With L=3, the mu_hat (covering L+1 periods) should be around 372 units. The OR backend subtracts the reported pipeline (476) from the base_stock. To compensate for the 168 hidden 'missing' units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for this gap: 372 (forecast) + 168 (compensation) = 540. This ensures the OR engine places an order to replace the lost units. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to provide a safety buffer given the high lead time variability and recent stockouts.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing significant stockouts. The inventory on-hand is 0, and the last 3 periods (P9, P10, P11) have seen zero sales due to non-arrival of orders. The history shows a highly unreliable lead time: observed L values include 1, 3, 3, and 3 periods, plus the definite loss of the P2 order (168 units) and the likely loss of the P6 order (105 units, ordered 6 periods ago, promised 2). This means the 'In-transit' of 540 units is misleading; it likely includes 105 dead units from P6. The actual pipeline is probably closer to 435 units (Orders from P9 and P11). Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~94 in the last few periods. Because lead time is frequently 3 periods instead of 2, I will set L to 3 and use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level. Setting L to 3 increases the base stock target to cover the longer lead time and the current period. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to focus on the post-volatility demand average (~94 units/period), allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Likely loss of Period 6 order (105 units); including P2 and P6 losses, total pipeline inventory is inflated by 273 units in system reports.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 119. Reported In-transit is 337. However, historical evidence confirms the loss of the Period 2 order (168 units) and the likely loss of the Period 6 order (105 units). The real pipeline inventory is 337 - 168 - 105 = 64 units (the order from Period 11). 

Lead Time Analysis: Observed lead times are predominantly 3 periods (Period 1, 4, 5, and 9 all took 3 periods), with one outlier of 1 period. The promised 2-period lead time is unreliable; I will use L=3 to ensure a higher safety coverage.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been relatively stable around 80-100 units (P7: 83, P8: 94, P9: 97, P10: 53, P11: 97, P12: 84). The average of the last 6 periods is ~85. Given L=3, the mu_hat should cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand. 

Correcting for Pipeline Inflation: The OR engine uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders. Since it thinks I have 337 units coming (when only 64 are coming), I must artificially inflate mu_hat to 'mask' the lost units (273 units) to force an order. Approximate required base stock = 4 * 100 (demand) + buffer = 450. The engine sees Pipeline = 337 + On-hand = 119 (Total 456). Without adjustment, the engine will order 0. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost stock and current demand needs.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14. Demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable, with the last 5 periods (P9-P13) averaging 82 units/period. The main challenge is the high lead time variability and order loss. Observation of 'Period X conclude' messages shows actual lead times of 3, 1, 3, 3, and 3 periods (average ~2.6). Critically, orders from P2 (168 units) and P6 (105 units) are significantly delayed (12 and 8 periods respectively) and are confirmed lost. The current system reported 'In-transit' is 545 units, but this includes the 273 units from lost orders P2 and P6. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 545 - 273 = 272 units. To compensate for this inflation in the OR backend's capped policy calculation, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3.0 to reflect recent arrival patterns and an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for the (L+1) window (4 periods) as 4 * 85 = 340. However, because the backend subtracts the inflated pipeline (545) from the base stock, I must inflate mu_hat by the lost quantity (273) to ensure a high enough order is placed: 340 + 273 = 613. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Total pipeline inventory inflation confirmed at 273 units due to lost orders from P2 (168) and P6 (105). Effective lead time stabilized at 3 periods for recent arrivals.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 16 units. The system reports 509 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 2 (168 units) and Period 6 (105 units) are lost, totaling 273 phantom units. The true effective pipeline is 509 - 273 = 236 units. Lead times for the last five successful arrivals (P1, P3, P4, P5, P9, P11) have averaged 2.67 periods, with the most recent four arrivals all taking exactly 3 periods (P4, P5, P9, P11), compared to the promised 2. I will use 'explicit' L=3 to reflect this shift. Mean demand over the last 14 periods is approximately 91.9 units. To account for the 3-period lead time (covering 1+3=4 periods of demand), mu_hat is set to 368 using the 'recent_N' method (N=14) to capture the stable but variable nature of demand. Sigma_hat is calculated using 'recent_N' (N=14) to maintain an appropriate safety stock buffer given the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (target service level = 50%). Setting L=3 and using recent demand history helps the OR backend correctly calculate the base stock while I manually account for the pipeline inflation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face an on-hand inventory of 0 and a reported in-transit value of 509. According to history and carry-over insights, the pipeline is inflated by exactly 273 units due to lost shipments from Period 2 (168) and Period 6 (105). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 236 units (509 - 273). These 236 units correspond to orders from P13 (208) and P14 (28). Recent arrivals (P4, P7, P8, P12, P14) clearly show that the actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods rather than the promised 2. Demand remains relatively stable with the most recent 5-period average (P11-P15) being approximately 85 units per period. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1)=4 period horizon despite the phantom pipeline inventory, I am setting L=3 and using an explicit mu_hat. I calculate target base stock for a (3+1) period cycle: 85 demand/period * 4 periods = 340 units. Since the backend subtracts pipeline (509) from the base_stock, I must provide a mu_hat that, when used in the formula 'base_stock - 509', results in the correct order quantity. However, to keep it simple and effective, I'll set L=3 and a mu_hat based on the last 5 samples to capture the slight downward trend in demand, while the OR engine will naturally account for the safety stock based on the profit/holding cost balance.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 90-100 units per period. Specifically, the mean of the last 10 periods (P7-P16) is approx 88.7. The lead time (L) has consistently been 3 periods for the last four successful arrivals (P11, P9, P5, P4 orders), despite the promised 2. I will set actual L=3 to ensure a (L+1)=4 period coverage. Two orders are confirmed lost: P2 (168 units) and P6 (105 units), totaling 273 units. The 'In-transit' figure is currently 301. Subtracting 273 units of 'ghost' inventory leaves an effective pipeline of 28 units (which matches the P14 order). With an On-hand of 76, the total effective inventory is 104 units. To cover 4 periods of demand (~360 units), the OR backend needs to order significantly. I will use recent_N=10 for demand forecasting to capture this stability while smoothing minor fluctuations, and set L=3 explicitly to account for the consistent delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown an upward shift, with the last two periods averaging 132 units compared to the overall historical mean of ~98. Specifically, the last 4 periods average 107.5. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this trend. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 273 units is entirely composed of lost orders from Period 2 (168) and Period 6 (105), confirmed by history. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Since the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from base_stock, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to offset this 273-unit deficit. Based on a lead time of 3 periods (observed consistently for all recent arrivals) and a forecast of ~110 units per period, the desired base_stock for a 4-period window (L+1) is 440 units. To ensure the backend orders enough despite the phantom 273 units in transit, I set mu_hat to 713 (desired 440 + 273 offset). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture recent volatility accurately.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a reported pipeline (In-transit) of 491 units. Based on history and carry-over insights, the pipeline consists of orders from P2 (168 units) and P6 (105 units) which are confirmed lost, totaling 273 units. Additionally, recent orders from P18 (218 units) are in transit. The effective pipeline is actually 491 - 273 = 218 units. This mismatch causes the OR backend to severely under-order because it assumes 491 units are arriving. Observation of historical arrivals (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P13, P14) consistently shows an actual lead time (L) of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. To compensate for the 273 lost units and the lead time of 3, I am setting L=3 and using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~100 units/period based on recent history. For a lead time L=3, the target base stock (covering L+1 periods) should be ~400 units. Since the effective pipeline is 218, the backend needs to order ~182 units. By setting mu_hat to 455 (explicit), I am forcing the backend to reconcile the phantom 273 units in its inventory logic while accounting for the target base stock (455 - 273 = 182 units order).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the system reports 0 on-hand inventory and 491 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the pipeline inventory is significantly inflated by lost shipments from Period 2 (168 units) and Period 6 (105 units), totaling 273 units that will likely never arrive. The actual effective pipeline is 218 units (the order from P18). Furthermore, observed lead times have stabilized at 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. Demand remains relatively stable, with a recent mean of approximately 100 units. To compensate for the 273 lost units and ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time (L=3) plus the current period (L+1=4), I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 and an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * mean_demand + adjustment_for_loss. Using a mean demand of 100, the baseline (1+3)*100 = 400. To offset the 273 units that the OR engine incorrectly thinks are in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 673. This forces the engine to recognize the need for more stock. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' to capture the current volatility across the longer lead time.

Carry-over insight: Total pipeline inflation of 273 units confirmed (P2: 168, P6: 105). Lead time is consistently 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit inventory of 673 units. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, the pipeline inventory reported by the system is inflated by 273 units due to lost shipments from Period 2 (168 units) and Period 6 (105 units). The effective pipeline inventory is actually 400 units (673 - 273). The actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed consistently for orders from P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P13, and P14). Demand in the most recent period (P20) spiked to 186, while the previous average was closer to 100. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), the average demand is ~127 units. To ensure sufficient stock given the 3-period lead time (L=3 requires covering 4 periods of demand), I am setting L explicitly to 3 and forecasting demand (mu_hat) using recent history to capture the current upward trend, while increasing sigma_hat to account for the recent demand volatility (186 in P20 vs 81 in P18).

Carry-over insight: Period 21: High demand spike observed in Period 20 (186 units); monitoring for a sustained regime shift above the 100-unit average.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we continue to manage a difficult lead-time environment where actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods, despite the promised 2. A major concern is the 273 units of inflated pipeline inventory from confirmed lost shipments in P2 (168) and P6 (105). System reports show 673 units in-transit, but the effective pipeline is only 400 (P18: 218, P20: 182). Demand has shifted upwards significantly; the last two periods saw 186 and 167 units, compared to the earlier average of ~100. This suggests a new high-demand regime. To account for the 3-period lead time and this spike, I am setting L to explicit 3. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=2 to capture the current demand burst (avg ~176.5) and projecting it across the (L+1) window, resulting in 176.5 * 4 = 706. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=3 to reflect the increased volatility. Because the OR backend's 'cap' and 'final order' logic uses the inflated in-transit total (673), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the base stock target, effectively 'hiding' the lost inventory from the subtraction. Target base stock needs to be ~706 + safety stock. Given current in-transit (673), setting mu_hat to 800 ensures a small supplemental order is placed to cover the recent demand spike and bridge the gap created by lost units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 20: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~176 (+76%) over the last 2 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 800 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms loss of orders from P2 (168 units) and P6 (105 units), totaling 273 units. The effective pipeline is actually 527 units. A demand regime shift occurred at Period 20; average demand over the last 3 periods (P20-P22) has risen to approximately 158 units (186, 167, 120), significantly higher than the previous 100-unit average. Lead times have stabilized at 3 periods for recent arrivals. To account for the 3-period lead time and the new demand regime, I am setting L to 3 and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the current high-demand state while ignoring the older, lower-demand data. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects a (1+L) period demand forecast of approximately 632 units (4 * 158), helping to overcome the current stockout and reconcile the inflated pipeline inventory report.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at P20: average demand increased from ~100 to ~158 (+58%) based on P20-P22 data.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 20. The mean demand for the last four periods (P20-P23) is 151.5 units (186, 167, 120, 133), which is significantly higher than the initial ~100-unit average. Lead times have consistently stabilized at 3 periods for most orders, although we occasionally see 1-period arrivals (as seen with the P22 order). Crucially, we have two lost orders (P2: 168 units and P6: 105 units) totaling 273 units that remain in the 'In-transit' figure but will never arrive. To account for this, I am setting L to 3 (the effective stable lead time) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * 151.5 = 606. To correct for the 273 phantom units in pipeline inventory, I add 273 to the mu_hat calculation (606 + 273 = 879), forcing the OR backend to place an order that restores the intended base stock level. Sigma_hat is set based on the standard deviation of the recent regime (approx 30.5) scaled by sqrt(1+L), resulting in roughly 61.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at P20 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~100 to 151.5 units (+51.5%) over P20-P23.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P20-P24) shows a shift from an average of ~100 to ~143.6 units per period. I will use N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volatility and mean. Historical evidence confirms 273 units in reported pipeline inventory are permanently lost (P2: 168, P6: 105). Real pipeline inventory is 430 units (703 - 273). Observed lead times are predominantly 3 periods (with occasional 1-period outliers). Setting L=3 (explicit) ensures the backend calculates base stock for a 3-period lead time. Because the backend's capped policy uses current In-transit (703) to calculate the final order, but 273 of those units don't exist, I set mu_hat explicitly to account for this gap. Target base stock = (1+L)*Mean + Z*Sigma*sqrt(1+L). With L=3, Mean=143.6, Std=30.3, and q=0.5 (Z=0), base stock \u2248 574. To force the OR engine to order enough despite the 273-unit phantom inventory, I set mu_hat = 574 + 273 = 847.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at P20 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~100 to 143.6 units over the last 5 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift since Period 20. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P20-P25) is approximately 144.17 units (186, 167, 120, 133, 112, 147), which is a significant increase from the earlier baseline of ~100. Lead times have stabilized at 3 periods for the majority of arrivals (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P13, P14, P20), though occasional fluctuations occur (P3, P22). There is a confirmed pipeline inflation of 273 units due to lost shipments from P2 (168 units) and P6 (105 units). The reported in-transit of 783 units includes these 273 ghosts, making the effective in-transit only 510 units. With on-hand at 0 and a target lead time of 3, the current effective inventory position is fragile. I will set L to 3 and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the shift to ~144 units/period, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at P20 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~100 to 144.2 units over P20-P25. Pipeline inflation remains 273 units (P2/P6 losses).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting at Period 20. The mean demand for the last 7 periods (P20-P26) is approximately 140.7 units (186, 167, 120, 133, 112, 147, 120), significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~100 units. I will use N=7 for mu_hat. Actual lead time is consistently 3 periods based on recent history (P5, P9, P11, P13, P14, P20 orders all arrived with lead_time=3, despite occasional 1-period outliers). I will set L to 3. Pipeline inventory is currently 783 units. However, as documented in carry-over insights, 273 units of this (P2=168, P6=105) are permanently lost shipments. The effective pipeline inventory is 783 - 273 = 510 units. Since on-hand is 0, the total coverage is only 510 units. With L=3, the coverage needs to span (L+1)=4 periods. 4 periods * 140.7 units/period = 562.8 units. The current reported 'In-transit' of 783 is significantly inflated, causing the OR engine to under-order if I use 'default' or standard calculations. To force the OR backend to recognize the need for more stock, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the pipeline inflation. Specifically, I need the backend to see a gap. Estimated base stock target: (1+3) * 140.7 + Z * sigma \u2248 563 + safety stock. With 510 effective units and 783 reported, the system thinks it has 273 units it doesn't have. I will set mu_hat to 835 (which is 140.7 * 4 + 273) to offset the phantom inventory and trigger an order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at P20 confirmed: mean demand stabilized at ~140.7 units over P20-P26 (+40% vs historic).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift since Period 20, with the mean demand over P20-P27 being approximately 134 units, compared to the (~100 units) earlier baseline. Although Period 27 showed a dip to 89, the overall P20+ average remains elevated. Lead times are consistently around 3 periods, with occasional variations (1 period). Critically, there is documented pipeline inflation of 273 units from lost orders in Period 2 (168 units) and Period 6 (105 units). In-transit inventory is currently 835 units, but the effective pipeline is 835 - 273 = 562 units. Since on-hand inventory is 0, we must ensure parameters reflect the higher demand and the real inventory status. I set L to 3 (based on history) and mu_hat using the last 8 periods (recent_N=8) to capture the higher demand regime while smoothing the recent dip. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the recent 8 samples to account for current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at P20 confirmed: mean demand over P20-P27 is 134.25 units (+34% vs historic). Effective pipeline inventory is 273 units lower than reported (P2/P6 losses).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 20) continues to show a higher mean of approximately 136 units (P20: 186, P21: 167, P22: 120, P23: 133, P24: 112, P25: 147, P26: 120, P27: 89, P28: 115). While P27 and P28 were lower, the overall average since P20 remains significantly higher than the historic 100-unit average. Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the majority of arrivals (recent arrivals at P23 were lead time 1 and 3, but P21, P22, P24-P28 orders are still pending, fitting the L=3 pattern). Crucially, the system-reported 'In-transit' of 835 units is inflated by 273 units due to historical losses (P2: 168 and P6: 105), making the effective pipeline 562 units. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand regime with lead time delays, I am using an explicit L of 3 and explicit mu_hat based on (1+3) * 136 = 544 units. However, because the backend logic [base_stock - pipeline] will use the inflated 835 units, I must adjust mu_hat upward by the 273 lost units to ensure the desired order quantity is placed. Adjusted mu_hat = 544 + 273 = 817. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(4) * 30 (estimated std) = 60.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P20 remains elevated with a mean of ~136 units. Pipeline inflation of 273 units (P2: 168, P6: 105 losses) persists and requires mu_hat compensation to bypass backend order throttling.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is in a higher demand regime starting from Period 20, with mean demand from P20-P29 approximately 131 units. The backend OR engine uses a reported pipeline inventory that is inflated by 273 units due to lost orders (P2: 168, P6: 105). To counteract the order throttling caused by this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Target base stock calculation: Expected Lead Time (L=3) + Review Period (1) = 4 periods of demand. Base stock = 4 * 131 + Z*sigma. To bypass the backend's subtraction of the 783 units (which includes 273 phantom units), I set mu_hat = (Target Base Stock + 273). Target Base Stock ~ 524 + 100 = 624. Thus, mu_hat = 624 + 273 = 897. I set L=3 as the observed stable lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' for the current regime to capture the volatility of the higher demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Average demand since P20 remains stable at ~131 units. Pipeline inflation of 273 units persists, requiring explicit mu_hat adjustments to ensure sufficient ordering.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P20-P30) shows an average of ~131 units, significantly higher than the initial ~100 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 897 units; however, historical data confirms that orders from Period 2 (168 units) and Period 6 (105 units) are lost, totaling 273 phantom units. This inflation prevents the OR backend's capped policy from ordering enough to meet demand because it believes pipeline inventory is higher than it is. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the real demand (131 units over 1+L periods) PLUS the 273 units of lost pipeline inventory. With L=3 (the most frequent actual lead time), mu_hat = (131 * 4) + 273 = 797. This forces the backend to bypass the cap and place a necessary order. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent regime's volatility (std dev ~31), scaled for L=3: sqrt(4) * 31 = 62. Lead time L is set to 3 periods to reflect consistent operational reality over the game history.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P20-P31) shows an average demand of approximately 127.8 units per period, which is higher than the long-term historical average. The system reports an in-transit inventory of 897 units. However, based on extensive history, we have confirmed two lost shipments: P2 (168 units) and P6 (105 units), totaling 273 units of 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive. This makes the effective pipeline 624 units (897 - 273). Additionally, lead times have consistently settled at 3 periods (observed in most recent successful arrivals like P23 and P27, following a 3-period pattern). To compensate for the 273-unit pipeline inflation in the OR backend's logic [Order = Base Stock - Pipeline], I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat to [(1 + L) * expected_demand] + 273. With L=3 and expected_demand=128, the calculation is (4 * 128) + 273 = 785. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=12) to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime, ensuring the service level is maintained despite the stockout at the end of P31.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P20 onwards) has shown a mean of approximately 131 units, though very recent data (P29-P32) suggests it may be reverting closer to the historical 100-110 range. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 897 units in-transit. However, historical evidence (confirmed in Carry-over Insights) shows that 273 units in the pipeline are permanently lost (P2: 168 and P6: 105). This makes the effective pipeline 624 units (897 - 273). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover for these 'phantom' units and the elevated demand, I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and using explicit mu_hat. I estimate mu_hat as (1+L) * 125 = 500. This 125/period forecast accounts for the post-P20 elevated mean while slightly tempering the extreme spikes from earlier in the regime. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=13) to capture the volatility of this higher demand period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 897 units in-transit, but 273 units are confirmed lost (P2: 168, P6: 105), making the effective pipeline inventory 624 units. Since base_stock = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap), the backend will not order if it perceives the pipeline is full. To force orders and compensate for the 273 phantom units, I am using an explicit mu_hat. The demand regime starting at P20 has a mean of approximately 124.6 units (P20-P33). With an effective lead time (L) of 3, the target base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand plus safety stock. Target base stock should be roughly 4 * 125 + safety stock \u2248 650. Given on-hand is 0 and effective pipeline is 624, the OR engine needs to see a mu_hat that results in a base_stock significantly higher than 897 to generate an order. However, setting mu_hat too high may hit the backend 'cap'. I will set L to 3 (recent average) and mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for the lost units while maintaining the 125/period demand forecast.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 897 units in-transit, but historical evidence confirms a permanent loss of 273 units (P2: 168 and P6: 105), making the effective pipeline inventory 624 units. Furthermore, despite placing an order for 114 units in Period 30, nothing has arrived between Periods 31-34. The lead time for the P27 order was 2 periods, but many other orders (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P13, P14, P20) consistently arrived in 3 periods. The current streak of no arrivals for 4 periods suggests either another lost shipment or a significant lead time extension. Demand since the Period 20 spike has averaged approximately 117 units (P20-P34), though it has softened recently. To force the OR backend to order despite the inflated 'in-transit' figure, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate effective demand coverage needed for 4 periods (L=3 + 1) at approximately 120 units/period, but I must inflate this to offset the 273 phantom units (total base stock target approx 480 + 273 = 753). Setting mu_hat to 750 (representing roughly 187 units/period over 4 periods) to ensure the backend generates a corrective order to replenish the currently empty on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Prolonged arrival gap (P31-P34) following P30 order suggests increasing lead time instability or additional lost shipments beyond the confirmed 273 phantom units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 897 units for chips(Regular). However, historical data and carry-over insights confirm that at least 273 units are phantom inventory from lost shipments (P2: 168 units, P6: 105 units). Furthermore, the order from P30 (114 units) is now 5 periods overdue based on a promised lead time of 2, suggesting it may also be lost or severely delayed. This brings confirmed pipeline inflation to 273 units, with a high risk of 387 units. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to throttle new orders, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to override this inflation. The actual lead time has stabilized at L=3. Demand since P20 has averaged approximately 115 units, following an initial spike. I will set L=3 and use an explicit mu_hat = (1+3) * 115 + 273 = 733 to account for the current demand regime and bypass the 273 units of confirmed phantom inventory. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=16) to capture volatility since the P20 shift.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total confirmed pipeline inflation of 273 units (P2, P6) persists. Order from P30 (114 units) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting a third lost shipment; if not arrived by P37, pipeline inflation should be adjusted to 387.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37, the supply chain for chips(Regular) is in a critical state due to persistent lost shipments and lead time instability. Current On-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 897 units in-transit, but this includes confirmed losses: P2 (168 units) and P6 (105 units). Additionally, the order from P30 (114 units) is now 7 periods old (placed P30, now P37 start), which is 5 periods past the promised lead time and 4 periods past the recently observed 3-period lead time. This P30 order is now officially considered lost, bringing total pipeline inflation to 387 units (168+105+114). The average demand since the P20 regime shift is approximately 116 units (P20-P36). To trigger an order despite the backend's inflated pipeline view, I set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock using (L+1) * mean_demand + z * sigma. With L=3 and mean=116, the physical requirement is roughly 464 units + safety stock. Given the massive 387-unit phantom inventory blocking the OR backend, I must inflate mu_hat significantly to force an order that replenishes actual stock. Overcoming 387 phantom units requires a mu_hat around 900-1000 to ensure the base_stock calculation exceeds the reported pipeline (897 units).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Third lost shipment confirmed (Period 30 order, 114 units); total pipeline inflation updated to 387 units (P2, P6, P30). Effective pipeline is currently 510 units (897 reported - 387 lost).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 950 units in-transit, but 387 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P30), making the effective pipeline 563 units. Furthermore, no orders have arrived since Period 29, indicating a massive delivery gap. Current on-hand is 0. Demand since P20 has averaged approximately 115 units, though the P37 demand was 132. Given the persistent stockouts and the 387-unit pipeline inflation, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to force the OR backend into ordering. To calculate the explicit value, I use (1+L) * mean_demand + confirmed_losses. With L=3 and mean_demand ~115, the required base stock is 460. Adding the 387 phantom units to bypass the backend's subtraction leads to a target of 847. I will set mu_hat to 847 to ensure a significant order is placed despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to 100 (explicit) to reflect high uncertainty during this extended arrival hiatus.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Lead time instability continues with no arrivals for 8 consecutive periods. Total pipeline inflation remains 387 units (P2, P6, P30). Monitoring for a potential fourth lost shipment if orders from P37 onwards fail to arrive within 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 950 units in-transit, but 387 units are confirmed lost (Period 2: 168, Period 6: 105, Period 30: 114). Effective pipeline inventory is actually 563 units. Furthermore, there have been no arrivals for 9 consecutive periods, indicating extreme lead-time instability or a complete supply chain rupture. To bypass the OR backend's order throttling\u2014which sees a large (but phantom) pipeline\u2014I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I will set mu_hat to (1 + L) * expected_demand + pipeline_inflation. Using an effective lead time L=3 and a stabilized mean demand of approximately 110 units (reflecting recent cooling from the P20-P27 spike), the base requirement is 4 * 110 = 440. Adding the 387 phantom units brings the 'explicit' mu_hat to 827. This ensures the backend recognizes a need for stock despite the 950 reported in-transit units. sigma_hat is kept at a recent_N=10 to account for high volatility during this period of stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Lead time instability has reached critical levels with 9 consecutive periods of zero arrivals (P30-P38). Total confirmed pipeline inflation is 387 units (P2, P6, P30). Monitoring for potential loss of the P37 order if no arrivals occur by P40.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation is critical: 10 consecutive periods without arrivals (since Period 30 order). The reported In-transit inventory of 950 includes confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (168), Period 6 (105), and Period 30 (114), totaling 387 'phantom units'. The effective pipeline is thus only 563 units. Given the backend uses the formula 'base_stock - (Reported Pipeline - Cap)', large reported pipelines prevent new orders. Since P37, I've tried to force orders, but zero arrivals suggest a potential supply blackout or a lead time shift to 4+ periods. I will set mu_hat explicitly high (covering 4 periods of demand at ~110 units/period plus the 387 phantom units) to bypass the pipeline inflation and force the backend to place a significant order, while setting L to 3 to reflect the most frequent 'real' lead time observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: 10 consecutive periods without arrivals (P30-P39) suggests lead time has extended beyond 3 periods or a total supply disruption is occurring. Total confirmed pipeline inflation from lost orders: 387 units (P2, P6, P30).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe supply disruption with zero arrivals for 11 consecutive periods (P30-P40). Total confirmed pipeline inflation from lost shipments is 387 units (P2: 168, P6: 105, P30: 114). The system reports 950 units in-transit, but the effective pipeline is only 563 units (950 - 387). With on-hand inventory at 0 and multiple periods of lost sales, we must force the OR backend to place orders despite the 'inflated' pipeline. While demand has slightly cooled from the P20-P25 peak, the priority is restoring inventory. I will set L to 4 to reflect the extended delivery cycle and use \u03bc\u0302 = 550 (calculated as (1+4) * ~110 units/period) while adding the 387 lost units directly to \u03bc\u0302 to bypass the pipeline calculation. Explicit \u03c3\u0302 is set to 150 to ensure a robust safety stock buffer during this period of high lead-time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: 11 consecutive periods without arrivals (P30-P40). Total pipeline inflation confirmed at 387 units. Effective in-transit is 563 units against a reported 950.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 42. Since Period 30, there has been a complete halt in arrivals (11 consecutive periods), confirming a severe supply chain disruption or extremely extended lead times. The system reports an in-transit inventory of 950 units, but 387 of these are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P30). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 563 units. Given the 11-period gap, even the remaining 563 units are highly suspect. However, the OR backend's capped policy will throttle or zero out orders if the reported pipeline (950) is high relative to the base stock calculation. To force the OR engine to place orders despite this 'phantom' inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I will use the established demand mean of 131 units (since P20) and an assumed lead time of 4 periods (given the current drought), yielding a base demand of (1+4)*131 = 655 units. To offset the 387 units of phantom inventory that the backend subtracts, I will set mu_hat to 655 + 387 = 1042. I set L to 4 as a conservative estimate of the current actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Supply disruption continues with 11 periods of zero arrivals. Total pipeline inflation remains 387 units (P2, P6, P30). Effective pipeline is 563 units. Explicit mu_hat adjustment is required to bypass backend logic and maintain order flow.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe disruption with zero arrivals for 12 consecutive periods (P31-P42). Total confirmed pipeline inflation from lost orders is 387 units (P2: 168, P6: 105, P30: 114). Reported In-transit is 1042, but effective In-transit is only 655 units. Demand recently surged to 160 in P42, matching the regime shift noted since P20. To ensure the OR backend continues to place orders despite the inflated pipeline, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that accounts for the current demand level plus the 'phantom' inventory. Calculating for effective lead time L=3, the required base stock (approx (L+1)*demand) must be at least 4*135 = 540. However, because the backend subtracts the inflated pipeline (1042), I use an explicit mu_hat of 1200 to force a net positive order. Sigma is kept at recent levels to reflect the high volatility of both demand and supply.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: 12 consecutive periods of zero arrivals; supply disruption remains critical. Pipeline inflation persists at 387 units. Demand remains in the elevated P20 regime (~135 units/period).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44, facing a critical supply chain disruption with 13 consecutive periods of zero arrivals (since Period 30). Confirmed lost shipments from P2 (168), P6 (105), and P30 (114) total 387 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The reported in-transit is 1200, making the effective pipeline 813 units. Demand remains elevated in the regime starting at P20, with the most recent two periods (P42-P43) showing a mean of 150.5 units, though the longer-term average since P20 is ~131 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the reported (inflated) pipeline from the base stock, it will likely throttle or zero out orders if we use standard parameters. To force the system to keep ordering despite the 387-unit inflation and zero arrivals, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the 387 lost units. With L=3 and mean demand ~135, base stock should be roughly (4 * 135) + 387 = 927. However, with the reported in-transit already at 1200, even this might result in zero orders. I will use an explicit L of 3 (the last stable observed lead time) and an explicit mu_hat of 1300 to ensure the backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) calculates a positive order quantity to hedge against the massive arrival gap and sustain inventory levels if arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: 13 consecutive periods of zero arrivals confirms a severe supply disruption/extended lead time. Total pipeline inflation remains 387 units (lost orders P2, P6, P30).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 with a severe supply disruption: 14 consecutive periods (P31-P44) with zero arrivals. Total confirmed pipeline inflation from lost orders is 387 units (P2: 168, P6: 105, P30: 114). The system reports 1300 units in-transit, but the effective pipeline is only 913 units (1300 - 387). Demand remains in the elevated regime established at P20, averaging approximately 135 units per period. Because the backend OR engine is unaware of the 387 lost units, it sees an inflated pipeline and will throttle or stop new orders. To counteract this, I will set 'L' to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and use 'explicit' for mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost units to force the backend to place an order. Target = (3+1) * 135 + 387 = 927. Setting mu_hat to 927 ensures the backend attempts to maintain the necessary stock despite the phantom inventory it 'sees'.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: 14 consecutive periods of zero arrivals. Supply disruption is critical. Total pipeline inflation remains 387 units (P2, P6, P30 lost). Demand regime since P20 stable at ~135 units/period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data from Period 45 shows a partial resolution of the severe supply disruption, with orders from Period 42 and 43 arriving (92 and 158 units respectively). This establishes an actual lead time of 2-3 periods for recent successful shipments. However, the system's reported in-transit still contains 387 units from confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P30). With current on-hand inventory at 126 and reported in-transit at 1050, the OR backend sees 1176 units available. Subtracting the 387 phantom units leaves an effective pipeline of 663 units. Given the demand regime since P20 averages ~132 units (131.7 over the last 26 periods) and the current period is 46, we need to ensure enough is ordered for the final periods (47-50). To counteract the 387-unit pipeline inflation while staying within the backend's capping logic, I will continue using an explicit mu_hat. I will set mu_hat based on (1 + L) * demand + inflation gap. With L=3, (4 * 132) + 387 = 915. This encourages the backend to place orders despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=26) to reflect the volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply disruption partially eased in Period 45 with arrivals from P42/P43 confirming a 2-3 period lead time. Total pipeline inflation remains 387 units (P2, P6, P30 lost). Long-term demand regime (P20-current) mean is 131.7 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply disruption has partially stabilized, with arrivals from Period 42 and 43 confirming an actual lead time of 2-3 periods. However, the system's in-transit inventory is significantly inflated by 387 units due to confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, and P30). The reported in-transit is 1050, but the effective in-transit is 663 units. Demand remains in the elevated regime identified at Period 20, with a mean of approximately 132 units per period. To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders despite the phantom pipeline inventory, I will use an explicit mu_hat set to (1+L) * (Demand_Mean + Pipeline_Inflation/ (1+L)). With L=3, mu_hat = (1+3) * (132 + 387/4) = 4 * (132 + 96.75) \u2248 915. Sigma_hat is calculated for the P20 regime (approx 27 units/period) scaled for L+1: sqrt(4) * 27 = 54.

Carry-over insight: Supply disruption eased with P42/P43 arrivals confirming L=2-3; however, pipeline inflation remains at 387 units (P2, P6, P30 lost). Demand regime since P20 remains stable at ~132 units/period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply disruption has partially stabilized with arrivals in Period 45 from orders placed in P42 and P43, confirming an actual lead time (L) of approximately 2-3 periods. However, there is a cumulative pipeline inflation of 387 units due to confirmed lost orders in Periods 2 (168 units), 6 (105 units), and 30 (114 units). This inflation causes the OR backend to believe inventory is higher than it actually is, potentially stopping new orders. To counteract this, I will use 'explicit' methods for mu_hat. Since Period 20, the demand regime has shifted to a mean of approximately 132 units per period. The backend's base stock calculation is (1+L)*mu. With L=2, the target pipeline should be (1+2)*132 = 396 units. However, we must bypass the 387 phantom units in the reported 1050 in-transit. The effective in-transit is 1050 - 387 = 663 units. Since effective in-transit (663) > target stock (396), the backend would normally order 0. To ensure we have stock for the final periods (P48-50), I will set an explicit mu_hat that forces the base stock above the 1050 figure. Setting mu_hat to 400 (which corresponds to a theoretical demand of 133 with L=2) ensures the OR engine sees a base stock around 1200+, allowing for an order that covers the remaining demand without over-ordering into excessive holding costs at the game's end.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 49. Inventory is 0 units on-hand with 1050 units reported in-transit. Based on historical data, 387 units in the pipeline are permanently lost (P2: 168, P6: 105, P30: 114), making the effective pipeline 663 units. Arrivals resumed in P45-P46 (from P42/P43 orders), confirming the supply line is active again with a lead time (L) of approximately 3 periods. Demand since the Period 20 regime shift has stabilized with a mean around 132 units/period, though the most recent four periods (P45-P48) show a lower average of ~89 units. I will use N=29 (from P20 onwards) for mu_hat to ensure we don't under-order due to the recent low-demand noise, while maintaining an explicit L=3 to account for the observed delivery lag. sigma_hat will use N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply line resumed in Period 45 after a 14-period disruption; Lead Time (L) for recent arrivals is confirmed at 2-3 periods. Demand since P20 remains in an elevated regime (mean ~132) compared to the initial periods (~100).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. The demand since P20 remains elevated (mean ~131 units) compared to the initial periods. The supply line, which suffered a major 14-period disruption (P31-P44), resumed in P45 with arrivals from P42/P43, confirming a lead time of 2-3 periods. However, there is a cumulative pipeline inflation of 387 units due to confirmed lost orders in P2 (168 units), P6 (105 units), and P30 (114 units). The system reports 1050 units in-transit, but the effective in-transit quantity is only 663 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant lost sales in recent periods, we must ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order. Using 'explicit' mu_hat allows us to bypass the backend's capped base-stock logic that would otherwise be throttled by the phantom in-transit inventory. I am setting mu_hat to 925 units, which targets a base stock level (including the upcoming period) that accounts for the ~132 unit demand and the 387-unit pipeline shortfall (approx 4 * 132 + 387), ensuring an order is triggered despite the inflated system inventory.
