Based on the provided historical demand samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177), the average demand is approximately 118 units per period with significant variance. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 3. To maintain a sufficient pipeline, I need to cover (L+1) periods of demand (Periods 1, 2, and 3). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0, the order must cover the forecast for these three periods. Forecasting an average of 120 units per period, the total requirement is 360 units. I will order 360 units to establish the initial pipeline and meet upcoming demand.",
