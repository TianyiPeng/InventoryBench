(b) Demand regime: Historical data for Period 1-5 shows an average demand of 118 units (80, 120, 120, 93, 177). Note the spike to 177 in P5, suggesting potential volatility or upward trend. (c) Lead time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive during P3 and be observable in P4. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0, in-transit is 0. (e) Order logic: We must cover demand for the current period (P1) plus the lead time (P2, P3). Total periods to cover = L+1 = 3. Using the historical average (~118) plus a small safety margin for the P5 spike, I estimate demand at 120 units/period. Target pipeline = 120 * 3 = 360 units.

Historical seeds (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) suggest a similar mean (~118). Current demand seems to fluctuate around 120 units. c) Lead Time Inference: Lead times are volatile. P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. Notably, the P2 order (120 units) placed in Period 2 is now 3 periods old and has not arrived in Period 5's conclusion (meaning it didn't arrive by the end of P5).

Total demand for 3 periods (~360 units). Current inventory (212) + reliable in-transit (P4=120, P5=80, total 200) = 412 units. This is sufficient to cover 3 periods even if P2 is lost.
