P3 order arrived at P4 (LT=1). P2 order (50) is still missing after 5 periods (ordered P2, still not arrived at end of P6), suggesting it is lost. Promised LT is 2.

Since current pipeline (excluding lost P2) is 407 and expected demand until the next order arrives (Period 7, 8, 9) is ~300, I have sufficient stock.

{
  "rationale": "The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains volatile but consistent with a regime around 100-110 units/period (P26-P43 average is ~106). In Period 44, on-hand inventory is critically low at 27 units. The system reports 2280 units in-transit, but historical data confirms a ~50% shipment loss rate. Specifically, orders from P25 (400), P29 (400), and P33 (150) are confirmed losses (well over 3 periods). The order from P41 (100) is now 3 periods old and P42 (100) is 2 periods old; these are the primary hope for immediate arrival. To maintain a safety buffer against the high shipment failure rate and to cover the next 3 periods of demand (estimated at 330 total), a consistent ordering pattern is necessary. I will order 200 units to aggressively restock given the low on-hand position and the high probability that roughly half of current in-transit orders will never arrive.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Shipment from Period 33 (150 units) is confirmed lost (11 periods since order). Reliable pipeline consists only of orders from Period 41 onwards (100 units each in P41, P42, P43). Actual shipment arrival rate remains approximately 50%.",

{
  "rationale": "The recent demand (P36-P44) has been somewhat higher than the previous 104 average, coming in at approximately 117 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is critically low at 9 units. Given the high order loss rate (approaching 50%, with confirmed/likely losses for shipments from periods 25, 29, 33, 37, 42), the reported in-transit of 2380 units is largely composed of 'ghost' orders. To calculate effective pipeline, I focus on recent orders: P42 (100 units, T+3), P43 (100 units, T+2), and P44 (200 units, T+1). Historically, successful lead times range from 1 to 3 periods. I expect arrivals from P42 or P43 soon, but given the 50% loss risk, I cannot rely on all of them. Target inventory for the remainder of the game (periods 45-50) is based on a demand of ~120/period. With only 6 periods remaining, I need to ensure sufficient stock arrives to cover demand while accounting for the high probability of shipment failure. I will order 250 units to bolster the pipeline against potential losses, aiming to have enough units arrive for the final 5 periods.",

  "rationale": "The demand regime is currently averaging 120-130 units per period (e.g., P42: 160, P43: 141, P44: 118, P45: 124). Supply remains extremely unreliable with a confirmed historical loss rate of approximately 50%. Looking at the pipeline, orders from Period 44 (200 units) and Period 45 (250 units) are the only reliable ones remaining, as they are within the 1-3 period lead time window. Older reported 'In-transit' units are confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33). We currently have 85 units on hand. With 4 periods remaining in the game (46, 47, 48, 49, 50), the total expected demand is roughly 125 * 5 = 625 units. Total reliable stock (On-hand 85 + In-transit 450) equals 535 units. To cover the remaining periods and mitigate the high risk of shipment loss, I will order 250 units. While this may result in some ending inventory if all recent orders arrive, the cost of a stockout (Loss of $4 profit) far outweighs the holding cost ($1) given the severe instability of the supply chain.",
  "carry_over_insight": "No new pattern shift detected. Supply risk remains extreme with a ~50% historical order loss rate; effective pipeline is significantly lower than system-reported In-transit due to 'ghost' orders (specifically P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33).",

On-hand inventory is currently 0. The primary challenge is the extreme supply risk, with a historically confirmed order loss rate of approximately 50%. The system reports 2680 units in-transit, but most of these (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P33, P37) are confirmed or statistically likely lost. Reliable pipeline includes orders from P44 (200), P45 (250), and P46 (250). Lead times for successful deliveries range from 1 to 3 periods. To maximize profit in the final 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50), we must ensure stock arrives to satisfy remaining demand (~420 units total). Given the 50% loss rate, we need to over-order. The P44 order (200 units) should arrive in P47 (LT3), which would satisfy current demand. I will order 300 units to hedge against the loss of the P44-P46 shipments while minimizing ending inventory for P50.",

Demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 26 has averaged approximately 104-110 units/period, with some high spikes (up to 160). The primary constraint is a severe shipment loss rate (~50% historically). Looking at the pipeline: orders from P44 (200), P45 (250), P46 (250), and P47 (300) are in-transit. Based on the max observed lead time of 3 periods, P44 should have arrived in P47 (it hasn't, likely lost) or must arrive in P48's arrival phase (which we'll see in P49). P45 is due P47-P48. Given we have only 50 periods total, orders placed now (P48) with a 2-3 period lead time will arrive in Period 50 or not at all. Orders placed in P49/P50 are useless. To maximize profit in the final three periods (48, 49, 50) and mitigate the ~50% loss risk, I will place a final substantial order. If the P44/P45/P46 orders fail, this P48 order serves as the last possible chance to capture revenue in Period 50. Total demand for the remaining 3 periods is expected to be ~330 units. With 0 on-hand, and extremely high pipeline uncertainty (the 2980 in-transit includes hundreds of units from dozens of periods ago that are definitely lost), I must order enough to cover Period 50 demand assuming recent orders fail.",

{
  "rationale": "We are in the penultimate period (Period 49). Inventory is currently 0. The reported In-transit is high (3280 units), but historical data confirms that approximately 50-60% of orders are lost entirely. The orders currently in the 'arrival window' (Period 47 ordered 300, Period 48 ordered 300) may or may not arrive. If an order from Period 47 arrives during Period 49's arrival phase, it can satisfy Period 49 demand. However, since we cannot observe Period 49 arrivals until Period 50, and our goal is to maximize Period 49 sales (reward) while finishing at Period 50, any order placed now (Period 49) with a minimum lead time of 1 would arrive during Period 50 (after Period 50's demand phase has concluded, based on the execution sequence). Therefore, an order placed in Period 49 cannot satisfy demand in Period 49 or Period 50. Inventory at the end of Period 50 is subject to holding costs. Since Period 49 orders cannot be sold but will incur holding costs if they arrive, the optimal action is to order 0.

{
  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has recently been between 53 and 113 units per period (P46-P49), aligning with the broader ~104 unit average regime. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an in-transit of 3280 units, but historical data confirms a ~50% shipment failure rate. Specific confirmed or highly likely losses include orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, and P33. Furthermore, orders from P44 (200 units), P45 (250 units), P46 (250 units), P47 (300 units), and P48 (300 units) have not yet arrived. Given the max successful lead time is 3 periods, the P44 order (ordered 6 periods ago) and P45 order (ordered 5 periods ago) are now highly likely lost. The P46 order (ordered 4 periods ago) is also borderline. This extreme supply instability requires continuous aggressive ordering to ensure at least some shipments arrive to meet the 100-130 unit/period demand. Since this is the final period (Period 50), no units ordered now will arrive in time to satisfy demand or affect the score, as they would arrive in Period 51 or later. However, maintaining the logic of the simulation, I would normally order to cover the gap; but for the final step, the action is symbolic.",
