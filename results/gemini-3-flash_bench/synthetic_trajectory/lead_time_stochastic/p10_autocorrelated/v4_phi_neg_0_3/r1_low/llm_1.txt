Average demand is ~100 units/period (mean = 100.4). There is moderate variance. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. This means an order placed in Period 1 arrives in Period 3 (after Period 3 decision). d) Inventory & Pipeline: Currently On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. e) Final Order Logic: Since I am starting at Period 1 with 0 inventory, I need to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (P1). Target stock = (L + 1) * Avg Demand + Safety Stock. $(2+1) * 100 = 300$.

Order P2 (110 units) should arrive in P4. Currently, 410 units are in-transit. d) Inventory: On-hand is 0. Customers are currently losing sales (Sold=0 in P1 and P2) because initial inventory was 0 and P1 order hasn't arrived yet. Pipeline is 410. e) Logic: I need to cover (L+1) periods of demand (P3, P4, P5). Total expected demand for 3 periods \u2248 270 units. My pipeline (410) already exceeds the next 3-4 periods of demand once it arrives. However, since I am sitting at 0 inventory and have lost significant sales, I must ensure I don't run out if demand spikes or lead time is slightly longer. But, with 410 in-transit against ~90/period demand, I have enough for ~4.5 periods. Ordering more now would likely lead to high holding costs ($1/unit) once the large P1 order arrives. I will place a small order to keep the pipeline moving in case P1 is delayed or lost, but 410 units is already a high stock level for this demand.",

Lead times observed are 1, 2, or 3 periods. Looking at the reliable pipeline: P11 order (120) should arrive in P14 (this period, L=3); P12 order (130) should arrive by P15; P13 order (160) should arrive by P16. To satisfy demand for Period 14 (already started), Period 15, and Period 16 (L+1 coverage where L=2 promised/median), I need to cover roughly 300-350 units. My reliable pipeline (410) covers this and provides safety stock.
