Step 3: Strategy: The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, resulting in a critical fractile of 0.5. This means the target service level should be exactly 50% (base stock = mean demand) because holding costs are high relative to profit. Step 4: Final Adjustment: The OR capped recommendation of 138 units is based on a 95% service level logic for the cap, which is overly aggressive for a product where holding costs equal profit.

Historical demand shows values of [74, 108, 88, 98, 134], with a mean of approximately 100.4 and a standard deviation of 22.4. In Period 1, demand was 98, resulting in a stockout since on-hand was 0.

Expected demand over 3 periods is ~300 units. Current pipeline is 120 (ETA Period 3/4).

Using L=3 to be safe due to volatility, we need 4 periods of coverage \u2248 400 units. Reliable inventory (204) is far below this target. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 289 includes the lost P2 order (134 units), which the OR agent likely sees as valid inventory, leading to its '0' recommendation. \n5. **Adjustment**: By stripping the lost P2 units from the OR's perspective: Reliable Pipeline is 155.

Based on recent lead-time patterns, the P15 order is overdue (lead time 5) and potentially lost, but given the volatility, I will wait one more period before discounting it. Demand Analysis: Recent demand is highly volatile, ranging from 65 to 133. The historical mean is approximately 100 per period. A base stock for L+1 (effective lead time 3 + 1 = 4 periods) at 100 units/period requires 400 units. Strategy: The pipeline (390 units) nearly covers the required base stock.

Current demand is stable with no clear seasonal signals or regime shifts.\nDecision Logic: The OR recommendation of 0 is driven by the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 679.

Based on historical 'conclude' messages, the delivery reliability is poor, with several shipments being lost or severely delayed (P2, P6, P15, and now likely P17, P18, and P19). Identifying the effective pipeline is crucial. Specifically: P17 (ordered P17, currently P22) is now 5 periods old; P18 is 4 periods old; P19 is 3 periods old; P20 is 2 periods old; P21 is 1 period old. Given that the typical arrival occurs within 1-3 periods, the fact that P17, P18, P19, P20, and P21 have not arrived yet suggests a clustering of delays or further losses. The OR recommendation is 0 because the raw pipeline (769) massively exceeds the base stock level calculated from mean demand (~98-100/period). However, if most of those 769 units are lost, we will remain out of stock indefinitely. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), the penalty for overstocking is as high as the penalty for stockouts (critical fractile 0.5), favoring a conservative ordering approach when inventory is already high.

The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely driven by the massive 'In-transit' figure of 859, but the 'effective' pipeline (excluding the likely lost ~424 units) is much lower. However, simply ordering more will not solve the immediate stockout if the delivery mechanism itself is failed or experiencing a massive shift in lead time (now exceeding 6 periods for multiple batches).

With only 12 units on-hand and an actual lead time that fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, we must ensure we have enough stock in the pipeline to cover the next 3-4 periods of demand (~400 units). The OR recommendation of 0 is ignored because it fails to account for the massive volume of lost/phantom shipments in the in-transit figure.

According to the carry-over insights and historical records, shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, and P37 are confirmed lost (totaling 1118 units). The 'In-transit' figure of 1348 units is largely phantom inventory. Real Pipeline = 1348 (In-transit) - 1118 (Lost) = 230 units. This 230 units consists of orders from Period 44 (115) and Period 45 (115).\n2. Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand inventory is 102 units. Demand has averaged approximately 105 units over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), with individual periods peaking at 144. \n3. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically driven by the inflated 'In-transit' figure (1348). However, since 1118 of those units will never arrive, the system is at risk of stockout. With 102 units on-hand and 230 units in the real pipeline (due to arrive in P46 and P47 respectively, assuming current 2-3 period lead times), we should order to maintain the supply chain rhythm for the remaining 4 periods of the game.

Specifically, the pipeline consists of orders from P44 (115), P45 (115), and P46 (115). Since the game ends at P50 and the actual lead time is currently 2-3 periods, an order placed today (P47) will likely arrive at P49 or P50. Current on-hand is 15. The expected demand for P47, P48, and P49 is ~312 units. The arrivals from P44 (due ~P47) and P45 (due ~P48) should cover this.

Since current real pipeline (460) already significantly exceeds the remaining game-total demand (300), and further orders placed now (P48) would arrive in P50 or later with a 2-3 period lead time, additional orders would only increase terminal holding costs without improving sales.
