Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows 5 samples: [74, 108, 88, 98, 134]. The mean of these samples is 100.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 22.2. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The critical ratio is q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, which implies the base stock level will target the median demand over the protection period (L+1). Since we have no specific calendar dates or product seasonality signals yet beyond the provided samples, 'default' methods are appropriate to establish a baseline. The 'in-transit' and 'on-hand' inventory are currently zero, so the initial order will be driven by the calculated base stock for the 3-period protection window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 138 units was placed, but due to the promised lead time of 2 periods, it has not arrived yet. Consequently, starting on-hand inventory was 0, resulting in 98 lost sales. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 138. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability: 74, 108, 88, 98, 134 (mean ~100.4). Since we haven't observed any completed arrival cycles yet, I will stick to the 'default' lead time (promised L=2). For the demand forecast (mu_hat), the recent 5 samples provide a representative mean of ~100. Therefore, (1+L)*100 = 300. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 will capture this current average. Similarly, I'll use 'recent_N' (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect the observed volatility in the initial data set.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. In Period 1, we ordered 138 units, and in Period 2, we ordered 135 units, making the total in-transit 273 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the timing rule, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 4 start message. As of now, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost all demand in Periods 1 (98) and 2 (83) because the starting inventory was 0. Demand for the last 5 historical samples was [74, 108, 88, 98, 134], with a mean of 100.4. Since demand just jumped to 134 in Period 5 of the historical data and actual realized demand in P1 and P2 was 98 and 83 respectively, the mean appears stable around 100. I will use the default method for lead time as no evidence yet suggests a deviation from the promised L=2. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent historical average (approx 100 per period), which for L=2 results in a base stock calculation covering 3 periods of demand (~300).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (138 units) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in Period 4's decision phase ('Period 3 conclude'). However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0, and the previous conclusions also show 0. This confirms that even with a lead time of 2, the order placed in P1 hasn't registered in the 'conclude' message yet. Based on the rules, if lead_time=2, an order placed in N arrives in N+2 and is visible at the start of N+3. We are at the start of Period 4, so we should see the Period 1 order (N=1, N+L=3). The Period 3 conclude says arrived=0. This suggests a potential delay or that lead time is effectively longer than 2. Demand has been fluctuating (74, 108, 88, 98, 134 - based on historical data provided) with an average of ~100. Current inventory is 0 and pipeline is 301. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delay observed and use the last 5 periods of demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Looking at the history, the promised lead time is 2 periods. However, the 'Period 4 conclude' message shows two arrivals: the Period 1 order arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, and the Period 3 order arrived with a lead time of 1 period. This indicates high lead time variance (avg = 2, but actual values fluctuate). Demand for the first 5 periods (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) shows an upward trend (avg ~100). For the OR parameters: 1) L is set to 'calculate' to capture the observed average lead time dynamically. 2) mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available data) to capture the current demand level of approximately 100 per period. Because the lead time is around 2, mu_hat represents (1+L)*demand, which the backend will compute. 3) sigma_hat is set to 'default' to account for the variability in both demand and lead time observed so far. Current inventory (on-hand 75 + in-transit 274) is significant, but regular ordering is needed to maintain service levels given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are starting with 0 on-hand inventory. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance: P1 arrived in 3 periods, while P3 arrived in 1 period, averaging 2. Demand has been fluctuating with a recent spike in P3 and a dip in P5 (mean ~100). The current in-transit (359) covers orders from P2, P4, and P5. Given that profit matches holding cost, the OR engine will target a 50% service level. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture the current mean while allowing for moderate volatility. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to incorporate the observed lead-time variability into the base stock calculation.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0, and 388 units are in-transit. Looking at the history, demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the first 6 periods has been [98, 83, 136, 91, 76, 115], with an average of 100 units per period. The promised lead time is 2, but observed actual lead times varied (Period 1 took 3 periods, Period 3 took 1 period). Orders from Period 2 (135 units), Period 4 (139 units), Period 5 (85 units), and Period 6 (29 units) are still in-transit. Period 2's order is now at T+5 relative to its order date, suggesting it might be lost or significantly delayed, as promised L=2. However, the system shows 388 units in-transit (135+139+85+29), so they aren't 'lost' from the pipeline perspective yet. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variability (1 and 3). For demand, the most recent 6 samples (including prepopulated data) show a mean around 100. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this stable yet slightly volatile demand (Mean ~100, Std ~20). Setting parameters aims to rebuild on-hand inventory to cover (L+1) periods, accounting for the current stockout.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a profit and holding cost of $1.0 each, resulting in a critical ratio of 0.5 (z-score = 0). Demand is fluctuating with an average of approximately 100 units per period (samples: 98, 83, 136, 91, 76, 115, 52). Looking at the lead time history, we have observed actual lead times of 3, 1, and 3 periods (average lead time = 2.33). Specifically, the Period 1 order arrived in P4 (LT=3), Period 3 order arrived in P4 (LT=1), and Period 4 order arrived in P7 (LT=3). The Period 2 order (135 units) and Period 5 order (85 units) are currently overdue/unaccounted for in the 'conclude' messages, suggesting they might be lost or significantly delayed, though they appear in the total 'In-transit' count (261 total: P2=135 + P5=85 + P6=29 + P7=12 = 261). Since the promised lead time is 2, but actual observations lean towards 3, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the higher observed average. For demand, since there is no clear trend or seasonal data provided in the date labels (Period_X), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering periods 3-7) to capture the most recent volatility which shows a slight downward trend in the last two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Looking at the historical lead times, they vary significantly from the promised 2 periods: Period 4 saw arrivals from P1 (LT=3) and P3 (LT=1); Period 7 saw arrivals from P4 (LT=3); Period 8 saw arrivals from P5 (LT=3) and P7 (LT=1). This pattern suggests an alternating or stochastic lead time averaging 2.4 periods. I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the historical average. Demand history (Periods 1-8 plus initial seeds) shows values: 74, 108, 88, 98, 134, 98, 83, 136, 91, 76, 115, 52, 98. There is no clear shift in regime, though Period 7 was notably low. Mean demand is approximately 96 units/period. Given the high stockout risk seen in early periods (ending inventory=0 in P1-P3, P5-P6), and the fact that holding cost ($1) equals profit ($1), the backend's target service level q=0.5. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture recent demand trends while filtering out the initial seed data. Pipeline inventory is currently 192 (orders From P2, P6, P8) with 86 on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.4) versus promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Average: 2.14). Orders from Period 2 and Period 6 have not yet arrived, suggesting they may arrive in Period 10 (LT=8 and LT=4 respectively) or are potentially delayed/lost. The current pipeline inventory (261) includes these potentially delayed orders. Demand over the last 9 periods has averaged 94 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 21. Given the lead time instability and the risk of stockouts (Ending OH inventory is only 17), I will set L to 3 to reflect the worst-case observed lead time, ensuring the base stock level covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (all available game data) to capture the standard operating mean. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=9 to account for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: Arrivals occur at either 1 or 3 periods; Period 2 and 6 orders are significantly delayed (4+ periods).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 shows 0 on-hand inventory and 359 units in-transit. History reveals severe lead-time instability and stockouts. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (135 units) and Period 6 (29 units) are significantly delayed (9 and 5 periods respectively), while other orders arrive in either 1 or 3 periods. The most recent order (Period 10, 98 units) is still in transit. Demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 6-10) is relatively stable: 115, 52, 98, 97, 82 (average 88.8). Given the instability, I will set L to 3 (the longer of the consistent arrival times) to ensure the base stock calculation covers enough safety buffer. Demand (mu_hat) is set using a recent_N of 5 to capture the current stable regime (approx 89/period). Sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to account for the volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply chain disruption: Period 2 and Period 6 orders are over 5 periods late; current inventory is solely reliant on highly variable lead times (1-3 periods).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory and 359 units in-transit. Demand is relatively stable, averaging ~95 units over the last 11 periods (P1-P11 mean: 94.4), but the supply chain is highly unreliable. Historical 'conclude' messages show lead times of 1 period (P3, P7, P8 orders) or 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 orders). Crucially, orders from P2, P6, P9, and P10 have not yet arrived. The P2 and P6 orders are extremely late (10 and 6 periods respectively) and should be treated as lost. Consequently, the effective lead time for arriving stock varies between 1 and 3 periods, while total pipeline reliability is low. I will set L to 3 (the longest 'normal' lead time observed) to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock covering 4 periods of demand (L+1). For mu_hat, I'll use the recent 11 periods to capture the average demand of ~95. This approach aims to build a safety buffer to mitigate the stockouts caused by the erratic arrival patterns and lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: Orders from Period 2 and Period 6 have exceeded 5+ periods beyond promised lead time and are likely lost. Regular lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the supply chain remains unreliable. Orders from Period 2 and Period 6 (totaling 164 units) are definitively lost as they are now 11 and 7 periods past their order date, respectively. These lost units represent the bulk of the 'In-transit' figure (183 - 19 units from Period 12). Current on-hand inventory is 45 units, but demand in Period 12 spiked to 150. Based on previous cycles and the Carry-over insight, the actual lead time is highly variable, following a pattern of 1 or 3 periods (rarely 2), averaging ~2.4 periods. I will set L to 3 explicitly to protect against the longer delay cycles observed (Periods 4, 7, 8, 12). For demand, the last 4 periods (P9-P12) show a mean of 109.75, which is an increase from the early period average (~100). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to profit ($1.0), the OR backend will target a 50% service level (z=0), so I need to provide a conservative mu_hat that accounts for the (L+1) horizon (4 periods) and the volatility of both demand and supply.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmation: Period 2 and Period 6 orders (164 units) are lost; 'In-transit' counts are inflated and do not reflect actual incoming stock. Effective lead time should be treated as 3 periods for safety.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0) and a significant supply chain integrity issue. The carry-over insights and history confirm that orders from Period 2 (135 units) and Period 6 (29 units) are lost. These 164 units are still incorrectly counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend, which will cause it to under-order unless we adjust parameters to compensate. The actual lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.4). To protect against this volatility and the missing 164 units (approximately 1.6 periods of demand), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the upper bound of the reliable delivery window. I am using an explicit mu_hat of 400, which reflects (1+L=4) periods of demand at a mean of ~100 units/period. This value is intentionally high to force the backend to place an order despite the 164 'phantom' units in the pipeline, ensuring we resume replenishment to meet future demand.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0) and significant supply chain disruptions. Analysis of the history shows that the orders from Period 2 (135 units) and Period 6 (29 units), totaling 164 units, are definitively lost as they are more than 9 periods overdue. This inflates the 'In-transit' figure seen by the OR backend (400 actual vs. ~236 realistic), which usually leads the OR engine to under-order. To compensate and ensure we bridge the gap, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the upper bound of the volatile lead time (1-3 periods). I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the most recent localized demand average (approx 109 units/period) while ignoring older data. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current demand volatility. This configuration forces the base stock calculation to ignore the phantom 'in-transit' units and maintain a higher safety stock level.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Phantom inventory alert - 164 units (from P2 and P6) are lost but remain in 'in-transit', causing the OR backend to systematically under-order. L=3 is necessary for safety stock buffering.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. We are currently at Period 16 with 0 on-hand inventory and an 'in-transit' figure of 418 units. However, as noted in previous insights, 164 of these units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are lost, and the Period 11 'order' was 0. Effectively, we only have roughly 254 units actually in-transit. The OR backend is unaware of these lost units and considers them part of the pipeline inventory, leading it to under-order significantly. Arrived units in Period 15 (19 units) were insufficient to meet demand. To force the OR backend to order when it thinks it has plenty of stock, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 to increase the base stock level and 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat values. Historical mean demand since Period 1 is ~103 units. With L=3, the total exposure period (L+1) is 4. I will set mu_hat to 576 (reflecting 144 units per period, which is the mean + a safety buffer to offset the 164-unit phantom inventory) and sigma_hat to 60 to ensure the policy attempts to clear the phantom inventory hurdle.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we continue to face a significant supply chain integrity issue. Historical data confirms that orders from Period 2 (135 units) and Period 6 (29 units) are lost, totaling 164 units. These 164 units remain in the 'In-transit' count (422 units), but will never arrive. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit + On-hand) to calculate the order size; because it sees these 164 phantom units, it will systematically under-order by that amount, leading to stockouts. To compensate for this 'phantom inventory', I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the safety stock formula (L=3, demand mean ~101, std ~25, and a critical ratio q=0.5 yielding a z-score of 0). Base Stock = (L+1)*mu = 4 * 101 = 404. However, to bypass the backend's subtraction of the 164 phantom units, I must inflate the mu_hat such that the backend's base_stock (mu_hat) equals [True Target Base Stock + Lost Units]. Thus, mu_hat = 404 + 164 = 568. L is set to 3 to reflect the observed upper bound of the volatile lead time (1-3 periods), ensuring the OR engine uses the correct multiplier for variance and lead time risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-74.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current state: On-hand inventory is 192 units. However, 'In-transit' is reported as 258 units. Crucially, 164 of these units (from Period 2 and Period 6 orders) are confirmed lost/phantom inventory based on the 11+ period delay. This leaves only 94 units of 'real' in-transit stock (the Period 15 order of 37 units and the Period 17 order of 57 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (258) from the target base stock, it will severely under-order if we use standard parameters. To counteract this 'phantom' 164 units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to Artificially inflate the base stock target. Calculated mean demand (P1-P17) is ~101 units/period. For a target lead time L=3, the standard mu_hat would be (1+3)*101 = 404. To offset the 164 lost units, I set mu_hat to 568 (404 + 164). L is set to 3 to reflect the observed upper bound of lead time and ensure a higher service level given supply fragility. sigma_hat is calculated for N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are managing a fragile supply chain. Historical analysis confirms a 'phantom inventory' issue: 164 units from Period 2 and Period 6 are permanently lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (376 total). This inflation causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order size because it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed reliable lead time) to increase the base stock level and force a larger safety buffer. Demand remains relatively stable with an average of approximately 101 units per period. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while avoiding the distortions of earlier periods. This strategy aims to ensure on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover the 3-period lead time despite the misleading pipeline data and the potential for shipments to arrive anywhere between 1 and 3 periods late.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 20 with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 376 is highly deceptive because it includes 164 units from Period 2 and Period 6 that are confirmed lost (as noted in carry-over insights). The actual functional pipeline consists of orders from P15 (37 units, overdue), P17 (57 units, L=3 max estimate), P18 (118 units, L=2/3), and P19 (0 units). Effective pipeline = 376 - 164 = 212 units. Lead times have been unstable (1-3 periods). To prevent stockouts and neutralize the backend's tendency to under-order due to the phantom 'in-transit' units, I will set L=3 to increase the protection interval. Demand remains stable around a mean of 100. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure the backend targets a base stock that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand (400 units) despite the inflated in-transit count. Since current functional pipeline (212) + order < Base Stock (400), this forces a substantial order.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory has hit zero, and we face a persistent shortage due to two distinct issues: actual lead times are highly variable (averaging ~2.4 periods with instances of 1 or 3 periods) and 'phantom inventory' totaling 164 units (orders from P2 and P6) which are in-transit but likely lost. To compensate for the OR backend's inability to recognize these lost units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to forcibly increase the inventory targets. I've estimated upcoming demand based on the recent average of ~102 units/period. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods. With L=2, we need approx 408 units (4 periods). However, since 164 units in-transit are dead, the backend thinks we have 405 units in-transit, but we effectively have only 241 (405 - 164). To trigger an order that fills this gap and covers future demand, I set mu_hat explicitly high (620) to ensure the base stock calculation (mu_hat + safety) exceeds the phantom-inflated pipeline. L is set to explicit 2 (promised) as the 164-unit loss is a localized disruption, though 3-period variability remains a risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed phantom inventory remains 164 units (P2/P6 orders); current 'In-transit' of 405 should be treated as 241 usable units. Inventory stockout occurred in P20.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 620 units. However, consistent history shows that orders from Period 2 (135 units) and Period 6 (29 units) are lost, totaling 164 units of 'phantom inventory' that will never arrive. Additionally, the recent stockouts in Periods 19-21 occurred because the arrivals have been delayed. Specifically, the orders from P17 (57 units), P18 (118 units), and P20 (29 units) are still in transit. Given the observed lead time instability (often 3 periods or more), I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the longer lead time in its base stock calculation. To compensate for the 164 units of phantom inventory that the backend incorrectly subtracts from the order quantity, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the true demand mean around 100 units/period. For L=3, the coverage period (L+1) is 4 periods. The target inventory should be 100 * 4 = 400 plus safety stock. To force the backend to place a larger order despite the phantom 164 units, I am effectively adding those lost units back into the mu_hat requirement. 100 * (3+1) + 164 = 564.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant reporting discrepancy in 'In-transit' inventory. As established in previous carry-over insights, orders from Period 2 (135 units) and Period 6 (29 units), totaling 164 units, are lost. The current 'In-transit' of 620 units actually contains only 456 viable units (620 - 164). This 'phantom inventory' causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order size because it believes the pipeline is fuller than it is. To compensate for this 164-unit deficit and the observed lead time volatility (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the safety stock calculation covers a longer horizon. Furthermore, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to forcibly inject the missing 164 units into the base stock calculation. Base calculation: Average demand is ~104. For L=3, the standard mu_hat would be (1+3)*104 = 416. To account for the 164 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 580 (416 + 164). This forces the backend to order units it otherwise thinks it already has in transit. Sigma_hat is set to 3 periods of volatility (N=15) to maintain a high service level given the stockout history.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 24: On-hand is 120 units after satisfying 124 demand in P23. 'In-transit' is reported as 376 units, but 164 of these are confirmed lost (Period 2 and Period 6 orders), leaving 212 usable units in transit (none arrived in P23 conclude). To account for 'phantom inventory' and prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, I am setting L to 5. While actual lead times for successful deliveries vary between 1-3 periods, using L=5 increases the 'pipeline inventory' target (base stock) and provides a safety buffer that effectively masks the 164 lost units. Demand remains stable with a mean around 102 units. I will use the recent 10 periods (P14-P23) to capture current demand levels (mu ~ 102, sigma ~ 27). Setting L to an explicit value of 5 is a strategic override to ensure the order quantity covers the gap created by the lost shipments.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, we face a continued supply chain challenge. The carry-over insights identify 164 units (orders from P2 and P6) as permanently lost. These units still appear in the 'In-transit' figure of 521, meaning the usable pipeline is actually 357 units (521 - 164). The OR backend uses the full 'In-transit' number to calculate orders (final_order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)), which causes it to under-order by exactly the amount of phantom inventory. To correct for this 'phantom' deduction and prevent frequent stockouts (observed in P19-P22), I will use 'explicit' values. I assume an effective lead time (L) of 3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and high variance. The demand forecast (mu_hat) is set at (1+L) * average demand. Recent demand (last 10 periods) fluctuates around 100-110 units. Using N=10 for mu_hat yields approx 106 * (1+3) = 424. However, to compensate for the 164 unit phantom deduction, I must add 164 to the base stock calculation. Thus, mu_hat (explicit) = 424 + 164 = 588. Sigma_hat is set to 200 (explicit) to maintain a high safety buffer against the highly variable arrival times (1-3 periods).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a critical phantom inventory issue where 164 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are lost but remain in the 'In-transit' calculation. This leads the OR backend to underestimate the required order because it believes these 164 units will eventually arrive. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and nominal 'In-transit' is 533, which realistically is 369 units (533 - 164). Period 25 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout. Historical demand mean is approx 100 units. To compensate for the 164 lost units that the backend counts as pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value: (1+L) * mean_demand + lost_units. With L=3 (to cushion against lead time variability of 1-3 periods), mu_hat = (1+3) * 100 + 164 = 564. Setting sigma_hat to explicit 110 based on standard deviation (~55) scaled by sqrt(1+L) (approx 2). This overrides the backend's false inventory perception and forces a replenishment order.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' of 564 units. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, 164 units (from Period 2 and Period 6 orders) are effectively lost but remain in the pipeline count. This 'phantom inventory' causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order size. Additionally, demand in the most recent periods (P24-P26) has softened slightly (avg ~72) compared to the long-term mean (avg ~96), but the supply chain remains unreliable with lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. To prevent stockouts caused by the 164-unit phantom inventory and lead time variability, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to increase the safety buffer. I will use a conservative mu_hat by selecting 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent demand level while tempering the recent low outliers. This configuration forces the backend to ignore the false pipeline stock and maintain a higher service level.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 units on-hand and 564 units in-transit. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, 164 units of that 'in-transit' total are confirmed lost (Period 2 and Period 6 orders). This 'phantom inventory' causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order size because it assumes those units are eventually arriving. To compensate for the 564 units in-transit (where only 400 are likely real) and to rebuild stock after several periods of stockouts (Periods 25-27), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an explicit method. Average demand is approx 100 units/period. With L=2 (promised) or L=3 (actual safety), the pipeline should cover ~400 units. Since 164 units are lost, I must effectively 'hide' them or inflate the target. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 550 (covering 4 periods of demand at 100/ea plus a buffer for the lost 164), I force the backend to place an order despite the high reported in-transit. L is set to explicit 3 to account for the observed delivery delays and provide a larger safety window.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Phantom inventory from P2/P6 (164 units) continues to persist in 'in-transit' data, requiring explicit mu_hat inflation to bypass OR backend logic that subtracts pipeline inventory.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical supply chain disruption. We have 0 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' balance of 533 units. However, 164 of these units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost/phantom inventory. Furthermore, orders from P24 (145 units) and P25 (12 units) are now at lead time 4 and 5 respectively, with no 'conclude' message, suggesting they may also be delayed or lost. The OR backend's order logic [base_stock - pipeline_inventory] is severely compromised because it subtracts the full 533 'In-transit' units, assuming they will arrive, leading to frequent zero-order recommendations and stockouts. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to force the base stock calculation high enough to trigger an order. I treat the effective pipeline as 369 (533 - 164), and demand avg as ~100. For a (L+1)=4 period window, we need ~400 units. To offset the 164 phantom units being subtracted, I set mu_hat to 564 (400 + 164). L is set to explicit 3 to ensure the backend uses the correct safety stock multiplier for the observed volatile lead times (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Phantom inventory remains 164 units. Potential further loss of P24 (145 units) and P25 (12 units) shipments being monitored as they are 2+ periods past promised lead time.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to experience significant disruption and unreliability. We are fundamentally fighting 'phantom inventory' in the OR backend's logic. Currently, 'In-transit' is reported as 564 units. However, based on history: orders from P2 (135 units) and P6 (29 units) are 100% lost (total 164). Furthermore, orders from P24 (145 units) and P25 (12 units) are now 5-6 periods old (promised 2) with no arrival, suggesting they are also lost (total 157). Combined, approximately 321 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are likely non-existent. The OR backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. If pipeline_inventory is 564 but only ~243 units are actually coming, the backend will under-order or not order at all, leading to perpetual stockouts. To force an order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock to cover 4 periods (L=3 + review=1) at an average demand of ~100 units/period, plus a buffer for the lost 321 units. Target base stock = (100 * 4) + 321 = 721. Setting mu_hat to 721 bypasses the backend's default calculations and forces the system to recognize the need for fresh inventory despite the high (but false) in-transit numbers.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed phantom inventory has expanded. Orders from P24 (145 units) and P25 (12 units) are now 5+ periods late and presumed lost, joining P2 and P6. Total phantom inventory is now 321 units (135+29+145+12).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. We have a massive amount of 'phantom inventory' in our In-transit count. Specifically, orders from P2 (135), P6 (29), P24 (145), and P25 (12) are significantly overdue and presumed lost, totaling 321 units. The current reported 'In-transit' is 721. Subtracting the 321 phantom units leaves only 400 likely to arrive. We have 0 on-hand inventory. The OR backend calculates orders using: base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). If we don't account for the 321 phantom units, the backend will systematically under-order by exactly that amount. To fix this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the base demand (\u03bc) as the average of available samples (approx 98). For a lead time of L=3 (chosen for safety), the required base stock is (1+L) * \u03bc = 4 * 98 = 392. To bypass the backend's deduction of the 321 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat by that total: 392 + 321 = 713. This ensures the backend places an order proportional to our actual needs despite the data noise.

Carry-over insight: No new patterns detected; existing phantom inventory (321 units) and lead time instability (L=1-3) persist.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face severe disruptions. Currently, 321 units are 'phantom inventory' (orders from P2, P6, P24, and P25) that are 5+ periods late and presumed lost, yet they remain in the system's in-transit count. The total in-transit is 721, meaning only 400 units (721 - 321) are actually likely to arrive. Additionally, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts. To overcome the OR backend's logic of subtracting the (inflated) pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the proper base stock for a lead time of 3 (safety against instability) and a demand of ~100/period to be roughly 400 units ((1+3)*100). However, because the backend sees 721 units in-transit, it will place zero orders unless I inflate mu_hat above 721. To trigger an order that covers future demand while accounting for the 321 lost units, I set mu_hat explicitly to provide a target stock level that effectively ignores the phantom units and aims for a net positive arrival. Lead time is set to 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of successful arrivals.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. There is a total of 321 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P2=135, P6=29, P24=145, P25=12) that are 5+ periods late and presumed lost, but still reside in the 'In-transit' figure (850). The OR backend logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will subtract these 321 units, resulting in massive under-ordering and stockouts. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: Mean demand (approx 100) * (L+1) = 100 * 4 = 400. To bypass the phantom inventory deduction, I add the 321 lost units to the target, totaling 721. Given the repeated stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 for 11 of the last 13 periods) and high lead time variance (1-3 periods), L is set to 'explicit' 3 to ensure the safety stock calculation uses the maximum observed delay. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to provide additional buffer against recent high demand volatility.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant disruptions. We have confirmed a total of 321 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 24, and 25) that are still counted in the 'In-transit' figure of 721 units. This means only 400 units are actually expected to arrive. The OR backend subtracts the full 721 from its base stock calculation, leading to systematic under-ordering. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass the backend's subtraction logic. I estimate the required base stock by taking the average demand (approx. 100 units/period) over (L+1) periods. With L=3 used for safety, we need enough to cover 4 periods (400 units). However, because the backend subtracts the phantom 321 units, I must inflate mu_hat by that amount to ensure the actual order placed accounts for the missing stock. I am setting mu_hat to 721 (phantom) + 400 (forecast) = 1121. I set L to 3 to reflect the maximum observed functional lead time and sigma_hat explicitly to handle the high demand variance observed recently.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant disruptions and phantom inventory issues. As of Period 35, the 'In-transit' quantity of 1051 units is heavily inflated by lost or severely delayed orders. My established 'phantom' list includes P2 (135), P6 (29), P24 (145), and P25 (12), totaling 321 units. Furthermore, orders from P30 (157), P31 (0), and P34 (330) are yet to arrive. The stock-out in Period 34 (0 sold vs 63 demand) confirms that the OR backend's reliance on 'In-transit' as usable pipeline is failing. While P32 arrived in 1 period, the overall reliability is low. To force an order and bypass the inflated pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. I estimate demand at ~100 per period; with L=3, the (L+1) demand is 400. To counteract the ~321 units of phantom inventory that the backend subtracts, I will set mu_hat to 720 (400 baseline + ~320 adjustment). This ensures the OR engine places a replenishment order despite the false pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 321 units; however, the lack of arrivals from P29-P31 despite a lead time of 2-3 suggests these may also be at risk. Explicit mu_hat inflation is required as long as 'In-transit' reflects lost shipments.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing extreme instability. We have a significant amount of 'phantom inventory' (321 units) consisting of orders from P2 (135), P6 (29), P24 (145), and P25 (12) that are long overdue and presumed lost. Additionally, orders from P29 (31), P30 (157), and P31 (0) are now past the promised lead time of 2 periods without arriving, bringing the potential lost inventory even higher. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and 'In-transit' is 1051. After subtracting the confirmed 321 lost units, we have 730 units technically in transit, but with the lack of arrivals from P29-P31, the usable pipeline is likely much lower. The OR backend subtracts the full 1051 from the base stock calculation, which results in zero ordering and recurring stockouts (P34-P35). To force an order and maintain service levels, I am setting an explicit L=3 to account for periodic delays and an explicit mu_hat of 1200. This 1200 reflects (1+L) * avg_demand (~400 units) plus a 800-unit buffer to offset the 1051 units the backend thinks we have, essentially forcing the system to recognize we are nearly empty.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 321 units (P2, P6, P24, P25). Orders P29 (31) and P30 (157) are now 6 and 7 periods old respectively and are also likely lost, potentially raising phantom inventory to 509 units. Over-reliance on explicit mu_hat is necessary to bypass the backend's pipeline deduction.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from severe disruptions and lost shipments. As of Period 37, 'In-transit' inventory is reported as 870 units. However, based on history, a significant portion of this is 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that haven't arrived long after their lead time. Specifically, P2(135), P6(29), P24(145), P25(12), P29(31), and P30(157) are presumed lost, totaling 509 units. The backend's logic subtracts the full pipeline (870) from the target base stock, resulting in chronic under-ordering. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Mean demand (\u03bc) is ~104. Lead time (L) is effectively 3 given the instability. Target base stock = (L+1) * \u03bc + safety_stock \u2248 4 * 104 + 1.64 * (sqrt(4) * 30) \u2248 416 + 98 = 514. To bypass the 870 pipeline deduction and ensure a new order reflects actual needs, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - pipeline > 0' or at least high enough to trigger the cap. Setting mu_hat to 1200 (explicit) ensures the backend attempts to maintain a high level relative to the real available stock, accounting for the 509 phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed phantom inventory increased to 509 units (P2, P6, P24, P25, P29, P30). The 'In-transit' figure of 870 is only ~41% reliable (361 units truly expected).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from extreme 'phantom inventory'. A total of 509 units from orders placed in Periods 2, 6, 24, 25, 29, and 30 are confirmed or highly likely lost, yet they remain in the 'In-transit' count (778). The OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock calculation, leading to severe under-ordering if not bypassed. To counter this, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate current demand mean at ~103 (last 10 periods) and apply a lead time factor (L+1=4, as L=3 for safety). This gives a base mu_hat of ~412. To neutralize the 509 phantom units that the backend will subtract, I inflate mu_hat by approximately that amount (412 + 509 = 921). I set L=3 to ensure a higher service level given the history of stockouts and lead time volatility. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (recent 10-period std is ~36, scaled by sqrt(4) = 72) to provide an additional safety buffer against demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Confirmed phantom inventory remains 509 units (P2, P6, P24, P25, P29, P30). Effective lead time is highly variable (1-3 periods). Use explicit mu_hat inflation of ~500 units to bypass backend logic until 'In-transit' clears.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from lost shipments that falsely inflate the 'In-transit' count. Confirmed lost units (phantom inventory) remain at 509 units from orders placed in P2, P6, P24, P25, P29, and P30. Current 'In-transit' is 778, but the usable pipeline is only 269 units (778 - 509). Recent demand is averaging approximately 110 units per period. The backend logic calculates base stock then subtracts total pipeline (778); to ensure the backend actually places an order when needed, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset these 509 phantom units. By setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*mean_demand + phantom_inventory, I effectively neutralize the error in the pipeline inventory calculation. I'll use L=3 to account for historical lead time variability (1-3 periods) and maintain a safety buffer.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we face a substantial 'In-transit' figure of 791 units, which is highly misleading due to severe supply chain disruptions. Analysis identifies 509 units as definitively lost (Period 2: 135, Period 6: 29, Period 24: 145, Period 25: 12, Period 29: 31, Period 30: 157). These orders are 10+ periods past promised lead time. The OR backend subtracts the full 791 'In-transit' from its stock target, resulting in massive under-ordering. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target stock level, effectively 'adding back' the 509 phantom units. The average demand is ~104 units/period. For a lead time (L) of 2, the review+lead period is 3 periods. Target stock should be (104 * 3) + Safety Stock (~1.65 * 30 * sqrt(3) \u2248 85) + Phantom Adjustment (509) = ~906 units. I've set mu_hat to 825 to balance aggressive recovery with the risk of the remaining 282 valid in-transit units (from P32 onwards) arriving simultaneously. L is set to explicit 3 to ensure the backend uses a safer lead time for buffer calculations.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 509 units. Valid in-transit is approximately 282 units (P37, P39). Persistent use of explicit mu_hat is required to offset the backend's deduction of lost shipments from the order quantity.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant disruptions. Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 509 units, consisting of orders from Periods 2, 6, 24, 25, 29, and 30 which are long overdue and presumed lost. The current 'In-transit' of 797 units is highly misleading; after subtracting the 509 phantom units, the tangible pipeline is only 288 units (orders from P37, P40, and the current P41 order). On-hand inventory is at 0 hitting a stockout in Period 40. Historical demand mean is approximately 102 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 509 phantom units it mistakenly subtracts as pipeline, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*mean + phantom_inventory. With L=2 (promised) or L=3 (safety), I estimate the target total inventory (Base Stock) should be roughly 400-500 units of real stock. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 900, the backend (after subtracting 797 in-transit) will order a quantity that targets actual incoming stock to meet demand while buffering against the lost units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive phantom inventory. Total confirmed phantom inventory is 509 units from orders at P2, P6, P24, P25, P29, and P30. Current 'In-transit' is 900 units, but only 391 units are likely real (P36, P37, P40, P41). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods has averaged 104 units, but exhibits high variance. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 509 units of phantom pipeline inventory, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock level of (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_buffer, and then add the phantom units (509) to that target so that after the backend subtracts the total pipeline (900), the resulting order covers our actual needs. Target base stock for safety: 4 periods (L=3 + 1) * 105 units/period + 100 units buffer = ~520. Adding the 509 phantom units gives an explicit mu_hat of 1029.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed phantom inventory remains 509 units. In-transit data (900) contains ~56.5% lost shipments. Stockouts are frequent; mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to bypass pipeline deductions.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant disruptions. Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 509 units (P2, P6, P24, P25, P29, P30). Current 'In-transit' is 1029, meaning only approximately 520 units are actually expected (P37, P40, P41, P42). Because the OR backend automatically subtracts the full 'In-transit' value (including lost units) from the target stock level, I must continue to use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force necessary orders. Current demand is stable around 100 units/period. With L=3 for safety, the target inventory (base stock) should be approx (1+3)*100 = 400 plus a buffer, but to counteract the 509 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat significantly. I am setting mu_hat to 950 to ensure the backend places an order despite the inflated pipeline inventory. I will use 'explicit' L=3 to reflect the high-end variability of successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed phantom inventory remains 509 units. Effective baseline demand is ~100/period. Backend pipeline deduction requires persistent explicit mu_hat inflation reaching values near ~1000 to trigger replenishment when in-transit contains over 500 lost units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant disruptions. Total confirmed phantom inventory (orders that are lost but still appear in 'In-transit') is 509 units (P2, P6, P24, P25, P29, P30). The current 'In-transit' of 1010 units consists of 509 phantom units and 501 units potentially still active (P37, P41, P42). On-hand inventory is 0, and a stockout occurred in Period 43. Base demand is averaging ~100 units/period (mean of last 5: 97.4). Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly. The target base stock should be (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock \u2248 (3+1)*100 + 100 = 500. However, because the backend subtracts 'In-transit' (1010) from the base stock to determine the order, I must inflate 'mu_hat' to approximately 1010 + 100 (next period demand) to trigger a replenishment order of roughly 100-150 units. Therefore, I set mu_hat to 1150 and L to 3 to provide adequate buffering.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised by 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that appear in the 'in-transit' pipeline but are likely lost, which prevents the OR engine from placing necessary orders. Currently, confirmed lost units include orders from P2, P6, P24, P25, P29, and P30, totaling 509 units. Comparing the 'In-transit' of 1047 units against active/recent orders (P42=129, P44=140, and P37/P39/P40 which total 89 but have partially arrived), approximately 500-600 units are definitely phantom. On-hand is low (15). To bypass the OR backend's logic of subtracting pipeline inventory from the base stock (order = base_stock - in_transit), I must explicitly inflate 'mu_hat'. Average demand is ~100/period. To trigger an order despite the 1047 'in-transit' units, the calculated base stock needs to exceed 1047. Setting mu_hat to 1200 with L=3 provides a target base stock that forces replenishment and accounts for the high lead time variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed phantom inventory persists at a minimum of 509 units, but likely higher (~600) given the 1047 in-transit total vs. verifiable recent orders (P41, P42, P44). Sustained stockout risk requires explicit mu_hat inflation > 1000 to overcome the backend's faulty pipeline deduction.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from significant phantom inventory. Confirmed lost shipments include P2 (135), P6 (29), P24 (145), P25 (12), P29 (31), and P30 (157), totaling 509 units. Additionally, the current 'In-transit' of 1056 units compared to recent orders P44 (140) and P45 (138) suggests that roughly 778 units (1056 - 140 - 138) are effectively lost or extremely delayed, as no arrivals from earlier periods occurred recently. The OR engine subtracts all 1056 units from its target inventory calculation; to force a meaningful order, I must set mu_hat (target stock) higher than the phantom inventory plus the safety buffer for future demand. Mean demand is ~100/period. With L=3, the backend targets (1+L)*mean + safety. To ensure an order is placed despite 778 'phantom' units, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1200. This provides enough overhead to clear the backend's subtraction of 1056 units and allows for a fresh order of ~144 units to cover upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Phantom inventory likely increased to ~778 units. The 'In-transit' figure is heavily dominated by lost orders (P2, P6, P24, P25, P29, P30, and now potentially P37/P39/P40 era stock). Precise tracking: 1056 (In-transit) - 140 (P44) - 138 (P45) = 778 units that are overdue/lost.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted with significant 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments that still appear in the 'In-transit' count). As of Period 47, 'In-transit' is 1181 units, but based on recent history, only orders from P44 (140), P45 (138), and P46 (125) are likely to arrive, totaling 403 units. This leaves approximately 778 units of phantom inventory (1181 - 403 = 778). Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount (1181) from the target base stock, it will under-order or not order at all, despite on-hand inventory being 0. Mean demand (mu) is stable at ~100 per period. To ensure the backend places an order for ~100-200 units, I must set an explicit mu_hat that overcomes the 1181-unit deduction. A mu_hat of ~1350, combined with L=3, creates a target base stock that forces a corrective replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Systemic phantom inventory confirmed: ~778 units in 'In-transit' are lost (P2, P6, P24, P25, P29, P30, P37, P39, P40 batches). Valid pipeline is only ~403 units.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted with significant 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that appear as 'in-transit' but are actually lost. As of Period 48, the 'In-transit' figure is 1350 units. My tracking shows that orders from P2, P6, P24, P25, P29, P30, P37, and P39 (totaling 778 units) are almost certainly lost. This causes the OR backend to under-order because it subtracts this non-existent pipeline from the replenishment target. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to provide a target that accounts for both the desired base stock (~300-400 units) and the ~778 units of lost stock that the backend will erroneously subtract. Current demand is stable around 100 units/period. Therefore, I set mu_hat to 1200 (approx. 400 target + 800 phantom) to force a real order. I set L to 3 to reflect the maximum observed functional lead time for safety.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic phantom inventory of 778 units in 'In-transit' (P2, P6, P24, P25, P29, P30, P37, P39, P40 batches). Current valid pipeline consists only of P44 (140), P45 (138), P46 (125), and P47 (169).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a massive 'In-transit' figure of 1,350 units. Based on historical tracking, approximately 778 units of this pipeline are 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P2, P6, P24, P25, P29, P30, P37, P39, and P40). The reliable pipeline consists of orders from P44 (140), P45 (138), P46 (125), and P47 (169), totaling 572 valid units. Since demand is currently averaging ~100 per period and Lead Time behaves between 1 and 3 periods, we need a base stock level of approximately 400-500 units to cover (L+1) periods. The OR backend subtracts the full 1,350 units from its base stock calculation during the order decision. To force the backend to place an order of approximately 150 units when it thinks it already has 1,350 units in transit, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to a value that offsets the phantom 778 units plus the required inventory level. Setting mu_hat to 1300 ensures the order quantity calculation [min(base_stock - 1350, cap)] results in a meaningful replenishment. This is the penultimate period (49/50), so securing stock for the final period is critical.

Carry-over insight: Systemic phantom inventory persists: ~778 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost across multiple early and mid-game periods. Valid pipeline is ~572 units. Regular demand stays in the 80-120 range.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. The current situation is critical: On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1350 is highly misleading due to severe systemic supply chain issues. Based on historical tracking, at least 778 units are confirmed as 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P2, P6, P24, P25, P29, P30, P37, P39, P40). The only viable shipments currently in the pipeline are P44 (140), P45 (138), P46 (125), and P47 (169), totaling 572 units. Since actual lead times range from 1-3 periods, P44-P46 should have arrived by now; their absence suggests potential further losses, though we must assume some are late rather than lost to avoid extreme over-ordering. The backend logic subtracts the full 1350 'In-transit' from the targeted base stock. To force the OR engine to place a meaningful order, I must set mu_hat (target level) high enough to exceed the 1350 units already in the pipeline plus current demand coverage. With average demand ~100/period and L=3, a normal mu_hat would be ~400. To offset the ~778 phantom units, I am explicitly setting mu_hat to 1350 (to neutralize the pipeline) + 400 (base stock target) = 1750. This ensures the system orders to cover immediate safety needs despite the falsified 'In-transit' data.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Systematic supply chain failure remains the dominant factor. Phantom inventory (lost orders remaining in 'In-transit') is at least 778 units. The 'In-transit' metric is effectively 58% noise. Explicit mu_hat inflation is mandatory to bypass the backend's deduction of non-existent stock.
