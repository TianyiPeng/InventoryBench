Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows an upward trend (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) with a mean of 100.4. Since demand resolution happens after our decision and on-hand inventory is currently 0, we must place an order that covers the pipeline. I will use the default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to establish a baseline using all available historical samples (N=5). The 'default' mu_hat will calculate (1+L) * mean, which is (1+2)*100.4 = 301.2, helping the OR backend target a base stock sufficient for the lead time plus current period resolution.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 138 units, which are currently in-transit. The promised lead time is 2, so we expect this order to arrive during Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). Historical demand data shows five periods (74, 108, 88, 98, 134), while the game history shows Period 1 demand was 89. The mean of the 5 historical samples is 100.4. Since we started with 0 inventory and the order hasn't arrived yet, we have lost sales in Period 1 (89 units). To cover the lead time (L=2) and the current period (L+1=3 periods total), and accounting for the high demand volatility and initial stockout, I will use recent_N for both demand mean and standard deviation to stay responsive to the latest signals while the pipeline fills. Since N=5 is the total available historical count, I'll use that as the baseline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. For chips(Regular), we have seen two periods of demand (89 and 107) but have zero on-hand inventory because the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (138 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase, meaning it will be available to satisfy Period 3's demand. The total in-transit quantity is 273 (138 from P1 + 135 from P2). Historical demand samples are [74, 108, 88, 98, 134] plus the observed demand from P1 (89) and P2 (107). Across these 7 data points, the mean is roughly 99.7. Given the promised lead time L=2, the base stock should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both demand mean and volatility to capture the most relevant recent consumption patterns while we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (138 units) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible in Period 3's conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0, and inventory remains at 0. Historically, demand has been ramping up: 89, 107, 129 (average ~108). We have 338 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3). Since the P1 order did not arrive by the start of P4, the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect this delay. For demand, I'll use recent_N with N=3 to capture the upward trend (average ~108). mu_hat needs to cover (1+L) periods, so (1+3)*108 = 432. sigma_hat will use the default calculation for the increased lead time window.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed to be at least 3 periods (Period 1 order of 138 units not arrived by start of Period 4, exceeding promised L=2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival of the Period 1 order (138 units, L=3) and the Period 3 order (65 units, L=1). The Period 2 order (135 units) is still in transit after 3 periods, suggesting high lead-time variability. Demand has been fluctuating but shows a recent upward trend (P5 demand of 134 follows a dip in P4, but P2 and P3 were high). I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed L=3 and L=1 samples. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the full sample set of demand (mean=100.4) given the short history. This balances the stock against the high lead-time volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile: observed L=1 and L=3 (avg=2), while Period 2 order remains in transit after 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $337.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the lead time and demand patterns. History shows significant lead time volatility: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (L=3), Period 3 arrived in 1 period (L=1), and Period 2 (ordered P2) is still missing after 3 full periods (should have arrived by P5 start if L=2). This suggests a risk of lost or severely delayed shipments for the Period 2 order. Demand has been relatively stable but fluctuating around a mean: 89, 107, 129, 75, 93 (Average \u2248 98). Given the uncertainty in lead time and the potential for a lost shipment, I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat to ensure coverage for (L+1)=3 periods of demand. With On-hand at 35 and In-transit at 342 (mostly P2, P4, P5), the total pipeline seems high, but if P2 (135 units) is lost, the effective pipeline is much lower. I will set mu_hat based on the average demand of ~100/period * 3 periods = 300, and use a safe sigma_hat to account for demand and lead-time variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly volatile: P1=3, P3=1, P2 is potentially lost (in-transit for 4 periods). Forecast remains stable around 100 units/period.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory. History shows significant lead time volatility and unreliability. Specifically, the order from Period 2 (135 units) has been in-transit for 5 periods (placed P2, hasn't arrived by P7 start), suggesting it is likely lost or significantly delayed. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations include 3 periods (P1) and 1 period (P3). The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 97.5 units. Given that we have 342 units in-transit (P2: 135, P4: 130, P5: 77) and the P2 order is likely lost, the 'functional' pipeline is closer to 207 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the current stockout and future demand (L+1 periods), I am setting L to 3 (reflecting the observed maximum lead time) and using a recent demand average (N=6) of 100 units/period to calculate mu_hat. This targets a base stock that accounts for the extended lead time and recent demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 2 order (135 units) confirmed as likely lost (in-transit for 5 periods vs promised 2). Sustained lead-time volatility and supply unreliability observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $305.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable, with a mean of approximately 96 units over the last 7 periods (89, 107, 129, 75, 93, 92, 87). However, supply reliability is a major issue. We have confirmed lead times of 3 periods (P1, P4) and 1 period (P3). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (135 units) has been in transit for 6 periods and is almost certainly lost, which the OR backend does not know. Current on-hand is 43, and the backend sees 292 in transit (P2=135, P5=77, P7=80). Since P2 is likely lost, the true pipeline is only 157. To compensate for the 'phantom' inventory of 135 units and the volatile lead time (average is 2.33, but promised is 2), I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to increase the safety stock buffer and base stock level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand stability.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Permanent loss of Period 2 order (135 units) confirmed (6 periods in-transit). True pipeline inventory is 135 units lower than system records.

Daily Reward (R_t): $340.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of lead times (L) shows extreme volatility: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1. The average observed lead time is (3+1+3+3+1)/5 = 2.2 periods. Critically, the P2 order (135 units) has been in-transit for 7 periods and is confirmed as a lost shipment. The 'In-transit' figure of 214 includes this lost order; therefore, the true pipeline is 214 - 135 = 79 units (the order from P8). Demand is stable: the last 8 periods have an average of 97.5 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the inflated 'In-transit' count (which it subtracts from the base stock), I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for L=2 (meaning a 3-period coverage) as (3 periods * 100 units/period) = 300 units. To compensate for the 135-unit ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat to 300 + 135 = 435. This ensures the backend orders enough to reach the true target. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average of ~2.2.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Ghost inventory (lost P2 order) remains in system totals. Pipeline inventory must be adjusted by +135 units in mu_hat calculation to ensure sufficient ordering.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with the most recent sample (58 units) being slightly lower than the average (~100 units). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (avg ~85) to reflect the recent slight cooling in demand while maintaining responsiveness. Lead time analysis: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1, P8=1. The average lead time is (3+1+3+3+1+1)/6 = 2, which aligns with the promised L. The major issue is the Period 2 order (135 units) which is now 8 periods in-transit and definitively lost. The OR backend includes this 'ghost inventory' in pipeline calculations, causing it to under-order. To compensate, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * Forecast_Demand + Ghost_Units. With L=2 and Forecast=85, the nominal mu_hat is 255. Adding 135 units of lost inventory makes the explicit mu_hat 390. This forces the OR engine to order enough to ignore the lost 135 units. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 11. On-hand inventory is critically low at 3 units. In-transit inventory is 308, but 135 of those units (from the Period 2 order) are confirmed lost (in-transit for 9 periods against a promised 2). This 'ghost inventory' results in the OR backend under-ordering because it believes the pipeline is fuller than it is. To compensate for this 135-unit deficit and prevent stockouts, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the average demand (approx. 100 units/period) over (L+1) periods. With an average lead time of 2, the expected demand for 3 periods is 300 units. Adding a buffer for volatility (+10% or approx 30 units) and explicitly adding the 135 lost units to the base stock target ensures the order placed covers the gap. Therefore, mu_hat = (300 + 30 + 135) = 465. I use 'calculate' for L to acknowledge the high lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods) and 'default' for sigma_hat.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 466 units in-transit. Crucially, the 'in-transit' figure includes 135 units from Period 2 that are now 10 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 331 units (466 - 135). Demand remains stable with a historical mean of approximately 100 units/period (last 5 periods: 92, 87, 108, 58, 110, 138; avg \u2248 99). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2. To account for the lost P2 order and prevent the OR backend from under-ordering (since it sees the 135 lost units as 'pending arrival'), I use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat to (1+L)*mean_demand + lost_units = (1+2)*100 + 135 = 435. This ensures the base stock calculation effectively ignores the 'ghost' inventory. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Ghost inventory (lost Period 2 order of 135 units) continues to distort the OR engine's pipeline calculations. mu_hat must be adjusted upward by 135 to compensate for this permanent deficit until on-hand levels normalize.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the on-hand inventory is 78 units. The 'In-transit' quantity is 306 units, but this includes the lost Period 2 order (135 units) which has been missing for 11 periods. The effective pipeline inventory is actually 171 units (306 - 135). The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline). Because the backend incorrectly includes the 135 lost units in 'pipeline', it will under-order by exactly 135 units. To compensate, I must increase the base_stock target by 135 units using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The average demand across the last 12 periods is approximately 98.5 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the standard look-ahead is (1+L) = 3 periods of demand (approx 295.5 units). Adding the 135-unit compensation results in a mu_hat of 430.5. I am sticking with the default L (promised) and sigma_hat calculations as demand remains stable and lead times, though volatile (1-3 periods), average out to 2.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are out of stock (on-hand: 0) with a pipeline inventory of 384 units. However, this pipeline is inflated by 135 units from a lost shipment (Period 2), which the OR engine still counts as valid 'in-transit'. The actual reliable pipeline is only 249 units (384 - 135). Recent demand (Periods 11-13) has been high (138, 95, 122), averaging ~118 units/period, while the overall game mean is ~100. Lead times continue to be volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2). To compensate for the 'ghost inventory' and ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the actual deficit, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 2. Calculation: (1 + L) * Forecast + Ghost Inventory Buffer = (1 + 2) * 110 + 135 = 465. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time of 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging 97.4 units per period across 14 samples. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.4), with one confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (135 units). This lost shipment is still counted as 'In-transit' (357 units) by the OR engine, creating 'ghost inventory'. To prevent the engine from under-ordering, I must adjust mu_hat upward to compensate for this 135-unit deficit. Calculation: Average demand per period is ~100. For L=2, the backend expects a base stock covering 3 periods (~300 units). However, because 135 units of the 357 in-transit units are lost, the actual pipeline is only 222 units. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set the target level to (1+L)*mean + ghost_adjustment, which is (1+2)*100 + 135 = 435. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility. For sigma_hat, I use N=10 to capture recent demand variance.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has an 'on-hand' inventory of 0 and an 'in-transit' total of 416 units. However, we have a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (135 units) that is still counted by the OR engine as part of the pipeline. Since the OR engine calculates the order as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', this 'ghost inventory' results in an under-order of 135 units every period. To neutralize this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Average demand is stable around 100 units/period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the total expected demand over (L+1) periods is 300. Adding the 135-unit lost shipment offset, the explicit mu_hat is 435. For L, although volatile, the average observed lead time remains close to 2 (observed: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3), so I will use 'calculate' to let the engine use the historical average. For sigma_hat, I will use 'default' (all samples) to capture the demand volatility observed across the history (range: 58-138).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) despite recent arrivals, due to consistent lead time volatility and a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (135 units). Lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the most frequent recently (P11, P12, P13 all arrived with L=3). To account for the 'ghost inventory' of the 135-unit lost shipment that still erroneously counts towards the OR engine's pipeline balance, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Average demand is stable around 100 units/period. For a target lead time of 2 periods (providing coverage for 3 periods including the current one), the base stock should be (1+2)*100 = 300. However, I must add 135 units to mu_hat to offset the lost P2 order, resulting in 435 units. This ensures the OR engine places an order sufficient to cover actual demand needs. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility while maintaining responsiveness.

Daily Reward (R_t): $286.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging 97 units across all 17 periods, with recent demand (last 5 periods) averaging 102.8 units. The supply chain remains volatile: L=3 is the most frequent lead time (observed in 7 out of 11 arrivals), while L=1 occurs occasionally, and the Period 2 order (135 units) is permanently lost. The current 'In-transit' figure of 287 units includes this 135-unit ghost inventory, meaning the real pipeline is only 152 units (Period 15 and Period 17 orders). To compensate for the OR engine's overestimation of pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (1+L) * mean_demand. With L=2 (promised) or L=3 (actual common), and mean demand ~100, target base stock should be ~400. However, because the engine subtracts the ghost 135 units from its order calculation, I must inflate mu_hat by 135 units. Calculated mu_hat = (1+2)*100 + 135 = 435. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent volatility to maintain a safe buffer against the frequent stockouts seen in history.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units/period (average of last 10 periods: 104; last 5: 92; last 3: 82). I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture this baseline. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2), so I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average observed performance. Crucially, the 'ghost inventory' from the lost Period 2 order (135 units) still persists in the system's in-transit calculation (Total in-transit: 377, minus P15: 72, P17: 80, P18: 90 leaves 135 units unaccounted for). To neutralize this, I am manually inflating mu_hat by 135 units using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L_promised) * 100 + 135 = 3 * 100 + 135 = 435. This ensures the base_stock calculation accounts for the permanent 135-unit deficit in real pipeline inventory, preventing stockouts caused by the OR engine overestimating available stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent mean of approximately 98 units per period over the last 19 periods. However, the system is currently stock-out (On-hand: 0). The primary issue is the 'Ghost Inventory' from Period 2 (135 units), which never arrived and is permanently lost. This lost order remains in the OR engine's 'In-transit' count, causing it to under-order because it believes those 135 units are still coming. To compensate for this 135-unit deficit in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at ((1+L) * mean_demand) + 135. With L=2 (promised) and mean=100, (1+2)*100 + 135 = 435. Regarding lead time, observations show high volatility (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), but the average is close to the promised L=2. I will use L=2 to keep the base-stock calculation stable while the extra mu_hat covers the lost shipment gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Ghost inventory (lost Period 2 order of 135 units) continues to persist in the system's in-transit total. To prevent critical stock-outs, mu_hat must be manually inflated by +135 units to offset this phantom stock until the system record is corrected or irrelevant.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit 'pipeline' of 466 units. However, this includes the Period 2 order of 135 units, which is confirmed lost (in-transit for 18 periods). Consequently, the actual effective pipeline is only 331 units (466 - 135). The OR engine calculates the order as (base_stock - reported_pipeline). If the reported pipeline is artificially inflated by 135 units, it will under-order by exactly that amount. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat by 135 units. The demand for chips(Regular) has remained steady with a mean of approximately 98.7 units per period. Using a 3-period lead time safety factor (L=2 promised, but often 3 observed), the base mu_hat would be (1+L) * 98.7 \u2248 296. Adding the 135 unit 'ghost inventory' offset results in a target mu_hat of 431. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility to maintain service levels during lead time fluctuations.

The system is currently in a stock-out state (on-hand inventory = 0) following a prolonged period of no deliveries since Period 17.

The in-transit total of 468 units includes the 'ghost inventory' of 135 units from Period 2 that we identified as lost. This phantom inventory causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order because it believes pipeline inventory is higher than it actually is. To compensate for this 135-unit deficit and the current stock-out, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~100 units/period (mean of recent pulses). Over the review+lead time window (L+1 = 3), base demand is 300. Adding the 135 units to neutralize the ghost inventory brings the adjustment to 435. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility. For sigma_hat, I use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent demand variance while the system recovers.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state is critical: On-hand is 0, and current demand (approx. 100/period) has exhausted recent arrivals. We have 447 units in-transit, but this includes a lost shipment of 135 units from Period 2. The OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the target base stock, so this 'ghost' inventory causes chronic under-ordering. To compensate, I must inflate mu_hat. Mean demand is ~97 units. For L=2, base stock calculation uses (1+L) * demand. With ghost inventory being 135 units, I'm setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock should cover 3 periods (~300 units) + safety stock (~200 units) + the 135 unit deficit = ~635. Given the high stock-out risk and recent small orders from the backend, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 650 to force a larger order that accounts for the lost P2 shipment and current backlogs.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 units on-hand and 655 units in-transit. Crucially, 135 of those in-transit units are from an order placed in Period 2, which is now 23 periods overdue and confirmed lost. The internal OR logic subtracts all 'in-transit' units from the target base stock, but since these 135 units will never arrive, the system persistently under-orders. To rectify this without manual intervention in the backend, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean demand of ~100 units/period and an effective lead time (including current decision + arrival) of L+1 = 3. This yields 300 units. To offset the 135-unit 'ghost' inventory error, I inflate the demand target by +135, totaling 435. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time (ranging 1-3 periods). For sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand volatility (~18 units/period).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 654 units in-transit. Based on historical data, Period 2's order of 135 units is permanently lost (unresolved for 24 periods), creating 'ghost inventory' that prevents the OR backend from ordering enough. Therefore, the pipeline is effectively 519 units (654 - 135). Demand remains stable around 100 units/period (mean of last 10 samples is 101.9). Current lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.3 periods. To ensure the OR engine covers the risk of stockout while accounting for the lost 135 units, I will set L to 3 (recent worst-case) and mu_hat using 'explicit' to include the compensation. Calculation: (1 + L) * Forecasted Demand + Ghost Inventory = (1 + 3) * 102 + 135 = 408 + 135 = 543. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to handle historical volatility.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and a distorted pipeline of 654 units. This pipeline is highly suspicious as it includes the lost Period 2 order (135 units) and several other orders that haven't arrived. Historical analysis shows demand remains stable at approximately 100 units/period (mean of provided 5 initialization samples is 100.4; mean of the last 10 concludes is 97.1). The OR engine's formula [base_stock - pipeline_inventory] is dangerous here because the 'In-transit' figure of 654 is significantly inflated by both the lost P2 order and potential additional losses or delays from the Period 15-20 gap. To force the backend to place an order when on-hand is 0 and the pipeline is 'full' of phantom units, I must set mu_hat (the target level) to exceed the ghost pipeline. I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat to 800, which accounts for the (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~300 units) plus the 135 confirmed lost units and a buffer for other potentially lost/delayed shipments currently clogging the pipeline. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility which averages to ~2.3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply chain disruption confirmed: multiple orders from Periods 15-22 appear lost or excessively delayed, contributing to a massive 'in-transit' total that does not reflect actual upcoming arrivals. Total ghost inventory potentially exceeds 300 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe crisis. On-hand inventory is 0, and the system shows 833 units in-transit. However, historical performance reveals that almost all of this in-transit inventory is 'ghost inventory' from lost or excessively delayed orders (Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, etc.). Because the OR backend relies on pipeline stock (in-transit) to calculate the order size, it will refuse to order more if it believes 833 units are arriving. To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom in-transit stock plus the desired base stock. Current demand is stable around 100 units/period (average ~98). Using a 3-period lead time logic, the target base stock should be ~400 units. To overcome the 833 'ghost' units, I am setting mu_hat to 1350 via the 'explicit' method. This provides enough overhead to trigger a replenishment order of approximately 517 units, which is necessary to restore on-hand availability and satisfy demand while acknowledging that previous orders are likely lost.

Carry-over insight: Massive supply chain failure: 'In-transit' total of 833 units is largely comprised of lost shipments from P15 onwards. Pipeline total is no longer reliable for stock-level decisions.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of extreme failure. In-transit inventory has ballooned to 1205 units, but the last significant arrival was only 20 units in Period 23. Historical demand remains remarkably stable around 100 units/period (mean of last 20 samples is ~97), yet the stock-out has persisted for most of the last 10 periods despite massive orders. The 'In-transit' figure contains roughly 900+ units of 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (Periods 2, 15-19, 22, 24). To force the OR backend\u2014which subtracts pipeline inventory from its target base stock\u2014to place an order, I must set mu_hat (target level) to exceed the ghost inventory plus expected demand. With 1205 in transit, a standard 300-400 target results in zero orders. I will set mu_hat to 1600 units (1200 to offset phantom stock + 400 for safety) to ensure we actually place a replenishment order of approximately 400 units, as the current on-hand is 0 and we are losing all profit.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory confirmed at ~1000 units by Period 29 (sum of lost/delayed orders from P15-P26). Backend 'In-transit' calculation is completely decoupled from Physical Reality, requiring massive mu_hat inflation.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely compromised. At Period 30, 'In-transit' shows 1455 units, but the vast majority is 'ghost inventory' from orders placed between Period 15 and 26 that have not arrived despite the promised 2-period lead time. Specifically, we are missing orders from P15 (72), P17 (80), P18 (90), P19 (69), and P24 (208), among others. This ghost total is estimated at approximately 1200+ units. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' from the target base stock, it will result in zero orders unless we artificially inflate mu_hat. Demand averages ~100 units/period (mean of all samples). With L=2, the required base stock is ~300. To force an order while the system wrongly thinks we have 1455 units coming, we must set mu_hat to cover the expected demand PLUS the ghost inventory. I am setting mu_hat to 1300 + (1+L)*100 = 1600. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to place a replacement order for the current cycle, maintaining on-hand availability despite the broken pipeline reporting.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory confirmed at ~1200 units by Period 30 (sum of lost/delayed orders from P15-P26). Pipeline inventory is essentially irrelevant for replenishment. mu_hat must be significantly inflated (approx +1200 to +1300 units) to override the 'in-transit' deduction in the OR engine and ensure new orders are actually placed.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. There is a confirmed cumulative loss of approximately 1150 units in 'ghost inventory' (orders from P15 onwards that haven't arrived/will likely never arrive) which continues to inflate the system's pipeline inventory. In Period 30, we saw 372 units arrive, resulting in an on-hand balance of 360. However, the system still sees 1150 units 'in-transit'. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit). To force the engine to place any orders despite this massive phantom pipeline, mu_hat must be significantly inflated. The current demand mean is ~100. With L=2, base_stock would normally be around 300-400. To overcome the 1150 in-transit deduction and ensure we maintain stock, mu_hat is set to 1500 (approx. 1150 ghost units + safe stock levels). Recent history (P27-P30) shows arrivals at L=2, so we revert L to default but maintain the mu_hat buffer to bypass the pipeline distortion.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory confirmed at ~1150 units by Period 31. Pipeline inventory is decoupling from physical arrivals. mu_hat must be manually inflated by approximately 1150 units to override the 'in-transit' deduction in the OR engine.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive reliable-to-unreliable transition. The 'In-transit' total is currently 1166 units, but history shows that orders from Period 15 through at least Period 22 (and others) never arrived, creating 'ghost inventory' that the OR engine subtracts from its base stock calculation. By Period 31, I estimate roughly 1150 units of in-transit inventory are permanently lost (ghosts). In Period 30, a large order from P28 (372 units) finally arrived, replenishing on-hand stock to 246 units. However, to prevent the OR engine from stopping orders due to the 1166 units of 'in-transit' (which it views as upcoming supply), I must inflate mu_hat. Demand remains stable around 100 units/period (mean of samples is ~100). Assuming L=2, the base stock should cover 3 periods (~300 units). With on-hand at 246 and real pipeline likely being orders from P29-P31 (429+67+16=512), the backend would normally see 246 + 1166 and order 0. To force a maintenance order that accounts for the ghost inventory, I set mu_hat using 'explicit' at 1450 (calculated as: 300 base stock + 1150 ghost offset). This ensures the backend sees (1450 - 1412) and potentially places a small replenishment order or stays at parity without being starved by the phantom stock.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost/never-arriving orders) remains stagnant at approximately 1150 units. This volume must be added to mu_hat indefinitely to bypass the 'In-transit' deduction in the OR backend.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant reliability issues. Current on-hand inventory is 155 units with an 'In-transit' figure of 1219 units. Many of these units are 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (notably P2, P15-P19, P24, P25, P26, and P29-P30). Specifically, from the current 1219 in-transit, only a small portion is likely to arrive. We recently saw arrivals from P27, P28, and P31. The order from P30 (67 units) and P32 (69 units) are the most credible candidates for future arrival. The ghost inventory is calculated as (Total In-transit - Credible Pipeline). Total In-transit is 1219. Credible pipeline includes P29 (429 units - overdue), P30 (67 units), and P32 (69 units). Even if we treat P29 as potentially arriving, the ghost inventory is approximately 1219 - (429 + 67 + 69) = 654 units. However, given P29 is already delayed past the average 2-3 day window, the true ghost volume is likely closer to 1000-1100 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the daily demand (~100 units/period) while ignoring the 1219 units it thinks are coming, I will set mu_hat using the explicit method to approximately (1+L)*demand + Ghost Inventory. With L=2, (3*100) + 1100 = 1400.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive documentation of 'ghost inventory' \u2013 orders that are listed as in-transit but have effectively been lost or destroyed (Periods 2, 15, 18, 19, 24, etc.). Currently, the 'In-transit' figure is 1205 units, while historical average demand is ~100 per period. If the OR engine uses the default logic (base_stock - pipeline), it will place an order of 0 indefinitely, leading to an eventual stockout as the current on-hand of 131 is depleted. To force the backend to place a restorative order, I must set mu_hat (the target level) to exceed the ghost inventory plus the desired safety stock. Based on the Carry-Over Insights, approximately 1150-1200 units are 'ghosts'. Current demand is stable (mean of 100). Therefore, the actual target stock for a 3-period horizon (L=2) should be ~300. Adding the ~1150 ghost units gives a target mu_hat of ~1450. I will use 'explicit' values to bypass the backend's miscalculation of the pipeline.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging approximately 100 units per period (last 5 periods mean: 107 units). The supply chain remains severely compromised by 'ghost inventory'. Currently, the system records 'In-transit: 1347 units'. However, looking at the history, many orders from the P15-P26 range never arrived. Specifically, subtracting the recent successful arrivals from the historical in-transit total reveals approximately 1,150 to 1,200 units that are likely lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1,347 units (pipeline) from its base stock calculation, it will refuse to place new orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset this phantom inventory. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, calculated as [(1+L) * mean_demand] + ghost_inventory. With L=2 and mean_demand=100, (1+2)*100 = 300. Adding 1,200 units of ghost inventory gives a target mu_hat of 1,500. This ensures the OR engine places a replenishment order of approximately 150 units (the target stock minus the phantom pipeline) to maintain on-hand levels as the current 31 units will likely be depleted by this period's demand.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive ghost inventory. Orders from Periods 15-26 (excluding P20, P21, and P23) never arrived and are effectively lost, yet they remain in the 'In-transit' count. As of Period 36, the In-transit total is 1495 units. Based on historical tracking, approximately 1300 units of this total are 'ghost' units (e.g., P15-P26 total orders minus small arrivals). This phantom inventory causes the OR engine to believe the pipeline is full, preventing it from placing new orders. Demand remains stable, averaging ~100 units/period (last 5 periods: 114, 107, 93, 100, 97). With 0 on-hand inventory and the system deducting 1495 units from its base stock calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force new orders. To cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~300 units) and overcome the -1495 pipeline deduction, I set mu_hat to 1800. This ensures the OR backend sees (1800 - 1495) = 305 units of net requirement, triggering a replenishment order to cover the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at ~1300 units within the 1495 In-transit total. mu_hat must be inflated to ~1800 to bypass the backend's pipeline deduction and maintain physical stock.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to display a massive 'In-transit' figure (1684 units) that is significantly decoupled from physical reality due to cumulative lost shipments since Period 15. Based on historical data, demand remains steady at approximately 98-100 units per period. The backend OR engine subtracts all in-transit inventory from the target base stock. To trigger a replenishment order that overcomes this 1684-unit 'ghost' deduction and establishes a physical base stock for a (L+1=3) period window, mu_hat must be inflated to approximately 2000 units (1684 ghost units + ~300 units physical requirement). This ensures the order placed is sufficient to maintain stock as older, missing shipments are never resolved.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost/never-arriving orders) has increased to approximately 1400-1500 units by Period 37, given the In-transit total of 1684 compared to actual expected arrivals. mu_hat must be inflated to ~2000 to maintain physical service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-65.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 98 units per period over the last 10 periods. The critical issue is the persistent 'ghost inventory' in the system's pipeline records. As of Period 38, the In-transit total is 1487 units. Based on historical data, much of this consists of lost or severely delayed orders from the Period 15-26 disruption. In Period 37, we saw two shipments arrive totaling 479 units (from P35 and P36), which brought our on-hand inventory to 445 units. However, to maintain regular ordering, we must continue to inflate mu_hat to offset the ~1400 units of ghost inventory that the OR engine will otherwise subtract from the target base stock. I am setting mu_hat to 2000 to ensure we place a replacement order if physical stock levels drop below the required buffer for a 2-period lead time. L is set to 'calculate' to adapt to the recent mix of 1-3 period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost/never-arriving orders) is estimated at approximately 1400 units, as the In-transit total of 1487 heavily outweighs realistic upcoming arrivals. mu_hat must remain significantly inflated to override the backend's pipeline deduction.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive ghost inventory. Period 39 shows an 'In-transit' total of 1581 units. Based on history, the vast majority of this (approximately 1400-1500 units) consists of lost orders from periods 15-26 that will never arrive. Specifically, recent successful arrivals from Periods 34, 35, and 36 confirm that current lead times are around 1-2 periods, yet the pipeline hasn't cleared the massive backlog. To ensure the OR backend places a replenishment order, mu_hat must be inflated to exceed the (In-transit + On-hand) subtraction. Demand is stable near 100/period. With 333 on-hand and 1581 'in-transit', the backend sees 1914 units of coverage. I will set mu_hat to 2100 using 'explicit' to bypass this deduction and trigger a reasonably sized safety order. I'll use L=2 (promised) as recent actuals are 1-2.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost/never-arriving orders) is estimated at approximately 1500 units as of Period 39. The 'In-transit' figure of 1581 is decoupled from physical reality. mu_hat must remain inflated above 2000 to override the backend's pipeline deduction and maintain physical inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-7.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system's 'In-transit' figure of 1697 units is largely comprised of 'ghost inventory' from massive supply chain failures between Periods 15 and 26. Based on recent physical arrivals (Period 34 arriving in P36, Period 35/36 arriving in P37, and Period 38 arriving in P39), the supply chain has partially stabilized but remains volatile (lead times of 1-2 periods). Demand is steady around 98 units/period (mean of last 20 samples). With 343 units on hand and a ghost inventory estimate of approximately 1500 units (1697 total in-transit minus the Period 39 order of 210 units which is actually expected to arrive), I must continue to inflate mu_hat significantly to bypass the OR backend's deduction of this phantom pipeline. To maintain a physical base stock of ~300 units (enough for 3 periods), and because the backend subtracts ~1700 units (In-transit), I set mu_hat explicitly to 2000. This ensures the OR engine calculates a need for new stock despite the inflated in-transit record.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost/never-arriving orders) is estimated at approximately 1500 units as of Period 40. The 'In-transit' figure is disconnected from physical reality. Maintenance of on-hand inventory requires mu_hat inflation to ~2000 units to override backend pipeline deductions.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to struggle with 'ghost inventory' - orders placed in Periods 15-26 that haven't arrived and likely never will. As of Period 41, the OR backend sees an In-transit total of 1487 units. However, based on recent history, actual arrivals are functioning on a lead time of 1-2 periods. Specifically, the orders from P38, P39, and P40 (94, 210, and 0 units) have mostly been resolved or are expected. Subtracting realistic upcoming shipments from the 1487 In-transit units confirms approximately 1400-1500 units are 'ghosts'. Current on-hand is healthy (458), and demand remains stable around 100 units/period (mean of last 20 samples is 99.4). Since the OR backend subtracts the full 1487 In-transit from its target base stock, I must set mu_hat to approximately 1800-2000 to trigger any new replenishment orders. I will use 'explicit' values to bypass the backend's default calculations which are based on the faulty pipeline data. I'm setting mu_hat to 1800 to ensure that even with the 1487 deduction and current on-hand, the system maintains a safety buffer without over-ordering to the point of excessive holding costs, as we are entering the final 10 periods of the game.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' inventory of 1487 units. Based on historical data from Period 15 through Period 40, we have confirmed that a massive volume of orders never arrived, creating 'ghost inventory'. By subtracting recent actual arrivals from the In-transit total, I estimate that approximately 1400-1500 units of this total are lost shipments. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire In-transit balance (including these ghost units) from the target base stock, it will not place any new orders unless the mu_hat parameter is significantly inflated. Current demand is stable at ~100 units per period. With on-hand inventory at 356 and a promised lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage needed), we are safe for now, but we must override the backend's pipeline deduction to prevent a future stock-out. I am setting mu_hat to 2000 (roughly 1500 'ghost' units + 500 for actual demand/safety stock) to ensure the system logic allows for replenishment once on-hand levels drop further.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains stable at approximately 1400-1500 units as of Period 42. Recent actual lead times have varied between 1 and 2 periods (P38 L=1, P39 L=1, P40 L=0/1), but the pipeline distortion remains the primary risk.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to present two distinct challenges: a significant 'ghost inventory' of roughly 1,500 units in the system's in-transit record that will never arrive (based on historical losses from Period 15-26), and recent actual lead times that fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods (P38 L=1, P39 L=1, P41-42 no arrivals yet). On-hand inventory is healthy at 281 units, but to ensure the OR backend continues to place orders despite the 1,660 units 'in-transit', mu_hat must be significantly inflated. The base demand remains stable around 100 units per period. With a 2-period promised lead time, the backend looks to cover 3 periods of demand (approx 300 units). I will set mu_hat to 1,900 units. This value, when the backend subtracts the ~1,660 in-transit units, effectively targets a replenishment level that maintains our current physical stock and accounts for 3 periods of actual future demand, overriding the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost inventory remains around 1500 units. Reliable lead time for recent physical arrivals is 1-2 periods. mu_hat inflation is required to keep physical stock above zero.

The supply chain continues to suffer from a massive decoupling between the system's 'In-transit' record (1660 units) and physical reality. Historical analysis indicates that approximately 1500 units of this in-transit total are 'ghost inventory' from lost or indefinitely delayed orders (primarily from the P15-P26 disruption). Without intervention, the OR backend would subtract this 1660 from the target base stock and place no orders. Recent physical arrivals (P38-P40) show an actual lead time of 1 period. To maintain physical stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to 1800 units. This value is calculated to override the 1660 in-transit deduction while providing for roughly 1.5 periods of demand (~150 units), ensuring a net order is generated to replenish on-hand inventory which has dropped to 145 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted with approximately 1500 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost/delayed orders from P15-P26) artificially inflating the 'In-transit' figure to 1676 units. Actual physical arrivals have recently shown a lead time of 1-2 periods. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite the phantom pipeline, mu_hat must be significantly inflated. The target total inventory (on-hand + actual pipeline) should cover (L+1) periods of demand (~300 units). With the backend subtracting 1676 units from its calculation, setting mu_hat at approximately 2000 units ensures a physical order is placed. Recent demand is stable around 100 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains stable at approximately 1500 units as of Period 45. The system's 'In-transit' total remains disconnected from physical reality, requiring mu_hat inflation to ~2000 to maintain replenishment logic.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a massive decoupling between the system's 'In-transit' record (1771 units) and physical reality. Historical analysis shows approximately 1500 units of this total are 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (primarily Periods 15-26). Recent physical arrivals (P45 arrival from P42) indicate an actual lead time (L) of approximately 3 periods. To ensure the OR engine actually places an order despite the 1771 unit pipeline credit, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds (In-transit - Ghost Inventory + Safety Stock). Total demand remains stable around 100 units/period. Therefore, with L=2 (promised), mu_hat must be set to approximately 2100 (100 units/period * (2+1) plus ~1800 to offset the ghost inventory and ensure a positive order). This allows the backend to bypass the 'cap' and 'pipeline' deductions to maintain physical on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 46, ghost inventory in the 'In-transit' total is estimated at 1550-1600 units. System records are permanently distorted by lost shipments from the P15-P28 window. Replenishment requires sustained mu_hat inflation to ~2100+ to ensure physical availability.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, the system reports an In-transit total of 1982 units. Based on historical data, the vast majority of this (approximately 1600-1650 units) is 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (Periods 15-28). The actual physical pipeline consists only of orders from Period 44 (16 units), Period 45 (268 units), and Period 46 (211 units), totaling 495 units. To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 1982-unit pipeline deduction, mu_hat must be inflated to at least the ghost inventory level plus the desired physical base stock. Demand remains stable around 100 units/period (mean=98, std=20). Lead times for recent arrivals (P39-P45) have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. I will set mu_hat to 2200 to override the 1982-unit deduction and maintain a safety buffer of physical stock, ensuring continuity as we approach the end of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 47, ghost inventory in the 'In-transit' total is estimated at ~1630 units (1982 reported - 373 recent real orders). mu_hat must be sustained at ~2200+ to negate this phantom stock and ensure physical orders are triggered.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to struggle with a massive misalignment between recorded 'In-transit' inventory and physical reality due to cumulative lost orders from Periods 15-28. As of Period 48, 'In-transit' is reported as 2135 units, while the physical pipeline consists roughly of orders from P44 (16), P45 (268), P46 (211), and P47 (153), totaling 648 units. This implies approximately 1487 units of 'ghost inventory' (2135 - 648). To ensure the OR engine triggers an order despite this phantom stock, mu_hat must be inflated to exceed the phantom volume plus the safety stock and cycle stock requirements. Demand remains stable around 100 units/period, and actual lead times have stabilized at 2-3 periods. I am setting mu_hat to 2300 to override the 2135 in-transit deduction and maintain a physical base stock of approximately 165 units.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 48, ghost inventory in the 'In-transit' total is estimated at ~1487 units. System records are permanently distorted. Replenishment requires sustained mu_hat inflation above the ghost inventory level (~2135 recorded) to ensure new physical orders are placed.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the system shows On-hand at 0 and In-transit at 2338 units. History confirms a massive 'ghost inventory' problem where approximately 1500-1600 units of the 'In-transit' figure are lost shipments from the Period 15-28 window. Real expected arrivals are significantly lower: only orders from P46 (211), P47 (153), and P48 (203) are potentially live. The backend OR engine subtracts the full 2338 from its target stock level. To ensure an order is actually placed to cover physical demand (~100/period) and replenish the empty shelf, mu_hat must be inflated to exceed the ghost inventory plus the desired safety stock. I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method at 2300 to bypass the pipeline deduction and L to 2 (promised) to stabilize the base stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure (2339) is severely decoupled from physical reality due to cumulative lost orders from previous periods (estimated around 1700-1800 units based on historical non-arrivals). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 for the third consecutive period (P48, P49, P50). Physical arrivals are expected from P46 (211 units), P47 (153 units), P48 (203 units), and P49 (1 unit), totaling 568 units. However, the OR backend's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see the 'In-transit' of 2339 and refuse to place any new orders unless mu_hat is inflated above that value. To ensure replenishment for the next cycle (assuming L=2-3), I must set mu_hat to approximately 2450 (covering the ~2339 ghost inventory plus current demand of ~100 units). I'm using 'explicit' to force this override.
