Looking at the history, the Period 12 order (placed P12, now start of P15 decision phase) should realistically arrive during Period 15 based on the maximum observed L=3 (confirmation would appear at P16 start). To protect against the lead time variability (L=1 to L=3) and the risk of lost shipments, I aim for a target inventory coverage of roughly 3 periods of demand (approx 310 units). Given the current pipeline of 525 units, we are technically over-indexed if all orders arrive. However, the history shows a 15-20% loss rate (2 out of 11 completed/past-due orders lost).

On-hand inventory is critically low (13 units), while Period 29 demand is expected to be ~100, leading to a high probability of a stockout this period before new arrivals hit. Analyzing the pipeline: Orders were placed in P24, P25, P26 (arrived), P27, and P28. Current in-transit includes P24 (100), P25 (100), P27 (100), and P28 (100), plus older shipments previously flagged as lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18 total 500 units). Removing the 500 lost units from the in-transit tally leaves 400 'reliable' units in the pipeline. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. To maintain a standard (L+1) coverage (3+1=4 periods) given the high risk of lost orders and current on-hand depletion, I need approximately 400 units of total inventory position. Current reliable position: 13 (on-hand) + 400 (reliable in-transit) = 413. This covers the next 4 periods of demand. However, given the precedent of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18), I will place a standard replenishment order of 100 units to maintain the flow and buffer against future losses, as the holding cost ($1) is equal to profit ($1), suggesting a conservative but steady replenishment strategy is optimal.",

Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after P42's demand resolution. To ensure stock for the next few periods (P43-P45) while accounting for the high loss rate, I need to maintain a robust pipeline. Summing expected demand for 3 periods (~300 units) and subtracting the reliable pipeline (P40, P41 are 200 units), while noting P42 (220 units) was a large catch-up order, I will place a standard replenishment order of 100 units to maintain flow, relying on the P40/P41/P42 sequence to resolve the current stockout.",

The current reliable pipeline consists of orders from P44 (100 units, L=2 now) and P45 (100 units, L=1 now). Total supply available for the next three periods (P46-P48) is 251 (on-hand) + 200 (reliable in-transit) = 451. Calculated demand for those periods (L+1=3) is ~300. This leaves a projected surplus of ~150 units.

Specifically, orders from P38 through P43 have all arrived. Looking at the current pipeline: On-hand is 84. In-transit consists of orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47 (all 100 units each). According to the 'Period 47 conclude', the arrival resolution of Period 47 (which we observe at P48 start) showed 0 units arrived. However, P44 is now at L=4 and P45 is at L=3. Given the Lead Time (L) is roughly 2-3, we expect P44/P45 to arrive during P48 or P49.
