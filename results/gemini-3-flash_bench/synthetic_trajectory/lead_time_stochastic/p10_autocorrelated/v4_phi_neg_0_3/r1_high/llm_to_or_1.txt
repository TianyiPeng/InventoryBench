Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical arrivals to calculate actual lead time, so we will use the promised lead time (L=2). The historical demand over the first 5 periods shows an upward trend (74, 108, 88, 98, 134), with an average of 100.4 units per period. Since this is the first decision, I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the initial historical average of 100.4 units/period, scaled by (1+L). The OR backend will calculate the base stock to achieve the high service level required by the $19.0 profit vs. $1.0 holding cost ratio (~95%). Starting from zero inventory, we need to build the pipeline quickly.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The sample demand for Period 1 was 98 (actual sold was 0 due to zero initial on-hand). The in-transit inventory is 138 units from the Period 1 order. Promised lead time is 2, meaning the Period 1 order should arrive in Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). For now, I will use the default lead time (2) and calculate the demand forecast based on the provided historical samples (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) plus the Period 1 observation (98). The mean of these 6 samples is approximately 100. Since we are in the early stages and variability is present but not yet showing a clear trend shift, 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat are appropriate to capture the baseline statistics.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (138 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Therefore, currently on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1 and 2. The mean demand over the first 5 historical samples is 100.4. Looking at the last 3 periods of history provided (P3=88, P4=98, P5=134) plus the two game periods (P1=98, P2=83), the demand is relatively stable but showed a spike to 134 in the history. Since we have no stock, we need the OR backend to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2, we need to cover 3 periods. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 2) and 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) to capture the most recent fluctuations including the game periods and the latter part of the pre-game history. This targets a base stock roughly around 300 units (3 * ~100), which reconciles with the 272 units already in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility (74, 108, 88, 98, 134, 83, 136). The mean demand over these 7 samples is approximately 103. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 358 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Reviewing 'conclude' messages: Period 1's order (138 units) has not arrived by the end of Period 3. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 with L=2 should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. Since 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0, the shipment is either delayed or the actual lead time is greater than 2. However, it's too early to confirm a permanent lead time shift or lost shipment based on only one missing arrival. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent high volatility and mean (approx 102). For lead time, I will stick to 'default' as we lack enough evidence to deviate from the promised 2 periods.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5 (deciding for Period 6 arrival and beyond). Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 74, 108, 88, 98, 134 (mean approx 100.4). My inventory position is On-hand (133) + In-transit (174) = 307. Based on history, Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time 3) and Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time 1). The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is 2. Since lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 3, I will use the 'calculate' method to let the backend average the observed performance. Demand recently spiked to 134 in Period 5, but the overall sample size is small (N=5). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand mean and volatility to reflect the full historical set while remaining sensitive to the recent upward movement. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1) suggests a high service level, which the base-stock policy will naturally maintain with these parameters.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 74, 108, 88, 98, 134 (mean \u2248 100.4). However, the observation log shows different demand numbers in the conclude messages: 98, 83, 136, 91, 76 (mean \u2248 96.8). I will prioritize the conclude message data. Lead time analysis: P1 order arrived at P4 (L=3), P3 order arrived at P4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. The P2 order (134 units) is still in transit (ordered P2, should have arrived P4 or P5 if L=2 or 3); it has currently been 4 periods since P2 without arrival, suggesting it might be delayed or potentially lost, though it's too early to confirm total loss. Pipeline inventory is high (324). Since lead times are volatile (1 to 3+), I will set L to 'calculate' to use the average observed lead time. For demand, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent history which shows a fairly stable mean around 97-100 units per period. The sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect current volatility.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand history (Periods 1-6) shows values of 98, 83, 136, 91, 76, 115, with an average of ~100. Previous demand data (P1-P5 from user prompt) was 74, 108, 88, 98, 134. Combining these, the demand is relatively stable around a mean of 100-110. Lead time analysis: Period 1 arrived at P4 (LT=3), Period 3 arrived at P4 (LT=1). Orders from Period 2 (134 units), Period 4 (40 units), Period 5 (150 units), and Period 6 (84 units) are currently in-transit (Total 408). The promised LT is 2. The variability in LT (1 to 3) suggests we should use a 'calculate' or 'explicit' approach for L, but since we are early, 'calculate' is safer to capture the mean. For mu_hat, the sample mean is roughly 100/period. With L=2, (1+L) * mean = 300. However, current in-transit (408) exceeds this, which might suppress the OR order. I will use a conservative mu_hat based on the recent average demand (~100/period) and default settings to allow the backend to manage the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $760.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 433 in-transit. Historical demand over 12 periods (5 pre-game + 7 game) shows a mean of approximately 96 units (mean of all samples: 96.1). There is a pattern of erratic lead times: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P4 took 3 periods. The P2 order (134 units) is significantly overdue (ordered P2, expected P4/P5, now P8), suggesting it is likely lost. The P5 (150 units), P6 (84 units), and P7 (65 units) orders are still within a plausible lead-time window. Given the stockout for two consecutive periods and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), maintaining sufficient pipeline inventory is critical. I will set L to 3 (the max observed lead time) to be conservative against delays. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand volatility while hedging for the (3+1) period demand window.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile (observed 1 and 3 periods); P2 order (134 units) likely lost as it hasn't arrived by P8.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe significant lead time variability and a likely lost order from Period 2 (ordered 134 units, now 7 periods overdue). History shows lead times of either 1 or 3 periods (Average: 2.2). Recent demand has fluctuated but remains around a mean of 100 units/period. The current 'In-transit' of 269 units includes orders from P6 (84 units) and P8 (51 units), plus the suspected lost P2 order (134 units). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering because it assumes the 134 units are still coming, I will use an explicit L=3 to account for the frequent delays. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the mean of the available history (approx 100) across the review+lead period (1+3=4 periods), totaling 400. Sigma_hat is set to the standard deviation of recent demand (approx 20) scaled by sqrt(1+3), totaling 40.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is bimodal (1 or 3 periods). Shipment from Period 2 (134 units) is confirmed lost as of Period 9 (7 periods since order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1772.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a fairly stable demand pattern for 'chips(Regular)' with a mean of approximately 100 units across the first 9 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 71 units, while 298 units are in-transit. A critical observation from history is the lead-time behavior: orders consistently arrive in either 1 or 3 periods (bimodal distribution), while the P2 order of 134 units is confirmed lost. Specifically, orders from P1, P4, and P5 arrived in 3 periods, while orders from P3, P7, and P8 arrived in 1 period. To protect against the 3-period lead-time risk (L=3), the pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 4 periods. Given the average demand is ~100, the target stock should be around 400. Total current pipeline is 71 (on-hand) + 298 (in-transit) = 369. To ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed reality of 3-period lead times (rather than the promised 2), I am explicitly setting L to 3. I will use the last 5 periods of demand (avg ~87.6) for mu_hat via recent_N to reflect the slightly lower recent volume compared to the early spikes, while using default for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Analysis of history shows Period 2's order (134 units) is definitively lost. Observed lead times have been 1 or 3 periods (Average ~2.25). Currently, we are out of stock (ending on-hand 0 at Period 10). In-transit inventory includes orders from Period 9 (80) and Period 10 (56), but the oldest in-transit order is from Period 6 (84 units), which is now 5 periods old and likely lost or significantly delayed, similar to Period 2. Demand is relatively stable with a mean around 95 units per period. I will use L=3 to be conservative given the history of 3-period arrivals and lost shipments. mu_hat will use the last 7 samples to capture recent demand trends (Mean ~87, adjusted for L+1). sigma_hat will be set via recent_N to handle the moderate volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Orders from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (84 units) are likely lost, significantly reducing the effective pipeline inventory.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory and 415 units reported in-transit. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights and history, the shipments from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (84 units) are definitively lost (P2 is 10 periods old, P6 is 6 periods old). This reduces the effective pipeline to 197 units (Orders from P9, P10, and P11). Historically, lead times are bimodal (1 or 3 periods). The order from P9 (80 units) is now at lead_time 3, so it is expected to arrive during P12. Demand has been relatively stable, with the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaging 87.8 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent stability while maintaining the promised lead time of 2 for the internal OR safety stock calculations, as the bimodal pattern (1, 3) averages to 2.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Shipments from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (84 units) are lost and will not arrive. Effective pipeline inventory calculation must exclude these units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13 with 0 on-hand inventory and 279 units in-transit. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, the shipments from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (84 units) are confirmed lost and will not arrive. This means the actual effective pipeline inventory is 279 - 134 - 84 = 61 units (the order from P11). The order from P12 was 0. Demand has recently spiked to 150 (P12) and 110 (P11), ending a period of stockouts. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are bimodal at 1 or 3 periods, averaging 2.25. To recover from the current stockout (on-hand = 0) and account for the significant lost inventory which the OR backend still believes is coming, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure a high enough base stock is set to trigger an order that covers the true pipeline gap. I'll estimate demand based on the recent higher samples (avg approx 100-110) over a 3-period horizon (L+1). I will set L to 3 to reflect the risk of the longer lead time observation and provide a buffer.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, On-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit inventory is 427 units. However, consistent with past 'Carry-over Insights', orders from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (84 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 218 units. The effective pipeline consists of Period 11 (61 units), Period 12 (0 units), and Period 13 (148 units), totaling 209 units. Lead times have shown a bimodal distribution of 1 or 3 periods (average 2.3). I will set L to 'explicit' value of 3 to provide a safety buffer against the longer lead time observations and stockouts. Historical demand (including the provided seed data P_1-P_5: 74, 108, 88, 98, 134 and game history P1-P13) shows an average demand of approximately 99 units per period. Using L=3, the mu_hat should cover (1+L)=4 periods. 4 * 100 = 400. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 to capture the full game history mean. Sigma will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to reflect the moderate demand volatility. This configuration ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the actually arriving pipeline and the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains relatively stable, with an average of approximately 100 units per period (last 10 periods average is 100.8). However, the supply chain is highly unreliable. Historical 'conclude' messages show lead times of 1, 2, and 3 periods, with significant losses. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (84 units) have never arrived and are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' of 414 units includes these lost units (134 + 84 = 218 lost), meaning the effective pipeline is only 196 units (Period 13 and 14 orders). With 0 on-hand inventory and recent stockouts (Period 13 and 14), we must ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the variability. I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand to capture the current mean (~101). For lead time, I will use an explicit value of 3 to account for the longest observed delay, ensuring the OR backend targets enough inventory to bridge the gap between arrivals.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 16. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is total 488, but we must account for lost orders. Historical evidence confirms orders from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (84 units) are lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 488 - 134 - 84 = 270 units. These 270 units come from Period 13 (148), Period 14 (48), and Period 15 (74). Analysis of 'conclude' messages shows lead times are highly variable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P11 arrived P14 = 3, P10 arrived P12 = 2, P9 arrived P12 = 3). The promised lead time is 2, but the average of realized lead times [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3] is approximately 2.22. Given the frequency of 3-period arrivals and the risk of stockouts (on-hand is 0), I will set L to 3 to ensure the backend covers a longer horizon. Demand is stable but shows periodic spikes; the average over the last 15 periods is 99.8. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility while smoothing the data, which will result in a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) horizon (4 periods).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 17 shows 83 units on-hand and 347 units in-transit. Based on Carry-over Insights, we must adjust for lost shipments. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (84 units) are definitively lost (last seen in P11/P12 insights). Subtracting these 218 units from the 347 in-transit units leaves a realistic pipeline of 129 units (P14: 48, P15: 74, P16: 7). Demand has been relatively stable, with the most recent 10 samples (P7-P16) averaging ~101 units. Lead times are bimodal at 1 or 3 periods; using the compute-ready average (calculate) or an explicit L=3 provides a buffer for the longer arrival cycle. Given the loss of previous orders, the OR backend needs to recognize that the pipeline is thinner than the raw 'in-transit' number suggests. By setting L to 3 and using the last 10 samples for demand (N=10), we ensure the target base stock covers the 4-period window (L+1) required to prevent stockouts while the system accounts for the 129 units actually coming.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 20 units. Total in-transit is 342 units, consisting of orders from P2 (134), P6 (84), P15 (74), and P17 (50). Per the carry-over insights, the P2 and P6 orders (total 218 units) are confirmed lost. Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 124 units (74+50). Historical demand is stable with an average of approximately 100 units per period (samples show range 52-150). Lead times are unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.3). The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' in its base-stock calculation. Since the backend cannot 'forget' lost orders, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat (and potentially L) to compensate for the 218 phantom units in the backend's pipeline calculation. Base stock Target = (L+1) * mean_demand + z * sigma. With L=3 and mean=100, Target is ~400 + safety. Backend order = min(BaseStock - 342, Cap). To force an order despite the 218 phantom units, I set mu_hat to a value that reflects the desired target plus the phantom inventory (Approx 450 actual target + 218 phantom = 668).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current lead time is highly variable (1 to 3 periods), with a historical mode of 3. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown a significant recent upward shift, with samples from P15 onwards being 103, 65, 118, 133, and P1-P5 samples were 74, 108, 88, 98, 134. Average recent demand (last 4 periods) is ~104.7. The in-transit inventory of 551 units includes two confirmed lost shipments (P2: 134 units, P6: 84 units, total 218 units). This means the 'effective' pipeline is actually 333 units. To ensure the backend places a sufficient order despite these 'ghost' units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate mu_hat as (1 + estimate_L) * forecast_demand + lost_units. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 105) + 218 = 533. This compensates for the 218 units the OR engine thinks are coming but aren't. I've set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 analysis: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory stands at 619 units. Historical data confirms two lost shipments: Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (84 units), totaling 218 units that will never arrive. These must be manually subtracted from the reported in-transit amount of 619, leaving an effective pipeline inventory of 401 units. Lead times have been highly volatile, oscillating between 1, 2, and 3 periods (average is roughly 2.3). Total demand history (including initial samples) shows a stable mean of approximately 98 units per period without clear seasonality or regime shifts. Demand volatility (sigma) is moderate. To compensate for the lost inventory and ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the lead time + review period, I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods using all available samples. Sigma_hat is set using the default (all samples) to capture the overall variance. I'll use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to use the observed average lead time (which is closer to 2.3 than the promised 2).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand inventory 0) following a high demand Period 20 (130 units). The historical demand reflects a mean of approximately 101 units per period (last 20 samples). Lead times are highly volatile, switching between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode frequently at 3. Most importantly, carry-over insights confirm that orders from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (84 units) are lost. The backend OR engine sees a total 'In-transit' of 619 units, which includes these lost orders. Subtracting them yields an effective pipeline of 401 units (P15: 74, P17: 50, P18: 209, P19: 68). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 'phantom' units, I will set mu_hat explicitly high and maintain L at 3 periods to ensure the base stock calculation targets at least (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock, effectively compensating for the pipeline gap.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 22 with 0 units on-hand and an In-transit pile of 619 units. Analysis of recent history confirms a bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods). Critically, we have confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (84 units). Furthermore, recent orders from Period 15 (74 units), Period 17 (50 units), Period 18 (209 units), and Period 19 (68 units) have not yet arrived. The Period 15 order is now at L=7, making it highly likely to be lost. The Period 17 order is at L=5, which is outside the observed L=1 or 3 pattern, also suggesting loss. Excluding confirmed/likely lost units (134+84+74+50=342), the effective pipeline is only 277 units. Demand has averaged 104 units over the last 10 periods. With L=3, we need to cover 4 periods (~416 units). Setting L to 3 to reflect the late-side arrival, and using a recent_N of 10 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current mean, while keeping sigma_hat at default to account for volatility in arrival and demand.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 15 (74 units) and Period 17 (50 units) are likely lost, as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods and remain in-transit at Period 22.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' quantity of 619 units is misleading because several historical orders are confirmed or highly likely to be lost. Specifically: P2 (134), P6 (84), P15 (74), and P17 (50) for a total of 342 'phantom' units. The P18 order (209 units) and P19 order (68 units) are currently at lead times of 5 and 4 respectively, which exceeds the previously observed max of 3, suggesting they may also be delayed or lost. However, to restore service, I will assume a worst-case scenario where the backend pipeline calculation is overstating availability. I'm setting L to 3 (the max observed lead time) to ensure the base stock covers enough periods. Historical mean demand since P1 is approx 101 units per period. I'll use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while attempting to re-trigger ordering despite the high (but largely lost) pipeline inventory reported by the system.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 18 (209 units) and Period 19 (68 units) have exceeded the 3-period lead time and may be lost; monitor for arrival in Period 23.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe inventory stockout with On-hand: 0. The system shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 619 units, but historical evidence suggests a high rate of lost shipments. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (134), Period 6 (84), Period 15 (74), Period 17 (50), Period 18 (209), and Period 19 (68) totaling 619 units have all exceeded the maximum observed actual lead time of 3 periods without arriving. Because the OR backend subtracts the pipeline (In-transit) from the target base stock, if we treat these 619 units as active, the backend will place an order of 0. To force the inventory replenishment needed to meet demand, the L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat parameters must be set exceptionally high via 'explicit' values. I calculate the target base stock using mu_hat(1+L) based on a mean demand of ~102 units and a lead time of 3 (L+1=4, total 408). However, to offset the 619 'phantom' units in transit, I am setting mu_hat to 1100 to ensure the backend generates a replenishment order. Parameters are set to manage this deficit while acknowledging the actual lead time varies between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.5).

Carry-over insight: Emergency replenishment: Entire pipeline of 619 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) confirmed lost after exceeding 4+ periods. Parameters adjusted to override backend's pipeline subtraction.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is being entirely lost. The Carry-over Insights confirm a massive systemic failure where orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 619 units) are considered lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 1018 units includes these 619 lost units plus the 399 units ordered in P24. The OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will subtract the full 1018 units, preventing any new order from being placed despite the stockout. To force an order and bypass the phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that significantly exceeds the current 'In-transit' total. Demand averages ~100 per period; for a lead time of 2+1, 300 units would be normal. To overcome the 1018 pipeline and ensure an order of ~300-400 units, I set mu_hat to 1400. Lead time (L) is set to 3 based on 'calculate' to reflect the actual bimodal reality (1 or 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Massive pipeline inflation confirmed (619 lost units). OR parameters must now explicitly account for a 1018 pipeline deficit to trigger replenishment.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation is critical: the current in-transit inventory of 1442 units is largely illusory. Historical analysis confirms that 619 units (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are permanently lost. Additionally, orders from P24 (399 units) and P25 (424 units) were only recently placed and have not yet reached the maximum lead time of 3 periods. However, due to the 0 on-hand inventory and the backend's logic of subtracting 'pipeline_inventory' from the 'base_stock', no new orders will be generated unless base_stock exceeds 1442. The demand mean is approximately 97 units per period. With a target service level of 95% and a lead time (L) of 2 (for calculation purposes (1+L)=3 periods), the required base stock is approximately 400 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1442-unit pipeline, I must set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom pipeline. Setting mu_hat to 1900 ensures (1900 - 1442) = 458 units are targeted, which covers ~4.5 periods of demand, acting as an emergency replenishment to compensate for lost stock and ongoing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Cumulative lost inventory confirmed at 619 units. In-transit monitoring: Order P24 (399) and P25 (424) are still within lead-time window. Explicit mu_hat of 1900 required to override pipeline logic and restore service.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a massive stockout due to a significant volume of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) totaling 619 units, which remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (currently 1980). This phantom inventory prevents the OR engine from ordering enough to meet actual demand. Period 27 shows 0 on-hand inventory. Orders P24 (399), P25 (424), and P26 (538) are still within the observed 1-3 period lead time window and should begin arriving in P27 or P28. However, to ensure the backend continues to replenish and compensates for the 619 lost units while maintaining a high service level for the current demand (avg ~95/period), I am setting mu_hat explicitly high. mu_hat = (L+1)*AvgDemand + LostUnits = (2+1)*95 + 619 \u2248 904. To be safe and ensure the system clears the 'pipeline deficit' and builds safety stock, I will maintain an explicit mu_hat of 1200. This is lower than the previous extreme override (1900) as P24's arrival is imminent.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Pipeline deficit of 619 units persists. Recent orders P24-P26 (1361 units total) are within window; monitoring for arrival confirmation to adjust replenishment intensity.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 1,980 units in-transit, but 619 of these are confirmed lost (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The valid pipeline consists of P24 (399 units), P25 (424 units), and P26 (538 units), totaling 1,361 units. Period 27's 'conclude' message (read now at the start of P28) shows zero arrivals. Given the observed bimodal lead time (1-3 periods), P24 (ordered in P24) should have arrived in P25, P26, or P27. The fact that P24 still hasn't arrived by the end of P27 is highly concerning, suggesting either a lead-time shift to 4+ periods or that the supply chain is experiencing a systemic failure. The backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see 1,980 units and refuse to order. To force an order or maintain the target stock level, mu_hat must be set to exceed the ghost pipeline. Average demand is ~100. For a lead time of 3, base stock should be roughly 400. To offset the 1,980 ghost units and target a base stock of ~400, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 2400. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base_stock high enough to potentially trigger replenishment despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: Order P24 (399 units) has failed to arrive within the maximum historical lead time of 3 periods (now 4 periods since order), suggesting lead times have extended to 4+ or the loss pattern is continuing.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1602.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, a major arrival from Period 26 (538 units) finally restored the on-hand inventory to 431 units, ending a long stockout. However, the supply chain remains highly unstable. Order P24 (399 units) and P25 (424 units) are now overdue (4 and 3 periods respectively, based on a max historical lead time of 3), suggesting they may be lost or significantly delayed. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1961 is heavily inflated by these likely lost/stalled orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25), totaling approximately 1442 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost inventory and stopping all orders, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to force a base stock that accounts for both real demand and the need to buffer against high loss rates/lead-time variability. Demand remains stable around 100 units/period. Setting mu_hat to 1600 aims to keep a high safety stock given the 95% service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss/delay worsened: Order P24 (399 units) confirmed overdue (4 periods). Total suspected lost/stalled pipeline inventory now includes P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 (~1442 units total). Lead times are effectively unpredictable/lengthening.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1329.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing extreme volatility and systemic loss. Historically, shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are likely lost or significantly delayed (cumulative ~1442 units), as they have all exceeded the maximum historical lead time of 3 periods (P24 is now at 6 periods, P25 at 5). However, a large shipment from P26 (538 units) arrived unexpectedly in P28 (LT=2), providing temporary on-hand stock (343 units). The 'In-transit' figure is currently 1961 units, but 1442 of these are ghost units. Only the order from P28 (519 units) is reliably in-transit. To ensure the backend places an order and compensates for these 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 2200. This calculation represents (Desired Stock Level + Estimated Ghost Pipeline - On hand). With Demand averaging ~100 and a 3-period lead time, a base stock of 400 plus the 1442 ghost units requires a target visibility around 1800-2200. I am using L=3 to reflect the high-end of successful lead times.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss/delay at Period 30: Confirmed arrival of P26 order (538 units) at LT=2, but P24/P25 orders remain missing (LT 5-6), confirming that the pipeline contains ~1442 units of 'ghost' inventory that will not arrive.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a state where on-hand inventory (736) is healthy, following the arrival of orders from P26 and P28. However, the system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1442 units, which historical 'conclude' messages and the carry-over insights confirm are 'ghost' units (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25) that are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. The OR backend subtracts this 1442 units from the target base stock to calculate the order. Since the desired inventory for a 2-period lead time plus 1 review period is roughly 300-400 units (Mean demand ~100/period), the backend will produce an order of 0 as long as (Base Stock - 1442) <= 0. To prevent future stockouts once the current on-hand inventory is depleted, we must continue to override this pipeline inflation. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat set to 1600. This value is calculated to ensure the backend sees a target high enough to potentially place a small replenishment order or at least stay near the threshold, though with 736 on-hand, an order of 0 is currently appropriate for this specific period. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed 2-3 period range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1804.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 609 units on-hand, which is sufficient for approximately 6 periods of demand given a mean of ~100. However, there is a massive 'ghost' pipeline of 1442 units consisting of orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 that are confirmed lost or significantly overdue (LT 5-30+). These units will never arrive but the OR backend subtracts them from its calculations, resulting in negative order quantities. While on-hand inventory is healthy for the immediate 2-3 periods, we must continue using 'explicit' parameters to ignore the 'ghost' pipeline if we need to order. However, since On-hand=609 is already above our target base stock for (L+1) periods (approx 300-400 units), we do not need to order this period. I will set parameters to maintain a neutral stance while the on-hand inventory depletes toward the target.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Ghost pipeline inventory of 1442 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) must be permanently bypassed using 'explicit' mu_hat values when ordering is required. Current on-hand of 609 units provides temporary safety.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a massive 'ghost inventory' problem where 1442 units are recorded as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Current on-hand inventory is 488 units, with no legitimate arrivals expected in the next few periods since no orders were placed in P29-P32. Demand is stable, averaging ~102 units over the last 10 periods. With a lead time of 2-3 periods, the 488 units will cover approximately 4 periods of demand. To maintain the service level while bypassing the backend's deduction of the 1442 ghost units, mu_hat must be set as 'explicit'. I've calculated a target inventory (base stock) of ~450 units (average demand 100 * (L+1=3) + safety stock). To trigger an order despite the pipeline, mu_hat must exceed (Current On-hand + Pipeline). Setting mu_hat to 1930 (1442 ghost + 488 on-hand) would result in a net order of zero. Since on-hand is still sufficient for the next 2-3 periods, I will set mu_hat to 1930 to hold steady and observe if any 'ghost' units unexpectedly arrive before forcing additional replenishment.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean around 100-110 units. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable. As confirmed in previous periods, approximately 1442 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are 'ghost' inventory (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25) that will never arrive. The backend OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock. With 1523 units currently in-transit and 1442 of those being lost, the backend perceives a massive surplus and will not order unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset this 'ghost' pipeline. Current on-hand inventory is 336. Average demand is ~104. Lead time is volatile but recently 2 periods. To ensure we keep ordering to replace what we consume, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Predicted Demand for (L+1) = 3 periods * 104 = 312. Ghost Pipeline = 1442. Target mu_hat = 312 + 1442 = 1754. This overrides the backend's subtraction of the 1442 lost units, effectively resetting the desired inventory position to cover future demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $924.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to exhibit a massive pipeline inflation issue due to 'ghost' inventory. Total in-transit units are 1523, but the majority (1442 units) are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25 that have never arrived despite lead times of up to 33 periods. The effective pipeline inventory consists only of the order from Period 33 (81 units). Current on-hand inventory is 273 units. With demand averaging approximately 100 units per period (sample mean: 101.4), the current 273 units will cover approximately 2.7 periods of demand. Given an inferred lead time of 2-3 periods, we are approaching a stockout risk. To bypass the OR backend's logic, which would subtract the 1523 units from the target base stock and result in zero ordering, I use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock of roughly 1900 units (Calculated as: 1442 lost units + (3 periods lead time + 1 review period) * 110 demand forecast + safety stock), ensure the system triggers an order to replenish the physical inventory before it depletes.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss remains the primary driver of inventory inaccuracy. Cumulative lost 'ghost' inventory is 1442 units. All orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are confirmed losses and must be bypassed in replenishent calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2867.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. There is a confirmed total of 1442 'ghost' units in the pipeline (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) that will never arrive. The backend OR engine incorrectly counts these units as available inventory, preventing replenishment as real stock depletes. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (116 units), and demand remains steady around 100 units/period (Recent 5-period mean \u2248 112). To force the backend to place an order despite the 1671 total in-transit units (1442 lost + 229 recent), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 2100. This calculation target (base_stock roughly 2100) effectively cancels out the 1442 lost units and targets a safety level for expected demand over the lead time (3 periods including the review period). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (range 1-3), while sigma_hat uses recent_N to capture current demand variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1024.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised by systematic losses. Cumulative lost 'ghost' inventory is 1,442 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25), which the OR backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculations, preventing new orders. Current on-hand inventory is 59 units, with demand averaging ~100. Recent arrivals (P26, P28) show a lead time of 2 periods. To force replenishment and account for the 1,442 unit pipeline deficit, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock for L=2 (Review+LT=3 periods) at ~100 demand/period is roughly 300. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 1,442 ghost units and 648 units recently ordered (P33, P35, P36), I will set mu_hat to a value that overrides this: (1442 lost + 648 recent + 300 target) \u2248 2400. This ensures we maintain a flow of stock despite the massive accounting distortion caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss persists: 1442 units in-transit (P2-P25) are confirmed lost and must be bypassed via explicit mu_hat increases. Lead time for successful deliveries has stabilized at 2 periods (Observed P26, P28).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1974.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 111.9 units per period. The supply chain remains severely compromised by 1,442 units of 'ghost' inventory (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25), which the OR backend falsely treats as valid pipeline inventory. Recent successful deliveries (P26, P28, P35, P36) show lead times of 1-2 periods. I currently have 496 units on hand. To ensure the OR backend places an order that accounts for the ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 2100. This value is calculated to cover 3 periods of demand (~336 units) plus the 1,442 lost units, plus a small buffer. This override forces the logic (base_stock - pipeline) to result in a positive order quantity despite the inflated in-transit figure of 1,876 units. I will use 'calculate' for L to acknowledge the recent volatility while staying responsive to the 1-2 period delivery window seen in the last three arrivals.

Carry-over insight: No new patterns detected; systemic shipment loss of 1,442 units remains the dominant factor requiring explicit mu_hat overrides.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 1,442 units (from orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) that has never arrived and is confirmed lost. Current on-hand inventory is 363 units. In Period 37, order P35 (148 units, LT=2) and P36 (419 units, LT=1) successfully arrived, confirming recent lead times are short (1-2 periods). However, the backend still sees a total in-transit of 1,876 units. Subtracting the 1,442 lost units, the actual functional pipeline is only 434 units (P37: 353 units, P38: 0 units, P33: 81 units - though P33 is now overdue and likely lost as well). To force the backend to place an order despite the massive ghost pipeline, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Average demand is ~104 units/period. For a base stock covering L+1=3 periods, we need roughly 312 units plus safety stock (~120 units) = 432 units. To bypass the 1,442 unit ghost pipeline, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1,442 + 432 = 1,874. I will set mu_hat to 1,850 to trigger a replenishment order that maintains service levels as on-hand inventory depletes.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Order P33 (81 units) is now 6 periods old and confirmed lost, increasing total ghost inventory to 1,523 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive systemic failure, with 1,523 units now confirmed as 'ghost' inventory (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and now P33). These units are officially 'In-transit' in the system but will never arrive, causing the OR backend to underestimate the required order size by subtracting this non-existent pipeline inventory. Currently, the system shows 1,876 units in transit, but only 353 units (Order P37) are actually valid and expected to arrive. On-hand inventory has dropped to 219 units. Average demand remains stable at approximately 100-110 units per period. To trigger a replenishment that offsets the 1,523 ghost units and accounts for 3 periods of demand (L+1=3), I must set an explicit mu_hat that covers both. Current requirement: (110 * 3) = 330 units. Adding the 1,523 ghost deficit results in 1,853. Since 353 units are genuinely in transit, the backend's core calculation (base_stock - pipeline) with a mu_hat of ~1,900 will result in a base stock of ~2,200. Subtracting the full system pipeline (1,876) results in an order of approximately 324 units, which is necessary to restore safety stock before the current on-hand inventory is depleted.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean of approximately 102 units per period (last 40 periods). Current on-hand inventory is low (104 units). The primary challenge is the systemic loss of inventory. I have identified 1,523 units of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and now P33) that have exceeded historical lead times and are unlikely to arrive. The total in-transit listed by the system is 1,876 units. Subtracting the ghost inventory (1,876 - 1,523) leaves an effective pipeline of 353 units, which corresponds to the order from Period 37. Given a lead time of 2 periods, the P37 order is expected to arrive during Period 39's resolution (visible in P40 conclude) or P40's resolution (visible in P41 conclude). Since P40 conclude showed no arrival, it should arrive now. To trigger a replenishment that accounts for the 1,523-unit deficit and ensures we meet future demand, I use an explicit mu_hat. Total targeted inventory (base stock) should be (L+1) * mean_demand + ghost_pipeline. With L=2 and mean=102, this is 306 + 1523 = 1829. Setting mu_hat to 1830 will force the OR engine to order sufficiently despite the inflated pipeline.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 1,523 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P33) which are confirmed lost but still counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend. As of Period 42, on-hand inventory has depleted to 40 units, while current demand averages ~106 units per period. The physical pipeline that is actually expected to arrive consists of P36 (arrived P37) and P37 (353 units). Note that P37 (ordered at Period 37) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived; while recent successful shipments (P26, P28, P35, P36) showed lead times of 1-2 periods, P37 may be another loss. Total in-transit is 1876. If we subtract the confirmed ghost units (1523), the 'real' in-transit is 353 (P37). To trigger a replenishment order that covers demand for cycles (L+1=3) despite the 1876 'In-transit' figure, I must set an explicit mu_hat that exceeds (Pipeline + On-hand + Desired Safety Stock). Given On-hand=40 and In-transit=1876, a mu_hat of 2300 is used to bypass the logic and ensure an order is placed to prevent stocked-out states in Period 43.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Suspected loss of Order P37 (353 units) as it is now 5 periods old, following the pattern of previous systemic losses. Total 'ghost' inventory now likely includes P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, and P37, totaling 1,876 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a severe supply chain crisis with substantial 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. As of Period 43, the total in-transit quantity is 2,370 units, but a significant portion is confirmed or suspected lost based on historical lead times (max 3 periods for successful deliveries): P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, and P37 are all overdue and totaling 1,876 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 42. Since the backend's capped policy subtracts the entire (mostly fake) pipeline from the target base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force a replenishment order. The goal is to cover demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) plus clear the deficit. Average demand is ~104 units/period. To trigger an order despite the 2,370 'in-transit' units, the base stock (approx mu_hat + safety) must exceed 'in-transit + on-hand'. I set mu_hat to 2,800 to ensure the backend places an order that accounts for the ghost inventory while providing sufficient stock for the remaining 7 periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost inventory confirmed at 1,876 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37). All subsequent orders must use explicit mu_hat overrides to bypass the pipeline subtraction logic until these units are removed or the game ends.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from significant 'ghost' inventory\u2014orders that are in-transit but confirmed lost. As of Period 44, the cumulative ghost inventory is 1,876 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, and P37). With 0 on-hand inventory and the OR backend's logic subtracting the nominal pipeline (2,910 units) from the base stock, new orders will be suppressed unless mu_hat is set explicitly to a value high enough to overcome this subtraction. Average demand is ~100 units/period. For a lead time of 2, the required inventory to cover the review and lead period (L+1=3) is ~300 units plus safety stock. To trigger an order given the current pipeline deficit, I must set mu_hat to exceed the ghost inventory plus the desired stock. Current in-transit (2,910) minus ghost (1,876) leaves ~1,034 units in 'real' transit (P42=494, P43=540). Since P42 and P43 are still within the lead-time window, they should arrive in P44/P45. To ensure continuity and handle potential future losses, I will use an explicit mu_hat to maintain pressure for arrival confirmation.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from systemic shipment losses. We have identified a cumulative 'ghost inventory' of 1,876 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37) that are in-transit but will never arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (3,209 units) from the target base stock, it will not place a new order unless we artificially inflate the demand parameter (mu_hat) to offset these losses. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced 3 periods of stockouts. To trigger an order that actually reaches the shop floor, mu_hat must exceed (Ghost Inventory + Current Pipeline) relative to demand. Given the ghost inventory of 1,876 and the fact that orders P42, P43, and P44 (totaling 1,333 units) are still within the potential lead-time window, we must set an expansive explicit mu_hat to ensure replenishment. I am setting mu_hat to 3,500 to overcome the 3,209 unit pipeline drag and target approximately 300 units for arrival including safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Ghost inventory of 1,876 units remains confirmed. Systemic losses continue to necessitate explicit mu_hat overrides to bypass the backend's pipeline-based order capping.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current on-hand inventory is 909 units. Demand remains stable, with recent mean around 104 units per period. The systemic shipment loss (ghost inventory) is currently 1,876 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37). These units remain in the 'In-transit' calculation (2554 units total), which prevents the OR backend from ordering unless mu_hat is explicitly set high enough to offset them. Total real pipeline = 2554 - 1876 = 678 units (Orders P44, P45). Net target inventory (Base Stock) should cover L+1 periods of demand (~3 * 104 = 312). Total real position = 909 (on-hand) + 678 (real in-transit) = 1587 units. Since this is well above the target, no new order is needed this period. I will use 'default' or 'recent_N' parameters which will naturally result in a zero order because the inflated in-transit (2554) will exceed the calculated base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $831.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 105 units. However, the supply chain is plagued by systemic shipment losses. I have identified a 'ghost inventory' of 1,876 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, and P37) that are currently in the system's 'in-transit' count but are confirmed/highly likely to be lost. At Period 47, the on-hand inventory is 822 units, which covers nearly 8 periods of demand. The 'in-transit' count is 2,554 units, of which 1,876 are ghost units and 678 are recent valid orders (P44: 299, P45: 379). The backend's base-stock logic subtracts the entire in-transit amount (2,554); to prevent stockouts in the final periods (48-50) after current stock is depleted, I must ensure the internal order calculation doesn't hit the zero-cap due to this inflated pipeline. However, with 822 units on hand and 678 valid units arriving soon (P44/P45), the actual available stock (1,500 units) is more than sufficient for the remaining 4 periods of the game. Therefore, I will use default parameters which will naturally result in an order of 0, avoiding unnecessary holding costs at the end of the game life while maintaining high service levels from existing stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $558.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant 'ghost inventory' (predicted to be 1,876 units) that persists in the pipeline but will not arrive, causing the OR backend to underestimate required orders. Current on-hand inventory is 753 units with demand averaging ~100 units. To maintain service through the end of the game (Period 50), we must ensure sufficiency against the next 2-3 periods of demand. Given the current 753 units and an average demand of 100-110, we are safe for the remaining periods without additional ordering. The in-transit pipeline of 2,554 units includes 1,876 ghost units and recent orders P44 (299) and P45 (379) which are still within the lead-time window. No new order is needed to finish the game with positive inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $887.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 671 units. Historical demand suggests an average of approximately 100-110 units per period. With only 2 periods remaining (Period 49 and 50), the total expected demand is roughly 200 units. Our current on-hand inventory (671) is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand for the rest of the game, including safety stock for volatility. The massive 'in-transit' figure (2554) is primarily composed of 1,876 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory (orders P2 through P37 that never arrived) and recent orders from P44 and P45 (678 units). Since on-hand inventory is already far in excess of total remaining demand, the optimal strategy for the final periods is to place no further orders to avoid additional holding costs. To ensure the backend does not trigger an order despite the high on-hand levels, I will set mu_hat to a minimal value (explicit 1), effectively instructing the OR engine that no additional units are required.

Daily Reward (R_t): $909.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision period. On-hand inventory is 592 units, which is sufficient to cover demand for approximately 5-6 periods based on the recent average demand of ~100. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 1,876 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37) which are confirmed losses. However, because this is the final period (50/50), any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends (since lead time is at least 1-3 periods). Placing an order now would only incur a potential ordering cost (if any) without contributing to sales or reward. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to 0 to ensure no order is placed, effectively bypassing the pipeline logic and maximizing the remaining profit from the existing on-hand inventory.
