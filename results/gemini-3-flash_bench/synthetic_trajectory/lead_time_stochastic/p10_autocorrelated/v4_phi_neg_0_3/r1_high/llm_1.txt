Promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. To avoid stockouts, I need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (Period 1, 2, and 3). Expected demand for 3 periods is ~300 units. Current inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. I will order 300 units to establish the pipeline and meet upcoming demand, assuming the lead time holds at 2 periods (arrival at start of Period 4). Although P1 demand will likely result in a stockout before this order arrives, getting 300 units into the pipeline is the priority to stabilize service levels.",

Averaging these inputs suggests a baseline demand of approximately 100 units per period. 2. **Lead Time & Pipeline**: The promised lead time is 2 periods. An order of 300 units was placed in P1 and is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase (visible in P4's start). An order of 100 was placed in P2 and is expected in P4. Total in-transit is 400. 3. **Inventory Position**: Current on-hand is 0. Since lead time is 2, the order placed now (P3) will arrive in P5. I need enough inventory (on-hand + in-transit + current order) to cover demand for P3, P4, and P5 (L+1 periods). 4. **Requirement calculation**: Expected demand for P3, P4, and P5 is ~300 units. Current in-transit is 400 units, which theoretically covers the next three periods. However, I have already missed sales in P1 and P2 due to 0 starting inventory. 5. **Decision**: With 400 units in the pipeline arriving over the next two periods and an average demand of 100, I am currently over-indexed relative to immediate demand.

If L=3, the 300 units should arrive during Period 4 (visible P5). Since current on-hand is 0 and demand is ~100, I have lost sales for 3 periods.

Actual evidence shows variability: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (3 periods), while Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (1 period). Period 2 order (100 units) is currently missing (ordered P2, should have arrived by P4 or P5). Period 4 order (100 units) should have arrived in Period 6 or 7.

Let's re-verify: P7(120) arrived P8; P8(100) arrived P9. Current In-transit is total 340, which consists of P6(120) and P9(120) and unknown?

On-hand inventory is critically low at 23 units. Current position (on-hand + effective in-transit) = 23 + 300 = 323 units. To cover (L+1) periods (where L=3 is the observed outer bound) of demand (~100/period) plus a safety stock buffer due to lead time volatility, I need to maintain a position of approximately 400-450 units. Ordering 120 units targets a position of 443, mitigating the risk of stockouts if shipments from P11/P12 arrive at the longer end of the 1-3 period lead time range.",

The product is a staple snack, and while there's no specific calendar date provided beyond 'Period 42', we must account for this variability. Lead time is highly volatile (1-3 periods) with a history of significant order loss. The 'In-transit' figure of 1613 includes 1163 units confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17-19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33). The effective pipeline consists of orders from P37 (150 units), P40 (150 units), and P41 (150 units). Checking arrivals: P37 should arrive imminently (currently lead_time=5, which is dangerous, but we assume it might still arrive or is newly lost). P38 and P39 have already arrived. P40 and P41 are in the 'safe' window. With only 7 units on-hand and a likely demand of ~115, we are at risk of a stockout. I will order 150 units to maintain a buffer for 1-2 periods of demand plus safety stock, while accounting for the high probability of further order losses in the pipeline.",

Lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods; the P40 order arrived in P43 (lead time 3). Therefore, we expect the P41 order to arrive in P44 or P45. To protect against stockouts given the volatility of lead times and recent demand, I am targeting an inventory position (on-hand + reliable in-transit) that covers approximately 4 periods of demand (~460 units). Currently, our effective pipeline (P41+P42+P43) is 450 units.
