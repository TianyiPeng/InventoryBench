Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The Promised Lead Time (L) is 2. The item 'chips(Regular)' has a historical demand mean of approximately 86.4 units (samples: 81, 97, 100, 84, 70). Since we have 5 historical samples that are relatively stable, I will use all 5 samples (recent_N=5) to compute the initial forecast. To ensure we cover demand over the (L+1) period window (3 periods), mu_hat should target ~260-270 units. The OR backend with recent_N=5 will handle the multiplication by (1+L) automatically. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to establish a baseline using contemporary history.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 107 units based on initial logic, but as expected with a promised lead time of 2, nothing arrived (arrived=0). Demand in Period 1 was 124 units, which resulted in lost sales since we started with 0 on-hand. Total in-transit is currently 107 units. Using the available historical demand data (81, 97, 100, 84, 70), the mean is 86.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 11.9. Since we have no specific calendar dates or seasonal descriptions provided, I will base the forecast on the historical samples provided in the prompt. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the provided historical variance and mean. L is set to 'default' (2 periods). The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 107 units; in Period 2, we ordered 129 units. According to the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase, which happens after this decision. Thus, the current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have recorded 0 sales for Periods 1 and 2 due to stockouts. The demand history provided shows Period 1: 81, Period 2: 97, Period 3: 100, Period 4: 84, Period 5: 70. However, the game history block shows demand as 124 for Period 1 and 95 for Period 2. I will rely on the game history demand for forecasting. Average demand of (124+95)/2 = 109.5. Given the high stockout risk (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will set mu_hat to cover the lead time + current period (L+1 = 3), using recent_N=2 to capture the latest demand levels. L remains at the promised value of 2 as we have no evidence yet to suggest otherwise (the first order is only due to arrive now).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. Looking at the history, we have placed three orders: P1 (107 units), P2 (129 units), and P3 (144 units). The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period N arrives during the arrival resolution phase of Period N+L. For P1, with L=2, it should arrive during Period 1+2=3. If it arrived, we would observe it in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This strongly suggests that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or there is a delay. Demand has been fluctuating (124, 95, 66) with an average of 95. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and have sold 0 units so far (due to no arrivals), we are in a stockout situation. I will set the lead time estimate to 3 explicitly to account for the observed delay and use the last 3 periods of demand to project mu_hat. This helps the OR backend target a higher base stock to recover from the stockout once shipments arrive.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 6, having just observed the conclusion of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Reviewing the history: the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (actual lead time = 3), and the order from Period 3 arrived in Period 4 (actual lead time = 1). The average observed lead time is currently 2.0 ((3+1)/2). Historical demand over the first 5 periods is 81, 97, 100, 84, and 70 (mean \u2248 86.4, std \u2248 12.3). The demand hasn't shown a significant regime shift yet, though the last two periods are slightly lower. With 158 units on hand and 225 in transit (from Periods 2, 4, and 5), we have a total pipeline of 383 units. This covers roughly 4.4 periods of average demand. The OR backend uses the formula base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Since the service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, z* is approx 1.645. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to use the observed average (2.0) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the initial behavior while being responsive to the slight downward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2242.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the chips(Regular) SKU. Demand has been relatively stable with an average of 86.4 units over 5 periods (samples: 81, 97, 100, 84, 70). Lead time is variable: the P1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the P3 order arrived in 1 period (actual lead times of 3 and 1). The promised lead time is 2. Currently, we have 38 units on-hand and 277 units in-transit (orders from P2, P4, and P5). Total pipeline inventory is 315. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19/$1), the system targets a high service level (~95%). I will use the promised lead time of 2 for L, and use recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full history while awaiting lead-time stabilization. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1=3 periods) is set based on a mean of ~86 units/period, requiring roughly 258 units. Since pipeline (315) exceeds this, the OR engine will likely order the minimum 'cap' amount to maintain flow without overstocking if lead times continue to fluctuate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $722.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand history shows values: 81, 97, 100, 84, 70 (initial samples) and 124, 95, 66, 93, 120, 113 (actual periods), suggesting a mean of approx 95 units per period. Regarding lead times: the order from P1 arrived in P4 (lead_time=3) and the order from P3 arrived in P4 (lead_time=1). This indicates high variability around the promised lead time of 2. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand in Period 6 (113) exceeded starting inventory (38). We have 328 units in-transit (orders from P2, P4, P5, P6). The order from P2 is now overdue (placed P2, promised P4, currently P7 start). I will use L=2 (promised) but use recent_N for demand to capture the current mean more accurately. Given the stockout and lead time variability, setting N=5 for demand and sigma helps stabilize against the recent fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1824.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The stock situation is critical as we have 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced stockouts in the last two periods (P6 and P7). Demand history shows a mean of approximately 108.5 units per period. The lead time is highly volatile: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P4 took 3 periods. The promised lead time is 2. Currently, orders from P2 (129 units), P5 (52 units), P6 (51 units), and P7 (25 units) are in-transit (Total 257). Given the stockout and lead-time variability, I am setting L to 3 (the longer observed actual lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the mean of all 7 completed periods (approx 108.5) multiplied by (1+L=4), which is 434. Sigma_hat is set to default to manage the observed volatility in demand.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is unstable, averaging 2.33 periods with observed values of 1 and 3; stockouts occurred in Period 6 and 7 due to delayed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1463.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. The item 'chips(Regular)' is suffering from zero on-hand inventory due to inconsistent arrivals. Reviewing the 'Period X conclude' messages: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1, P4 in 3, P5 in 3, and P7 in 1. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times alternate between 1 and 3. I will set L to 2.2 (explicit) to account for the risk of 3-period arrivals. Demand is relatively stable but high, with the last 5 periods (P4-P8) showing a mean of 118.6 units. To prevent the recurring stockouts (sold < demand in P6, P7, P8), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples to cover the (L+1) window, which translates to a forecast of roughly 118.6 * (2.2 + 1) units. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the standard deviation of this active high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: alternating 1 and 3 periods (average 2.2 over 5 arrivals); persistent stockouts in Period 6-8 underscore the need for a higher base stock to buffer against L=3 scenarios.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a highly volatile lead time (L) pattern. Analyzing the history of concluded orders: P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), P3 arrived in P4 (L=1), P4 arrived in P7 (L=3), P5 arrived in P8 (L=3), P7 arrived in P8 (L=1), and P8 arrived in P9 (L=1). The lead times alternate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.0 over these 6 concluded shipments. However, the last arrival was L=1, and the promised lead time is 2. The pipeline inventory is high (291), but we must ensure we cover the risk of the next order taking L=3. Demand has been relatively stable with a slight upward trend, averaging 108.7 over the last 9 periods. I will set L to 2 (the promised and calculated average) and increase mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (mean ~120) to ensure we buffer against the L=3 scenario which caused previous stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $893.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 115.8 (last 5 periods: 113, 149, 118, 101, 127). However, the lead time is highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1). The average observed lead time is currently 2.0. In Period 10, we stocked out because the P2 order (129 units) is significantly overdue (promised L=2, now at L=8), suggesting it is likely lost. The P6 order is also overdue (L=4). To compensate for the high stockout risk seen in Periods 6, 7, 8, and 10, I am setting L to 2.2 explicitly to buffer for the 3-period lead-time occurrences. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (all periods from P6 to P10) to capture the current demand level. sigma_hat is set to 25 to provide a wider safety margin given the inventory instability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains unstable with observed values of 1 or 3 periods (average 2.0 across 6 arrivals); orders from Period 2 and Period 6 are likely lost as they are significantly past the max observed lead time of 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory and a history of lost shipments (Period 2 and Period 6). Demand is consistently around 100-130 units. The critical issue is lead time instability, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with a high probability of lost shipments. Currently, orders from Period 9 (111 units) and Period 10 (158 units) are in-transit. Given a lead time of 3, Period 9's order should have concluded by now if it were L=1 or L=2; it is likely either arriving this period (L=3) or lost. Period 10's order is at L=2 and expected to arrive in Period 13 (L=3). To protect against stockouts and the unpredictability of arrivals, I am setting L=3 to ensure the backend calculates base stock for a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I'm using the mean of the last 6 periods (excluding Period 12's unknown demand) which is approximately 115 units, but applying this over (1+L) = 4 periods. Since we have zero inventory and recent demand has been strong, recent_N=5 captures the current regime well.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory has finally recovered with 170 units on-hand after receiving Period 9 and 10 orders. Demand remains stable, with the last 5 samples (P8-P12) averaging 115 units. The lead time is confirmed as highly variable, alternating between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with orders from Period 2 and 6 officially lost. To prevent future stockouts caused by L=3 scenarios (like the one that led to the Period 11 stockout), I am explicitly setting lead time to 3. I will use a mu_hat based on the last 5 periods of demand to capture recent levels. A safety stock buffer is necessary given the volatility in lead times and the risk of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as highly variable (1, 2, or 3 periods) with periodic lost shipments (P2, P6); base stock must proactively account for L=3 to prevent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1670.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with a recent 5-period average (P9-P13) of approximately 109.8 units per period. However, the lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1, 2, and 3 periods, and certain orders (P2, P6) appear to be lost. Period 11 and 12 arrivals confirmed that shipments can take up to 3 periods (P9 arrived in P12) or 2 periods (P10 arrived in P12). To prevent the frequent stockouts observed in earlier periods (P6-P8, P10-P11), I am setting the lead time L to 'explicit' with a value of 3. This forces the base stock calculation to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand, providing a necessary buffer against the maximum observed lead time and delivery uncertainty. I am using a recent_N of 5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current consumption rate and a recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to accurately reflect recent demand volatility. Period 13 concluded with an ending inventory of 78, and we have 338 units in-transit (P12 order of 109 and P13 order of 49, plus potentially older missing units that the OR backend needs to reconcile).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability with a mean of approximately 104 units over the last 14 periods, though there was a slight dip in the most recent period (61 units). The primary challenge remains lead time instability and lost shipments. Historical lead times have been 1, 2, or 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1, P9:3, P10:2). Orders from P2 and P6 are confirmed as lost. To protect against the worst-case observed lead time (L=3), I will set the lead time parameter L to 3. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 to capture the core demand distribution while filtering out the early startup noise, ensuring the safety stock adequately covers the high volatility in arrivals.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) appears relatively stable around a mean of ~100. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable. Observed lead times since the start include: 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, and 3 periods. In particular, the last four arrivals had lead times of 3, 2, 3, and 3 periods, suggesting the actual lead time is more likely 3 than the promised 2. Furthermore, orders from Period 2 and Period 6 (totaling 180 units) are now clearly lost, as they are 14 and 10 periods late respectively. These lost units must be removed from the OR backend's pipeline tracking. To compensate for the lead time variation and the 'ghost' pipeline, I will set an explicit lead time L=3 to ensure the base stock formula (1+L) covers a 4-period window. I will use a recent_N window (N=10) for demand estimation to capture the slightly lower demand seen in the most recent periods (average ~80-90) while maintaining enough history to buffer against the volatility caused by stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 2 (129 units) and Period 6 (51 units) are confirmed lost (exceeded current max lead time of 3 by 7+ periods). Actual lead time has shifted from the promised 2 to a mode of 3 (observed 4 times out of the last 5 arrivals).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the beginning of the game. Comparing the last 5 samples (P12-P16: 99, 92, 61, 78, 72) with earlier periods, the demand has dropped from ~110 to ~80. I will use N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this shift. Regarding lead time, carry-over insights and shipment history confirm that the actual lead time is highly variable (1, 2, or 3 periods) and currently leans towards 3 (observed in the last 3 arrivals from P12, P13, and P15). Specifically, the promised lead time of 2 is unreliable. I will set L to 'explicit' with a value of 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum observed realistic lead time (plus the current period demand), preventing further stockouts. Orders from P2 (129) and P6 (51) are confirmed lost and must be ignored in pipeline calculations, which the OR backend does by essentially using on-hand and current in-transit (417 units). Operating with L=3 provides the necessary buffer for the backend's base-stock logic.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a shift from high volatility (Period 1-11) to a lower, slightly steadier range (Period 12-17 average ~87). Period 17 demand (122) suggests potential upward spikes. Lead time remains highly variable, with recent arrivals showing L=3 (P12, P13, P14 orders) and L=1 (P16 order). As noted in carry-over insights, P2 and P6 orders are lost. The pipeline (265 units) consists of P15 (85 units) and unknown quantities from previous periods. Setting L to 3 periods to safeguard against the most frequent recent lead time. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to focus on the current demand profile (Period 12-17) while respecting the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which encourages maintaining higher stock to avoid the stockouts seen earlier in the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1045.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms that lead times are highly volatile, frequently oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode of 3 in recent arrivals. We are currently experiencing a stockout (Ending Inventory: 0) while waiting for arrivals. The units in transit include orders from Period 15, Period 17, and Period 18. Orders from Period 2 (129 units) and Period 6 (51 units) are confirmed lost and must be excluded from pipeline inventory calculations. Given the recurring stockouts (Periods 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 18), the backend base stock calculated with L=2 and mean demand is insufficient. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the high-impact lead time scenario and using the last 8 samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This choice of N captures the recent demand regime (approx 93 units/period) while avoiding the noise of the earlier, higher demand samples. This configuration ensures the OR backend targets a higher base stock level to buffer against the frequent 3-period lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face 0 on-hand inventory and an empty 'Period 19 conclude' message, meaning no stock arrived to satisfy Period 19's demand (resulting in another stockout). The current 'In-transit' quantity is 461 units, comprising orders from Period 2 (129), Period 6 (51), Period 15 (85), Period 18 (102), and Period 19 (94). Based on history, the orders from Period 2 and Period 6 (180 units total) are definitively lost. The order from Period 15 is now at L=5, which is highly likely lost given the historical maximum observed lead time is 3. I am adjusting the backend logic by setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period arrival mode and to increase the look-ahead window. For demand forecasting, the average demand of the last 10 periods (95.1) is slightly lower than the all-period average (~100). Given the repeated stockouts and lost units, I will use recent_N=10 to capture the current demand level while maintaining a conservative service level through a higher safety stock (L=3 helps with this in the OR backend).

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Order from Period 15 (85 units) is now likely lost (L=5 compared to max observed L=3). Stockouts occurred in Periods 18 and 19 due to arrivals failing to meet demand.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to face severe supply chain instability. Period 20 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout (sold 0 of 100 demand), following similar stockouts in Periods 18 and 19. The 'In-transit' quantity of 468 includes several orders: P15 (85 units - now confirmed lost as it's at L=6), P18 (102), P19 (94), and P20 (7). Historically, actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with significant shipments lost (P2, P6, and now P15). This pattern of loss and variable delay means the OR backend's default assumption of a reliable 2-period lead time is insufficient. I am explicitly setting L=3 to ensure the inventory policy targets enough stock to cover the maximum observed successful lead time, plus the current period's demand (L+1). For demand, I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture the current mean of approximately 95 units per period. This approach prioritizes service level over holding costs, which is appropriate given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0) and the ongoing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Order from Period 15 (85 units) is confirmed lost (L=6 compared to max stable L=3). Supply chain remains highly unreliable with frequent lost shipments (P2, P6, P15) and lead times frequently hitting 3 periods, necessitating a conservative L=3 planning parameter.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the system is in a critical stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical analysis shows that the promised lead time of 2 is unreliable; the actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, with L=3 being the most frequent recently. Several shipments (P2, P6, P15) are confirmed lost, as they are significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3. These lost shipments (totaling 265 units) must be subtracted from the 'in-transit' total of 468 to assess the true pipeline (effective in-transit is ~203 units). The demand has shown a slight downward shift recently (avg of 89.2 over last 5 periods vs 98 overall). To stabilize, I will set L to an explicit 3 to account for the frequent delays, use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level while providing a buffer for the L+1 window, and use a recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to account for demand volatility over a representative window.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) continues to be extremely unreliable. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and no arrivals have occurred since Period 17, despite orders being placed in Periods 18, 19, and 20. Historical data indicates that orders from Periods 2, 6, and 15 are lost. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times frequently hit 3, and recent history suggests significant delays or additional lost shipments (nothing has arrived for 5 periods). To recover from current stockouts and buffer against this unreliability, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the maximum observed stable lead time. For demand (mu_hat), the last 15 periods (since Period 8) reflect a stable mean demand of ~93 units, so I will use recent_N=15. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=15 to capture current volatility. The OR backend's capped policy will help prevent over-ordering despite the high in-transit figure (468), which includes several likely lost orders.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged delivery gap: No units arrived between Period 18 and Period 22 (5 periods). Orders from P18 (L=5+), P19 (L=4+), and P20 (L=3+) are currently overdue against the max stable L=3.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted. On-hand inventory is 0, and no units have arrived since Period 17, with the exception of 7 units in Period 23. Orders from Period 18 (102 units) and Period 19 (94 units) are now at lead times of 5 and 4 respectively, which exceeds the previously observed maximum stable lead time of 3. Based on the pattern of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15), these orders are increasingly likely to be lost or significantly delayed. Despite these gaps, the OR backend's Pipeline Inventory calculation still includes all 461 units in-transit. To force the system to place a recovery order, I must increase the base stock significantly. I will set L to an explicit value of 4 to reflect the current delay and use an explicit mu_hat that represents a very aggressive target (effectively treating the pipeline as partially lost). Demand averages around 100 units; with a desired L+1 coverage and accounting for the massive pipeline blockage, setting mu_hat explicitly to 750 (covering 5 periods of demand at ~150 units/period) while keeping sigma_hat high will aim to trigger an order despite the in-transit units. This is a manual override to combat inventory 'ghosts' in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: No major arrivals since Period 17. Orders from P18 (L=6) and P19 (L=5) are currently non-responsive and likely lost. The system is entering a prolonged stockout phase due to unreliable lead times and frequent lost shipments.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for 'chips(Regular)' is experiencing extreme instability and frequent shipment losses. As of Period 25, on-hand inventory is 0, and we are in a prolonged stockout state. Historical 'conclude' messages show that orders from P2 (129), P6 (51), P15 (85), P18 (102), and P19 (94) are significantly overdue compared to the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods, and are now considered lost. Total 'In-transit' is 722, but after subtracting these losses (461 units), the effective pipeline is only 261 units (the order placed last period). To recover from the stockout and buffer against the unreliable lead time (which fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods), I am setting L to 3. Demand has remained relatively stable (mean ~97), so I will use a recent 20-period average for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this baseline. Setting L=3 and using the backend's base-stock calculation will prompt the system to order enough to cover the anticipated 4-period risk window (L+1), accounting for the missing units without over-ordering excessively if the lost shipments never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed as of Period 25: Orders from Period 18 (102 units) and Period 19 (94 units) are now 6-7 periods old and confirmed lost, following previous losses from P2, P6, and P15. True pipeline inventory is significantly lower than the system-reported 'In-transit' value.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised with significant lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19. Of the current 'In-transit' quantity of 722, approximately 461 units are confirmed lost (P2: 129, P6: 51, P15: 85, P18: 102, P19: 94). This leaves an effective pipeline of only 261 units (ordered in Period 24). On-hand inventory is 0, and demand remains stable around 100 units/period (mean=98.3). The maximum observed lead time for successful deliveries is 3 periods. To recover from this prolonged stockout and account for the high loss rate, I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend aims for a higher base stock level. mu_hat is set to (1+3) * 100 = 400. Because the OR backend subtracts the total (inflated) pipeline of 722 from its target, it will incorrectly assume we are overstocked; however, by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly and forecasting L=3, we trigger the largest possible orders allowed by the cap to rebuild the on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Recovery phase initiated. Confirmed lost units (461) represent 64% of reported 'In-transit' inventory. Effective pipeline is 261 units from P24. Average demand remains 98.3, but consistent stockouts since P18 persist due to arrival gaps.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a severe disruption. At Period 27, we are in a prolonged stockout phase (on-hand = 0). History analysis confirms that a significant portion of the 'In-transit' inventory (722 units) is actually lost: Orders from P2 (129), P6 (51), P15 (85), P18 (102), and P19 (94) are long past the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods, totaling 461 lost units. The actual effective pipeline is the 261 units ordered in Period 24. Average demand is stable (~98 units). To recover from the stockout and account for the high lead time variability (L can be up to 3) and history of lost shipments, I am setting L=3 explicitly. For demand, I'm using the last 20 samples (recent_N=20) to capture the long-term mean of ~98.3, while keeping sigma_hat at default to account for the variance observed across the history. This should trigger a significant order to refill the inventory buffer once the OR engine accounts for the 'effective' pipeline.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from severe reliability issues. Total units reported as 'In-transit' is 722, but historical analysis confirms substantial losses: P2 (129), P6 (51), P15 (85), P18 (102), and P19 (94) for a total of 461 lost units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 261 units (placed in Period 24). Arrival monitoring reveals that the order from P20 arrived in P23 (L=3), but P24 (261 units) has not arrived as of P28 START (current L=4). Demand remains stable with a historical mean around 98.6 over 27 periods. Given the frequent stockouts and lead time instability, I am maintaining L=3 (the max stable lead time) to ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock covering 4 periods of demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to incorporate recent arrival data, but use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=10) to reflect the consistent demand level while ignoring the noisy older data.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Order from Period 24 (261 units) is now overdue (L=4 vs max stable L=3), extending the record of supply chain instability. Total confirmed lost units remain at 461.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of extended distress. On-hand inventory is 0, and the system reports an In-transit balance of 722 units. However, my historical analysis reveals that a significant portion of this pipeline is likely lost: P2 (129), P6 (51), P15 (85), P18 (102), and P19 (94) for a total of 461 lost units. This leaves an 'effective' pipeline of 261 units (ordered in P24), which is now overdue at L=5 relative to P24. Since demand remains stable (mean ~98), the primary challenge is the delivery failure. I will set L to 4 explicitly to reflect the recent extreme delays observed (the last successful arrival was L=3 in P23 for a small order, but the major P24 order is now at L=5). I will use mu_hat for L=4 (5 periods of demand) using a recent window of 5. By setting L to 4 instead of the default 2, I signal to the backend that it needs to cover a longer cycle, which should trigger a restorative order to replace the confirmed pipeline losses (461 units) that are still being counted as 'active' by the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Major order from Period 24 (261 units) is now at L=5, confirming that even the 'recovery' shipment is delayed beyond the previous max stable lead time of 3. Total confirmed lost units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) remain at 461.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be severely disrupted. Period 29 conclude shows 0 units arrived despite 722 units in-transit. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, at least 461 units are confirmed lost (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19). The critical shipment from Period 24 (261 units) is now at a lead time of 6 (Period 30 - Period 24), which is twice the previous 'stable' maximum lead time of 3. This indicates either a massive delay or that the Period 24 order is also lost. Due to persistent stockouts since Period 18 and highly unreliable arrivals, I am setting L to 6 (explicit) to account for the current delay of the P24 shipment. mu_hat is set using recent_N=20 to capture the long-term stable demand of ~98 units, while sigma_hat is set using recent_N=20 to maintain a standard volatility estimate. These parameters aim to trigger a significant reorder to bridge the massive gap between the reported 'in-transit' and the reality of likely lost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Order from Period 24 (261 units) is now at L=6, doubling the previous max stable lead time of 3. This confirms a total breakdown of the promised 2-period lead time. True effective pipeline inventory is likely near zero, as P24 was the only significant replenishment remaining; total lost units are now estimated at 722 (all reported in-transit).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has completely destabilized. As of Period 31, no significant shipments have arrived since Period 17 (except for 7 units in Period 23). Orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, and now 24 (261 units, lead time 6+) are confirmed or highly likely to be lost. The 'In-transit' count of 788 is misleading; accounting for these likely losses, the effective pipeline is near zero. Demand remains steady with a sample mean around 100, but recent periods (P29, P30) show a slight uptick (151, 122). With on-hand inventory at 0 and the backend capping policy potentially restricted by the ghost 'In-transit' units, I must use 'explicit' values to bypass the backend's standard calculations. For L, I set it to 3 (the last stable observed maximum) to ensure the backend projects enough safety stock. For mu_hat, I forecast a mean demand of 105 over a 4-period window (L+1), totaling 420. For sigma_hat, I use a high explicit value (70) to account for the extreme lead-time variance recently witnessed, signaling the OR engine to maximize its base stock within the allowed cap.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: All current 'In-transit' units (788) are mathematically confirmed lost or severely overdue (L > 6), as the last significant arrival was Period 17. Effective pipeline is 0. Systemic supply failure persists.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a total breakdown. All 788 units currently reported as 'In-transit' (from orders in Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, and 30) are either confirmed lost or severely overdue. Specifically, the major recovery order of 261 units from Period 24 is now at L=8, far exceeding the previously observed maximum lead time of 3. Because the OR backend subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit) from its base stock calculation, and the 'In-transit' value is inflated by non-existent units, it will not place any new orders. To force the system to order despite these 'ghost' units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~105 units/period. For a target lead time of 3, the desired pipeline + on-hand should be (3+1) * 105 = 420 units. To bypass the backend's subtraction of 788 units and the cap logic, I am setting mu_hat to an extremely high value (6000). This is a 'manual override' to trigger an order up to the cap, which is the only way to replenish given the systemic reporting error regarding lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total supply chain failure confirmed. All 788 'In-transit' units are considered lost or non-recoverable (P24 order is now L=8). Effective pipeline inventory is 0. Manual parameter inflation is required to force orders past the ghost 'In-transit' inventory.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has effectively collapsed, with no significant arrivals since Period 17 and 2305 units trapped 'In-transit', most of which are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24). The OR backend's inventory-on-position logic (OH + Pipeline) prevents new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a value significantly higher than the current 'In-transit' quantity. This forces the OR engine to recognize a deficit and place a replenishment order. Demand has remained relatively stable (avg ~100), but I am targeting a base stock near 2500 to overcome the 2305 units of 'ghost' inventory. Actual lead time is defaulted to 2 but the systemic failure suggests a much higher or infinite lead time; however, manual inflation of mu_hat is the only lever to trigger an order in this capped sub-policy environment.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Systemic supply failure remains absolute. 'In-transit' count (2305) consists almost entirely of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P32). Effective pipeline is 0. Manual parameter inflation via 'mu_hat' is required to force the OR backend to order past the ghost inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $863.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, a massive arrival of 1517 units (ordered in Period 32) finally broke the stockout streak. This order arrived with a lead time of 1, contradicting the recent history of failed deliveries. The current on-hand inventory is 1398 units, which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the remaining 17 periods (approx. 100 units/period * 17 = 1700). However, the 'In-transit' count of 1146 includes many confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P30) totaling 788 units. The OR backend's inventory balancing logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see the high on-hand + inflated pipeline and stop ordering. Given the extreme supply chain volatility, I will maintain a high service level by assuming a worst-case lead time (L=3). I've set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=20 to capture the current demand regime (~102 units/period) while avoiding over-ordering further since we now have significant on-hand stock to work through.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered in Period 33 with a large arrival (1517 units), but reliability remains low. Ghost pipeline inventory (orders from P2 through P30) totals approximately 788 units which are likely lost. Manual monitoring is required to ensure on-hand stock does not deplete before the next successful delivery, despite the high system-reported 'In-transit' values.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain recovered significantly in Period 33 with the arrival of 1,517 units from the Period 32 order (L=1). Current on-hand inventory is 1,313 units, which is high. However, the system reports 1,146 units 'In-transit', but history confirms that orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, and P30 (totaling approximately 788 units) are lost or indefinitely delayed. The true pipeline inventory consists only of the Period 33 order (358 units). Average demand remains stable around 100 units/period. Given the high on-hand stock relative to demand, the goal is to prevent the OR backend from seeing the 'ghost' inventory as valid supply, though currently, the high on-hand balance minimizes stockout risk for the immediate 10+ periods. I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current mean and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the actual variability observed across the session.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed in Period 33 (L=1); however, 788 units of 'In-transit' stock (from P2 to P30) remain lost. Effective pipeline is significantly lower than system-reported values. Current on-hand inventory (1,313) is sufficient for ~13 periods if no further arrivals occur.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with a massive arrival in Period 33 (1517 units, lead time 1), providing a significant on-hand buffer of 1,226 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1,146 is highly misleading, as it includes 788 units from orders placed between Period 2 and Period 30 that are mathematically confirmed lost or unrecoverable. Only the Period 33 order (358 units) and the current period's activity represent real pipeline inventory. Demand remains stable around a mean of 98.3 units/period over the last 15 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory levels which cover approximately 12 periods of demand, there is no immediate risk of stockout. To prevent the OR backend from prematurely ordering due to the lost units in the pipeline, and to avoid excessive holding costs from further large orders, I am maintaining a strategy of zero additional orders by using the 'default' parameters which will likely result in no order given the high on-hand stock.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following the large arrival of 1517 units in Period 33. Currently, on-hand inventory is 1174 units, which is extremely high (covering ~12 periods of demand at the current average of ~98). The 'In-transit' figure of 1146 units is misleading as it includes approximately 788 units confirmed lost from periods P2 through P30. However, even excluding the lost units, the effective inventory (on-hand + recent orders from P33 onwards) is more than sufficient. I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the stable demand regime after the mid-game volatility, ensuring the OR backend sees a consistent mean and standard deviation. No new orders are needed; the high on-hand balance will naturally prevent new orders until it depletes toward the target base stock level.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a massive breakdown, with a significant stock arrival in Period 33 (1,517 units). Current on-hand inventory is 1,133 units, which provides approximately 11-13 periods of coverage based on recent demand trends. While the 'In-transit' count is 1,146, approximately 788 of those units (from orders P2 through P30) are confirmed lost based on historical lead time analysis. The remaining 'valid' pipeline includes 358 units ordered in Period 33. Demand has dropped recently (52 and 41 units in P36-P37), but the broader mean remains around 90-100. Given the high on-hand stock and the existing valid pipeline, no new orders are necessary. I will maintain a lead time estimate (L) of 3 to reflect the historical 'high-end' of successful deliveries and use the most recent 10 samples for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current lower-demand phase while still planning for a typical volume of ~100/period. Sigma_hat is set to the default to allow the OR backend to manage safety stock based on full history variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $447.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain exhibits extreme instability, characterized by frequent lost shipments and highly variable lead times (1 to 6+ periods). Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, and P30 (totaling 788 units) are confirmed lost or severely overdue beyond the maximum observed functioning lead time. Although a large recovery shipment (1517 units) arrived in P33 (L=1), the 'In-transit' figure of 1146 units is misleadingly inflated by these 'ghost' orders. The actual effective pipeline is zero. Current on-hand inventory is 1054 units. With average demand hovering around 85-95 units (though recently lower at ~57 over the last 3 periods due to noise or a minor dip), on-hand stock covers approximately 11-12 periods. Given the high risk of future supply gaps, I will maintain current stock levels but allow the OR backend to start normalizing. I choose L=3 to account for the frequent 'long' lead time observed when the supply chain is functioning. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=15) to capture the post-chaos demand environment while ignoring the extreme stockout zeros in the mid-game.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain remains unreliable despite P33 recovery; 788 units of reported 'In-transit' stock (P2-P30) are confirmed lost. Effective pipeline is zero. On-hand stock is sufficient for ~11 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a massive delivery in Period 33, but 788 units of reported 'In-transit' inventory (from orders placed between P2 and P30) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The current on-hand inventory is 950 units. Recent demand has slowed slightly, with an average of roughly 75 units over the last 5 periods (P35-P39), compared to the long-term average of ~99. Given the high on-hand stock (covering ~10-12 periods), no new orders are necessary. However, the OR backend sees 1,146 units in-transit, of which 788 are 'ghost' units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering in the future, I must continue to monitor the effective pipeline. For this period, I will use default parameters for mu_hat and sigma_hat as the current stock safely exceeds any immediate demand, and the 'cap' mechanism in the backend will naturally prevent unnecessary ordering.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following the mass replenishment in Period 33, but significant 'ghost' inventory persists. Of the 1,146 units reported as In-transit, approximately 788 units (orders from P2 through P30) are confirmed lost based on historical lead-time analysis. The only potentially valid in-transit order is from P33 (358 units). Current on-hand inventory is 839 units, providing approximately 8-9 periods of coverage at the current mean demand of ~97. Since on-hand inventory is still very high and the effective pipeline (On-hand + P33 order) is roughly 1,197 units, there is no immediate risk of stockout. I will continue to use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure the backend recognizes the systemic nature of the lost orders and doesn't prematurely stop ordering, though with current stock levels, the OR backend will naturally pause ordering. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to reflect the historical conservative maximum for successful deliveries.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain exhibits extreme volatility and significant unreliability. Based on historical data, approximately 788 units recorded in the 'In-transit' inventory (from orders placed between Period 2 and Period 30) are confirmed lost after exceeding lead times of 10+ periods. The current on-hand inventory is 731 units, which at an average demand of ~95 units per period, covers approximately 7.7 periods. Although 'In-transit' shows 1,146 units, the effective pipeline is likely only 358 units (ordered in Period 33), as the rest are ghost inventory. While the current stock is sufficient for the immediate term, the goal is to prevent a recurrence of the total stockout seen between Periods 18-32. I will maintain a lead time estimate of 3 to account for the frequent delays observed, and use a recent_N of 10 for demand to capture recent consumption trends (~82 avg). No new orders are likely to be triggered by the OR backend yet due to the high on-hand and ghost in-transit levels, but the parameters should remain robust.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 95 units over the last 10 periods. The supply chain has stabilized somewhat after a massive failure, with the last successful arrival in Period 33 (ordered in Period 32). However, there is a substantial 'ghost' pipeline inventory of approximately 788 units (orders from P2 through P30) that are confirmed lost. The current system reported In-transit is 1146, which includes these lost units plus more recent orders (P33 onwards). On-hand inventory is 621 units, which covers about 6 periods of demand. Since the effective pipeline is likely only ~358 units (from Period 33), and on-hand is still high, the OR backend logic (min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)) will result in zero orders. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the historical maximum stable lead time and using recent_N=10 for demand to capture the current stable consumption rate. No manual inflation is needed at this stage as current stock is sufficient.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized somewhat after the Period 33 recovery, although many orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P30) represent 788 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory that are confirmed lost. In Period 33, a massive order was placed and arrived in 1 period, suggesting the OR backend now sees a huge supply. Currently, on-hand inventory is 529, which covers approximately 5 periods of demand (avg ~100). Reported In-transit is 1146, but 788 is lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 358 (from P33, which haven't arrived yet). Total effective inventory (On-hand 529 + Effective Pipeline 358) is 887. With ~100 units demand per period and L=2, the required base stock is around 300-400. Since 887 > 400, no new orders are needed. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=10) to capture the current stable demand mean (~101), and 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to use the observed history including the recent L=1 arrival.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following the major replenishment in Period 33, but significant 'ghost' inventory remains. Specifically, 788 units (from orders between Periods 2 and 30) are confirmed lost, as their lead times have extended far beyond the observed maximum of 3 periods. The 'In-transit' count of 1146 minus these 788 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 358 units (ordered in Period 33). On-hand inventory is currently 425 units. Average demand over the last 10 periods (P35-P44) is approximately 88.9 units. Therefore, the total effective inventory (on-hand 425 + effective pipeline 358 = 783) covers approximately 8.8 periods of demand. This is a healthy buffer given the promised lead time of 2. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime and use the default lead time for parameter calc, as current stock levels are sufficient to absorb the historical volatility (mode L=3).

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Effective pipeline inventory reconciliation: Total system In-transit: 1146; Confirmed lost units: 788 (P2-P30); Effective pipeline: 358 units (P33 order). Total effective inventory (On-hand 425 + Pipeline 358) is 783 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46, we are in the final stages of the game (ending at Period 50). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with 788 units of the 1,146 system-reported 'In-transit' inventory confirmed lost (orders from P2 through P30). The only viable pipeline is the 358 units ordered in Period 33, which are now significantly overdue (L=13). Currently, on-hand inventory is 288 units. Recent demand (P41-P45) has averaged 112.2 units, higher than the lifetime average of ~98. With 288 units on-hand and an estimated demand of ~112 per period, we have approximately 2.5 periods of inventory remaining. Given the game ends in 4 periods and the 'In-transit' stock is largely ghost inventory, we must ensure we have enough stock to satisfy demand through Period 50. Setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) reflects the recent demand uptick. Setting L to the max stable lead time of 3 ensures the base stock calculation targets at least 4 periods of demand (L+1), which covers the remainder of the game. This will trigger a small replenishment order to buffer against the high likelihood that currently 'In-transit' units never arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2612.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, on-hand inventory has dropped to 143 units, which is approximately one period of demand (avg ~100). The system-reported In-transit of 1146 units is misleading: 788 units (from P2-P30) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 358 units from the Period 33 order. The total effective inventory (On-hand 143 + Effective Pipeline 358) is 501 units, covering approximately 5 periods. Since the game ends at Period 50, no new orders placed now will arrive in time to impact the final score (promised lead time 2, actual lead time 1-3). The focus is on liquidating existing stock while avoiding stockouts. Since effective inventory (501) exceeds the demand for the remaining 4 periods (~400), no further orders are needed. I will maintain mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=14) to reflect the slightly higher demand seen since P33.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2717.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. As of Period 48, we are at 0 on-hand inventory and have physically stocked out in Period 47. The 'In-transit' figure of 1146 is misleading; history shows 788 units (from orders P2-P30) are confirmed lost. The remaining 358 units were ordered in P33 and are now at L=15, making them almost certainly lost as well. To bypass the OR backend's logic which subtracts these ghost 'In-transit' units from the base stock target, I must use 'explicit' methods to force a replenishment order. The game ends at Period 50. With 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50) and an average demand of approximately 100-110 units (recent trend is higher at 130-150), I estimate a need for ~450-500 units to cover demand and rebuild safety stock, even though arrivals are highly unlikely to arrive before the game ends. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly high to trigger a significant order despite the ghost pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Total systemic failure of 'In-transit' inventory confirmed. The 1146 units reported in-transit (P2-P33) are statistically lost (L > 15). Effective pipeline is 0. Manual order override is necessary to attempt replenishment before game end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49, the penultimate period. The current 'In-transit' quantity is 1,936 units. Based on historical analysis (Carry-over insights), 1,146 of these units (from orders P2-P33) are practically confirmed lost, as their lead times have exceeded 15+ periods. This leaves an effective pipeline of 790 units ordered in Period 48. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The goal for Period 49 is to maximize profit for the final period (Period 50). Since any order placed now (L=2) will arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends), the Period 49 decision only serves to fulfill Period 50 demand via the existing pipeline. The 790 units ordered in Period 48 are expected to arrive in Period 50 (assuming L=2). Since expected demand is ~100-150 units, the 790 units already in transit (from P48) will more than cover the final period's demand. Ordering more would only incur holding costs or be irrelevant. However, to satisfy the OR backend which sees 1146 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat explicitly high (2500) to ensure the P48 order isn't canceled and that enough stock is theoretically targeted, though no new order will likely be placed given the logic. I will use L=2 (promised) as the planning horizon for the final step.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the final period of the game, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' quantity of 2571 units is largely composed of lost orders (approx 1936 units from across various past periods) and recent attempts to force orders (P48: 790, P49: 635). Historical lead times have been highly erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with many orders never arriving. Recent demand (P45-49) has surged from an average of ~100 to ~148. Due to the inventory management logic where base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat and the order = base_stock - pipeline, the OR engine will not place an order if it perceives the 'In-transit' as valid inventory. To overcome the ghost inventory and attempt to fulfill any potential demand in the final resolution phase, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to 'explicit' values high enough to offset the non-existent pipeline stock. However, since this is Period 50, any order placed now will arrive at the earliest in Period 51 (arrival phase of P50 or later depending on L), which is after the final decision phase but during the final period resolution. Maximizing the base stock one last time is the only strategy to trigger a replenishment call.
