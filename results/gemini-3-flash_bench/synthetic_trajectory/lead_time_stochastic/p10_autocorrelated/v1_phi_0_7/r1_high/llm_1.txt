Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 81, 97, 100, 84, and 70 (average ~86.4). The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 3. Therefore, I need to cover demand for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 with the total pipeline. Average demand is around 86 units per period. Total demand to cover (L+1) is approximately 86 * 3 = 258 units. To account for variability and prevent stockouts during the lead time, I will target a slightly higher level (around 300 units) for the initial pipeline.
