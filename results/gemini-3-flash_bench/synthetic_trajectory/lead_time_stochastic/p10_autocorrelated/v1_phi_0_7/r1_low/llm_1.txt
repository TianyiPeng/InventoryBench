The product is 'chips(Regular)', a staple snack item with generally stable demand but potential for slight fluctuations based on calendar events (dates are currently provided as generic 'Period_X' indices). Historical data for the first 5 periods shows demand ranging from 70 to 100 (Avg: 86.4). Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, an order placed now (P1) will arrive during P3. Therefore, I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 to avoid stockouts. Current On-hand and In-transit are 0. Estimated demand for 3 periods (using P1-P5 avg ~86) is approximately 258 units. I will round this to 260 to account for the initial zero-inventory state and the slight upside potential shown in the early history (max demand 100).",

Therefore, current In-transit units (260) are expected to arrive in Period 3. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows an average of approximately 86.4 units (81, 97, 100, 84, 70), but the actual demand in Period 1 was higher at 124 units. To ensure I have enough stock to cover the (L+1) window (Period 2, 3, and 4), I need to calculate total requirements. Assuming an average demand of ~100 units/period to be safe, I need 300 units total for that window. I currently have 0 on-hand and 260 in-transit (arriving in P3). This leaves Period 2 and 4 potentially under-stocked. However, since the P1 order doesn't arrive until P3, I will definitely lose sales in P2. To prepare for P4 and beyond, I will place an additional order now. Total target for P2-P4 is 300; 260 is in pipeline, leaving a gap of 40, plus I need stock for P5.

To satisfy demand for Period 3 (current), Period 4 (L=2 arrival), and Period 5 (L=2 order arrival), I need roughly 3 periods of coverage (approx 300-330 units). Since 400 units are already in the pipeline and expected to arrive in the next two periods, the pipeline is currently sufficient to cover expected demand and safety stock through Period 5.

The in-transit pipeline of 530 units consists of orders from P12 (115 units, L=3 reached), P13 (40 units, L=2 reached), and P14 (160 units, L=1 reached). However, given the established pattern of lost shipments (P2, P6, and previously suspected P11 which finally arrived in P14), the reliability of this pipeline is questionable. To maintain a service level covering (L+1) = 4 periods (to account for the max L=3 lead time) at an average demand of 105, we need ~420 units in total availability. Current effective inventory is 133 (on-hand) + 115 (P12) + 40 (P13) + 160 (P14) = 448 units.

Specifically, the effective pipeline consists of orders from P24 (100), P25 (120), P26 (100), and P27 (120). Since Lead Time is at most 3, P24 (100 units) should arrive in P28 arrival phase. To cover the current period (P28) plus the lead time (up to 3 periods), we need to ensure around 400-450 units are in the system. The effective pipeline (440) currently covers this requirement. However, to hedge against further lost shipments and restore lost inventory from the P27 stockout, a standard replacement order of 100 units (matching mean demand) is prudent to maintain the flow.",
