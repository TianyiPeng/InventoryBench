The product 'chips(Regular)' typically has stable demand, but since the starting inventory is 0 and the promised lead time is 2 periods, I need to cover demand for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 (L+1 periods). Forecasted demand is approximately 85-90 units per period. Target inventory for 3 periods = ~260-270 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are both 0, I will place an initial order to build the pipeline and satisfy immediate needs once arrived. Given high holding costs relative to profit ($1.0 vs $1.0), I will target slightly above the historical average to avoid stockouts while being mindful of potential overstocking.",

Though Period 11 was an outlier (48), the general trend is much lower than the mid-game spike. Current on-hand inventory is 38 units. The in-transit pipeline is 580 units, but 380 of these units come from a Period 6 order that is now 8 periods old; given the promised lead time of 2 and historical maximum of 3, this shipment is highly likely to be lost. The remaining in-transit units are 100 from Period 11 (Expected Period 13/14) and 100 from Period 12 (Expected Period 14/15). Assuming a lead time of 2-3 periods, the Period 11 order (100) should arrive during Period 14 (making it visible in Period 15). To cover demand for Period 14 and Period 15 (Lead time 2, covering L+1 periods) at ~75 units/period, I need a total of 150 units. Currently, I have 38 on-hand + 100 (from P11) + 100 (from P12) = 238 reliable pipeline units. This exceeds the immediate 150-unit requirement. Ordering more now would risk heavy holding costs ($1/unit/period equals 100% of profit) if the shipments arrive concurrently or if the overdue 380-unit order suddenly arrives.

The current regime is estimated at 70 units per period. Lead times have been highly volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods for successful deliveries. The pipeline currently shows 480 units in-transit: 380 units from P6 (now 9 periods old) and 100 units from P12-P14 (none ordered in P12-P14, so this 100 refers to an order likely placed in P11 or before). Looking at the history, the P6 order (380 units) is extremely late compared to the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods; I am treating it as lost to avoid stockouts, while acknowledging that if it does arrive, it will cause a significant holding cost penalty ($1/unit). Current on-hand is 78 units. Given a lead time of roughly 3 periods, I need to cover demand for P15, P16, and P17 (~210 units total). On-hand (78) plus the 'living' in-transit (0 units, as the 480 includes the lost 380 and the P11 order which already arrived in P14) suggests a need for stock. Wait, checking history: P11 ordered 100 which arrived in P14. P12-P14 ordered 0. Thus, In-transit (480) = P6 (380) + P10 (100) - but P10 (100) arrived in P12. Actually, the 'In-transit: 480' likely includes the 380 (P6) and potentially 100 from an earlier period or the system is reflecting the P6 order plus other noise. Since I have 78 on hand and expect ~70 demand this period, I will have ~8 units left. To cover the lead time (L=2) plus the decision period (total 3 periods), I need ~210 units.

The in-transit pipeline (1670 units) is heavily inflated by confirmed lost orders from previous periods (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P31, P33). The only credible orders currently in transit are from P37 (120 units), P38 (arrived), P39 (arrived), and P40 (120 units). To maintain service levels given the 1-2 period lead time and the risk of the P37 order being lost (it is now 4 periods old), I will order 120 units. This maintains the recent strategy of ordering slightly above expected demand each period to hedge against the frequent shipment losses while avoiding excessive holding costs if multiple orders arrive simultaneously.",

Excluding these 'zombie' orders, the active and reliable pipeline consists only of P40 and P41 (120 units each). P40 (ordered P40) should arrive in P41 or P42 (L=1 or 2). Since it didn't arrive in P41, it is expected in P42. P41 is expected in P42 or P43.

In the current Period 49 decision phase, any order placed will only arrive during Period 50 or later. However, since the system resolution for Period 50 (Arrival and Demand) occurs after the final Period 50 decision phase, and rewards are maximized over the total period, placing an order in Period 49 with an expected lead time of 1 period could potentially satisfy demand in Period 50. Reviewing the pipeline: Period 45, 46, 47, and 48 orders (120 units each) are outstanding. P45 (L=4) and P46 (L=3) are at high risk of being lost given the pattern. P47 and P48 are within the standard 1-2 period delivery window. With 0 on-hand inventory and the need to cover potential demand of ~120 units in Period 50, I will place a standard order.
