To maintain a healthy service level, I should aim to cover demand for Period 1 (already occurring), Period 2, and Period 3. Total expected demand for 3 periods is roughly 82.4 * 3 = 247.2 units.

Instead, 'Period 3 conclude' reports 'arrived=0'. This confirms a delivery delay or loss for the P1 order. Assessment: On-hand is 0. In-transit is total 350. Since the P1 order (250) is delayed, I must treat the pipeline with caution. I need to cover demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the decision period (current P4), totaling 3 periods.

  "rationale": "The recent demand regime (P31-P42) is stable, averaging 106 units per period. World knowledge suggests 'chips(Regular)' has consistent demand without major seasonal spikes near Period 43. Inventory management is complicated by high logistics attrition; approximately 50-60% of placed orders are lost. Currently, only orders from P40 (150 units), P41 (150 units), and P42 (150 units) are within the reliable 1-3 period lead time window. As of P43 start, P40 is 3 periods old and overdue for a typical 'fast' arrival, but historically 'batch' arrivals often occur after several silent periods. With 57 units on hand and expected demand of ~110, there is a risk of a stockout if P40 does not arrive in the current period's resolution. To maintain a safety buffer against the high order loss rate and ensure coverage for the (L+1) horizon, I am placing an order of 150 units. This maintains the current pipeline volume while balancing against the risk of overstocking if multiple previous orders arrive simultaneously.",

This leaves a viable pipeline of only 100 units from P41, P42, and P43 totaling 450 units. Specifically, P41 (150 units, 3 periods old) is at high risk of being the next lost shipment. To cover demand for the 1-3 period lead time window and mitigate the 50% loss risk, I must continue placing orders to maintain a flow of arrivals.
