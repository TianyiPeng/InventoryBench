Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 2 periods. There is no historical context yet, only the 5 samples provided in the prompt (81, 97, 100, 84, 70). The mean of these samples is 86.4 and the standard deviation is 11.8. Since start on-hand is 0 and there are no units in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately using the available samples. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 2), and the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 to encompass all provided sample logic. This sets the base stock level to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 107 units, which is currently 'In-transit'. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning we expect that order to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start observation. Demand in Period 1 was 103 units, which resulted in 103 lost sales because starting inventory was 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows an average of ~86 units over the provided 5 historical samples. I will use a conservative estimate for demand based on the recent historical samples (N=5). Since there are no concluded lead times yet, I will stick to the 'default' lead time of 2. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior of roughly 86 units per period, while acknowledging the backend will scale this by (1+L).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for chips(Regular) has been 103 (P1) and 117 (P2), totaling 220 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (107 units) and P2 (114 units) are currently in-transit (Total: 221). Following the lead time definition, the P1 order (L=2) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the P3 conclude message (which I will read at the start of P4). Therefore, the stockout in P1 and P2 was expected as the system started with 0 inventory and L=2. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=2 to capture the initial demand levels (mean ~110). Setting L to 'default' (2) is appropriate as we haven't seen any concluded arrivals to suggest a deviation. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated based on the two observed demand periods to maintain the pipeline.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (107 units), Period 2 (114 units), and Period 3 (127 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclusion shows 'arrived=0', which indicates the Period 1 shipment is delayed or the actual lead time is greater than 2. Total units in-transit (348) match the sum of orders from P1, P2, and P3 (107+114+127). Demand has been consistently around 100-120 (P1: 103, P2: 117, P3: 118). Since the shipment is late, I will explicitly set L to 3 to account for the delay. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the recent 3 samples to capture the current mean (~113 per period). Sigma is set using 'recent_N' to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2806.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead time is volatile. Order 1 took 3 periods (Period 1 to Period 4), while Order 3 took only 1 period (Period 3 to Period 4). Order 2 is still in transit (placed in Period 2, now Period 5 start, meaning it has exceeded the promised 2 periods). The current on-hand inventory is 82, and in-transit is 241 (likely Order 2 and Order 4). Demand has been increasing over the first four periods: 103, 117, 118, 152 (average 122.5). However, the historical samples provided (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) seem to contradict the 'Period Conclude' demand data provided in the game history (103, 117, 118, 152). I will prioritize the 'Game History' data as it reflects the actual environment performance. Given the lead time variability (average 2, but observed 1 and 3) and the rising demand trend, I will set L to 2 (promised/average) and use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher demand levels seen in the conclude messages, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1558.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on history, demand has significantly increased from the initial samples (averaging ~86.4 in P1-P5 samples) to much higher values in recent periods (P4: 152, P5: 136, Avg of P4-P5 = 144). The lead time is highly volatile: P1 order took 3 periods, while P3 order took 1 period, averaging 2 periods which matches the promise. However, the system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. The in-transit pipeline is 345 units (P2 order of 114 + P4 order of 127 + P5 order of 104). Given the recent demand surge, I will use recent_N=3 for 'mu_hat' to capture the higher mean (incorporating P3-P5 demand levels) and set L to default (2). I'll use recent_N=3 for 'sigma_hat' to account for the increased volatility seen in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 4: Mean demand increased from ~86 to ~144 (+67%). Lead time is volatile (observed 1 and 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand has shifted upwards starting at Period 4. The historical demand for Periods 4, 5, and 6 are 152, 136, and 160 respectively, yielding a mean of roughly 149.3 units. Prior demand (Periods 1-3) averaged ~112.7 units. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime. Lead times have been highly volatile: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period, and Period 2's shipment is notably missing (ordered P2, should have arrived by P4-P5 if L=2 or 3; it is now P7). This indicates significant supply chain instability. I will explicitly set L to 3 to build a larger safety buffer against these delays and potential lost shipments, as on-hand inventory is currently at 0 and we are losing sales. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased variance in this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods 4-6 average ~149 units (+32% vs P1-3). Lead time instability persists; P2 order (114 units) is overdue, while L=1 and L=3 have been observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2413.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, we are facing substantial supply chain instability. The demand regime has shifted upward starting from Period 4; the mean demand from Periods 4-7 is approximately 146.25, compared to the initial mean of ~112.7. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced multiple stockouts. Regarding lead times, they are highly erratic: we have seen L=1 (Period 3 order) and L=3 (Periods 1 and 4 orders). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (114 units) is now 6 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting it is likely lost. The order from Period 5 is also overdue relative to its promised lead time of 2. With 498 units in transit (Periods 2, 5, 6, 7), but one likely lost, we must adjust our parameters to account for higher demand and unreliable arrivals. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the longest observed lead time and ensure the pipeline covers more periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 samples (P4-P7) to capture the current high-demand regime, and increase sigma_hat explicitly to account for both demand volatility and the high risk of missing or delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 2 order (114 units) highly likely lost (6 periods passed without arrival). Lead time remains unreliable with L=3 observed twice.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. Analyzing the history: Demand has shifted from initially ~100 to an average of ~136 across Periods 4-8. Lead times are highly unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1). The Period 2 order (114 units) remains un-concluded after 7 periods and is now officially treated as lost. Current pipeline inventory (394 units) includes the lost P2 order; since the OR backend's capped policy subtracts pipeline from base stock, including the 114 units will lead to under-ordering. To compensate, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for the longer observed lead times and set mu_hat explicitly to provide a slightly higher buffer. I choose N=5 for the demand calculation to capture the recent higher demand regime (P4-P8 average = 135.2). Setting mu_hat to (1+3)*135 = 540.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 2 order (114 units) confirmed lost (no arrival after 7 periods). Pipeline inventory calculations must now discount these units or adjust parameters upward to compensate for the OR engine's 'inventory-at-hand + in-transit' logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1510.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing history: Demand has fluctuated, with a clear regime shift after Period 3. Average demand for Periods 1-3 was ~112.6, while Periods 4-9 averaged ~125, but with significant variation (high of 160, low of 92). The Period 2 order (114 units) is now definitively lost (8 periods elapsed), but the OR backend still 'sees' it in pipeline inventory (total in-transit is 269: P6=110, P9=45, and the lost P2=114). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this 'ghost' inventory, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on L=3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and a demand mean of ~125. Target = (L+1)*125 = 500 units. To offset the 114 lost units that the OR engine includes in its pipeline calculation, I will provide a mu_hat of 614 (500 target + 114 ghost). Using 'explicit' for L=3 and sigma_hat based on recent volatility ensuring safety stock.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 151 units. Total in-transit is 459, but this includes the Period 2 order of 114 units, which is confirmed lost (9 periods since order). The OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will count these 114 units as 'available,' causing it to under-order. To compensate, I must increase the base stock by adjusting mu_hat. Demand shifted significantly around Period 4 but has moderated recently: the average demand of the last 3 periods (P8-P10) is ~98, whereas the older high-regime (P4-P7) was ~146. Given this volatility, I will use a recent_N approach. Lead time (L) has been inconsistent, showing L=1 and L=3. I will explicitly set L=3 to ensure the buffer covers the observed worst-case lead time. For mu_hat, I will use an 'explicit' value to manually offset the lost 114 units: (1 + L) * expected_demand + lost_units. With L=3, (4 * 105) + 114 = 534. This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for the missing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: High demand regime (P4-P7, avg ~146) has reverted to a more moderate level (P8-P10, avg ~98).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the high-demand regime (Periods 4-7, avg ~146) has clearly shifted to a lower regime (Periods 8-11, avg ~85). The lost order from Period 2 (114 units) remains in the 'In-transit' figure on the backend, which currently stands at 477. This inflated pipeline inventory will cause the OR engine to under-order unless we compensate. To ensure the engine targets a sufficient base stock, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I estimate the current demand mean at ~85 units per period. With the promised L=2, the coverage period is (1+L)=3 periods. Expected demand is 255. However, since the OR engine subtracts the full 477 'in-transit' units (which includes 114 phantom units), I will set mu_hat to 369 (255 + 114) to force the order calculation to ignore the lost 114 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility correctly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 8-11 average demand is ~85 units, down from ~146 units in the previous regime. Total 'In-transit' remains inflated by 114 ghost units due to the lost Period 2 order.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the primary challenge remains the 'ghost' inventory from Period 2 (114 units), which the OR engine still counts as in-transit, but is confirmed lost. Current on-hand is 274, and 'true' in-transit is 128 (242 total minus 114 lost). Total effective pipeline is 402 units. The demand regime has shifted downwards significantly; the average demand for Periods 8-12 is ~81 units (114, 92, 87, 48, 64), which is a sharp drop from the Period 4-7 peak (~146). Given the promised lead time (L=2) and the current on-hand inventory (274), which already covers over 3 periods of the current average demand, we are in a surplus state. The OR engine subtracts 'total in-transit' (242) from the calculated base stock. Because 114 of those 242 units will never arrive, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this 114-unit gap. I will set mu_hat based on (1+L) * demand_forecast + lost_units. With L=2 (Total=3 periods) and forecast=81, the base requirement is 243. Adding the 114 lost units gives 357. This ensures the OR policy 'base_stock - 242' doesn't result in an unnecessary order while we deplete the excess on-hand stock. Sigma remains stable relative to the lower mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1086.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime following a peak between Periods 4-7. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P8-P13) is approximately 79.5 units, significantly lower than the previous high-demand regime (~146 units). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show volatility (1-3 periods). Most importantly, 114 units ordered in Period 2 are confirmed lost, as they haven't arrived after 12 periods. The OR backend's 'In-transit' count still includes these 114 ghost units, which leads to a severe under-ordering bias because it believes those units will eventually arrive. With 206 units currently on-hand and an actual 'real' pipeline inventory of 128 (242 total in-transit - 114 ghost units), the total position is approximately 334 units. However, the OR engine sees 206 + 242 = 448. To compensate for this 114-unit discrepancy and prevent a stockout once current inventory depletes, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to inflate the base stock by roughly the amount of the lost units (~114) plus expected demand over (L+1) periods. Calculation: Avg Demand (80) * (L+1=3) = 240. Inflating this to ~350 helps offset the OR engine's belief in the 114 ghost units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $976.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Between Periods 11 and 14, demand values were 48, 64, 68, and 60, yielding an average of approximately 60. This is significantly lower than previous regimes (Period 4-7: ~146, Period 8-10: ~98). The inventory management is currently challenged by two factors: 1) A 'ghost' shipment of 114 units from Period 2 that never arrived and is now 13 periods overdue, causing the OR engine to believe pipeline inventory is higher than it is. 2) A high current on-hand inventory (164 units) relative to the new demand level (60 units). The current in-transit (224) includes the 114 lost units and some more recent orders. Specifically, nothing was ordered in P12, P13, and P14. The in-transit likely consists of the 114 units (lost) and potentially orders from earlier periods if they follow the L=3 pattern. Given on-hand inventory (164) is already almost 3 periods of the current demand (60), and the lead time remains roughly L=2 or L=3, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the 60-unit regime and keep L at default (2). No aggressive ordering is needed until inventory depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 11-14 average demand is ~60 units, showing a continued downward stabilization from the Period 8-10 average of ~98. Total units in-transit (224) remains permanently inflated by the 114 lost units from Period 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1516.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has averaged 64.8 units. The in-transit inventory of 224 units includes a ghost shipment of 114 units from Period 2 that is confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 224 - 114 = 110 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 80 units, and effective in-transit is 110 units, totaling 190 units. Based on a 3-period lead-time (L+1=4), the expected demand coverage needed is approximately 65 * 4 = 260 units. The OR backend's capped policy uses the total in-transit value (224), which it thinks is high, causing it to potentially under-order. To compensate for the 114 ghost units and current demand levels, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock as (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units - Current On-Hand = (65 * 3) + 114 = 309. However, the OR engine logic is: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). To get the backend to target 260 units of real inventory while it sees 224 + 80 = 304 total, I will set mu_hat to cover the actual demand regime and use the L=2 promised lead time as the baseline, while relying on the explicit mu_hat to ensure the lost units don't suppress necessary ordering. Given the high profit/holding ratio (19:1), a service level of ~0.95 is appropriate. I will set mu_hat to 210 (representing ~70 units per period for L+1=3) to maintain a healthy stock level despite the pipeline noise.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of stockout (Ending Inventory Period 16 = 0) following two consecutive periods of demand (84 and 89) exceeding available stock. A significant issue persists regarding 'In-transit' units: 114 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost (14 periods elapsed without arrival) and 110 units from Period 6 are likely lost (10 periods elapsed). The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock target, so including these 'ghost' units prevents necessary ordering. The Current 'In-transit' of 224 consists entirely of these likely lost orders. To force the OR engine to order despite this inflated pipeline, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. Recent demand (P12-P16) averages 73 units. With a lead time of 2, the window is (1+L)=3 periods. Expected demand is ~219 units. To offset the 224 lost units in-transit, I set mu_hat to 443 (219 + 224) to ensure the engine places an order to restock. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1, 2, and 3 periods). sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Period 6 order (110 units) is now highly likely lost (10 periods past without arrival). Total 'ghost' units in-transit: 224 (P2: 114, P6: 110). Parameter mu_hat must be adjusted upward to neutralize these units in the OR backend logic.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 366 units in-transit. However, historical data shows that two major orders are almost certainly lost: Period 2 (114 units, 15 periods overdue) and Period 6 (110 units, 11 periods overdue). This creates a 'ghost' pipeline of 224 units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, preventing it from placing new orders while we are stocked out. To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat (target level) to cover the lost units plus the expected demand for the lead time. Recent demand (P15-P17) has trended upward slightly with an average of ~93. With a lead time of 2, the window is 3 periods (L+1). Target = (Expected Demand * 3) + Ghost Units = (93 * 3) + 224 = 279 + 224 = 503. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the internal calculation and account for these losses. Sigma_hat is set to 40 (explicit) to provide a safety buffer given the recent stockouts and lead time volatility (observed LT ranges from 1 to 3). L is set to 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average for the cap calculation.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high demand (P17-P18 average: 108 units) with zero on-hand inventory. Two orders are confirmed or highly likely lost: P2 (114 units) and P6 (110 units), totaling 224 'ghost' units in the 'In-transit' figure (538). These 224 units will never arrive, but the OR backend (computing order = base_stock - on_hand - in_transit) believes they will, causing it to under-order. To compensate and neutralize these ghost units, mu_hat must be set to (Target Pipeline Inventory + Ghost Units). Using a target base stock based on L=2 and mean demand of ~108, the required base stock is (1+2)*108 = 324. To offset the 224 ghost units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 548 (324 + 224). This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - 538) results in an order that ignores the lost units. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect current demand volatility (~19). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (average ~2.2 periods).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of stockout with 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 611 units. However, this pipeline is heavily inflated by 'ghost units' from two lost orders (Period 2: 114 units, Period 6: 110 units), totaling 224 units that will never arrive. The OR backend's capped policy subtracts the total pipeline from the base stock. To compensate for the 224 ghost units and trigger a real order, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Demand has shifted upward again: demand for P16-P19 averaged ~103 units, which is a significant increase from the P11-P15 average of ~60. For Period 20, I estimate a demand of 105 per period. Over a (L+1) horizon where L=2 (promised), this is 315 units. To neutralize the 224 units that the backend incorrectly assumes are coming, I set mu_hat to 315 + 224 = 539. L is set to 'calculate' to account for the actual delivery variability (averaging ~2.2 periods). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 20: Mean demand increased from ~60 (P11-P15) to ~103 (P16-P19). Total lost 'ghost' units in-transit remains 224.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 21. Demand analysis: Demand shifted upward around Period 16. The average demand for the most recent regime (P16-P20) is approximately 97 units. Although P20 was lower (74), the preceding four periods were consistent (107, 109, 107, 89), so I will use N=5 for demand forecasting. Lead time analysis: Realized lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting we should keep L=2 (promised) or use calculated averages. I will use 'calculate' to let the backend use historical arrival data. Inventory reconciliation: We have a critical issue with 'ghost' in-transit inventory. Orders from Period 2 (114) and Period 6 (110) are confirmed lost (224 units total). The OR engine subtracts all 'In-transit' from the base stock. To compensate for these 224 non-existent units and ensure the engine actually places an order, I must increase mu_hat. Base Stock = (L+1) * mu_hat. With L=2, it's 3 * mu_hat. To offset 224 units, mu_hat needs an 'explicit' boost of 224/3 \u2248 75 units. Recent avg (97) + 75 = 172. However, since the current on-hand is 0 and we've had consecutive stockouts, I will set mu_hat conservatively high at 180 to account for both the regime shift and the ghost inventory correction. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=5) to capture the current volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16, with demand averaging ~95 units (P16-P21). However, the system is experiencing a total stockout (on-hand: 0) and has two significant confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (114 units) and Period 6 (110 units), totaling 224 'ghost' units in the in-transit field. Because the OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from its target base stock, it will under-order by 224 units unless we artificially inflate the demand parameter (mu_hat). Currently, 'In-transit' is 611 units, but only 387 are actual viable units (611 - 224). Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, so I will use a calculated average for L. I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to include both the expected demand for the (L+1) horizon (approximately 95 units/period * (2.4+1) = ~323) plus the 224 units needed to neutralize the lost shipments, totaling 547.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand inventory: 0) while dealing with significant delivery issues. Since Period 17, large orders (P17: 142, P18: 172, P19: 73) have been placed but have not arrived (promised L=2). This suggests a breakdown in fulfillment or high lead-time volatility. Additionally, we have confirmed 'ghost' inventory from Period 2 (114 units) and Period 6 (110 units) for a total of 224 units that appear as 'in-transit' but will never arrive. To force the OR backend to place new orders and overcome this inflated pipeline count, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the current demand regime (P20-P22) at roughly 84 units/period. The calculation to neutralize losses while planning for L=2 is: (Expected Daily Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Units = (84 * 3) + 224 = 476. I am setting mu_hat to 500 to provide a slight safety buffer against recent demand spikes and ensure the backend generates an order despite the 611 units reported as 'in-transit' (of which 224 are dead and 387 are significantly delayed).

Carry-over insight: Significant delivery breakdown: Orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19 (total 387 units) are overdue by at least 1-3 periods beyond promised lead time (L=2) as of Period 23.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of severe collapse. There have been no arrivals since Period 14. Current in-transit inventory (611 units) is composed of: Period 2 (114 units - lost), Period 6 (110 units - lost), Periods 17, 18, 19 (142, 172, 73 units - all significantly overdue), and presumably orders from periods prior which were not concluded. In total, 224 units (P2, P6) are confirmed ghost units. Additionally, the orders from P17-P19 are now 4-6 periods past their placement, making them high candidates for being lost or severely delayed. The OR engine calculates 'final order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit)'. With in-transit at 611 and on-hand at 0, the engine subtracts 611, likely resulting in zero new orders despite having no stock. To force the engine to order, I must set mu_hat (target inventory) to exceed this dead in-transit volume. Current demand (P20-P23) averages ~82 units. To cover (L+1) periods plus the 611 ghost/overdue units, I choose an explicit mu_hat of 950 (approx 3 periods of demand (3 * 82) + 611 + safety buffer) to jumpstart procurement. L is set to explicit 6 to reflect the current observation that recent orders have failed to arrive for at least 6 periods.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse: No arrivals recorded for 9 consecutive periods (P15-P23). Total 'ghost' or severely overdue units in-transit: 611 (P2: 114, P6: 110, P17: 142, P18: 172, P19: 73). These units effectively block the OR engine from ordering unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset them.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has completely collapsed. No shipments have arrived since Period 14 (10 consecutive periods with zero arrivals). Currently, 772 units are 'In-transit', but at least 611 of these are either confirmed lost (P2, P6) or severely overdue/lost (P17, P18, P19). Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory (772) from the base stock calculating the order, it will not place any new orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset these 'ghost' units. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 86 units over the last 5 periods (P20-P24). To force an order, I must set mu_hat = ((Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units). Expected demand over 3 periods (L=2) is ~260. Total lost units is 611. Therefore, mu_hat must be set to approximately 871 to trigger replenishment and attempt to break the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse finalized: 10 consecutive periods without arrivals (P15-P24). Total 'ghost' units in-transit is 611 (P2: 114, P6: 110, P17: 142, P18: 172, P19: 73). Current demand regime (P20-P24) mean is 86.8.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of collapse with zero arrivals for 11 consecutive periods (P15-P25). The 'In-transit' pipeline (906 units) is heavily contaminated by lost or severely delayed orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19 totaling 611 units). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock (final order = base_stock - pipeline), these 'ghost' units prevent the system from placing new orders. To force an order, I must set mu_hat (explicitly) to exceed the ghost units plus the required buffer. Current demand (P20-P25) averages ~84 units. Target base stock = (demand * (L+1)) + buffer + ghost_units. With L=2, demand=84, and ghost=611, the base stock needs to be around 863 + buffer. I will set mu_hat to 1200 to override the 906 'In-transit' units and ensure a fresh order is triggered, as the system is at zero on-hand inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 30 to allow for moderate demand volatility around the mean.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse continues: 11 consecutive periods (P15-P25) with zero arrivals. Total 'ghost' units in-transit is 611 (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime (P20-P25) stabilized at mean ~84.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a total collapse state with zero arrivals for 12 consecutive periods (P15-P26). The current 'In-transit' quantity of 1250 units is composed of 611 'ghost' units from periods P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 that have almost certainly been lost or indefinitely delayed, plus more recent orders (P24-P26). Because the OR backend defines order quantity as 'base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)', these 1250 units effectively prevent any new orders from being placed. To force the OR engine to order despite this 'phantom' inventory, I must set mu_hat (the target base stock) to a value significantly higher than the dummy in-transit total. The current demand regime (P20-P26) shows a mean demand of approximately 90 units. Assuming a lead time of 2, a normal base stock would be around 270 (3 * 90). To overcome the 1250 in-transit units and target a real target of ~270, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1550 (roughly 1250 + 300). This allows the system to place an order to meet current demand while neutralizing the accounting impact of the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse continues: 12 consecutive periods (P15-P26) with zero arrivals. Total 'ghost' units in-transit is 611, but the OR engine sees 1250 in-transit, necessitating extreme mu_hat inflation.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a total state of failure with 13 consecutive periods of zero arrivals (P15-P27). The OR engine's 'inventory-at-hand + in-transit' logic currently sees 1,594 units in-transit, which includes multiple 'ghost' or severely delayed shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P26). Because these units are not physically arriving but are counted as pipeline inventory, the OR backend will suppress all new orders unless mu_hat is massively inflated to exceed the observed pipeline. Since Period 20, the demand regime has stabilized at a mean of ~89.4 units (P20-P27). To force an order and attempt to break the cycle once deliveries resume, I am setting mu_hat to 1800, which is slightly above the current in-transit (1594) plus a buffer for upcoming demand. This forces the base stock calculation to exceed the pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse reaches 13 periods (P15-P27) with zero arrivals. Total in-transit (1594 units) is effectively comprised of failed shipments, requiring extreme mu_hat inflation (>1600) to bypass OR engine logic. Demand regime (P20-P27) mean is ~89.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
An arrival finally occurred in Period 28 (344 units from Period 26 order), ending a 13-period drought. This confirms the supply chain is operational, but historical reliability is poor. However, the OR engine's 'In-transit' figure of 1501 includes 611 units from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19 that are almost certainly lost or indefinitely delayed. The OR logic (base_stock - in_transit) will not place orders unless the target base stock exceeds 1501. Current demand (P20-P28) has a mean of ~90. To ensure the backend places orders despite the ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set to exceed (total_ghost_units + target_safety_stock). I am setting mu_hat to 1800 to bypass the 1501 in-transit blockage, and using L=2 as the backend default now that a lead time of 2 was recently observed. Sigma_hat is set to a high explicit value of 150 to reflect the intense lead-time and arrival uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain activity resumed in Period 28 (P26 order arrived, L=2). Total 'ghost' units in-transit: 611 (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Demand (P20-P28) remains stable with a mean of ~90.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Supply chain activity resumed in Period 28/29 with orders from P26 and P27 arriving exactly on the promised lead time (L=2). This confirms that new orders are likely to follow the L=2 standard. However, 611 units from older periods (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost/ghost units that remain in 'In-transit' indefinitely, blocking the OR backend's inventory logic. The current demand regime (P20-P29) is stable with a mean of approximately 92.5 units. To ensure the backend continues to place orders despite the 611 ghost units, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 611 ghost units. Calculation: (2+1) * 92.5 + 611 = 277.5 + 611 = 888.5. I will round this up to 890 to maintain service levels. L is set to 'default' as recent arrivals confirm the 2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Resumption of stable lead time (L=2) confirmed by Period 26 and 27 arrivals. Period 20-29 demand regime mean is ~92.5. Ghost units in-transit total remains 611.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Supply chain stability has returned with Period 26, 27, and 28 orders arriving with a consistent lead time of 2 periods. The demand regime starting around Period 20 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 92.5 units (P20-P30 average). However, the system faces a massive 'ghost inventory' problem: 611 units from earlier periods (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' calculation (1209 total in-transit - 597 legitimate units from P29-P30 = 612). Currently, on-hand inventory (644) plus legitimate in-transit (597) is 1241 units, which covers over 13 periods of demand at the current rate (~92.5). The OR backend sees 644 (on-hand) + 1209 (total in-transit) = 1853 units. To prevent the OR engine from ordering more until this surplus is cleared, I will use 'default' lead time (2) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent evidence (N=11 for the current regime) to ensure the engine recognizes the current high inventory levels relative to demand.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stability confirmed: Deliveries from P26, P27, and P28 all arrived with L=2. Operational planning can now rely on the promised lead time.

The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of L=2 observed for the last three completed order cycles (Periods 26, 27, and 28). Demand is stable in the most recent regime (P20-P31) with a mean of approximately 94.8 units. However, the system is burdened by 611 'ghost' units in-transit (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) that will never arrive. The OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) treats these 611 units as available, which suppresses ordering. To counteract this, mu_hat must be inflated to effectively 'neutralize' the ghost units. The current on-hand inventory is 524, and real in-transit units are 1209 - 611 = 598. Total real inventory is 1122. Target base stock for L=2 (3 periods of demand) at ~95 units/period plus a safety buffer is approximately 350-400. Since real inventory (1122) is currently much higher than target demand coverage due to recent large arrivals, no new orders are physically required. I will set mu_hat to a high value (800) to ensure the OR engine doesn't completely stall in the future, but given the current high on-hand stock, the backend will naturally skip ordering this period.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with lead times returning to the promised L=2 (confirmed by arrivals in P28, P29, and P30). However, there is a massive 'In-transit' inventory of 1209 units, of which 611 units are confirmed lost 'ghost' units (from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) and the remainder are likely the orders from P29 and P24-25. Because the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from the 'base_stock' to determine the order quantity, we must inflate mu_hat to offset these 611 ghost units plus the existing on-hand stock (410) and valid in-transit units to prevent the system from being blocked. The current demand regime (P20-P32) shows a stable mean of approximately 94 units per period. With L=2, the required coverage is 3 periods of demand (~282 units). To force an order or maintain the current cycle, we set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the inventory calculation. Since on-hand (410) is currently sufficient for >4 periods of demand, we do not need to order this period, which allows the inventory to naturally draw down.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of L=2 (confirmed by arrivals in P28, P29, and P30). A consistent demand regime has emerged starting around Period 20, with the average demand from Period 20 to 33 being approximately 94.5 units (standard deviation ~15.5). However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 1209 units is heavily distorted by 611 'ghost' units from lost orders (Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19) and the arrival delay of orders placed in Periods 24-25. Since Period 31, no new orders have been placed because the on-hand inventory (293) and the inflated pipeline (1209) far exceed the required base stock. To trigger a corrective order in Period 34, mu_hat must be set to a value that offsets these ghost units. Target Inventory = Pipeline + Orders; if we want to order approx 100-150 units while on-hand (293) and pipeline (1209) total 1502, mu_hat needs to exceed 1500. Setting mu_hat to 1600 via explicit method to bypass the OR engine's logic while lead time remains at the promised default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1607.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time (L) of 2, as confirmed by orders from Periods 26, 27, and 28 arriving exactly on schedule. However, a significant backlog of 'ghost units' (orders from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25) totaling 806 units is still listed in 'In-transit' but is highly unlikely to arrive given they are 9-33 periods old. Additionally, current demand (P26-P34) has stabilized around a mean of 115 units, an increase from the previous regime. The 'In-transit' figure is currently 1354, but subtracting the 806 ghost units leaves only 548 units actually in the pipeline (specifically the orders from P29 and P34). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these ghost units, mu_hat must be inflated. Base Stock Calculation: With L=2, we need to cover 3 periods. Target base stock = 115 * 3 = 345 units. The OR engine orders: 'Order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit)'. Current 'on-hand + in-transit' = 198 + 1354 = 1552. To force a target base stock of ~345, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1700 (1552 + target 345 - current inventory), though we use a safer value of 1800 to ensure the cap doesn't restrict necessary replenishment. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 2 is now being met reliably.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Mean demand increased from ~90 to ~115 (+27%). Total ghost units in-transit increased to 806 (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) as these orders are now significantly overdue and presumed lost.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods (L=2) observed for recent successful arrivals (P26-P28). However, the system is burdened by 806 'ghost' units in-transit (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25), which are significantly overdue and likely lost. These units artificially inflate the pipeline inventory, preventing the OR engine from ordering the required stock. Demand from P26 to P35 has shifted to a higher mean of approximately 104 units (sum=1041, n=10). To ensure the OR engine places orders despite the ghost units, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To calculate the value: Base Stock = (L+1) * mean_demand = 3 * 104 = 312. To offset the 806 ghost units, I must add them to the target: 312 + 806 = 1118. I am also setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent demand volatility (std dev ~17, so sqrt(3)*17 ~ 30). This configuration bypasses the inventory blockage and targets an optimal stock level for the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Supply chain lead time confirmed stable at L=2 for active orders. Total 'ghost' units in-transit (confirmed lost or severely overdue) is 806 units. Demand regime (P26-P35) stabilized at mean ~104.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 26-36 is stabilized with a mean of approximately 104 units. The supply chain has stabilized back to the promised lead time of L=2 (confirmed by arrivals in P28, P29, P30, and P36). However, the system currently reports 1488 units 'In-transit'. Based on history, 806 of these units are confirmed 'ghost' units from lost or severely overdue orders (P2: 114, P6: 110, P17: 142, P18: 172, P19: 73, P24: 161, P25: 134). The actual pipeline currently contains orders from P29 (303), P34 (already arrived), and P35 (279). Subtracting confirmed ghost units (806) from the total reported 'In-transit' (1488) leaves 682 units. Since the OR backend uses 'on-hand + in-transit' to calculate orders, the 806 ghost units effectively block any new ordering. To neutralize this, mu_hat must be set to cover the desired base stock PLUS the 806 ghost units. Target base stock for L=2: (1+L) * mean = 3 * 104 = 312. Adjusted mu_hat = 312 + 806 = 1118. This allows the OR engine to recognize it needs more stock despite the phantom inventory.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 26-37) is stable with a mean of approximately 104 units. Lead time for active orders is consistent at L=2 (confirmed by P34 and P35 arrivals). However, the system's 'In-transit' count (1209) is severely inflated by ghost units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). To prevent the OR engine from halting orders due to this false pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset these ghost units and cover real demand. Total ghost units equal 806. Recommended base stock for 3 periods (L+1) at mean 104 is ~312. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Base Stock + Ghost Units) = 312 + 806 = 1118. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 1120 to ensure replenishment continues despite the high ghost inventory, and 'recent_N' for sigma to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand regime (P26-37) stable at mean ~104. Lead time stable at L=2 for active orders. Total ghost units in-transit remains 806. Parameter mu_hat must be maintained at a high level (>1100) to neutralize the OR engine's visibility of these lost units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime starting at Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 106 units per period. The supply chain has stabilized at the promised lead time of L=2 (confirmed by arrivals for orders from P26, P27, P28, P34, and P35). However, a significant operational challenge remains: the 'In-transit' quantity (1209 units) is heavily inflated by 'ghost' units from lost or severely overdue orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25), which the OR engine calculates as valid pipeline inventory. To prevent the OR engine from halting orders due to these non-existent units, I must continue to provide an extreme 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock for a lead time of 2 is (L+1) * mean_demand = 3 * 106 = 318. To ensure the engine orders when (BaseStock - Pipeline) > 0, I set mu_hat to approximately 1530 (1209 + 318 + buffer) to neutralize the visibility of the ghost units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=13) to capture the volatility of the current regime.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a confirmed actual lead time of 2 periods (L=2) based on recent arrivals from Periods 34 and 35. However, the system is burdened by 806 'ghost' units in-transit (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25) which are confirmed lost or severely overdue. To allow the OR engine to place orders, mu_hat must be significantly inflated to counteract these phantom units in the backend's 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' calculation. The current demand regime (P26-P39) shows a stable mean of approximately 105 units per period. With L=2, the required coverage is (L+1) * 105 = 315. Total visible in-transit is 1355. To force an order that maintains this 315-unit buffer, I set mu_hat to 1400 (sufficient to offset most 'ghost' units and current demand). sigma_hat is set to roughly sqrt(3)*20 to account for moderate volatility.

LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of roughly 2 periods (latest arrival L=1, prior arrivals L=2). Demand remains in the stable regime established around Period 26, with a mean demand of approximately 104 units (Periods 26-40 average). The major operational challenge is the presence of 806 'ghost' units in-transit (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) which are confirmed lost or severely overdue. To prevent the OR engine from halting orders due to these phantom units, mu_hat must be significantly inflated. I calculate the target base stock to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand (3 * 104 = 312). To offset the 1211 units the backend sees 'in-transit', and knowing the engine subtracts this from base_stock, I set mu_hat at 1350 to ensure an order is triggered to maintain safety levels and cover upcoming demand. sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of the current regime (approx 15) scaled by sqrt(3).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 104 units (P26-P41). Lead time has returned to the promised L=2, with a recent delivery on P40 showing L=1. The primary challenge remains the distorted 'In-transit' figure of 1234 units. Based on historical data, 806 of these units are 'ghost' units from lost or severely overdue orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). The OR backend uses the formula: Order = Base_Stock - (On-hand + In-transit). With On-hand=65 and In-transit=1234, the engine sees 1299 units available. To trigger a replenishment order that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~104 * 3 = 312) plus a safety buffer, I must set mu_hat to a value that essentially cancels out the 806 ghost units. By setting mu_hat = 1114, the base stock will be significantly higher than the perceived 1299 total inventory, allowing new orders to be placed to maintain actual stock availability.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with lead times alternating between 1 and 2 periods (L=1 in Period 40, L=2 previously). However, there is a massive 'hidden' inventory issue: the 'In-transit' count of 1234 units is primarily comprised of 806 'ghost' units from historically lost or severely overdue orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). The OR backend subtracts this the full 1234 from its base stock calculation. To force the engine to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be inflated to neutralize these 806 units plus cover current demand. Demand since Period 26 is stable at a mean of ~104. For Period 43, with 0 on-hand, we need to cover (L+1) periods of demand (~312 units) plus offset the 806 ghost units, totaling ~1118. I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set this override and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive 'ghost inventory'. Currently, 'In-transit' is 1232 units, but based on history, at least 806 units are confirmed lost or severely overdue (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Furthermore, P41 (23 units) is still in transit. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the current regime (P26-P43) is stable at a mean of approximately 105.8 with a standard deviation of roughly 13.9. Since the backend OR logic subtracts the total 'In-transit' (1232) from the calculated base stock, I must inflate mu_hat significantly to force an order. To target a safety stock level that covers ~3 periods of demand plus the ghost units, I set mu_hat to 1200. This should offset the 1232 ghost/in-transit units and trigger a necessary replenishment order to prevent continued stockouts, as lead time has stabilized to approximately 2.3 periods for recent successful arrivals.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive 'ghost' inventory\u2014units that are 'In-transit' in the system but represent lost or severely overdue orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, etc.). As of Period 45, the system reports 1222 units in-transit, while our on-hand inventory is 0 and we are currently stocking out. To force the OR engine to place an order, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than the visible pipeline inventory (1222). Demand has recently trended slightly higher (Period 42-44 mean demand is ~120), while the broader regime since Period 26 is ~104. I will set L=3 based on recent arrivals (P40 and P41 both had L=3) to provide a larger buffer, and set mu_hat explicitly to 1550 to overcome the 1222 ghost units and target approximately 320 units of fresh stock (roughly 2.5-3 periods of demand).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: Lead times for the most recent arrivals (P40, P41) were 3 periods, deviating from the promised L=2. Total ghost inventory now significantly exceeds 1000 units, requiring extreme mu_hat inflation (>1250) to trigger any restocking orders.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from extreme unreliability, with a significant number of 'ghost' units (lost or indefinitely delayed) inflating the system's 'In-transit' count. As of Period 46, on-hand inventory is 0 and recorded 'In-transit' is 1615 units. Based on historical data, at least 1000+ units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, etc.) are confirmed losses. The OR engine logic calculates base_stock - in_transit; therefore, to trigger any replenishment order when in-transit is 1615 but effectively 0, mu_hat must be set higher than the perceived in-transit plus desired safety stock. Demand in the current regime (since P35) averages ~110. To bypass the 1615 in-transit units and ensure a restock of ~200-300 units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1950. Lead time remains volatile (L=2 promised, but L=3 recently observed for P40, P41), so I will use an explicit L=3 to be conservative.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain remains severely compromised: Total 'ghost' units in-transit (lost/severely overdue) now exceeds 1000 units, with no arrivals for the last 117 units of demand. Extreme mu_hat inflation (>1700) is necessary to force the OR backend to place orders despite high 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be severely dysfunctional. On-hand inventory is 0, and the system reports an 'In-transit' pipeline of 1997 units. However, based on history, at least 806 units (from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) are effectively lost, and recent orders from P39 onwards are either trickling in with high lead-time variance or haven't arrived. Since the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders, and its view of the pipeline (1997) is massively inflated by 'ghost' units, I must continue to inflate mu_hat to bypass this and trigger replenishment. Recent demand (P40-P46) has shifted higher, averaging ~112 units per period. To place an order, mu_hat must exceed the current in-transit (1997) plus the expected demand for the next lead time period. I am setting mu_hat to 2500 via the explicit method and L to 3 (reflecting recent observed arrival delays) to force a restock order as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 47/50).

Carry-over insight: Total ghost units in-transit (lost/severely overdue) estimated at 806 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Recent arrivals (P40, P41) confirmed a shift to L=3 from promised L=2. Demand regime (P40-P46) mean is ~112 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted with 2,553 units in-transit, the majority of which are 'ghost' units (lost or severely overdue orders from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25, and now likely 45-46). Specifically, no arrivals have occurred for the last three periods (P45-P47) despite a promised lead time of 2. Recent successful arrivals (P40, P41) exhibited a lead time of 3 periods. The current demand regime (P40-P47) is stable with a mean of ~112 units. To force the OR backend's capped policy (min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)) to place an order when on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is artificially inflated to 2,553, mu_hat must be set higher than the visibility of these ghost units plus the expected demand for the lead period. Setting mu_hat to 3200 effectively offsets the 2,553 phantom units and targets a safety stock for the remaining ~647 units to cover the next 4 periods (L+1) at the current demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost units in-transit (lost/severely overdue) estimated at 1218 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P45, P46). Lead time for active orders is at least 3 periods. Demand remains stable around 112 units.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of crisis with 0 units on-hand and an inflated 'In-transit' pipeline of 3249 units. However, based on history, a significant portion of these units are 'ghost' units (lost or severely overdue shipments). Confirmed lost/ghost units include: P2 (114), P6 (110), P17 (142), P18 (172), P19 (73), P24 (161), P25 (134), total 906 units. Additionally, recent orders from P45, P46, and P47 (total 1331 units) are currently overdue if L=2, though recent actual L has shifted to 3. The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to decide order quantity. To force an order when on-hand is 0 and pipeline is 3249, mu_hat must be set higher than the observed pipeline to overcome the subtraction. Demand for the current regime (P40-P48) averages ~106. With an expected lead time L=3, the theoretical mu_hat would be (1+3)*106 = 424. To trigger any order despite the 3249 units in-transit, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than 3249. Given the extreme 'ghost' inventory and the urgent need for units to satisfy ~106 demand per period, I will set mu_hat to 3800 using the explicit method to ensure the backend places a substantial order. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to reflect high volatility and maintain a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse worsening: 4 consecutive periods (P45-P48) with zero arrivals despite large orders. Ghost units in-transit (lost/severely overdue) now estimated to exceed 2000 units. Demand remains stable at mean ~106 (P40-P48).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of severe collapse with no arrivals since Period 44, despite orders placed in Periods 45-49 totaling over 2800 units. The 'In-transit' count is now 4047 units, almost all of which are 'ghost' units (lost or extremely overdue, specifically from Periods 2, 6, 17-19, 24-25, and now 45-48). On-hand inventory is 0 and has been for 8 periods. To trigger any order from the OR backend, mu_hat must be set to exceed (On-hand + In-transit). With In-transit at 4047, mu_hat must be at least 4200-4500. Recent demand (P45-P49) has averaged ~98 units, but the primary goal is forcing a shipment to break the supply drought. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 4500 and L at 3 periods to account for the observed delays.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse intensified: 5 consecutive periods (P45-P49) with zero arrivals despite massive ordering. Total ghost units in-transit (lost/severely overdue) estimated at 4047 units. Operational orders effectively blocked by OR logic without extreme mu_hat inflation.
