Since lead time L=4, my decision in Period 15 must cover demand for the next 5 periods (Periods 15, 16, 17, 18, 19). Total demand for 5 periods @ 95/unit average is ~475 units. Pipeline inventory (On-hand 69 + In-transit 200) = 269 units. To reach a safety-adjusted target of roughly 475-500 units, I need to order approximately 200-230 units. However, I must be cautious of high holding costs ($1/unit) especially since the profit margin is also $1/unit. Balancing stockout risk against holding costs, I will order 150 units to bolster the pipeline while acknowledging the existing 200 in-transit.",

  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a regime of approximately 273 units per period (P30-P43 average: 261, with recent variance). Currently, on-hand inventory is 104 units. The pipeline consists of orders from P40 (320), P41 (280), P42 (250), and P43 (250), totaling 1100 units in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently verified (P39 order arrived in P43). For the decision in Period 44, we must cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Expected demand for 5 periods (P44-P48) is ~1365 units (273 * 5). Total inventory available to cover this period is 104 (on-hand) + 1100 (in-transit) = 1204 units. To reach the target of 1365 units, an order of 161 (rounded to 160) is required. However, considering we are approaching the game end (P50), and inventory arriving after P46 (orders placed now) will only be available for P51 (after the game ends due to the 4-period lead time and 1-period observation delay), placing large orders now is risky. An order placed in P44 arrives in P48 (visible P49/P50). An order placed in P45 arrives in P49. An order placed in P46 arrives in P50. Orders after P46 won't arrive in time to be sold. I will order 160 to ensure coverage for the final periods while monitoring the pipeline.",

  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. In the most recent window (P30-P44), demand has averaged approximately 268 units/period, with a range between 185 and 327. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we are at Period 45 with only 5 periods left in the game (ending at Period 50), the total demand remaining for the game is demand for P45, P46, P47, P48, P49, and P50 (6 periods). My goal is now to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs. Current on-hand is 177. Total in-transit is 940 (arriving in P45-P48). Breaking down in-transit: P41 order(280) arrives in P45, P42(250) in P46, P43(250) in P47, P44(160) in P48. Total inventory available to cover the rest of the game (on-hand + current in-transit) is 177 + 940 = 1117 units. Estimated total demand for P45-P50 (6 periods * ~268) is 1608 units. Deficit is 1608 - 1117 = 491 units. However, an order placed now (P45) arrives in P49. An order placed in P46 arrives in P50. Orders placed after P46 will not arrive before the game ends. To cover the remaining ~500 units across the final two arrival slots (P49 and P50), I should split the orders. I will order 250 now to arrive in P49.",

The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P46 to P50), I must ensure I do not over-order and get penalized for excess ending inventory (Holding Cost = Profit). My current pipeline (On-hand: 167 + In-transit: 910 = 1077) covers approximately 4.1 periods of demand at the current 260-unit average. Since the game ends at the conclusion of Period 50, orders placed now (Period 46) will arrive in Period 50. Orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, I only need to order enough to cover Period 50's demand and maintain a small safety margin for the final lead time window, while being extremely cautious about holding costs at end-of-life. Total demand remaining (P46-P50) is estimated at 5 periods * 260 units/period = 1300 units. Total inventory currently in the system is 1077 units. To cover the deficit (1300 - 1077 = 223), I'll place an order of 300 units today to ensure we meet demand through P50 without excess stock-out risk, while acknowledging this is the last order that will realistically contribute to sales.",
