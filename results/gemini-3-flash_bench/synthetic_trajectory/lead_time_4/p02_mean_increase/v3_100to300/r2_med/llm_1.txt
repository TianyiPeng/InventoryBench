The promised lead time is 4 periods. My objective is to place an order in Period 1 that arrives in Period 5 (1 + 4) to cover demand for Period 5 and beyond. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no in-transit units, I must account for the lead time delay. However, according to the timeline, an order placed now in P1 arrives during P5's arrival resolution and is available for P5 demand. To cover the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods) and maintain a buffer, I calculate the target inventory. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~500 units. I will order 500 units to establish the pipeline, acknowledging that I will experience lost sales in Periods 1-4 because on-hand starts at 0 and the lead time is long.",

I need to cover demand for the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Expected demand for P16-P20 is ~550 units. Total pipeline is 461. Coverage gap is roughly 90-100 units.

Since the lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 46) will arrive during Period 50's Arrival Resolution (46 + 4 = 50). This is the last possible order that can impact sales. Subsequent orders (Period 47+) would arrive in Period 51 or later, which is outside the game's horizon. \n\nInventory Assessment:\n- Current On-hand: 477 units.\n- In-transit (to arrive in P46, P47, P48, P49, P50):\n  - P46 arrival (ordered P42): 300 units.\n  - P47 arrival (ordered P43): 300 units.\n  - P48 arrival (ordered P44): 200 units.\n  - P49 arrival (ordered P45): 0 units.\n  - P50 arrival (to be ordered now).\nTotal Pipeline (On-hand + existing In-transit): 477 + 300 + 300 + 200 + 0 = 1277 units.\n\nDemand Analysis:\nThe current demand regime has been relatively stable around 264 units/period (per Carry-over Insight P38), with recent fluctuations (P41: 286, P42: 231, P43: 215, P44: 247, P45: 290).

To maximize reward while minimizing terminal holding costs, I will order a small amount (200 units) to ensure a high service level for the final period without over-stocking. This brings total supply for the remaining periods to 1477, providing a safety buffer for Period 50 demand variability.",

Therefore, this order will not contribute to units sold but will also not incur holding costs (as there is no Period 51 inventory snapshot). Current on-hand inventory is 532. We have 700 units in-transit: 300 units from P43 (due P47), 200 units from P44 (due P48), 0 units from P45 (due P49), and 200 units from P46 (due P50). Total expected inventory to fulfill demand for the remaining 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50) is 532 (on-hand) + 700 (in-transit) = 1232 units. The current demand regime is approximately 264 units per period. Total expected demand for the final 4 periods is ~1056 units (264 * 4). With 1232 units available, we are well-covered for the rest of the game and likely facing a surplus that will incur holding costs. Placing an order now is useless for sales but also harmless as it won't arrive in time; however, to follow optimal behavior, I will place a 0 order to avoid any unforeseen costs or inventory clutter, as the pipeline already exceeds total forecasted demand.",

Given the recent demand average of approximately 270-300 units (the last two periods were 313 and 311), the on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover the demand for the final two periods (Period 49 and Period 50). Specifically, if demand in Period 49 is ~310, ending inventory will be ~98. If demand in Period 50 is ~310, we may face a small stockout, but an order placed now cannot prevent that due to the lead time.

Recent demand has stabilized around ~300 units/period (P47: 313, P48: 311, P49: 316). While the on-hand inventory (92) is likely to be lower than Period 50's demand, leading to some lost sales, placing an order now is counter-productive to the total reward as it cannot satisfy any future demand within the game's duration.
