The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows an average of approximately 100 units per period (88, 148, 80, 84, 103). The promised lead time is 4 periods. My ordering strategy must cover the demand for the lead time plus the arrival period (L+1 = 5 periods). The OR recommendation is 147 units. The OR agent uses a capped policy that factors in the mean demand and a safety factor based on the critical fractile (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.8). However, given that current on-hand is zero and the lead time is long (4 periods), a stockout is very likely in the early periods before the first shipment arrives. I will stick with the OR recommendation of 147 units as a conservative opening move, ensuring I don't over-order before observing the actual lead time and demand stability in this specific environment, while acknowledging that I will have a stockout for the first 4 periods regardless of my order size today.",

Based on L=4, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive at the start of Period 6 (visible in Period 5 conclude). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts (demand 99 in P1, 100 in P2) resulting in 0 units sold. The historical demand average is approximately 100 units/period (88, 148, 80, 84, 103 from pre-game; 99, 100 from game periods). To satisfy demand for the (L+1) window (Periods 3 through 7), we need a total inventory position of roughly 600 units (100 units/period * 6 periods). Current inventory position (On-hand 0 + In-transit 289) = 289. The OR recommendation of 138 units is based on its statistical base-stock calculation but stays within a safety cap. Adding 138 brings the position to 427, which is still likely under-stocking for a 5-period lead time window given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (critical fractile 0.8).

The OR recommendation is 0, which suggests that the pipeline (1200) already exceeds the calculated base-stock level. Reviewing recent demand (Periods 16-35), the average is approximately 293 units per period (the 'high demand' regime). A standard (L+1) = 5-period requirement at this demand level is roughly 1,465 units (5 * 293). My current pipeline + inventory is 1200, which covers only about 4 periods. However, the game history shows a pattern where the 'capped' OR logic frequently hits its maximum order capacity (300 units) to maintain flow. Looking at the In-transit status: Period 32 (300), Period 33 (300), Period 34 (300), and Period 35 (300) account for the 1200 units currently in transit. Given that my current inventory is 0 and I have reached the end of the previous order arrivals (the 210 units from P31 arrived last period), I will receive 300 units in Period 36 (from P32). Since demand fluctuates between 250-380, skipping an order now would create a stockout gap in Period 40. To maintain a constant flow of inventory and prevent a stockout in 4 periods, I will place an order of 300 units, overriding the OR's 0 to maintain the current rolling pipeline.",

This means we have enough stock coming to last until Period 49. Adding a small buffer ensures we don't stock out in the final two days if demand spikes.

Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, the Period 42 order is expected to arrive in Period 46 (this period), the Period 43 order in Period 47, the Period 44 order in Period 48, and the Period 45 order in Period 49. Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (Period 46) will arrive in Period 50. The demand regime shift confirmed in Period 18 maintains a mean demand of approximately 285 units. Total pipeline coverage required for Period 50 (the final arrival period) is roughly one period of demand (285 units). Current pipeline units arriving in Period 50 is 0. Total expected demand for Periods 46-50 is ~1425 units. Total available inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 43 + 948 = 991 units. To cover the remaining demand through Period 50, we need approximately 1425 - 991 = 434 units. However, we must be careful not to over-order for the final period and incur holding costs.

This leaves a massive gap. However, since this is Period 50 (the final period of the game), any order placed now will NOT arrive before the game ends (it would arrive in Period 54).
