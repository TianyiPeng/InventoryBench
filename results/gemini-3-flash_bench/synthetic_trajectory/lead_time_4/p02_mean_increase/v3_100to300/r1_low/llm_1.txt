The average demand over these 5 periods is 100.6 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My replenishment target must cover the current period (P1) plus the lead time (P2, P3, P4, P5), meaning I need to cover demand for 5 periods total. Current pipeline: On-hand (0) + In-transit (0) = 0. Target stock level calculation: Average Demand (100) * (Lead Time + 1) = 100 * 5 = 500 units. To balance potential variance (standard deviation of samples is approx 27) and the $1.0 holding cost vs $1.0 profit (which suggests a moderate service level), I will aim to get units into the pipeline immediately to mitigate the initial 0 inventory state and the 4-period wait.",

To cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5 periods), we need enough stock to satisfy demand for Periods 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Estimating demand at ~100 units/period, the total pipeline requirement is approximately 500 units. Since we already have 600 units in transit, we are currently over-covered for the immediate lead time window. However, to maintain a steady flow and avoid a stockout in Period 8 (considering orders placed now arrive in P7 conclude/P8 start), I will place a small maintenance order close to the average demand to keep the pipeline moving, while being mindful that holding costs ($1.0) equal the profit per unit ($1.0), making overstocking very expensive.",

Total demand expected (P4-P8) is ~500 units. Our pipeline already has 700 units. Adding more now would likely lead to excessive holding costs ($1/unit/period) once the bulk P1 order arrives.

To reach a target stock that covers the remaining 8 periods, I would need roughly 2,280 units. Subtracting the current total pipeline (1112) leaves a deficit of 1,168 units to be spread over the remaining effective ordering periods. Placing an order for 300 units fits the established demand regime and maintains a healthy buffer without over-ordering as we approach the end of the simulation.",

We are at period 44 of 50. With a lead time of 4 periods, an order placed now (P44) will arrive in Period 48. Subsequent orders would arrive in P49 and P50. Since the game ends at P50, we only need to cover demand through P50. Current On-hand is 148. In-transit consists of orders from P40 (250), P41 (90), P42 (320), and P43 (300) totaling 960 units. These are scheduled to arrive in P44, P45, P46, and P47 respectively. Total inventory currently available or in the pipeline to cover periods 44 through 50 (7 periods) is 148 + 960 = 1108 units. Expected demand for those 7 periods (approx 300/period) is 2100 units. To satisfy this, we need roughly 1000 more units in the pipeline across the remaining order opportunities (P44, P45, P46). To maintain a safety buffer while avoiding excessive holding costs at the end of the game, I will target a total pipeline of ~2100 units. Since we have 1108, I need to order approximately 992 units over the next few periods. I will place an order for 400 units this period to start closing that gap.",

To maintain safety stock and cover the 5-period window, an order of ~280 is needed. However, since the game ends at Period 50, we must be careful not to over-order and incur high holding costs in the final periods.

Total pipeline to cover the remaining periods (47, 48, 49, 50) is 35 + 300 + 400 + 300 + 110 = 1145 units. Expected demand for the 4 remaining periods at ~290 units/period is 1160 units. The pipeline is nearly perfectly balanced with expected demand, slightly leaning towards a lean inventory to avoid holding costs in the final period. Since any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends, the order quantity is set to 0.

Since we are at Period 48 and the game ends at Period 50, we must consider that any order placed now (P48) will only arrive in Period 52 (P48 + 4), which is after the game concludes. Therefore, ordering more units now would only incur lead-time costs and provide no benefit for sales. My objective is to satisfy demand for the remaining periods (P48, P49, P50) using the inventory already on hand and the pipeline. Current pipeline includes: P44 order (400 units) arriving in P48, P45 order (300 units) arriving in P49, and P46 order (110 units) arriving in P50. Total expected supply: 24 (on-hand) + 400 + 300 + 110 = 834 units. Total expected demand for 3 periods: ~300 * 3 = 900 units.

Similarly, any order placed in Period 50 will arrive in Period 54. Therefore, placing an order now will only incur potential holding costs if the game continues, but it will not arrive in time to satisfy any remaining demand or contribute to profit within the 50-period limit. We currently have 196 units on-hand and 410 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, the 300 units ordered in Period 45 are scheduled to arrive in Period 49, and the 110 units ordered in Period 46 are scheduled to arrive in Period 50.
