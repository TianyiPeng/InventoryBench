Since this is Period 1, I have no incoming shipments. Orders placed now will arrive in Period 5. d) Inventory Assessment: Starting with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. I am currently out of stock and will be for at least 4 periods due to the lead time. e) Order Logic: To cover demand for the lead time (4 periods) plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods), and assuming an average demand of ~100 units/period, I need to secure approximately 500 units. Since I have 0 inventory and 0 in-transit, I will place a robust order to establish a pipeline and account for the initial demand volatility.",

Demand Analysis: Historical data (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) and Period 1's actual demand (126) suggest a mean around 100-110 units per period. Pipeline Assessment: Lead time (L) is 4.

Over the last four periods (P40-P43), demand has averaged 169.5 units, which is lower than the previous ~200-210 baseline, suggesting a cooling-off period or stabilization following a seasonal event. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 272 and in-transit inventory at 1000 units (ordered P40-P43: 300, 300, 200, 200), the pipeline is very healthy. Total game length is 50 periods. For the remaining 7 periods (P44-P50), total expected demand at a 200-unit/period rate is 1400 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 1272 units. To cover the remaining periods through P50 while avoiding excessive holding costs at the end of the game, I will order 150 units to bring the total available supply to 1422, which aligns with the expected total demand for the remainder of the simulation.",

Using a safety-buffered forecast of ~200 units/period, the target inventory position should be approximately 1000-1100 units. Since my current pipeline (1181) already covers this target, and we are approaching the end of the simulation (P50), I will place a smaller order of 100 units to maintain a healthy buffer without significantly increasing holding costs as the game concludes.",

Total expected inventory to cover demand from P46 through P50 is 437 (on-hand) + 650 (in-transit) = 1,087 units. Projected demand for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50) at a conservative 200 units/period is 1,000 units. Since 1,087 units covers this forecast with a small buffer, and the game ends exactly when this order arrives (Period 50), I will place a minimal order to ensure no stockouts in the final period while minimizing potential holding cost overages, as any units ordered now will only be useful for Period 50 demand.",

Even if demand stays at the high-end average of ~200 units per period, the available units (488 on-hand + 200 arriving P47 + 150 arriving P48 + 100 arriving P49 = 938 units) are plenty to cover the remaining 4 periods of demand (P47, P48, P49, P50).

Looking at recent demand, Period 47 was 214 and Period 48 was 208, maintaining a stabilized high-volume regime. Even if demand spikes to historical highs (e.g., 250-300 units) in the final two periods, our 416 units on-hand are highly likely to cover all remaining demand.
