Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no history of arrivals or concludes yet. The promised lead time (L) is 4. The historical demand samples provided are [141, 118, 67, 94, 89], with a mean of 101.8 and a standard deviation of 28.52. Since L=4, the coverage period (L+1) is 5. Using the default methods, the OR backend will calculate mu_hat = (1+L) * mean = 5 * 101.8 = 509, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) * std = sqrt(5) * 28.52 \u2248 63.77. This initial stock-up is necessary to cover the 4-period lead time exposure. Given initial on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0, the backend will order to reach the base stock level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 149 units was placed (promised lead time is 4 periods). As expected, no arrivals occurred in Period 1 (visible at the start of Period 2). The on-hand inventory started at 0, so even though there was a demand of 91 units, 0 units were sold, resulting in lost sales. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 149. The demand samples provided (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) have a mean of 101.8. However, the system's actual demand in Period 1 was 91, which aligns with the sample range. I will use the 'default' L (4) and 'default' statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat to establish a baseline, as we only have one period of actual game observation and the samples provided are consistent with the initial demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time (L) is 4. Orders placed in Period 1 (149 units) and Period 2 (143 units) are currently in-transit and are expected to arrive in Period 5 and Period 6 respectively, based on the lead-time definition (N+L). Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory for Periods 1 and 2, resulting in lost sales for those periods despite demand occurring (91 in P1, 130 in P2). The current in-transit total is 292. Historical demand samples provided are [141, 118, 67, 94, 89], with an average of 101.8. However, actual observed demand in P1 (91) and P2 (130) averages 110.5. Since the promised lead time is 4, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using all 5 historical samples plus the 2 observed periods (Total 7 samples) gives an average of ~104. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most relevant recent volatility while waiting for the pipeline to arrive. L is set to 'default' (4).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In-transit inventory includes orders from Periods 1 (149), 2 (143), and 3 (132), totaling 424 units. No arrivals have occurred yet, which is expected as the lead time is 4. The physical arrival of the Period 1 order (149 units) is expected during Period 5 and will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are missing out on sales because demand (91, 130, 114) is exceeding our zero stock. Demand samples (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) average 101.8. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The OR backend uses (1+L) * mean. To be responsive to recent demand fluctuations and the fact that we have been stocking out, I will use recent_N=5 for demand and default for lead time as no actual lead time has been concluded yet.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (149 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5 (1+4=5). However, based on the execution sequence, this arrival happens AFTER the decision for Period 5 is made. Therefore, we will only see confirmation of this arrival in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 518 units in-transit (149+143+132+94). Demand has been relatively consistent over the first 5 periods (141, 118, 67, 94, 89), with an average of approximately 102 units per period. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Total demand across 5 periods (1 to 5) is 509 units. Our current pipeline (518) roughly covers this, but we must account for the fact that we have sold 0 units so far (stockouts) while demand accumulated. The OR backend will use the base stock policy to determine if more is needed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the initial behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, the first order placed in Period 1 arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. Since L=4, the decision for Period 6 must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Historical demand samples are [141, 118, 67, 94, 89] (from prompt) and [91, 130, 114, 118, 106] (from history conclude messages). These sets differ slightly, so I will focus on the most recent 5 samples from the game history (avg ~111.8) to establish the current demand regime. With On-hand = 43 and In-transit = 393, the current pipeline is 436. Targeting a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand at ~112 units/period equals ~560. The OR backend will calculate the order based on (mu_hat - pipeline). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand volatility and mean, and use 'default' for L as the 4-period lead time is now confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-94.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The inventory on-hand is 140 units. Since Period 5, we have seen confirmed arrivals for Period 1 and Period 2 orders, both with a lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand history (Periods 1-6) shows values: 91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46. The mean demand is approximately 101 units per period, though Period 6 saw a significant dip (46). Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the observed lead times are consistent with the promise. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full available history while acknowledging the recent volatility. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect the variance observed in the initial periods and the recent dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-100.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Orders from P1, P2, and P3 arrived at P5, P6, and P7 respectively). Demand samples for Periods 1-7 are: 91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46, 86. The average demand is approximately 98.7. The recent dip in Period 6 (46) and slight recovery in Period 7 (86) suggest some volatility, so I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current trend (avg ~94). With a lead time L=4, the pipeline should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current on-hand (186) + in-transit (241) = 427 units. Expected demand over the next 5 periods is roughly 470 units. The parameters are set to maintain a stable base stock that accounts for the holding cost equaling the profit ($1.0 each), which target a 50% service level via the OR backend, though the backend's capped policy will ensure we don't over-order given the high holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-74.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of the history shows that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8), which matches the promised lead time. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the first 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 99.25 units per period. The recent demand (last 4 periods: 106, 46, 86, 103) is slightly lower at 85.25, but given the volatility (standard deviation), using a longer window provides a more stable estimate. I will use N=8 (the full history) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the baseline demand profile. With a lead time of 4, the OR engine needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current on-hand (177) plus in-transit (190) equals 367 units. Based on an average demand of ~100/period, 5 periods requirement is ~500. This suggests the system will place a replenishment order to reach that target, adjusted by the holding cost vs profit ratio (which is 1:1, implying a 50% service level target).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 10. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met for all five orders that have arrived so far (Orders from P1 through P5 all arrived with lead_time=4). There are currently 296 units in transit (ordered in P6, P8, and P9). Historical demand from P1 to P9 shows a mean of approximately 99.1 units per period (91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46, 86, 103, 98), with a standard deviation of roughly 24. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The backend OR engine calculates base stock using the critical fractile q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which leads to a z-score of 0. This means the engine aims to set base stock equal to the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (mu_hat). Given the consistent demand and stable lead time, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture all available demand history and rely on the promised lead time (default).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Reviewing the history from Period 1 to 10, the actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (matches promised). Specifically, orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6 have all arrived exactly 4 periods later (P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, and P10 respectively). Demand for chips(Regular) appears relatively stable, with an average of approximately 103 units per period (samples: 91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46, 86, 103, 98, 137). The low demand in Period 6 (46) seems like an outlier. The current on-hand inventory is 89, and in-transit inventory is 270 (orders from P7=0, P8=43, P9=130, P10=97). I will use L=4. Given the stable demand, I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the full recent history and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 to cover the observed volatility. This helps the OR backend maintain a base stock level that accounts for 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Let's analyze the status for 'chips(Regular)'. Promised lead time is 4. Looking at 'Period X conclude' messages: P5 (P1 order arrived, LT=4), P6 (P2 order arrived, LT=4), P7 (P3 order arrived, LT=4), P8 (P4 order arrived, LT=4), P9 (P5 order arrived, LT=4), P10 (P6 order arrived, LT=4). In Period 11, arrived=0, which is correct because the order from P7 (LT=4) was 0 units. We expect the P8 order (43 units) to arrive during P12 and be visible in P13. Currently, on-hand is very low (3 units) with substantial in-transit (416). Historically, demand for the 11 observed periods (P1-P11) averages 100.45 units (91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46, 86, 103, 98, 137, 86). Sample demand provided (P1-P5) does not perfectly match history, but history is more recent. Demand is stable around 100. Setting L=4 (promised/actual match), mu_hat using the last 7 periods (P5-P11) to capture recent mean (~94.5), and sigma_hat using the same period for variance.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we ran out of inventory (sold 46 units from 46 on-hand, missed 41 units of demand). The shipment ordered in Period 7 (requested 0 units) resulted in no arrival at Period 11, creating a stockout gap because lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current demand is stable: the mean of the last 12 periods is approximately 104, while the provided initial samples (P1-P5) averaged 101.8. I will use recent_N for both demand mean (mu) and variance (sigma) with N=12 to focus on the active game history. Lead time L is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P12), and I'll use the calculate method which will average these consistent observations. The high holding cost relative to profit (1:1 ratio) suggests a target service level of 50%, but since the OR backend uses a capped policy that limits over-ordering, providing accurate distribution parameters is the priority.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the system is in a stable state regarding lead time, which is confirmed at 4 periods (P9 order arrived in P13, lead_time=4). There are no missing shipments currently; orders from P10, P11, and P12 are expected in P14, P15, and P16 respectively. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains relatively stable with samples: 91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46, 86, 103, 98, 137, 86, 87, 118. The mean demand is approximately 101.5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full recent history after the initial setup phase. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (base stock = mu_hat). Given the lead time is 4, (1+L) equals 5 periods of demand coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P12, P13, P14) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. However, the order from Period 7 (0 units) meant no delivery was expected in Period 11, and the order from Period 11 (146 units) is only due in Period 15. This inventory gap caused recent stockouts in Period 12 and Period 14. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has remained relatively stable (mean ~102 over 14 periods), but we face a critical replenishment period. The in-transit total is 399 units, consisting of orders from P11 (146), P12 (54), P13 (74), and P14 (125). The P11 order (146 units) should arrive during Period 15. To ensure we cover the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods), I will use the recent mean demand from all available samples (Period 1-14) to set mu_hat. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level which is appropriate for a stable SKU with high holding costs relative to profit.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods and the game history confirms that all arrivals (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P8, P9, P10, P11) have consistently arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods. The order from Period 7 (0 units) is accounted for in the sequence. Period 12's lack of arrival of P7 is expected (0 units). Demand appears relatively stable around a mean of ~102 units. The last 10 periods (P6-P15) show a mean of 95.3 and a standard deviation of 25.1. With L=4, the base stock system needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current inventory position: On-hand (69) + In-transit (365) = 434 units. Expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 500 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most representative demand profile since the start of the delivery cycle, which provides a stable mean and variance for the OR engine's safety stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, on-hand inventory is 0 after a significant demand spike of 273 in Period 16 (compared to the previous average of ~100). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P13-P16). However, the order from Period 7 (0 units) means there is a gap in the supply pipeline. More critically, the demand spike in Period 16 has significantly exhausted available stock. While the spike might be an outlier, the OR backend needs to account for the increased volatility (sigma) and ensure that (L+1) periods of demand are covered. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent mean (impacted by the spike) and for sigma_hat to account for the dramatically increased volatility. This will increase the base stock level to protect against further stockouts during the lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected at Period 16: demand surged to 273 (previous 15-period avg ~100).

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18. A massive demand shift occurred at Period 16 (273 units) and continued into Period 17 (170 units). This follows a stable period of demand averaging approximately 100 units. The stock-out in the last two periods (ending inventory 0) combined with 543 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed to catch up) necessitates a focused forecasting approach. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp, sustained increase in demand (regime shift), I am using 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat to capture the new demand level (mean of 273 and 170) while anticipating the backend's (1+L) logic. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' for N=3 to reflect the higher volatility seen in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-17 avg demand jumped to 221.5 units from a prior 15-period avg of ~100 units (+120%).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in P19. Looking at history, a significant demand regime shift occurred at P16. The average demand from P1-P15 was ~101 units. Demand in P16-P18 has been 273, 170, and 232, averaging ~225 units. This is a 122% increase. The current state shows 0 on-hand inventory and 801 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the shift is sustained over 3 periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this new regime (N=3) to ensure the OR backend aims for a higher base stock. Specifically, mu_hat for the (L+1)=5 period window needs to reflect this higher mean to cover demand until the next orders arrive.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Demand for the last 4 periods (P16-P19) was 273, 170, 232, and 116, averaging ~198 units per period, compared to the baseline of ~100. Although Period 19 dipped to 116, the preceding surge suggests a level shift or high-volatility event that requires higher safety stock. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 0 units on hand and 1000 in transit (following aggressive orders in P17-P19), we need to maintain a high base stock. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this new regime's increased mean (approx 200) and significantly higher variance, ensuring the backend calculates a sufficient base stock to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) was [273, 170, 232, 116, 164], which averages approximately 191 units per period. This is a significant jump from the earlier average of ~100 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there's a massive stockout risk. Pipeline inventory is 959 units, which covers about 5 periods of demand at the new rate, but the lead time is consistently 4 periods. The order from Period 17 (265 units) is expected to arrive in Period 21. For the OR backend, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 samples to capture the recent regime shift (N=5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages. Sigma_hat is also updated using N=5 to reflect the increased volatility in this higher-demand period.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, demand averaged roughly 100 units/period. Over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), demand has averaged 189 units (273, 170, 232, 116, 164, 180). This represents a nearly 90% increase in mean demand. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 13 through 17. Currently, we have 85 units on-hand and 694 units in-transit (orders from P18: 383, P19: 311). The P18 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 22 resolution phase and will be visible in the next 'conclude' message. Given the high volatility and significant shift in demand, I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new regime's mean (approx 189) and higher variance, while maintaining the lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (Period 16-21) average: 189 units/period, compared to pre-P16 average of 100 units.

Lead times remain consistent at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the P22 conclusion message showing the P18 order arrived on schedule). On-hand inventory is currently high (279) due to the arrival of a large catch-up order (383 units from P18), and there are 478 units in-transit. To maintain the new service level while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will use the recent 7-period demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=7 for the demand parameters ensures the backend focuses on the current higher volume, while L calculation remains stable on the promised 4 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 23, the average is approximately 189 units per period (273, 170, 232, 116, 164, 180, 189, 187), compared to the earlier average of ~100. This higher demand appears sustained over 8 periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 19 order in Period 23 (4 periods). With L=4, mu_hat should cover 5 periods (L+1) of this new demand regime. Using N=8 for mu_hat (the length of the new regime) provides an average of ~189, leading to a mu_hat calculation of 5 * 189 = 945. Sigma_hat is also adjusted to reflect the increased volatility in this new demand window (N=8). Currently, on-hand (403) + in-transit (356) = 759, which is below the expected base stock for the 5-period horizon, so ordering will continue to align with the new regime.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16. Analyzing the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the average demand is approximately 190.4 units. Period 24 showed a 'conclude' message with 0 units arriving, which is expected as the order from Period 20 was 0 units. In-transit inventory includes orders from P21 (0), P22 (167), P23 (189), and P24 (186), totaling 542 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock effectively targets the median/mean of demand over (L+1) periods. My parameters use recent_N (N=9) to capture the higher demand regime (approx 190/period) while acknowledging the increased volatility (std dev ~45). This ensures the OR backend orders enough to satisfy the higher volume while adjusting for the currently healthy pipeline.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P16-P24) average stable at ~190 units/period with standard deviation ~45.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 16. The pre-P16 average was ~100, while the post-P16 average (P16-P25) is approximately 190.4 units/period with a standard deviation of 43.6. Although orders from P20 and P21 (zero orders) and the lack of arrivals in P24-P25 (consistent with realized lead time of 4 periods following P19) have reduced on-hand inventory to 20, the pipeline remains heavily loaded with 753 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am using recent_N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock relative to the pipeline (753) and on-hand (20). Current parameters set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the ~190 demand level over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, the average demand was approximately 100 units. Since Period 16, the average demand has stabilized near 190 units (P16-P26 average is approx 191 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 26 where demand (187) equaled the available inventory (187). However, there is a large pipeline of 760 units in transit. Specifically, orders from Period 23 (189 units), Period 24 (186 units), and Period 25 (211 units) are expected to arrive in Periods 27, 28, and 29 respectively. To account for the new demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=11, covering P16-P26) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock levels reflect the higher volume and increased volatility (+120% increase in mean). The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been highly stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand is approximately 186.3 units, significantly higher than the initial average of ~100. Recent demand in Period 27 dipped to 122, but looking at the sustained pattern, using N=12 for demand capturing this regime is appropriate. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5-P10, P12-P13, P15-P23, and P26-P27). Note that shipments from P20 and P21 did not arrive at the expected 4-period mark (should have arrived in P24-P25), which suggests those specific orders may be lost or significantly delayed. To account for this in the ordering logic, I maintain the current lead time estimate of 4 but ensure the base stock is calculated using the high-demand regime samples. Using recent_N=12 for mu_hat captures the 186 units/period average, and N=12 for sigma_hat captures the increased volatility of the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Potential loss of shipments from Period 20 and Period 21 confirmed (no 'conclude' message by Period 28, well past lead time 4).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16. Specifically, over the last 13 periods (P16-P28), the average demand is approximately 181 units. The recent five periods (P24-P28) show a slightly lower but consistent average of 168 units. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, which aligns with the base stock primarily covering the mean demand. There is significant evidence that shipments from Period 20 and Period 21 are lost, as they are now 4-5 periods past their expected delivery date (lead time 4). This results in a 'pipeline gap'. To account for these lost units, I am ignoring them in my mental accounting and relying on the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages for P22-P24 orders. I will use the last 13 periods (since the regime shift) to calculate mean and volatility to ensure the forecast reflects the current volume while smoothing out recent fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16 from an average of ~100 to a higher regime. Over the last 14 periods (P16-P29), the average demand is 184.2, with recent volatility remaining high. Period 29 demand was 219. Regarding arrivals, orders from Periods 20 and 21 are confirmed lost as they have exceeded the established 4-period lead time without arriving or concluding. The backend 'In-transit' figure of 587 units reflects orders from Periods 26, 27, 28, and 29. Since the backend OR logic subtracts the entire pipeline from the base stock, the presence of these lost orders in the 'In-transit' count (if they were still there) would cause under-ordering. However, the system's in-transit total (587) matches the sum of orders from P26 (174), P27 (186), P28 (94), and P29 (133), which equals 587. This confirms that the lost orders from P20 and P21 have been purged from the pipeline count. Therefore, the pipeline inventory is accurate. I will set mu_hat based on the last 14 periods (N=14) to capture the current high-demand regime and set sigma_hat similarly to account for the increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation at Period 30: Lost orders from P20/P21 are no longer included in the 'In-transit' count (587 units = P26+P27+P28+P29). Demand regime (P16-P29) average confirmed at ~184 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained at a higher level. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 30 is approximately 188 units per period (sum = 2824 units over 15 periods). Recent demand (P28-P30) shows a slight uptick (147, 219, 205). The promised lead time is 4. Orders from Period 20 and 21 were lost, which caused stockouts but the 'In-transit' pipeline has now accurately dropped them. I am using recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime starting from Period 16, while keeping L at the promised value of 4 since the system seems back on the 4-period schedule (P22-P26 orders all arrived with lead_time=4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P16-P30) mean confirmed at ~188 units/period (compared to ~100 pre-P16). Lead time for successfully delivered orders remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $201.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 16 at a significantly higher mean. Examining the 16 samples from Period 16 to Period 31, the mean demand is approximately 188.1 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 41.5. Currently, we have 26 units on-hand and 672 units in-transit (orders from P28, P29, P30, and P31). Lead time for delivered orders remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit = 698) is roughly equal to the expected demand across the lead time plus the review period (5 periods * 188 = 940), the OR backend will place an order to maintain the base stock level. I am using recent_N (N=16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime effectively while excluding the lower pre-P16 baseline. The L parameter remains at default (4) as recent deliveries confirm this lead time.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we are in a sustained high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand mean from P16 to P32 is approximately 189 units/period. The most recent demand (P32) was 177. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to a stockout in Period 32, where demand (177) exceeded available inventory (120). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods for all successfully delivered orders. Orders from P20 and P21 are confirmed lost and have been removed from the in-transit count. The current in-transit inventory (818) consists of orders from P29 (133), P30 (233), P31 (212), and P32 (240). To maintain a high service level given the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0), I am setting mu_hat to be based on the recent high-demand regime (last 17 periods) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the ~190 unit mean. Sigma_hat is also set to the recent regime to capture the higher volatility observed since P16.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 16 remains stable, with current mean demand (P16-P33) at approximately 188 units. Recent demand in Period 33 was 160. Lead times for fulfilled orders remain consistent at 4 periods. However, recent stockouts in Period 32 and 33 (on-hand 0 at start and end) indicate that although deliveries are arriving, they are insufficient to meet the trailing demand + backlogs. The current in-transit inventory of 802 units corresponds to orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33 (233+212+240+117). This pipeline is significant, but on-hand is currently depleted. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 (the length of the current regime starting at P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects the higher demand levels and volatility seen since Period 16. Setting L to 'default' (4) is appropriate as the system has resumed delivering in a 4-period window after the P20/P21 losses.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable at a higher level than the initial phase. Analysis of the last 15 periods (P20-P34) shows an average demand of approximately 185 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently low (14 units), and the pipeline contains 695 units. Lead times for successfully delivered orders have consistently remained at 4 periods. The goal is to maintain a base stock that covers demand over the review period plus lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Given the profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, which aligns with using the mean (mu_hat) as the base stock target. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=19 (covering the start of the current high-demand regime at P16) to capture the stable mean of ~185 units. Similarly, sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=19 to account for the volatility in this regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the recent 20 periods (P16-P35), the average demand is approximately 191 units per period. The standard deviation over this same period is roughly 42 units. This reflects a clear shift from the initial pre-P16 baseline of ~100 units. Lead times for fulfilled orders remain consistently at 4 periods. Since units_sold and demand have been closely matched when inventory is available, and there are frequent stockouts (ending inventory at 5, on-hand at 5 current), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 samples to capture this sustained high-demand regime effectively. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock level that accounts for both the increased mean and the higher volatility seen in the current cycle.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P16-P35) confirmed with mean ~191 and std ~42, following the structural shift at P16.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted structurally at Period 16 from a mean of ~100 to ~190 units per period. Evaluating the most recent 21 periods (P16-P36), the mean demand is approximately 191 units with a standard deviation of 42. Since Period 32, demand has been consistently high (177, 160, 219, 221, 212). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and empirical evidence from successfully delivered orders (e.g., P32 order arriving at P36) confirms an actual lead time of 4. We are currently in a stable high-demand regime, so I am using recent_N (N=21) for demand parameters to capture this 'new normal'. The current on-hand inventory is low (33), but the in-transit pipeline (700) is robust, covering roughly 3.6 periods of demand. Setting L=4, mu_hat with recent_N=21, and sigma_hat with recent_N=21 will maintain a base stock that accounts for 5 periods of demand (L+1), ensuring high service levels during this sustained high-demand phase.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 16 remains stable, with a mean demand of approximately 190 units per period. The last 22 periods (P16-P37) show consistent high demand compared to the initial 15 periods. Specifically, the mean demand from P16 to P37 is approximately 192 units. Lead time for delivered orders is consistently 4 periods, although shipments from P20 and P21 were previously confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 800 units in transit (orders from P34, P35, P36, and P37). To set OR parameters, I will use a recent_N approach for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, focusing on the current demand regime (N=22). Setting L to 'default' uses the promised lead time of 4, which aligns with recent successful arrivals. This configuration ensures the base stock calculation covers at least 5 periods of demand (L+1) at the current regime's rate, accounting for the immediate zero on-hand status.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained in a high state. Since P16, the average demand is 191 units per period with a standard deviation of 42. Recent demand (P34-P38) is slightly higher, averaging 205.4 units, but keeping a window of N=23 (P16 onwards) provides the most stable estimate of this high regime. Lead time for successful deliveries is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are 823 units in transit (orders from P35-P38). The backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N=23 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures parameters are tuned to the current high-demand environment (~191/period) rather than the pre-P16 low-demand period (~100/period).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a structural shift at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~100 to ~191 units per period. In the most recent periods (P16-P39), the mean demand is approximately 194 units with a standard deviation of 42. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 724 units in transit (orders from P36-P39). The lead time for successfully delivered orders has consistently remained at 4 periods. Since P39 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory after a demand of 228 (fully met by an arrival of 228), we are in a high-utilization phase. Given P=1 and H=1, the target service level is 50%, which the OR base-stock model will target. I will use a 24-period window (P16-P39) to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using lead time 'calculate' to rely on the stable 4-period historical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P16-P39) mean remains stable at ~194 units/period with std ~42.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 194 units and a standard deviation of 42. Recent periods (P36-P40) show consistent demand within this range (mean ~202). Lead times for delivered orders remain stable at exactly 4 periods. While there were lost shipments from P20 and P21, the pipeline has since normalized. The current 'In-transit' of 730 units covers orders from P37 (217), P38 (149), P39 (129), and P40 (235). To maintain the target service level in this high-demand scenario (where profit and holding costs are equal, implying a 50% service level target for the base stock, though the OR backend incorporates a safety buffer via the cap), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=25 (covering the regime from P16 to P40) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable at a higher mean of ~194 units per period with a standard deviation of ~42. At Period 42, on-hand inventory is 0 after a high demand of 260 in Period 41. In-transit inventory stands at 709 units, which corresponds to orders from Periods 38 (149), 39 (129), 40 (235), and 41 (196). Since lead time for delivered orders has consistently been 4 periods, I expect the Period 38 order to arrive during Period 42. Using recent_N (N=26, from P16 to P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current high-demand regime effectively while discounting the pre-P16 lower demand. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers 5 periods (L+1) of demand, ensuring sufficient availability for the remainder of the game.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 16 remains stable, with current stats (P16-P42) showing a mean of approximately 196 units/period and a standard deviation of 45. Recent demand in Period 41 and 42 reflects this volatility (260 and 178 respectively). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods for all successfully delivered shipments. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 816 units (comprised of orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42). Given that profit relative to holding cost is balanced (1:1), the OR backend's target service level (q=0.5) will naturally aim for the median demand. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=27 to capture the entire current high-demand regime since Period 16, which provides the most accurate estimation of mean and variance for the current state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P16-P42) mean updated to ~196 units/period with std ~45. Lead time continues to be stable at 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained elevated since. For the period P16-P43, the mean demand is approximately 197 units per period with a standard deviation of about 45. In the most recent 10 periods (P34-P43), the mean is approximately 201 units. Lead time for successfully delivered orders has been extremely stable at exactly 4 periods. Current On-hand inventory is 0, and units were lost in Period 43 due to a stockout. We must ensure the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for this higher demand level. Using N=20 for recent_N captures the stable high-demand regime since P16 while smoothing recent fluctuations. This will set a base stock level around 1200-1300 units to meet the high service level target (critical since Profit=Holding Cost, requiring approximately a 50% service level for the math, but the backend uses q = p/(p+h) = 0.5; however, given lead time uncertainty and stockout history, maintaining the regime average is safer).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P16-P43 mean is ~197 units; last 10 periods (P34-P43) mean is ~201 units. Lead time consistently 4 periods for all fulfilled orders.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained elevated. For the current period, the long-term mean (P16-P44) is approximately 196.4 units with a standard deviation of 44.5. The most recent 10 periods (P35-P44) show a slightly higher mean of approximately 206.7 units. Given the inventory position (65 on-hand, 751 in-transit), the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (4) + review period (1). The lead time has been consistently 4 periods for all successful shipments. I will use the recent_N method with N=29 (covering the entire high-demand regime since P16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean accurately while smoothing out recent fluctuations. L is kept at the promised lead time of 4.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained stable. For the high-demand period (P16-P45), the mean demand is approximately 196 units with a standard deviation of 42. Recent 10-period demand (P36-P45) shows a mean of 207, suggesting a slight upward drift or sustained high volatility. I will use recent_N=30 to capture the entirety of this high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this provides a robust sample size (~30 periods) since the structural break. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods for all successful deliveries (no new losses since P20/P21). Current inventory (On-hand: 35, In-transit: 709) is being managed against a lead-time demand window of 5 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P16-P45) mean established at ~196 units/period; last 10 periods (P36-P45) mean slightly higher at ~207 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $167.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable with a mean of approximately 196-197 units. In the last 10 periods (P37-P46), the mean demand is slightly higher at 208 units, with a standard deviation of 29 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods for all successful deliveries (most recently confirmed by Period 42's order arriving in Period 46). On-hand inventory is 62 units and In-transit is 684 units (covering orders from P43, P44, P45, P46). Since the game is nearing its end at Period 50, and our lead time is 4 periods, orders placed now (Period 47) will arrive in Period 51 (Arrival resolution phase of P51), effectively at the very end or just after the simulation. However, to maintain the service level for the final periods (48, 49, 50), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 10-period window to capture the slightly elevated demand trend and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for current variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P37-P46) mean is 208 units with std 29, showing a slight increase from the long-term P16+ average of 196.

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from P16. Looking at the most recent 10 periods (P38-P47), the mean demand is 210 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods for all fulfilled orders since the start of the simulation (excluding the lost shipments in P20/P21). Current inventory state: 16 units on-hand and 786 units in-transit. The in-transit pipeline (786) consists of orders from P44 (145), P45 (154), P46 (231), and P47 (256). With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand over the protection interval (L+1). To ensure stability and capture the most recent mean shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to focus on the P38-P47 period. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P38-P47) mean is 210 units per period with std ~30, sustaining the high-demand shift observed since P16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $161.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 49, the penultimate period. The demand regime from P38-P48 shows a mean of approximately 210 units (sum of P38-P48 demand is 2315, mean ~210). Recent demand has consistently hovered around this mark after the initial shift at P16. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 893 units, which consists of orders from P45 (154), P46 (231), P47 (256), and P48 (252). The order from P45 is expected to arrive in the current period (P49), and the P46 order will arrive in P50 (the final period). Since the game ends at P50, any order placed now (P49) would only arrive in P53 (given L=4), which is past the game's horizon. However, the OR backend requires parameters to maintain the policy. I will use recent_N (N=11, covering P38-P48) to capture the current stable high-demand regime (~210 units/period) and fixed lead time (L=4). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current needs even though new orders won't arrive before the game ends.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P38-P48) mean is ~210 units per period with std ~28, representing the most recent stable high-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $154.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (P38-P49), the mean demand is approximately 210 units with a standard deviation of about 30. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand (237) exceeding arrivals (154) in Period 49. The 'In-transit' quantity of 896 units matches the sum of orders from P46 (231), P47 (256), P48 (252), and P49 (157), correctly reflecting the lead time of 4 periods. Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the backend logic targets a 50% service level for the base stock calculation (q = 0.5), which effectively sets the base stock near the mean demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1). To maintain stability and capture the most recent demand level without overreacting to individual spikes, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=12, covering the demand behavior since Period 38.
