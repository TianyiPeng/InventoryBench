However, my analysis indicates that the 'In-transit' figure is potentially inflated by late-arriving orders or the OR system overestimating the stock adequacy relative to the shift in demand. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival history (e.g., P23 order of 169 units arrived at the start of P28/end of P27). Looking at the pipeline: orders from P24 (180), P25 (250), P26 (160), and P27 (182) are in transit. Since Period 16, demand has shifted from ~100 to an average of ~190. Current on-hand is low (51). In the next four periods (P28-P31), total arrivals will be approximately 772 units (the current full pipeline). Total expected demand for those same 4 periods at the ~190 average is ~760 units. While the pipeline is technically sufficient to cover demand through the lead time, the safety margin is slim given recent demand spikes (up to 273 in P16 and 232 in P18).

In the recent periods (27-28), demand has moderated slightly (122 and 147 units). Current inventory state: On-hand = 84, In-transit = 692. Arrivals expected in upcoming periods (Step 2-4 resolution) include orders from P25 (250 units), P26 (160 units), P27 (182 units), and P28 (100 units). Total pipeline + On-hand = 776 units. Applying the (L+1) rule where L=4: we need to cover demand for 5 periods. Even at the high-regime average of 200 units/period, required stock is 1000 units. However, recent demand (P27-28) suggests a cooling to ~135 units/period, which would require ~675 units. The OR recommendation is 0 because the pipeline (692) plus on-hand (84) is 776, which exceeds its 'capped' logic based on the full history. Given the shift back toward moderate demand and the large volume already in transit (including a 250-unit spike arriving next period), I will maintain a lean position to avoid high holding costs while the current pipeline clears.

Strategy for End-of-Game: We are at Period 45. The total game length is 50 periods. Orders placed today (P45) arrive at the start of Period 49 (Decision Phase) and are available for Period 49 and 50 demand. Orders placed in Period 46 arrive at Period 50. Orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive before the game ends. \n5. Target Calculation: We need to cover demand for Periods 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 (6 periods). Estimated demand = 6 * 200 = 1200 units. Total inventory on hand + in transit (excluding P45 order) = 30 + 743 = 773 units. \n6. Gap: 1200 - 773 = 427 units. However, the OR recommendation is 112, which is capped. Given the imminent end of the game, I must ensure I don't over-order and get hit by holding costs for P50 ending inventory, but I must also avoid stockouts in the final periods which are highly likely given the current 0 on-hand trend. The order from P41 (193 units) arrives in P45 resolution, P42 (200) in P46, etc. My coverage is tight. I will increase the order beyond the OR recommendation to 150 to bridge the gap for the final two periods without excessive surplus.",

Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, these in-transit units are scheduled to arrive as follows: Period 46 (from P42 order: 200 units), Period 47 (from P43 order: 200 units), Period 48 (from P44 order: 150 units), and Period 49 (from P45 order: 150 units). The demand regime has stabilized at a mean of approximately 200 units per period (recent periods 41-45 demand: 260, 178, 218, 170, 226). To cover the lead time transition and the remaining periods of the game (ending at Period 50), we must ensure that the total pipeline covers the demand for the next 5 periods (46 through 50). Expected demand for the remainder is 5 * 200 = 1000 units. Total current pipeline is 700. The OR recommendation is 192, which brings the total pipeline to 892. Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive in time to be sold (a Period 47 order arrives Period 51). Therefore, this is the final order that can reliably impact revenue. I will slightly increase the OR recommendation to 200 units to ensure we meet the ~200 unit demand average for the final period (Period 50) and minimize lost sales, resulting in a total available supply of 900 units for the final 5 periods.",
