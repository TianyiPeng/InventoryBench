Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical performance yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Initial demand samples show a mean of 97.2 (110, 116, 74, 101, 85). Since we have no lead time observations, I will use the 'default' strategy for lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full set of provided pre-history samples, as there is no reason yet to suspect a regime shift. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand for (L+1) periods, which is 5 periods in this case, balancing the high holding cost ($1.0) against the profit ($1.0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 126 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4 periods. As expected for a multi-period lead time, 0 units arrived during Period 1. Consequently, since on-hand inventory was 0, total demand of 156 units was lost. Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 126 in-transit. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility (samples: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85, and current P1 demand of 156). The mean of the initial 5 samples is 97.2, but the most recent pulse (P1: 156) is much higher. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent mean of ~106.4 units per period (including P1). Given L=4, the base stock formula (L+1) means covering 5 periods of demand. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will calculate via z*=0. I'll stick to the default promised lead time and calculate sigma based on the most recent 5 samples to handle volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. Given the sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (126 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). The order placed in Period 2 (159 units) is expected in Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 285 units in transit (126 + 159). Historical demand samples are [110, 116, 74, 101, 85]. The average demand over these 5 samples is 97.2, with a standard deviation of 16.7. Since we have no confirmed arrivals yet, I will use the 'default' lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available historical samples (N=5) to establish a baseline, as there is no evidence of a regime shift yet. Using (1+L) calculation: (1+4)*97.2 = 486.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Consequently, our on-hand inventory has been 0 for the first three periods, leading to lost sales. Demand samples (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) show a mean of approximately 97 units per period. Since the lead time (L) is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The total pipeline inventory is currently 445 units (126 from P1, 159 from P2, 160 from P3). Based on the demand mean of ~97, a 5-period requirement is ~485 units. The OR backend will calculate the order as max(0, base_stock - pipeline). Given we have 445 in transit, and assuming L=4, mu_hat (5-period demand) should be around 485. I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all 5 historical samples provided in the prompt (110, 116, 74, 101, 85), which averages to 97.2, resulting in a mu_hat of ~486. This aligns with the necessary coverage while we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 (with L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Therefore, it is normal that 'arrived=0' appears in all history up to Period 4. The current in-transit inventory is 531 units (orders from P1: 126, P2: 159, P3: 160, P4: 86). Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85 (mean \u2248 97.2). Since there is no evidence yet that the actual lead time differs from the promise or that shipments are lost, I will use the promised L=4. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the representative mean and variance while slightly underweighting the high initial noise. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on history, an order placed in Period 1 arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4. Total demand over the first 5 periods is 110, 116, 74, 101, 85 (average ~97.2). Note: The game history 'conclude' messages show demand values that differ slightly from the provided 'historical demand data' block; I will use the history conclude values (156, 117, 90, 77, 94) which average 106.8 per period. Pipeline inventory is currently 405 (orders from P2, P3, P4). Since L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=5 captures the initial volatility. Expected total demand over lead time + review period is approx 5 * 106.8 = 534. The OR engine will subtract the pipeline (405) and on-hand (32) from the calculated base stock. Given Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning we target the mean demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the conclude messages: Period 5 confirms the P1 order (126 units) arrived with a lead time of 4. Period 6 confirms the P2 order (159 units) arrived with a lead time of 4. This validates the promised lead time of 4. Total demand for the last 6 periods is [156, 117, 90, 77, 94, 106], showing a mean of 106.6. There was a higher demand in P1 (156), while recent periods (P3-P6) show a lower, more stable regime around 91.75. Current inventory: On-hand = 85, In-transit = 343 units (Orders from P3, P4, and P6). Expected arrivals: P3 order (160) should arrive in P7 arrival resolution, and P4 order (86) in P8. The sum of on-hand + in-transit is 428, which covers approx 4 periods of demand at a mean of 107. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover L+1=5 periods. My parameters aim for a base stock around (5 * 107) = 535. Using recent_N=6 for demand captures the higher initial volume while respecting the recent lower trend.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data from Periods 5, 6, and 7 confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand history shows values: 156, 117, 90, 77, 94, 106, 125, with a mean of 109.3. The recent 5 periods (P3-P7) show a mean of 98.4, but the most recent two periods suggest a slight upward trend (106, 125). Given the 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use 'calculate' for lead time since the observations match the promised lead time. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the full scope of demand variance observed while smoothing out the early high outlier in P1. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to ensure adequate safety stock for this 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, which implies a target service level that balances stockouts and holding costs closely.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. The lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods based on 'Period conclude' messages (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). This aligns with the promised lead time of 4. Total demand history includes samples: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85 (pre-game) and 156, 117, 90, 77, 94, 106, 125, 64 (in-game). The mean demand over these 13 samples is approximately 101.1 units. The most recent demand at Period 8 was unusually low (64), but there is no confirmed regime shift yet. Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the in-game samples) to capture the current demand volatility and mean, as pre-game data might be less relevant. The backend OR agent will handle the service level calculation (q = 1.0 / (1.0 + 1.0) = 0.5), which naturally aims for a 50% service level when profit equals holding cost. With current on-hand (142) and in-transit (341), total pipeline is 483, which is close to our target (5 * 101 = 505).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4. Analysis of 'conclude' messages confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). The order placed in Period 5 was 0 units, which explains why 'arrived=0' was reported in the Period 9 conclude message. History shows demand is relatively stable with no clear seasonal trend or regime shift yet. Total demand samples (including pre-game and in-game) show a mean of approximately 102.3 units per period. With L=4, the base stock targets the demand over L+1 = 5 periods. On-hand inventory is 55, and in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9) is 377, totaling 432 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the observed L matches the promised L, and 'recent_N' with N=9 for demand to capture the most recent behavior while excluding the zero-order outlier from calculation logic where relevant, though the OR backend will handle the raw samples.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Over the last 10 periods, the average demand is 103.9 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since L=4, the pipeline should cover 1+L = 5 periods of demand. Currently, On-hand (29) + In-transit (357) = 386 units. Based on a mean demand of ~104, the target base stock (5 * 104) is approximately 520. However, the backend OR engine handles the base stock calculation using its internal service level logic (q = 1.0 / (1.0 + 1.0) = 0.5, meaning it targets the median demand over the protection period). To ensure stable ordering that reflects recent demand volatility while acknowledging the confirmed lead time, I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand and standard lead time calculations. No shipments are currently overdue based on the L=4 observation.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are managing a steady demand for 'chips(Regular)'. The average demand over the last 11 periods is approximately 106 units per period. The confirmed lead time remains 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of Period 11 where the Period 7 order arrived). This means we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Current inventory state: 10 units on-hand and 385 in-transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). In Period 12, we expect the order from Period 8 (138 units) to arrive, which will replenish the low on-hand stock. Since demand has been relatively stable with no clear regime shifts, I will use a recent window (N=11) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N for L ensures the backend utilizes the observed consistent 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since Period 5, all arrivals (except the zero-order from Period 5 itself) have consistently shown an actual lead time of 4 periods. Historical demand from Period 1 to 12 shows a mean of approximately 104.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 27.5. Recent demand (last 5 periods) is slightly higher at 108.0 but within normal variability (80 to 125). No significant seasonal or regime shift is detected yet. I will set the lead time method to 'default' (4 periods) and use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full confirmed history for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock calculated for (1+L)=5 periods of demand, balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level plus appropriate safety stock).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14. Lead time is consistently observed as 4 periods (matches promised). Looking at history, the order from Period 10 (77 units) is expected to arrive during this period (Period 14) and be visible in Period 15's conclude message. However, as of the start of Period 14, on-hand is 0 because demand in Period 13 (134 units) exceeded available inventory (104 units). Historical demand (P1-P13) shows a mean of approximately 106 units per period. The pipeline inventory is 415 units (Orders from P10: 77, P11: 134, P12: 135, P13: 69). To calculate the base stock for the OR engine, we need lead time plus review period coverage (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand mean (removing initial noisy samples) and 'calculate' for lead time since the 4-period lead time is now well-established.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but shows volatility, with an average demand of approximately 105 units over the last 14 periods. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand exceeding supply in Periods 13 and 14, while the in-transit pipeline (431 units) includes orders from Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14. An arrival of 134 units (ordered Period 11) is expected during Period 15. Since the profit per unit equals the holding cost, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). To recover from the stockout and account for recent demand fluctuations, I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's mean (approx 100) and variance, ensuring the base stock covers the target 500+ units for the lead time plus current period.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 64 units, and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 383 units. Analysis of the concluding periods confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (as evidenced by arrivals in periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15). Demand has fluctuated between 64 and 156. The last 15 periods show an average demand of approximately 100.4. Despite some stockouts in periods 13 and 14 due to timing, the current in-transit amount is high relative to the recent demand mean. Setting L to 4 reflects the confirmed actual lead time. Using a recent_N of 15 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) captures the established behavior of the 'Regular chips' SKU over the full game history to date.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P12 (visible up to P16 conclude). Demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without significant seasonal trends or regime shifts. The mean demand over the last 16 periods is approximately 102.5 units/period. The current pipeline (in-transit) of 316 units consists of orders from P13 (69), P14 (93), P15 (86), and P16 (68), all of which are expected within the next 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 111. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the history confirms L=4. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the full validated history since the start, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (L+1) while balancing the equal profit and holding costs ($1.0 each).

LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 64 units, and the pipeline inventory is 330 units (representing orders from periods 14, 15, 16, and 17). Historical analysis indicates a stable lead time of 4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively consistent, with a mean around 101 units per period since Period 1. There are no clear seasonal shifts or regime changes observed in the recent data. To maintain an optimal balance between the $1.0 profit and $1.0 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level via the base-stock model), I will use the 'default' lead time of 4. For demand estimation (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use a window of the last 13 periods (N=13, from Period 5 to 17) to capture post-initialization stability while excluding the high demand from Period 1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $147.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Period 13-18) has shown higher volatility and a slight upward trend, with the last period reaching a demand of 152. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed. Current on-hand inventory is low (5 units), and there are significant units in-transit (347). To ensure inventory covers the review period plus lead time (1+4=5 periods), and accounting for recent fluctuations, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this latest demand regime (avg ~109). This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock level that prevents stockouts while managing the holding cost of $1.0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime showing increased volatility and periodic spikes (e.g., P18 demand = 152) compared to early periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face a stockout after a massive demand spike of 238 in Period 19, despite an arrival of 86 units. The on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shifted from an average of ~100 to a highly volatile regime with significant spikes (152 in P18, 238 in P19). The promised lead time L=4 is confirmed by recent arrivals. For mu_hat, considering the severe stockout and recent spikes, I am using recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent sharp increase in demand volume. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=10 to incorporate the increased volatility while maintaining a slightly broader sample for stability. The parameters are designed to increase the base stock level significantly to recover from the stockout and buffer against further extreme demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: Demand spiked to 238, significantly exceeding previous highs (~150); volatility has increased sharply.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-volatility demand regime following a significant spike in Period 19 (238 units). Although Period 20 demand dropped back to 94, the recent average and variance have fundamentally shifted. Period 21 starts with 0 on-hand inventory and 565 units in-transit. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5 (which results in a base stock equal to the mean), and the increased risk of stockouts during spikes, I am focusing on the most recent data to capture this new volatility. I will use the mean and standard deviation from the last 5 periods (Periods 16-20: 88, 116, 152, 238, 94) to stabilize the forecast while accounting for the recent regime change. N=5 covers the spike and the subsequent normalization while ignoring the older, lower-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-20 average demand increased to ~138 units with a peak of 238, compared to an earlier period average of ~100. This indicates a higher baseline for mu_hat calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted significantly since Period 18. Specifically, the last four periods (P18-P21) have seen an average demand of approximately 155 units (152, 238, 94, 136), with a massive spike of 238 in Period 19. This is a substantial increase from the historical average of ~100. Additionally, the system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory due to this surge. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stock-outs during this high-demand, high-volatility phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current regime more accurately for the (L+1) planning horizon. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.5, but effectively higher in priority to minimize lost sales when holding cost is equal to profit), the base stock needs to reflect the higher mean and increased variance observed lately.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P18-P21): Average demand increased to ~155 (+55% from baseline) with extreme volatility (peak 238).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high demand volatility and frequent stockouts. We are entering Period 23 with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 19; the last five periods (P18-P22) have seen an average demand of approximately 159.8 units (152, 238, 94, 136, 179), compared to the earlier baseline of ~100. This represents a ~60% increase. The peak demand reached 238, and recent volatility is high. To prevent further stockouts and capture the current high-demand trend while accounting for the lead time (L=4, so protecting demand for 1+4=5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this latest high-volatility regime. This will raise the base stock level to better cover the current demand surges.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from P18-P22: Average demand increased to ~160 (+60% from initial baseline) with significantly higher volatility (Standard Deviation approx 54 vs early periods).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we observe the conclusion of the high-demand regime that accelerated significantly starting around Period 18. Recent demand samples (P18-P23: 152, 238, 94, 136, 179, 132) show a mean of 155.17 and a significantly higher standard deviation (approx 48) compared to the initial baseline (~100 units). The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. With only 28 units on hand and 639 units in transit (covering roughly 4 periods of demand at the new rate), the goal is to maintain a high base stock to prevent stockouts during this high-volatility phase. The OR backend profit-to-holding ratio (1:1) implies a 50th percentile service level target, but high volatility requires a more responsive forecast. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this current high-demand regime (starting from Period 18) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been highly consistent.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 18, moving from an average of ~100 to a significantly higher and more volatile baseline (avg ~156). Recent demand samples (P18-P24: 152, 238, 94, 136, 179, 132, 131) average ~151.7. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With stockouts occurring between P19-P22, it is crucial to use a recent window (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand environment and elevated volatility (std-dev approx 45.9). Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed stable lead time of 4. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will target via the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P18-P24): Mean demand has stabilized around 152 units (+50% from early periods) with significantly higher volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 18, moving from a mean of ~100 to a higher mean with increased volatility. Since Period 18, demands have been: 152, 238, 94, 136, 179, 132, 131, 125. Over the last 8 periods (N=8), the mean demand is 148.375 units per period. The 5-period average (P21-P25) is slightly lower at 140.6, but the spike to 238 in Period 19 suggests a high volatility regime persists. Comparing P18-P25 demand vs. early data confirms a significant sustained increase. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4). Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is healthy at 527 units, and on-hand is 107. Since L=4, the base stock targets demand for 5 periods (L+1). To account for the higher mean and increased volatility without over-ordering into potential stock-heavy situations (holding cost = profit), I will use the last 8 periods to capture the start of the current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 18. Before Period 18, the mean was approximately 105. From Period 18 to Period 26, the demand averaged approximately 147 units with a peak of 238, indicating a new regime of higher demand and volatility. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (as evidenced by the arrivals from Periods 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22 all concluding with a 4-period duration). Currently, there is 138 units on-hand and 465 units in-transit. Given the high volatility observed in this recent regime, I will use a window of N=9 (from Period 18 to Period 26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this increased baseline and standard deviation while ignoring the lower historical demand. This approach helps the OR backend set a base stock level that adequately covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5) at the required service level (50% given Profit=$1 and Holding=$1), while the cap mechanism will prevent excessive over-ordering if demand mean reverts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 23-27: 132, 131, 125, 139, 169) confirms a sustained higher demand regime compared to the early periods (approx. 100), though it has moderated from the Period 19 spike (238). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P18-P27) is approximately 159.5, while the last 5 periods (P23-P27) average 139.2. Given the Profit/Holding ratio of 1.0/1.0, the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0), essentially ordering to meet the mean demand over the lead time plus reviewing period (L+1). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am choosing N=10 for mu_hat to capture the elevated regime while smoothing the extreme spike from period 19, and N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 18-27 shows a sustained increase in mean to ~140-160 units compared to earlier baseline of ~100. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand landscape for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a regime shift starting around Period 18. While the initial baseline was ~100 units, the average demand from Period 18 to Period 28 is approximately 144 units, with significant volatility (high of 238, low of 94). The lead time remains consistently observed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. Current on-hand inventory is 106 units with 536 units in-transit (orders from P25-P28). Since the the current period is 29 and lead time is 4, we are covering demand through Period 33. I will use a 'recent_N' of 11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime (P18-P28). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the higher mean (~144) and the increased variance observed in the last 11 periods to maintain stock levels against potential spikes.

Carry-over insight: No new significant pattern detected beyond the sustained high-demand regime identified in Period 28.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-volume regime since Period 18. Average demand from Period 18 to Period 29 is approximately 149 units per period (compared to the early baseline of ~100), with significant volatility (peak of 238, recent 156). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 64 units, and the pipeline (in-transit) is 508. Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Using recent_N (N=12, covering the high-demand regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend captures this shift and maintains a sufficient base stock to meet the increased demand while managing the higher observed variance. An N of 12 precisely captures the stable high-demand period evidence starting from P18.

Daily Reward (R_t): $170.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime in the most recent period (P18-P30) has established a new mean of approximately 147 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline. This shift, coupled with increased volatility (peaks over 200), requires a narrower look-back window (recent_N) to focus on current levels. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since P30 ended with nearly zero on-hand inventory (1 unit) and demand is currently outpacing historic averages, I am using a recent_N of 13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-P18 behavior. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the sustained high demand and volatility observe in the last 13 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 18-31) shows a significant increase in mean and volatility compared to the initial periods. The average demand over the last 14 periods is approximately 144 units, with a standard deviation around 37 units. Period 31 demand was 131, consistent with the identified high-demand regime (+40-50% vs. baseline). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 4 units on-hand and 607 units in-transit (covering orders from P28, P29, P30, and P31), the inventory position is tight but supported by the incoming pipeline. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=14) to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=14) to account for higher volatility. L remains at the promised/confirmed 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-volume regime that began around Period 18. For the most recent 15 periods (P18-P32), the average demand is approximately 146 units. While there was a significant peak of 238 in P19, recent demand has fluctuated between 106 and 171, suggesting a sustained increase from the initial baseline of ~100. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, with orders consistently arriving as promised. Inventory is currently tight (26 units on hand), but there is a substantial pipeline (552 units) which includes several large orders placed to catch up with the regime shift. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture this sustained higher demand level more accurately than the long-term average, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=15 to account for the increased volatility seen in this period. L is kept at 'default' since the promised 4-period lead time is performing reliably.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime from P18-P32: Mean demand stabilized at approximately 146 units (+46% from initial baseline) with continued higher volatility compared to P1-P17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 18 and has remained in a high-demand state. For the last 16 periods (P18-P33), the mean demand is approximately 146 units with a standard deviation of about 33 units. In Period 33, demand was 137, exceeding on-hand inventory and resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P29 order arrived in P33 conclusion). To address the recent volatility and prevent further stockouts in this high-demand regime, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=16 to capture the parameters of the current regime. This will set mu_hat to (1+L)*146 and sigma_hat to sqrt(1+L)*33, allowing the OR backend to compute a base-stock level that accounts for the increased mean and variance.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-volume regime that began around Period 18. Since then, demand has averaged approximately 147 units per period, with significant volatility (peaks up to 238). Recent demand in Periods 30-34 remains elevated (averaging ~152 units). Current on-hand inventory is 0, following two periods of minor stockouts (sold 112/137 and 161/162). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To maintain a high service level across the (L+1)=5 period cycle (Period 35 decision through Period 39 arrival resolution), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=17 (covering the high-demand regime from P18-P34) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=17 to capture the increased variance of this regime. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the higher mean and the observed spikes.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (approx. P18-P35) indicates a sustained high-demand regime with a mean around 146 units and significant volatility. Period 35 demand (132) is consistent with this. On-hand inventory is 48, and there are 560 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the high-demand regime is well-established (18 periods), I will use recent_N with N=18 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the specific characteristics of this regime while filtering out the lower early-game demand. L is set to calculated as the lead time has been stable at 4.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 18. Over the last 15 periods (P22-P36), the mean demand is approximately 144 units, contrasting with the early baseline of ~100. Recent demand (P33-P36: 137, 162, 132, 121) shows continued stability around this higher mean but with notable volatility. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods throughout the history. To best capture the current demand state while filtering out early low-demand data, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15, which covers the established high-demand regime. This period starts with 52 units on-hand and 563 units in-transit (orders from P33, P34, P35, and P36), which are expected to arrive in P37, P38, P39, and P40 respectively. The OR backend will use these parameters to target a base stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), maintaining a high service level given the $1 profit per unit.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime that began around Period 18. Over the last 15 periods (P23-P37), the average demand is approximately 145 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 19 units. The most recent demand at Period 37 was 156 units. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 33 order in Period 37. On-hand inventory is 57, and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 504 units (from orders in P34, P35, P36, and P37). Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the service level target is approximately 50%, though the OR backend logic with cap and safety stock will adjust this. I will use a recent_N of 15 periods to capture this stabilized higher-demand regime while filtering out the initial transition volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime (P23-P37): Average demand 145 units with a standard deviation of ~19. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime that began around Period 18. Over the last 15 periods (P24-P38), the mean demand is approximately 142.3 units with a standard deviation of 19.3. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by every arrival since Period 5. The current on-hand inventory is 19 units, with 543 units in-transit (covering orders from P35, P36, P37, and P38). To maintain a high service level given the profit and holding cost are equal (leading to a 50% critical fractile base stock, but the OR backend uses a capped policy that adds safety stock), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 15 periods to capture this sustained demand level while filtering out the extremely volatile transition period (P19-P22). This ensures the base stock calculation (1+L)*demand is grounded in the current market reality.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 18. Over the last 15 periods (P25-P39), the average demand is approximately 147 units with a standard deviation of roughly 19. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the 'conclude' messages showing exact 4-period intervals (e.g., P35 order arrived in P39). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 39 demand exceeded available stock. There are 530 units in transit (ordered in Periods 36-39: 128, 102, 148, 152), which aligns with the expected pipeline for a 4-period lead time. To ensure we cover demand for the lead time (L) plus the review period (1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture this stable high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), while keeping lead time (L) at the confirmed 'default' of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $128.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P36-P40) shows a slight uptick in demand, with the last five periods averaging 152.6 units (121, 156, 147, 185, 154), which is higher than the previously stabilized mean of ~145. Specifically, Period 39 (185) and Period 40 (154) indicate continued high pressure on inventory, despite arrivals. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to demand exceeding the starting on-hand in P40. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages. To ensure the base stock calculation captures the most recent demand volatility and slightly higher mean, I am using a recent window of N=15 for mu_hat (covering the high-demand regime) and N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the current variability. Service level remains balanced by the OR backend's profit/holding cost logic, but I am keeping L at 'calculate' to rely on the stable observed lead time of 4.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand inventory is currently 0, although there are 640 units in transit. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods through recent arrivals (P37-P41). To address the current stockout and maintain a sufficient service level against the observed mean and volatility, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (covering P27-P41) to capture the stable high-demand regime characteristics. I'm setting L to default as the promised lead time of 4 is consistent with observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P38-P42) has shown significant strength, with P42 hitting 190 units, pushing the 5-period average to approximately 159 units. The system is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) and has faced stockouts for the last four consecutive periods (P39-P42) because arrivals (from P35-P38 orders) were insufficient to meet this elevated demand. Although in-transit inventory is high (587 units), most of this is from recent large orders (P39-P42) that will arrive in P43-P46. To address the current shortfall and the observed mean shift to ~160 units, I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (to capture the current 159 mean) and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat (to capture the increased volatility of the high-demand regime). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean shift confirmed: Period 38-42 average demand increased to ~159 units (+60% from initial baseline, +10% from previous high-demand regime), causing persistent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple regime shifts. The most recent shift occurred around Period 38, where the mean demand increased to approximately 159 units (+60% from the initial baseline). Recent activity shows high demand volatility, with a peak of 190 in Period 42. In Period 43, carry-over insights confirm that this sustained high demand (Average ~159) has led to persistent stockouts. Lead time remains stable and consistent at 4 periods (P39 order arrived in P43). To address the recent increase in mean and volatility, I am using a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=6 (covering Periods 38-43) to capture the higher baseline of ~151 units per period. I am also using a recent_N method for sigma_hat (N=10) to reflect the increased standard deviation observed in the later half of the game. This approach aims to set a higher base stock level to prevent stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained increase and higher volatility. Since Period 38, the average demand has risen to approximately 149 units, with recent periods (P42, P39) showing spikes up to 190. The inventory level is currently recovering after a series of stockouts from P39-P42, with on-hand units now at 94. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P44 saw P40's order). To account for the recent demand elevation and maintain service levels, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering P38-P44) to capture the current regime's mean (approx. 147 units/period) and heightened variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 38-44 remains elevated with an average of ~149 units/period, compared to the earlier ~140 range. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Recent performance (P38-P45) suggests a mean demand of approximately 150 units per period. The inventory position currently shows 82 units on hand and 488 units in transit. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history, including the most recent Arrivals (P45 arrived P41 order). Given the product's high demand variability and equal profit/holding cost ratio (z-score = 0), a robust base stock is needed to cover 5 periods (L+1). I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the most recent regime's characteristics (P38-P45) while filtering out earlier, less relevant low-demand data.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains elevated. Over the last 10 periods (P37-P46), the average demand is approximately 148 units, with a noticeable peak of 190 in P42. While demand has slightly dipped in very recent periods, the overall pattern justifies maintaining a higher forecast to avoid the stockouts observed between P39-P42. On-hand inventory is currently low (5 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 577 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime that emerged around Period 38.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 38-47) shows a mean demand of approximately 148.6 units with a standard deviation of 26.3. The system is currently in Period 48, with only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (48, 49, 50). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4), which is after the simulation ends. Consequently, no order placed now will impact the total reward. However, the requirement is to provide the best parameters for the OR backend based on the current regime. I will use N=10 to capture the current elevated demand level (approx. 150 units/period) and volatility. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., Period 47 arrival from Period 43).

Daily Profit: $135.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent 10 periods (P39-P48), the average demand is approximately 153.1 units with a standard deviation of 26.3. This represents a significant and sustained increase from the initial baseline of ~100. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods (P44 order arrived P48 confirms this). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory is 633 (orders from P45-P48). Given the lead time L=4, the safety stock must cover L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the current elevated mean and volatility while ignoring the early lower-demand data. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current consumption patterns and minimizes stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P39-P48 confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~153 units (+53% from initial baseline) with elevated volatility (Std Dev ~26). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-demand regime characterized by a mean of approximately 153 units and a standard deviation of 26 (calculated from the period 39-49 window). Periodic stockouts occur when demand spikes or supply is thin, although the lead time has remained exceptionally stable at 4 periods. For this final period 50, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods. To ensure we capture the most relevant recent volatility and mean without over-responding to the single-period stockout in P49, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11, covering the current stable regime from P39 to P49. This provides a balance between meeting the elevated demand and managing the risk of ending with high inventory.
