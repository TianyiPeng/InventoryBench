The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 6 (visible in Period 5 conclude). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (which are provided as historical context even though current status says Period 1) shows an average demand of approximately 97 units (110, 116, 74, 101, 85). The OR recommendation for Period 1 is 126 units. This recommendation uses a base-stock policy (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302) where \u03bc\u0302 is the demand for 5 periods (current + 4 lead time). Given the average demand (~97) and standard deviation (~16), the OR recommendation of 126 seems slightly conservative for a lead time of 4, but it is likely due to the 'Capped' nature of the algorithm which limits the order to prevent over-reactions when inventory is zero. Since we need to cover demand for Periods 1 through 5 before this order arrives, and we currently have zero stock, I will follow the OR recommendation of 126 to build the initial pipeline.

Since we are now at Period 2, these units are in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 5 (visibility in Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and because Period 1 demand was 156 (exceeding initial expectations), there is a significant stockout. Historical demand samples (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) suggest an average demand of approximately 97 units per period. The OR algorithm recommends 155 units based on its base-stock calculation for the lead time (L=4) plus review period (1). Given that we have 126 units already in the pipeline and the current on-hand is 0, we need to ensure the total pipeline + on-hand covers the demand over the lead time. Following the OR recommendation of 155 units will bring our total pipeline to 281 units (126 + 155). Considering a 4-period lead time, this amount (281 / 5 periods) covers roughly 56 units per period, which is actually conservative compared to the historical average (97) and recent demand (156).

Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no arrivals have occurred yet.\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Historical demand for the first two periods was 156 and 117 (Average = 136.5). The provided demand history outside the 'Game History' (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) suggests a mean closer to 95-100. There is a slight discrepancy, but I will lean on the more recent active game data (Avg 136) combined with the provided samples.\n3. **Inventory Position**: Total inventory needed to cover the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods) is roughly 136.5 * 5 = 682.5 units. Current pipeline (In-transit) is 126 + 155 = 281 units. On-hand is 0.\n4. **Correction of OR Recommendation**: The OR recommendation is 152. If I order 152, my total pipeline becomes 281 + 152 = 433. This is still significantly lower than the target base stock of ~682. OR likely uses the lower historical samples (avg ~97) resulting in a lower cap.

The 4-period lead time means we must cover demand for the current period (P4) plus the lead time (L=4), totaling 5 periods of demand. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are 156, 117, 90. Average demand is ~121 units/period. Estimated demand for 5 periods is 121 * 5 = 605 units. 4. Strategy: Current pipeline (456) is significantly below the required 605 units to cover the lead time window. The OR recommendation of 123 units brings the total pipeline to 579, which is closer to the requirement.

Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, these are scheduled to arrive at the start of Periods 46, 47, 48, and 49. The demand regime has been fluctuating but recently averaged around 162 units (Period 43 insight), and the most recent demand in Period 44 was lower at 124 units. Using an expected demand of 150-160 units per period, the current inventory position (110 on-hand + 120 arriving next period) is sufficient to cover Period 45 and 46. The OR recommendation is 97 units. Applying the base-stock logic: Target inventory for (L+1) = 5 periods should be around 5 * 150 = 750 units. My total inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) is 110 + 492 = 602 units. To reach a target of 750 (providing safety stock for the ~160 demand level), I need to order approximately 148 units.

Therefore, Period 46 is the last meaningful order. Current on-hand inventory is 60. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 512 units. Let's trace expected arrivals: P47 (P42 order: 62), P48 (P43 order: 170), P49 (P44 order: 140), and P50 (P45 order: 140). Total stock available to satisfy demand from P46-P50 is 60 + 512 = 572 units. Recent demand has averaged approximately 150-160 units (P41-P45 avg = 143.8, but P42-P45 avg = 150). Estimating 155 units/period for 5 periods (P46 to P50) equals 775 units of total demand.
