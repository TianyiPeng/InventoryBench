Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The historical demand data for the first five periods (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) shows a mean demand of 97.2 units and a standard deviation of approximately 16.7 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no observation history of actual arrivals yet, I will use the promised lead time (L=4) as the baseline. To ensure the OR backend covers the pipeline lead time plus the current review period (1+L = 5 periods), I will use the 'default' methods which calculate based on all available samples. This initial set of parameters targets a base stock level that accounts for 5 periods of demand at the historical mean and variance.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and 126 units were ordered. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, no arrivals were expected yet. Demand in Period 1 was 156, but sales were 0 due to zero on-hand inventory. The historical data (Periods 1-5) shows demand values of 110, 116, 74, 101, and 85, with an average of approximately 97.2. However, the game history shows a demand of 156 for Period 1, which is significantly higher than the sample seed provided for that period (110). This suggests the demand might be more volatile or higher than initially estimated. Given the promised lead time (L=4), we aim to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the mean of provided samples (97.2) and the Period 1 actual demand (156), the average is roughly 107. Multiplying by 5 gives a mu_hat around 535. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=1 to weigh the most recent actual observation (156) heavily, as the start shows higher demand than the training samples. For L, I will stick to the promised default of 4.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (126 units) and Period 2 (162 units) are currently 'In-transit' (total 288). Per the timing rules, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 (L=4), becoming visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as demand (156 in P1, 117 in P2) cannot be met. Historical demand samples (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) show a mean of 97.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. Since we haven't reached the first delivery yet, there is no evidence to override the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the baseline while we wait for the pipeline to start arriving.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since the game started at Period 1, we have not yet reached the moment where any order could have arrived (first order placed in P1 with L=4 arrives during P5 and is visible in P6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations are expected and do not yet indicate a change in lead time. On-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales, which is standard during the initial lead-time gap. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 448 units (sum of P1=126, P2=162, P3=160). Historical demand samples are [110, 116, 74, 101, 85]. The average demand is 97.2. Using the (L+1) logic for base stock, we need to cover demand across 5 periods (L=4 + current period). I will use 'default' (all samples) for demand mean and volatility as the sample size is small and hasn't shown a sustained trend shift yet.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 with L=4 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (as expected for L=4). Demand has shown a downward trend from 156 to 77 over the first four periods. I will use the average of all available demand samples (Periods 1-5 mean = 98.4) to forecast. Since L=4, my target inventory (base stock) must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. I'll stick with 'default' methods for now as we have not yet observed a single arrival to confirm or refute the lead time, nor have we established a stable demand regime beyond the initial 5-period window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $344.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (concluded), confirming a lead time of exactly 4 periods. Since L=4, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Historical demand samples are [110, 116, 74, 101, 85] (seed) and [156, 117, 90, 77, 94] (actual observed), showing a mean of approximately 101.3 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 32, and in-transit inventory is 453 (orders from P2, P3, P4). Since the lead time is stable at 4, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand trend (average ~106.8). For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect current variance. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (1+4) periods of demand while accounting for the high in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5); Demand shows a slight downward trend from early peaks but remains around 100 units/period.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the arrivals in Period 5 (ordered P1) and Period 6 (ordered P2). Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after early fluctuations. The demand for the last 5 periods (P2-P6) has been: 117, 90, 77, 94, 106, resulting in an average of 96.8 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 88, and in-transit inventory is 399 (representing orders from P3, P4, and P6). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation will capture the current stabilized demand regime while filtering out the initial Period 1 outlier (156).

Daily Reward (R_t): $377.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as seen in Conclude messages for P1, P2, and P3). Demand over the last 7 periods has averaged 109.3 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P5-P7) show an average of 108.3 units (94, 106, 125), suggesting a stabilization around 110 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target window is (1+L) = 5 periods. Pipeline inventory is currently 265 (orders from P4, P6, P7) and on-hand is 123, totaling 388 units of coverage. 388 units covers roughly 3.5 periods of demand at the current rate. I will maintain the lead time at the promised 'default' of 4 and use 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the full history since the initial P1 spike while smoothing the recent variance. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to reflect the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of 'conclude' messages confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P5 shows P1 arrival, P6 shows P2, P7 shows P3, P8 shows P4). Current on-hand is 190, with 287 units in transit. Demand over the last 8 periods has averaged 103.6 units, but the most recent 5 periods (P4-P8) average 92.6 units, showing a slight decrease compared to the very early spikes. Given the lead time is 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (1 current + 4 transit). Using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) captures the current stabilized demand level of ~93/period, which, when multiplied by (1+L=5), aligns with our pipeline requirements. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a conservative buffer against volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit).

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently observed at 4 periods across P1-P4 orders; Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~93 units since Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $245.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. The history shows orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 arrived exactly 4 periods later (in P5, P6, P7, and P8 respectively). No order was placed in P5, which explains why P9 arrivals were 0. The next expected arrival is from the P6 order (108 units) during Period 10. Demand has stabilized post-P4; the mean demand from P4 to P9 is approximately 92 units/period (compared to ~121 in P1-P3). With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current inventory position is 103 (on-hand) + 323 (in-transit) = 426 units. Recent demand samples (P4-P9) provide a more accurate representation of the current regime. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this stabilized demand for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain L=4 via the default method as it matches the promised lead time.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 88 units with 291 units in-transit. Based on historical data from Period 5 onwards, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6). The order from Period 5 was zero, explaining why nothing arrived in Period 9. The current demand mean over all 10 periods is 104.9, but the most recent 7 periods (P4-P10) show a slightly lower and more stable mean of approximately 96.6 units. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime while accounting for the confirmed lead time of 4. This setting (L+1 = 5 periods of demand coverage) provides a buffer for the observed demand volatility (std \u2248 21), ensuring high service levels for this profitable SKU ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, on-hand inventory is 0 following a stockout in Period 11 where demand (125) exceeded supply (114). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on systematic arrivals (P1-P4 and P6-P7). The order placed in Period 5 (ordered=0) correctly resulted in 0 arrivals in Period 9. Demand analysis shows a recent uptick: the last two periods saw demand of 123 and 125, which is higher than the previous stabilization around 93. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the 4-period lead time (covering 5 periods of demand), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent higher demand trend (Avg: (87+123+125+64+125)/5 \u2248 105). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to adjust to increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 10: demand increased from an average of ~93 to ~124 units over the last two periods (P10: 123, P11: 125).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with a regime shift identified at Period 10 (P10: 123, P11: 125). However, Period 12 demand dropped to 80, suggesting the 'shift' might be high variance rather than a sustained new mean. The average demand across P10-P12 is 109.3. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4). Inventory status: On-hand 73 + In-transit 398 = 471 pipeline units. Since promised L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current pipeline covers ~94 units/period for the next 5 periods. Given the high variance (range 64 to 156), I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent fluctuations (P8-P12 avg = 95.8, which adjusted for L+1=5 gives mu_hat \u2248 479) and recent_N with N=12 (all available data post-P1) for sigma_hat to adequately account for the wide spread in demand. This targets a robust base stock level to prevent stockouts observed in Period 11.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14. Analysis of the historical demand shows a clear regime shift starting around Period 10. The demand for the last four periods (P10-P13) has been 123, 125, 80, and 134, averaging 115.5 units. This is significantly higher than the previous stabilization around 93 units noted in Period 9. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P10, P11, P12, and P13, all showing a 4-period lag). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand exceeded supply in Period 13. The pipeline (In-transit) is 420 units, which covers approximately 3.6 periods of the current demand mean. To ensure we recover from the stockout and cover the (L+1) window, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent higher demand trend. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same recent 4 periods to account for the increased volatility (ranging from 80 to 134).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Mean demand from P10-P13 is ~115.5, up from ~93 (+24%). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 due to demand exceeding supply in recent periods. Reviewing the lead time history (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14), the actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. The demand from P10 to P14 shows a sustained increase to an average of ~111.6 units (123, 125, 80, 134, 96), compared to the earlier stabilized mean of ~93. This shift likely warrants a 'recent_N' approach to capture the higher mean and volatility. I will use N=5 to focus on this current demand regime (P10-P14). Setting L to 'default' is appropriate as it matches the observed lead time of 4. This configuration will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for (1+L) periods (5 periods) of demand to recover the current stock-out and cover future demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $215.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 16. Analyzing the lead time, the historical data (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14, P15) consistently confirms an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods. Regarding demand, while a previous insight noted a shift upwards starting Period 10, the most recent three periods (P13: 134, P14: 96, P15: 70) show a significant downward trend and high volatility. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P10-P15) is approximately 104.7 units, but the mean for the last 3 periods is only 100 units. To balance the service level against the $1.0 holding cost, I will focus on the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture the higher volatility seen in this 'messy' regime while ensuring mu_hat reflects the recent average. This uses a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the early, stable low-demand period (P4-P9). Given the 4-period lead time, the OR backend requires a coverage for (1+L)=5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $224.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by the order from Period 12 arriving in Period 16). The inventory position currently has 128 units on-hand and 358 units in-transit. Demand has shown higher volatility recently, but the regime shift mentioned in previous carry-overs (averaging ~115 units) seems to have cooled off slightly in the most recent periods (P14: 96, P15: 70, P16: 88, avg = 84.7). However, looking at the last 7 periods (P10-P16), the mean is approximately 102 units. Given the higher demand seen in P10-P13 (~115.5) and the lower demand in P14-P16 (~85), I will use N=7 for mu_hat to capture the most recent behavior while acknowledging the higher variance. L is set to 4 based on consistent observations. The sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=7) to reflect the recent high variance in demand (ranging from 70 to 134), ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Periods 14-16 average ~85 units, relative to Period 10-13 average of ~115; overall Period 10-16 average is ~102.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 10-17) shows high volatility with mean demand around 103 units, shifting between spikes of ~125 and dips around 70-80. The last period (P17) saw demand of 116. In-transit inventory is high (373 units) relative to the on-hand stock (70) and average demand. Given the confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The current pipeline (373 + 70 = 443) covers approximately 4.3 periods of average demand (~103 units). I will use a recent N approach (N=8) to capture the demand mean and variance since the regime shift at period 10, ensuring we account for the current higher-volatility environment to prevent stockouts while managing the large pipeline inventory.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by the arrival of the order from P14 in P18). Demand has been volatile but shows a significant upward trend recently (P17: 116, P18: 152). Since P10, demand has shifted into a higher-activity regime compared to the early periods. Over the last 9 periods (P10-P18), the average demand is approximately 109 units. However, given the most recent jump to 152 and the high variance observed (std dev ~27), I will use the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Setting L=4 (promised) as it remains reliable. The goal is to ensure the base stock (calculated over L+1=5 periods) accounts for the recent demand surge while acknowledging the high inventory already in transit (339 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand from P10-P18 is ~109 units, showing higher volatility and occasional peaks above 130. Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $700.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, there was a massive demand spike (238 units), which is the highest observed so far and significantly exceeds the recent average of ~109. This has resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The Carry-over Insights already noted a trend of increasing demand and higher volatility. Due to this recent surge, I am shifting from using the overall mean to a more reactive approach to prevent further lost sales during what appears to be a high-demand period. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focusing on the last 10 periods (N=10), which captures the upward shift and increased variance seen from Period 10 onwards. The lead time (L) remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods, so 'default' (promised lead time) is appropriate. The backend's base-stock logic will use these parameters to determine the order needed to replenish the pipeline and cover the forecasted demand over (L+1) periods, adjusted for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected at Period 19 (238 units), the highest historical value, indicating a potential regime shift or a period of extreme volatility; previous mean was ~109.

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 21. History confirms a stable lead time (L) of 4 periods. The demand in Period 19 was an extreme outlier (238), while Period 20 returned to 94. Because the Period 19 spike heavily influences recent averages and volatility, I am using recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this increased risk without over-committing to the outlier. Using N=11 (P10 to P20) covers the higher-demand regime starting from P10 while including the extreme volatility recent events have introduced. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with significant pipeline inventory (552 units), so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock level considering this pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has spiked significantly (Period 19 reaching 238); while Period 20 demand (94) suggests Period 19 might be an outlier, the overall variance in the regime starting Period 10 has increased.

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history has been highly volatile, characterized by a massive spike in Period 19 (238 units) and subsequent stockouts due to high demand and lead-time delays. Demand in Period 19, 20, and 21 were 238, 94, and 136 respectively. The mean demand for the 'current regime' starting Period 10 is approx 115 units per period, but the spike suggests we need a higher safety margin to avoid repeated lost sales (lost sales occurred in Periods 19, 20, and 21). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant in-transit quantities, I will use recent_N (N=12, covering the regime change since Period 10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the increased mean and heightened volatility while smoothing the outlier from P19. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the higher average and the risk of spikes.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a notable increase in both level and volatility. Demand in the last four periods (P19-P22) has been 238, 94, 136, and 179, averaging approximately 161.75 units. This is significantly higher than the previous stabilized mean of ~109. Additionally, we are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand inventory has been 0 for the last four periods), indicating that the pipeline inventory is currently insufficient to meet these higher demand spikes. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and recent trend, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods and mu_hat to cover a window of the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent upward shift in mean demand. Sigma_hat is also set to a recent window (N=4) to account for the increased variance seen in recent periods, particularly following the outlier-like peak of 238.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: Mean demand from P19-P22 is ~162 units, significantly up from the previous ~109 (+48%), with sustained high volatility.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we are managing the 'chips(Regular)' SKU with a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0. Analysis of the game history confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (as consistently observed from Period 5 through Period 23). The demand regime changed significantly around Period 19. The mean demand for the last five periods (P19-P23) is approximately 155.8 units (238, 94, 136, 179, 132), with significantly higher volatility (standard deviation ~54). Although Period 19 was a massive spike (238), following periods have remained elevated relative to the pre-Period 19 average (~109). We currently have 23 units on-hand and 675 units in transit (orders from P20-P23). Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Using the last 5 samples (N=5) captures this higher demand regime and its increased variance. This approach ensures we maintain a high service level given the $4/unit profit while managing the $1 holding cost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted starting around Period 19, with the last 6 periods (P19-P24) averaging approximately 151.3 units (238, 94, 136, 179, 132, 131), significantly higher than the previous stabilization around 109 units. Although the extreme peak of 238 in Period 19 influenced this, the subsequent 5 periods have sustained an average of 134 units with continued high volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 94 and a massive in-transit pipeline of 658 units (P21: 134, P22: 76, P23: 263, P24: 185), the pipeline is likely over-saturated relative to the current demand mean. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat captures the higher mean and volatility of this new regime. Setting L to the confirmed 4 periods ensures the base stock calculation covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand mean from Period 19-24 is ~151 units (previously ~109), representing a sustained +38% shift despite high volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 19, with the average demand from Period 19 to 25 being approximately 147.8 units, compared to the previous average of 109. This shift is sustained despite high volatility (e.g., P19 reaching 238). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 103 and a large pipeline of 625 (orders from P22-P25), the system needs to maintain a target base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the review period (1). Using a recent_N window of 7 periods (P19-P25) captures this higher mean and the increased volatility observed in this new regime, allowing the OR backend to set a safety stock that reflects current risks while managing the high pipeline inventory. The high pipeline is likely a response to the stockouts between P19-P22, and the parameters now aim to stabilize this.

Daily Reward (R_t): $516.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 19. While the peak of 238 units in Period 19 was an outlier, the subsequent periods (P20-P26) have settled into a higher mean compared to the pre-P19 period. Specifically, the average demand from Period 19 to 26 is approximately 146.75 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With only 40 units on-hand and high demand levels, maintaining a robust pipeline is essential. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering P19-P26) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher demand level and its increased volatility, while keeping L at the calculated historical average of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 19-26 is established at a higher mean of approximately 147 units (vs ~109 previously), with sustained high volatility.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 19 and has stabilized at a higher mean with significant volatility. Analyzing Period 19 to Period 27, the mean demand is approximately 149.2 units per period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 134, and in-transit inventory is 513 (covering orders from Periods 24-27). To manage the current regime (N=9, from Period 19-27), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=9. This captures the higher average and the increased variance required to maintain service levels for this SKU. Lead time L is set to 'default' as it remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 19-27 is stable at a mean of ~149 units (previously ~109), reflecting a sustained high-demand phase with significant volatility.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 19 and has stabilized at a higher mean of approximately 144 units over the last 10 periods (P19-P28), compared to the previous mean of ~109. Individual period demands are highly volatile, ranging from 94 to 238, necessitating a higher sigma_hat to maintain service levels. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all historical arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 213, with 505 units in-transit (P25: 101, P26: 100, P27: 127, P28: 177). I will use a recent window of N=10 to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, and keep L at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 19-28 is stable at a mean of ~144 units (previously ~109), reflecting a sustained high-demand phase with significant volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $466.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 19 has established a higher mean with significant volatility. The last 11 samples (P19-P29) have a mean of approximately 145.5 units. Period 29 demand was 156, following a slightly lower demand in Period 28 (106). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With stock on-hand at 158 and a large in-transit pipeline of 489 units, the immediate priority is to maintain the service level for the (L+1) horizon while ensuring we don't over-order given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0). Using N=11 for mu_hat correctly captures the current high-demand regime. Using N=11 for sigma_hat captures the increased volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 40) since the shift at Period 19. Setting L to 'calculate' allows the engine to use the consistent 4-period lead time observed in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P19-P29 is stable at a mean of ~145.5 units (standard deviation ~40), confirming a sustained high-demand phase with significant volatility.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime starting from Period 19. The mean demand from Period 19 to Period 30 is approximately 147.7 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 40 units. Most recently, P30 demand was 171. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 87 and a significant pipeline of 546 units, the current priority is to maintain the service level while accounting for the high volatility (sigma). I will use the last 12 periods (P19-P30) to define the current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This N=12 capture the shift and recent volatility effectively.

Daily Reward (R_t): $441.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 19. Over the range P19-P31, the mean demand is approximately 144 units per period (P19: 238, P20: 94, P21: 136, P22: 179, P23: 132, P24: 131, P25: 125, P26: 139, P27: 169, P28: 106, P29: 156, P30: 171, P31: 131). While Period 19 was an extreme outlier, the subsequent demand has consistently remained higher than the early-game average of ~100. I will use recent_N with N=13 to capture this entire high-demand regime for mu_hat. Volatility remains high, so I will also use N=13 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance since Period 19. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods, which is consistently confirmed by arrival data (e.g., P27 order arrived on P31). Total logic: Base stock must cover 5 periods (L+1) of high demand (~720 units) to account for current inventory and arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P19-P31 is established at a mean of ~144 units with high volatility (Std Dev ~38), representing a sustained shift from the earlier mean of ~109.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a higher level since Period 19. Calculating the statistics for the most recent regime (P19-P32, N=14), the average demand is approximately 145.5 units per period with a standard deviation of 40.5. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods (L=4). To account for the lead time and the current period's demand (L+1=5), I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=14. Sigma_hat is also set using the same window (N=14) to capture the sustained high volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers 5 periods of demand at the current 91% service level (calculated from Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)). Current on-hand (102) and in-transit (543) are being monitored; no missing shipments are currently detected as the P28 order arrived on schedule in P32.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 19 remains stable with a mean of approximately 144 units and significant volatility (std dev ~40). The most recent demand (P33: 137, P32: 158, P31: 131) aligns with this 'high-demand' phase. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 50 units on-hand and a lead time of 4, we need to ensure the pipeline inventory (618 units) plus new orders cover 5 periods of demand (current + lead time). Using recent_N with N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this current regime (P19-P33) effectively. L is set to calculated as the actual lead time of 4 is very stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P19-P33 is stable at a mean of ~145 units with high volatility (Std Dev ~39). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 19 remains stable with a mean of approximately 145 units and significant volatility (Standard Deviation ~39). Recent demand observations (P30: 171, P31: 131, P32: 158, P33: 137, P34: 162) support this, averaging 151.8 over the last 5 periods. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With only 45 units on hand and a high target service level (implied by the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost), parameters are set to cover the (L+1) period demand horizon using the established regime data (P19-P34). I will use N=16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full scope of this higher-demand, high-volatility regime.

The demand regime established around Period 19 remains stable with a mean of approximately 144-145 units and significant volatility (Std Dev ~38-40). Recent demand in Periods 34 and 35 was 162 and 132 respectively, consistent with this phase. Lead time is reliably 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P31 order in P35. Based on this sustained regime (P19-P35, 17 periods), I will use recent_N with N=17 to capture the relevant mean and variance for the OR backend, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the high demand and volatility of the current phase.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 19 remains stable. Analyzing demand from Period 19 to Period 36, the mean is approximately 144.5 units with a standard deviation of roughly 36.6. Recent demand (P34-P36: 162, 132, 121) aligns with this sustained regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 93 and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 582, the system is well-buffered. The OR parameters are set to reflect this stable but volatile high-demand regime, using N=18 (P19 to P36) to capture the full current regime's statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5) while the cap prevents excessive over-ordering given the large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $527.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 19 remains stable with a mean of approximately 144-146 units and significant volatility (Standard Deviation ~39). Recent demand samples (P34-P37) are 162, 132, 121, 156, which are consistent with this high-demand phase. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods, with the P33 order arriving exactly on time in Period 37. On-hand inventory is 97 and in-transit is 535, totaling 632 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. The current pipeline (632 units) covers about 4.4 periods of mean demand (632 / 144), which is slightly below the target of 5. To account for the high volatility (SD ~39) and maintain service levels given the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=19 (covering the regime from P19 to P37) to capture this specific sustained demand level and its variance while filtering out earlier low-demand phases.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P19-P37 is stable at a mean of ~145 units with high volatility (Std Dev ~39). Lead time consistency at 4 periods is reinforced by the P33 arrival in P37.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 19 remains stable, with current period observations reinforcing a mean of approximately 144-145 units and significant volatility (std dev ~38-40). Period 38 conclude data shows a demand of 147, which is very close to this mean. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, confirmed most recently by the arrival of the Period 33 order in Period 37 and the Period 34 order in Period 38. With on-hand inventory at 81 units and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 561 units (covering orders from periods 35, 36, 37, and 38), the goal is to maintain the base stock level required for a lead time of 4. I will continue using recent_N (N=20) to capture the higher demand regime that started at Period 19, which now has 20 samples available (P19-P38). This N value allows the backend to accurately reflect both the current mean and the elevated volatility observed in this phase.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 19, with a mean of approximately 146 units and significant volatility (Standard Deviation ~39). Recent demand in Period 39 was 185, which is on the higher end of the distribution. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods, as seen in the recent arrival of the Period 35 order in Period 39. Inventory levels are currently tight (on-hand 61), but a substantial in-transit pipeline (542) exists. To address the confirmed regime shift while accounting for high volatility, I will use lead time L=4 and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 21 periods (P19-P39) to prioritize the current regime's statistics. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while maintaining a sufficient service level despite the high variance.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 19 remains the dominant pattern, with a mean demand of approximately 144-145 units and significant volatility. Recent demand (P37: 156, P38: 147, P39: 185, P40: 154) continues to align with this high-demand phase, averaging 160.5 units over the last 4 periods, which is slightly higher than the regime average. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, with the P36 order arriving in P40 as expected. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (33), while in-transit inventory is high (611), covering the next 4 periods of lead time. To ensure optimal inventory levels given the slightly elevated recent demand and high volatility (Std Dev ~39), I will use the established regime (N=22, from P19 to P40) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR engine accounts for the sustained shift in demand magnitude and variance since Period 19.

The Lead Time is consistently confirming at 4 periods, as validated by the arrival of the Period 37 order in Period 41. I will use N=22 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to cover the entire stable regime starting from Period 19 (P19-P41), which provides the most robust statistical basis for current parameters. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), effectively targeting coverage for the expected demand mean and variance while managing the service level vs. holding cost trade-off.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 19 remains stable with a mean of approximately 144-145 units and high volatility (Std Dev ~39). Recent demand in Period 42 was 190 units, leading to a stockout (on-hand inventory is 0). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand at 0 and significant pending in-transit inventory (574 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of average demand), the goal is to maintain the base stock level to satisfy the high service level (80% critical ratio) while accounting for the current stockout. I will use a recent_N of 24 (from P19 to P42) to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 19, with a mean demand of approximately 144-145 units and significant volatility (Standard Deviation ~39). Recent demand observations (P41: 119, P42: 190, P43: 116) continue to exhibit high variance around this mean. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods (P39 order arrived in P43). Given the current low on-hand inventory of 30 units and a high pipeline of 628, I will use a window of the last 25 periods (N=25, covering the start of the current regime at P19) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach captures the current regime's higher mean and variance while smoothing out outliers like the 190 demand in P42. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 19. My analysis of the last 26 periods (P19-P44) shows a mean demand of 144.5 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 35.8. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 40 order in Period 44. Currently, the system has 101 units on-hand and 570 units in-transit (orders from P41, P42, P43, P44). To maintain a high service level given the current high volatility and the relatively high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N where N=26 to capture this entire stabilized high-demand regime. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that sufficiently covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

With 85 units on hand and 535 in transit (orders from P42-45), total pipeline inventory is 620 units. To maintain appropriate stock levels given the 4-period lead time plus 1-period review (covering 5 periods of demand), I will set mu_hat based on the last 27 periods (P19-P45) to capture this stable yet volatile high-demand regime. This ensures a service level optimized for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while accounting for recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P19-P45 is stable at a mean of ~147 units with high volatility (Std Dev ~40). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 19 remains stable with a mean of approximately 147 units and a standard deviation of about 40. Period 46 concluded with zero on-hand inventory due to an arrival of only 79 units (ordered Period 42) which was insufficient to meet the demand of 172. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 630 units, covering the next several periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given we are at Period 47 of 50, and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 51 (after the game ends). However, to maintain the inventory position for the remaining periods (47, 48, 49, 50), I will continue to use parameters reflecting the current stable regime. I'll use N=28 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations (capturing Periods 19-46) to provide the most accurate estimate for this high-demand, high-volatility phase.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 19 remains stable with a mean of approximately 147 units and significant volatility (Standard Deviation ~40). This is consistent through Period 47. Lead time is reliably confirmed at 4 periods, as evidencd by the arrival of the Period 43 order in Period 47. We are in the final stages of the simulation (Period 48 of 50). Since the promised lead time is 4, any order placed now will arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4), which is past the end of the simulation. However, the OR backend utilizes these parameters to manage current state and existing pipeline inventory. I will use N=29 for the demand regime starting at Period 19 to capture the current mean and volatility accurately.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 19, with a mean demand of approximately 147 units and a standard deviation of about 40. For Period 49, the game is nearing its end (Period 50). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, which is also the promised lead time. Inventory levels (On-hand: 36, In-transit: 621) are high relative to demand, but since the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (P49) would arrive in Period 53, which is beyond the game's end at Period 50. However, the OR backend logic requires parameters to manage the current pipeline. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 30 periods (N=30, back to Period 19) to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime. L is set to 'default' as it matches the observed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $620.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 19 remains stable with a mean of approximately 147 units and significant volatility (standard deviation ~40). The last three periods (P47-P49) show demand of 159, 142, and 166, which is consistent with this high-demand regime. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 45 order in Period 49. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but a large pipeline (in-transit) of 642 units is expected to cover most demand in the lead time window. I will continue using the high-demand regime (starting Period 19, N=31) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure sufficient base stock to cover demand during the lead time and the review period (L+1=5) while accounting for the established volatility.
