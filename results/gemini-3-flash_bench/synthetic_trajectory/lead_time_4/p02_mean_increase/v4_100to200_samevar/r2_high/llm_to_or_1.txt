Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 4. There is no historical data available yet to infer actual lead time or demand patterns beyond the provided samples. Initial demand samples show a mean of 91 and standard deviation of 31.6. In Period 1, we must place an order to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since we have no on-hand or in-transit inventory, the OR backend will calculate the base stock level. I will use the 'default' method for L (L=4), and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat which will use all available samples to set the initial safety stock and order quantity.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 143 units. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, this order is currently in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 (visible at start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is 0, and we lost 83 units of demand in Period 1 because the game starts with 0 inventory. The historical demand data provided (5 samples) shows: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96. Mean = 91, Std Dev \u2248 31.06. Period 1's actual demand was 83, which is close to the mean. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean of 91, expected demand over lead time + review period is ~455 units. Currently, only 143 units are in-transit. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'default' method to capture the 5-sample stats, and keep L at the promised 'default' of 4.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Initial demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of 104 units over the first two periods (83 and 125). No stock has arrived yet, which is expected given the promised lead time of 4 periods (orders from P1 are expected to arrive in Period 5 and be visible in Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 279 units in transit from orders placed in P1 and P2. To ensure sufficient coverage for the (L+1) window (5 periods total), I am setting mu_hat to cover a forecast of approximately 100 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' for demand to stay responsive to these early samples, while keeping the lead time 'L' as the promised default since no lead time shifts have been observed yet.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Consequently, the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution Phase) and will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, all demand (Periods 1-3) has been lost because on-hand inventory is 0. Total units in transit are 416 (143+136+137). Historical demand samples are [105, 36, 108, 110, 96]. Note: The 'demand' reported in the conclude messages (83, 125, 107) differs from the historical data provided in the prompt; I will prioritize the provided sample statistics for the forecast. The average demand across the 5 provided samples is 91. Since lead time hasn't been confirmed yet, I will use the promised lead time of 4. To ensure we recover from the current stockout and cover the lead time pipeline, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the mean and standard deviation of all provided samples, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, we expect it to arrive during Period 5 (the current period) and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no stock has arrived yet, leading to lost sales. Historical demand samples (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) show an average of 91 units per period. Using all 5 samples (N=5) for mu_hat captures the current volatility (std approx 31) while we wait for the first delivery to confirm the actual lead time. L is set to default (4) as we have not yet seen a concluded delivery to suggest otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $957.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Promised lead time is 4. Period 1's order arrived exactly on schedule in Period 5 (L=4). Orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5 are currently in transit (total 417 units). On-hand inventory is 88. Historical demand for periods 1-5 shows a mean of 91.2 and a standard deviation of 26.2. There is no clear seasonal trend yet, so I will use 'default' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters using all 5 available samples (N=5) to reflect the recent baseline. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5 periods). Current pipeline inventory (417) + on-hand (88) = 505 units, which is roughly 5.5 periods of average demand, suggesting we are well-positioned for the immediate future.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (ordered P1, arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2076.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by the arrivals in Period 5 (ordered P1) and Period 6 (ordered P2). Demand for chips(Regular) has shown some variance but remains relatively stable around a mean of 95.8 units (samples: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96 from the user prompt history; 83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115 from the game history). Combining all 11 available samples, the average is approximately 93.3 units. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), a high service level is required. The pipeline inventory (330 units) represents orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using all available data (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides the most stable statistical foundation at this early stage, as no clear demand regime shift is yet evident.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1954.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have observed that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the available samples (Periods 1-7) shows a mean of approximately 97 units per period. The demand appears relatively stable with moderate variance (standard deviation ~23). The current lead time (L=4) requires the system to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the stability of the demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most accurate recent behavior. Current on-hand inventory is 136 and in-transit is 320, which is enough to cover near-term demand while the next arrivals (ordered in Periods 4 and 5) are expected soon. Setting L to the promised 4 periods remains appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $853.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of 'conclude' messages confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (Orders from P1-P4 arrived in P5-P8). Current on-hand is 211, and in-transit is 308 (Orders from P5, P6, P7, P8). Historical demand shows significant fluctuations: P1-P4 had a higher mean (~100), while P5 and P8 had lower demand (~55), and P6, P7 were ~112. The mean demand over 8 periods is approximately 92. Since there is no clear seasonal trend yet or a persistent regime shift, I will use all available samples (N=8) to estimate demand. The lead time (L) is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 samples (recent_N=8) will provide a balanced forecast for the next 5 periods (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1856.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from orders in P1 through P5). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some fluctuations but remains relatively stable around an average of 93 units per period (all 9 samples). The service level target is high (q \u2248 0.95 due to $19 profit vs $1 holding cost). Current on-hand inventory is 120, with 335 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). Since the promised lead time of 4 is being met precisely, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' (all historical samples) as there is no clear evidence of a sustained regime shift yet, ensuring we account for the variability seen across the first 9 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1031.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as evidenced by orders from Periods 1 through 6 arriving exactly 4 periods later. Demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate fluctuations. Analyzing the demand from the last 10 periods (including initial samples and game history): 105, 36, 108, 110, 96, 83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115, 110, 56, 104, 60. The mean demand across these 15 samples is approximately 90.4 units. Since the lead time is stable at 4, I will use the 'default' method for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent demand volatility and mean, which allows the OR engine to adapt to the recent average demand of 88.1 units per period and its associated standard deviation.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by all completed arrivals (Periods 5-11), where orders placed in Periods 1-7 arrived exactly 4 periods later. Demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate fluctuations with no clear trend or seasonal shift yet. Since the start of the game, demand has averaged approximately 93.75 units per period. I will use the default lead time (4) and the mean demand from all samples to set mu_hat. Given the target service level (q = 19 / (19+1) = 0.95), the base stock calculated by the OR engine using current statistics should sufficiently cover demand over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I'll use all available samples (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full variance observed so far.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the item 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand data (including the original samples and the 12 periods of recorded history) fluctuates around a mean of approximately 94 units (latest sample mean) with a standard deviation around 25. Specifically, the mean demand of the last 12 periods is approximately 93.6. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been stable at 4. For demand forecasting, I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full range of observed behavior since game start, as there is no specific seasonal signal or regime shift detected yet. This will set a base stock level that covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand, balancing the high profit margin ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1). Current inventory (On-hand 133 + In-transit 298 = 431) is being monitored against the 5-period demand expectation (~470 units).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 88 units with 388 units in-transit. The game history consistently shows a lead time of 4 periods (matches promised). Analysis of demand from Period 1 to 13 shows a mean of approximately 93.3 units per period (Std Dev ~23.5). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality as demand fluctuates within a consistent range (55-125). Expected arrivals for the next few periods (from orders in P10, P11, P12, P13) are 105, 47, 106, and 130 respectively. Since the lead time is stable at 4, L remains default. I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat as the demand variance is stable and the full sample size (13 periods) provides a robust baseline for the OR engine to calculate the cycle stock and safety stock required to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable across the 14 periods of history. Calculating the mean demand from Period 1 to 14, we get approximately 92 units per period. The lead time (L) has consistently been 4 periods as observed in the concluded history. I will set L to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time. For mu_hat, I will use a conservative estimate based on the historical mean demand (92) multiplied by (1+L), which is (1+4) * 92 = 460. Since the demand shows some variability (standard deviation is roughly 22 across the whole period), using the 'default' sigma_hat calculation (which uses all samples) is appropriate to ensure a sufficient safety stock without incurring excessive holding costs. The in-transit inventory is currently 363 units, which combined with 74 on-hand units gives a pipeline of 437, slightly below my target base stock of 460+ safety stock.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without significant regime shifts. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals from Period 5 through Period 15 (all observed arrivals had a lead time of 4). At Period 16, we have 433 units in transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, P15) and 8 units on hand. The average demand across all 15 observed periods is approximately 93 units. With a lead time L=4, the pipeline should ideally cover demand for L+1=5 periods. My current inventory position (on-hand 8 + in-transit 433 = 441) covers approximately 4.7 periods of average demand. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover the review period and lead time. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will target a high service level. Since no significant demand shifts or lead time variations are present, using 'calculate' for lead time and 'default' (all-sample mean) for demand parameters is the most stable and statistically sound approach.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2166.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked significantly to 229 units, compared to the previous average of approx. 98. This spike resulted in 115 lost sales and an ending on-hand inventory of 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand at 0 and current in-transit at 452 (orders from P13-P16), the system is vulnerable to further stockouts if this spike represents a new regime or a temporary surge. Analyzing the full history (16 periods) plus the seed data (5 periods), the overall mean demand is approx. 98. However, recent demand (last 5 periods) shows an upward trend (85, 119, 113, 229), averaging 136.5. To protect against recent volatility and the recent spike, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to increase the base stock level. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased standard deviation from the P16 outlier. L is set to default (promised 4) as arrivals have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected at Period 16: demand surged to 229 (2.3x historical average), causing immediate stockout.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Demand for the last two periods was 229 and 243, significantly higher than the previous average (~95). This has resulted in immediate stockouts (on-hand is 0). We must update our mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new reality to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to cover this increased demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 547, and the OR backend needs parameters that account for the L+1 (5 periods) of demand. I will use recent_N (N=2) to capture this surge for the forecast, though the backend constraints on N (min 3) will naturally pull in one more historical point and smooth it slightly, but this is the most aggressive way to respond to the shift.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed: Period 16-17 demand averaged 236 units vs previous average of 95 (+148%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1520.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a significantly higher regime since Period 16. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P16-P18) is 219.7 units, compared to the pre-P16 average of approximately 95 units. This surge has depleted all on-hand inventory, resulting in stockouts for the last three periods (P16, P17, P18). The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Given the high criticality (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), we must aggressively increase the base stock level to cover the (L+1) window of demand (5 periods). The OR backend calculates mu_hat as (1+L) * mean, so we set N=3 to capture the recent surge (mean \u2248 220) while avoiding dilution from earlier low-demand periods. For sigma_hat, N=3 will reflect the increased volatility associated with the higher demand volume.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The average demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) is approximately 216 units, compared to the historical average of roughly 95. This surge has resulted in zero ending inventory for four consecutive periods (P16-P19), indicating significant lost sales. To address this, mu_hat must be set based on this new regime. Using recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this shift. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns (P15 order arrived at P19). The current In-transit inventory is high (931 units) due to aggressive ordering in recent periods (225 in P17, 313 in P18, 268 in P19) to compensate for the surge, but since on-hand is 0, we must maintain a high base stock to ensure service levels once the pipeline clears.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2375.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 21. A major demand regime shift occurred around Period 16, with demand increasing from an average of ~95 to ~212 (last 5 periods: 229, 243, 187, 205, 194). This change triggered zero on-hand inventory since Period 16 because pre-surge orders were insufficient. The lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock must cover 5 periods (1+L) of demand. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the new surge average (avg=211.6, so mu_hat approx 1058). Given the significant increase in variance since the surge, I will use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat as well to ensure the service level is protected during this volatile period. The in-transit inventory is high (1047) but consists of orders placed before or during the ramp-up; the backend will determine if the current gap (base_stock - pipeline) necessitates further ordering up to the cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher level: Periods 16-20 average demand is 211.6 units (+122% vs initial baseline).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3255.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand from Period_1 to Period_15 was approximately 97 units, while the average demand from Period_16 to Period_21 is 205.3 units (sample: 229, 243, 187, 205, 194, 174). This represents a sustained increase of over 100%. The system successfully received the large order from Period 17 (225 units) in Period 21, confirming the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. However, the in-transit pipeline (921 units) contains high-volume orders placed during the stockout period (P18: 313, P19: 268, P20: 241, P21: 99). These units will begin arriving from Period 22 through Period 25. To avoid excessive overstocking while maintaining the new service level, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (the new regime length) to reflect the mean of ~205. L is set to calculated as the lead time of 4 is consistent. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher demand floor while the OR backend's inventory-minus-pipeline logic prevents massive over-ordering now that the pipeline is full.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from a mean of approximately 95 units to a higher mean of approximately 211.6 units. This surge initially caused several periods of stockouts until the pipeline of larger orders began arriving in Period 21. Currently, in Period 23, on-hand inventory is 137 units following the arrival of a 313-unit order from Period 18. The lead time (L) has consistently been 4 periods as promised. To maintain a service level consistent with a profit-to-cost ratio of 19:1 (approx. 95%), I am setting parameters based on the most recent 7 samples (Periods 16-22) to capture this 'high demand' regime. Specifically, using N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend targets the new (1+L) period demand (expected ~1050 units) while accounting for the increased volatility (std dev has risen along with the mean). This strategy balances the higher holding cost risk against the high penalty of stockouts in the new regime.

The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16. In the new regime (P16-P23), the average demand is approximately 208.4 units per period (compared to 95 units in P1-P15). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to use the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this higher demand level, setting N=8 to cover the entirety of the new regime. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the actual demand of ~208 units per period, while the lead time L=4 (covering 5 periods of demand) ensures sufficient 'pipeline' to meet the current demand trend. The high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) justifies a high service level, which 'recent_N' with N=8 will provide by accurately modeling the new mean and variance.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~95 to ~210 units. Since Period 16, demand has consistently stayed in a higher range: 229, 243, 187, 205, 194, 174, 227, 206, and 189 (9 samples). The average for this new regime (P16-P24) is approximately 206 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this stabilized higher demand for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, N=9 will also be used to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level. Lead time 'L' remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (Periods 5-24 all consistent with L=4). Recent on-hand inventory (251) and large in-transit (687) suggest we are recovering from the stockouts seen in Periods 16-20.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted from approximately 95 units to 211 units starting at Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 21-25), demand has stabilized at an average of 193.4 units (174, 227, 206, 189, 171), slightly lower than the initial peak of the surge but still significantly higher than the baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory (179) and total in-transit (764) are now reconciling well with the higher demand, I will focus on maintaining the service level for this current regime. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift while maintaining enough historical variance to handle the volatility seen in Periods 16-18. The OR backend will use these values to calculate a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) period cycle (current period + 4 period lead time).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted from an average of ~95 units to ~200 units starting at Period 16. Analyzing the recent stabilization (Periods 21-26), the mean demand is 193.8 units (174, 227, 206, 189, 171, 196). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 134 and a large pipeline of 772 units (covering roughly 3.9 periods of future demand at the current rate), I will focus on maintaining the base stock level to satisfy the higher demand regime. I am using recent_N=6 to capture the most recent stabilized demand behavior after the initial surge. Using this recent window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock for this new volatility and mean.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16, increasing from a baseline mean of approximately 95 to a new average of approximately 201 over the last 12 periods (P16-P27). Demand remains stabilized at this higher level with moderate volatility. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages (e.g., Period 27 confirms Period 23 order arrived with L=4). Pipeline inventory is healthy (673 units) relative to recent orders. Since the demand regime changed 12 periods ago (P16 to P27), I will use recent_N with N=12 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory targets reflect the new, higher demand level (approx. 200/period) and the observed volatility of this period. L is set to 'calculate' as historical lead times have been consistent.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~95 units to ~203 units (based on the average of the last 13 periods, P16-P28). The demand remains stable within this new higher regime with low volatility relative to the mean. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent and accurate as evidenced by recent arrivals (P28 conclude confirms P24 order arrival). I will set L to 4 (promised) and use recent_N=13 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the earlier low-demand data. This ensures the base stock reflects current consumption rates and maintains an appropriate service level without excessive holding costs.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16. Since Period 16, demand has stabilized at a higher level, averaging 204.6 units per period (P16-P29). The initial baseline (P1-P15) was much lower, averaging 95.7 units. The lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. To optimize for this higher demand while accounting for the lead time (L=4), I will use the last 14 samples (starting from the shift at P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the relevant demand statistics for the current regime to set the base-stock level and order quantity properly to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 16, increasing from an initial mean of ~100 to a new stable mean of approximately 201 units (average of Periods 16-30). Lead time has remained consistent at the promised 4 periods. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (q=0.95), necessitating a base stock that covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture this higher demand regime for both mu_hat (expected demand over 5 periods) and sigma_hat (volatility). This ensures the OR backend adjusts the base stock to the current sustained demand levels while maintaining a buffer against stockouts.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained at a higher level. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 31 is approximately 205.1 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~95. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we are in a stockout situation as of Period 31 conclude. To address this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 16 samples (Period 16-31) to capture the current high-demand regime accurately. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the (L+1) = 5 period risk window at the new demand mean. The profit/holding cost ratio ($19/$1) suggests a high optimal service level, which the OR engine will manage using these updated parameters.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 to ~205 units per period. This higher demand level has stabilized over the last 17 periods (P16-P32). In Period 31 and 32, we observed particularly high demand (260 and 241), which has exhausted on-hand inventory (currently 1 unit). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the demand regime is now stable at this higher level, I will use recent_N (N=17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific regime without noise from the pre-P16 data. This will ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current ~205 unit/period expectation and associated volatility, helping to recover from the near-stockout state while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~95 to a stabilized higher level. Focusing on the last 18 periods (P16 to P33), the average demand is 211.9 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27.6. Recently, demand has shown even higher volatility with a peak of 260 in P31. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all historical arrivals. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (12 units), making the system highly dependent on in-transit arrivals (the P30 order of 163 units is due this period). To ensure adequate service levels during this high-demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=18) for demand parameters to capture the post-shift behavior while smoothing out recent spikes. The OR backend will compute the base stock using L=4, mu_hat = (1+4) * 211.9 = 1059.5, and sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 27.6 = 61.7, which aligns with covering the lead time plus the review period during this stable high-demand phase.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a second high-level regime since Period 16, following the initial jump. Over the calculation window from Period 16 to Period 34, demand has averaged approximately 213 units per period. In the most recent four periods (P31-P34), demand has remained high (260, 241, 229, 190), averaging 230 units. We are currently facing a stockout (on-hand: 0) at the start of Period 35, following a demand of 190 in P34 which exceeded the sum of on-hand inventory and the P30 arrival. Since the actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, I am setting L to 'default' (which is the promised 4 periods). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using a recent_N window of 19 periods (Period 16 to 34) to capture the stabilized high-demand regime while excluding the distinct early-game low-demand phase. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the current 210+ magnitude demand while accounting for recent volatility to maintain service levels.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 16, increasing from ~95 units to ~205 units per period. Since Period 31, demand has slightly edged higher, averaging 212 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 31-35). The inventory position is currently strained with 0 on-hand, though a large pipeline of 934 units is in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), I am setting mu_hat using the last 20 samples (N=20) to fully capture the current high-demand regime since Period 16, while using a smaller window for sigma_hat (N=10) to capture recent volatility. L is set to default as the promised 4-period lead time is consistently met.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~100 to ~205 units per period. Recent demand (last 21 periods since the shift) has maintained this higher level with moderate volatility. For Period 37, I am using 'recent_N' with N=21 to capture the statistics of this new regime (Period 16 to Period 36). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which is consistently confirmed by recent arrivals (e.g., Period 32 order arrived Period 36). Current inventory status (On-hand: 98, In-transit: 887) is healthy, but because lead time is 4 periods and demand is high (~200/period), the pipeline must be maintained to avoid future stockouts, especially as we approach the final periods of the game. Using recent_N ensures the OR backend uses the updated mean (~206) and standard deviation (~31) rather than the lower values from the start of the game.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 205 units per period. The recent demand (Period 16 to Period 37) shows a consistent mean around this level, approximately double the initial baseline. Actual lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals). Based on the current status at Period 38, we have 147 units on hand and 774 units in-transit (reflecting orders from P34-P37). Since we are in a stabilized regime, I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the current demand mean (\u03bc) and variance (\u03c3) accurately, which reflects the behavior since the last changepoint. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1 periods) is aligned with the ~205/period demand while accounting for the moderate demand volatility seen in this regime.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level since Period 16, averaging 202.9 units over the last 23 periods (P16-P38). The most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) show a slightly lower but consistent mean of 185.2 units, suggesting a potential minor cooling from the peak of the surge, though still significantly above the initial baseline of ~95. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The inventory position is currently healthy with 218 units on-hand and 704 units in-transit. To maintain optimal service levels given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a ~95% service level), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the sustained higher demand mean while remaining responsive to the slight recent softening. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=15 to reflect the current volatility of this higher demand regime.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable at the higher level established around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 24 periods (Period 16 to Period 39), the average demand is approximately 205.5 units per period. The standard deviation over this same window is approximately 28.1. Lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 35 order in Period 39. Currently, on-hand inventory is 198 units and in-transit inventory is 711 units (orders from P36, P37, P38, P39). Using recent_N helps track the sustained higher demand mean and variance while ignoring the initial low-demand phase (Periods 1-15). N=24 is chosen to capture the entirety of the current high-demand regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a secondary regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 201.8 units over the last 25 periods (P16-P40). Recent demand (P36-P40) suggests a slight softening but remains consistent with the post-spike baseline (averaging 179.8). The lead time remains steady at 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 235 and in-transit at 715, the total pipeline inventory is 950. Using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=25 covers the entire current demand regime since the spike. For sigma_hat, N=25 will capture the volatility of this stabilized high-demand period. These parameters will help the OR backend maintain a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) horizon of roughly 1,000 units (5 * 200), ensuring high service levels while managing holding costs as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) shifted significantly at Period 16 from a historical mean of ~95 to a higher regime. Over the most recent 26 periods (P16-P41), the mean demand has stabilized at 203.2 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 28.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival since Period 5 (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 189 units and in-transit is 734 units (total pipeline 923). Since we are nearing the end of the simulation (Period 42 of 50), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=26 to capture this stabilized higher demand regime accurately while allowing the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock level (L+1 = 5 periods of demand) to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16 and has remained stable at a higher level ever since. For the period range 16-42, the average demand is approximately 204 units. Looking at the last 10 periods (33-42), the average demand is 190.8 units, which suggests a very slight softening or stabilization around 190-200. The lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods throughout the history (e.g., P38 order arrived P42). Currently, on-hand inventory is 169 units, and in-transit is 733 units. The pipeline is healthy, covering approximately 3.8 periods of recent average demand. To maintain the high service level required by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand and sigma, focusing on the last 20 periods to capture the current stable high-demand regime while filtering out the initial low-demand phase. Lead time will remain at 'default' (4 weeks).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable at a higher level since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 201 units over the last 10 periods (P34-P43). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the history (e.g., P39 order arrived P43). Given the current status at Period 44, the inventory position (on-hand 137 + in-transit 733 = 870) needs to cover the demand for the lead time plus the current review period (L+1 = 5 periods). With a target of ~200 units per period, the desired base stock is around 1000 units. To maintain this, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime since Period 16 while smoothing out minor fluctuations. L will be set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is reliable.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable at an average of approximately 201 units per period over the last 15 periods (Periods 30-44). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 6 periods remaining in the simulation (Period 45 to 50), it is critical to ensure enough inventory is ordered to cover the remaining demand while avoiding excessive holding costs or overstocking at the end of the game. On-hand inventory is 153 units, and 754 units are in-transit (orders from P41, P42, P43, P44). The total pipeline plus on-hand (907) is sufficient to cover approximately 4.5 periods of demand. I will use a recent_N of 15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable higher demand regime while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 200 units since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 15 periods (P31-P45), the mean demand is 199.1 units with a standard deviation of 27.6. The lead time remains constant at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 128 units and in-transit is 800 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is critical. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture this stable, high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'default' for L since the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 197 units per period over the last 30 periods (P16-P46). Specifically, the last 15 periods (P32-P46) show a mean of 196.5. This high demand (relative to the initial mean of ~95) requires specialized parameters to maintain a high service level (given the $19 vs $1 profit/holding ratio, which implies a target service level of 95%). The lead time has remained exceptionally stable at 4 periods since the start of the simulation. I will use 'recent_N' for both demand parameters using N=30 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime, and 'default' for lead time as the promised 4 periods is consistently being met. With 4 periods remaining in the simulation after this decision, the 'in-transit' of 797 units (ordered P43-P46) plus current on-hand of 161 should generally cover the end of game demand without excessive holding costs.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 16, with the average demand from Period 16 to 47 being approximately 198 units. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a slight cooling to an average of 185, but still remains significantly above the initial baseline of ~95. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (decision for P48, P49, P50), and a lead time of 4, any order placed now will arrive after the game concludes (Period 52). However, the OR backend requires parameters to calculate the base stock for the current period. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=32 (covering the entire high-demand regime) to ensure a stable estimate, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to capture recent volatility. The L parameter remains 'default' at 4.

Daily Profit: $3059.00, Daily Holding Cost: $236.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2823.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 20 periods (Periods 29-48), the average demand is approximately 192.1 units with a standard deviation of around 27.6 units. This period is P49 out of 50, meaning this is the final ordering opportunity before the simulation ends at P50. Since the lead time is consistently 4 periods, any order placed now (P49) would arrive in Period 53, which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, the primary objective is to manage the current on-hand inventory (236 units) and the significant pipeline (671 units) to maximize profit while minimizing holding costs for the final period. The existing stock (236) is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for P49 (avg ~192). I will set L to 'default' (4) and use the 'recent_N' method (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the established high-demand regime, though the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a zero or minimal order given the high pipeline-to-demand ratio and the proximity to the game's end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3460.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 16 at a higher level than the initial phase. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 49 is approximately 197.8 units, whereas the initial average (Periods 1-15) was around 96.9 units. In the most recent 10 periods (P40-P49), the demand average is 184.8 units with a standard deviation of 20.8, showing a slight cooling compared to the initial surge phase (which peaked around 211). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as seen in the conclusion of Period 49 (arrival of P45 order). With 245 units on hand and 633 in transit, the inventory position is strong. I will use a recent_N (N=20) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stable, high-demand regime while filtering out the noise from the immediate transition period. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current sustained demand volume (~191 units per period over the last 20 periods) and actual lead time (L=4).
