Historical data shows demand around 105 (P1), 36 (P2), 108 (P3), 110 (P4), and 96 (P5). Excluding the outlier in P2 (36), the average demand is roughly 100-105 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive during Period 5 and be available for sale in Period 6. Current on-hand inventory is 0. To cover demand for the lead time (4) plus the arrival period (1) = 5 periods (P1 to P5), with an average demand of ~100 units/period, I need approximately 500 units in the pipeline. Since I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will place an initial order to establish the pipeline. However, P2 showed a significant dip (36), suggesting variance. I'll target a pipeline that covers the next few periods' expected demand while starting to build a buffer.",

Currently, I have 0 on-hand and 600 in-transit (450 from P1 + 150 from P3). d) Inventory & Pipeline: Pipeline = 600.

The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With a lead time of 4, I need to manage inventory to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Total pipeline needed is (5 * 200) + safety stock. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I aim for a healthy safety stock. Current on-hand is 290 and in-transit is 890 (total 1180). Expected arrivals are 250 (P40), 200 (P41), 220 (P42), and 220 (P43). Looking ahead to the end of the game at Period 50: Orders placed now (P44) arrive in P48. Orders placed in P45 arrive P49. Orders placed in P46 arrive P50. Any order placed after P46 will not arrive before the game ends. To maintain the pipeline target of ~1000-1100 units for the next 5 periods while avoiding excessive holding costs as the game nears completion, I will order 200 units.",

On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 351 units. The target inventory for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50) must account for the 4-period lead time. Orders placed now (P45) will arrive in P49. Orders placed in P46 will arrive in P50. Any order placed after P46 will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, I need to ensure the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) covers the total demand for the remaining 6 periods (current P45 + 5 future periods). Total expected demand = 6 * 210 = 1260.

Total inventory scheduled to arrive by P50 (excluding P46 order) is 1077. Since 1077 > 1000, we already have sufficient stock to cover through the end of the game.

  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 200 units per period (recent periods P36-P46 show an average of 188 units). The game is approaching its conclusion (Period 47 of 50). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, meaning any order placed now (Period 47) will arrive in the arrival resolution phase of Period 51 (47 + 4), which is after the final decision period (Period 50). Therefore, any order placed in Period 47 or later will not arrive in time to satisfy demand within the 50-period window. Current on-hand inventory is 440 units. Expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50) at a rate of ~200 units/period is 800 units. My current pipeline consists of On-hand (440) + In-transit (489) = 929 units. Since the in-transit units from P43, P44, P45 (220, 200, 69 units) are scheduled to arrive in periods 47, 48, and 49 respectively, they will contribute to satisfying demand. Total inventory available to satisfy demand through Period 50 is 440 (on-hand) + 220 (P43 order) + 200 (P44 order) + 69 (P45 order) = 929 units. Given the remaining demand is ~800 units, I already have a surplus. Ordering more would only increase holding costs at the end of the game without increasing sales.

Since the game concludes at the end of Period 50, any order placed now (or since Period 47) will never arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence profit within the game's duration.

My current on-hand (481) plus confirmed arrivals in P48 (200) and P49 (69) totals 750 units, which more than covers the maximum possible demand for the remaining two periods.
