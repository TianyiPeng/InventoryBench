OR Analysis: The OR agent recommends 136 units based on the promised lead time (4) and samples. 4.

Actual demand in Period 1 was 83 and Period 2 was 125. The average is approximately 100 units/period. Because on-hand inventory is 0 and arrivals haven't started yet, sales are currently 0. 3.

  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand for the first 15 periods was approximately 93 units, whereas the last three periods (P16-P18) have averaged 220 units (229, 243, 187). We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for the last 4 periods). The OR baseline recommendation of 82 units is based on the historical average and is severely underestimating current demand (~220 units). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. To manage the pipeline, we must account for 5 periods of demand (L+1). Total pipeline inventory is 567 units (orders from P15, P16, P17, P18). P15 (126 units) is expected to arrive this period (P19), P16 (81) in P20, P17 (180) in P21, and P18 (180) in P22. At a demand rate of 220, we require ~1100 units to cover 5 periods. However, the 'capped' nature of the game and the risk of the regime shifting back suggests a aggressive but measured increase. Current pipeline is 567; adding another 180 (matching recent high orders) maintains the inflow to match the new demand mean, while the OR recommendation is ignored as it's tuned to the old regime.",

Total pipeline is 720. 4. **OR Recommendation Critique**: The OR agent recommends 0 units. This is because its 'cap' logic is likely triggered by the high pipeline (720 units) relative to historical global averages, or it hasn't fully weighted the recent demand surge. 5. **Strategy**: With demand at ~212/period and a lead time of 4, the target inventory (covering L+1=5 periods) should be approximately 1,060 units. Current pipeline (720) + on-hand (0) = 720. We are short by ~340 units.

With a current demand average of ~200, these near-term arrivals (180/period) are slightly below expected demand, but total pipeline (720) covers roughly 3.6 periods of demand. 5. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0, likely because the 720 units in transit plus 6 on-hand satisfy its base-stock level calculated across all historical data (which includes low-demand periods P1-P15). 6.

Strategy: I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods (P23, P24, P25, P26, P27).

The total in-transit quantity is 820 units. Since Period 16, demand has shifted significantly upward, averaging 203.6 units over the last 12 periods. The OR recommendation of 0 units is based on unweighted historical demand (including the low-demand Period 1-15 phase) and a capped policy. However, looking at the pipeline: we expect 180 units to arrive this period (P28) and 330 units in P29. With current demand levels (~204 units/period), the 180 arriving now will likely be fully consumed, and the 330 arriving in P29 will cover P29 and partial P30. However, the order from P26 was 0 units, meaning P30 will have 0 arrivals. To prevent a stockout in P31 and P32 (4-5 periods from now), I must order now. A target base stock for 5 periods (L+1) at a 210-unit demand rate is 1050 units. Current pipeline (820) + on-hand (0) = 820 units. Required order = 1050 - 820 = 230 units.

The 10-period average demand is now 207 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Therefore, to protect against stockouts, I need to maintain a pipeline + on-hand inventory sufficient for 5 periods (L+1), which is approximately 1,035 units (207 * 5). Currently, on-hand inventory is 108 units and in-transit is 870 units (composed of orders from P33: 240, P34: 210, P35: 210, P36: 210), totaling 978 units. The OR recommendation of 0 is likely driven by its use of the entire historical dataset (including the low-demand early periods) and a capped policy that doesn't account for the sustained higher floor of the current regime. To reach the target level of 1,035, an order of 57 units would be required. However, considering the recent fluctuation (P36 demand dropped to 150), I will place a slightly more conservative order of 150 units to maintain momentum and buffer against the 4-period lead time without over-investing in holding costs, especially as the game approaches its final stages (Period 37/50).",

The 'In-transit' of 720 covers approximately 4 periods of demand at this current rate. Since the actual lead time is confirmed as 4 periods, order placed now (Period 39) would arrive in Period 43. Current inventory and incoming shipments for Periods 39, 40, 41, and 42 (from orders in P35, P36, P37, P38) appear sufficient. Specifically, we expect arrivals of 210 (P35), 210 (P36), 150 (P37), and 150 (P38). Total supply coming is 720 + 174 = 894.

Recent periods (P35-P40) show stable demand around 150-200. Over the last 5 periods, demand average is approximately 180. 3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: Current on-hand is 228. Pipeline is 600 units.

The OR recommendation of 56 units is based on the entire history (including the low-demand pre-P16 era), which under-forecasts the current regime.

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "1. **Lead-Time Inference**: Confirmed lead time remains 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (Period 45 shows Period 41's order arrived exactly on time). \n2. **Inventory Analysis**: Current on-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 922 units (ordered Periods 42-45). Orders scheduled for Period 46 (from Period 42) totaled 220 units. \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand over the last 10 periods is ~191 units. The game ends at Period 50. Total remaining demand over the horizon (Periods 46-50) is estimated at approximately 955 units (191 * 5).\n4. **Pipeline Evaluation**: Pipeline is 922 units. Arrival in Period 46 (220 units) covers Period 46 demand (~191). Arrival in Period 47 (200 units) covers Period 47 demand. Arrival in Period 48 (202 units) covers Period 48. Arrival in Period 49 (300 units) covers Period 49. \n5. **Final Decision**: The game concludes at Period 50. An order placed now (Period 46) would arrive during Period 50. My current pipeline (922) plus on-hand (0) is very close to the total remaining expected demand (955). Specifically, I need around 30-50 more units to fully cover Period 50 without excess holding cost at the game's end. The OR recommendation is 0, likely because the pipeline is almost equal to the remaining demand. I will order 50 units to ensure coverage for the final period given recent demand volatility.",

Period 47 (Period_47) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The goal is to maximize total reward over the remaining 4 periods (Period 47-50). Current status: On-hand inventory is 72, In-transit is 752. The confirmed lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed today (Period 47) will arrive during Period 51 and thus will NOT be available to satisfy demand within the game's timeframe (ends at Period 50). The pipeline currently consists of: Period 43 order (200 units) arriving in P47, Period 44 order (202 units) arriving in P48, Period 45 order (300 units) arriving in P49, and Period 46 order (50 units) arriving in P50. Total arrivals for the remaining periods (including today's expected arrival) are 752. Given the average demand regime of ~200 units, the total expected demand for periods 47-50 is ~800 units. Total supply available (72 on-hand + 752 in-transit) = 824 units. This is sufficient to cover the remaining game periods without incurring excessive holding costs from further unnecessary ordering. Since Period 47 is the last period where an order could potentially be useful (if lead time was shorter) and we already have sufficient stock coming in for the fixed lead time of 4, I will order a minimal amount to avoid unnecessary holding costs, considering the OR recommendation of 76 is still based on infinite horizon logic.",

Period 50 is the final period of visibility, meaning orders placed now (Period 48) will arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4), which is past the game's horizon. Any inventory arriving after Period 50 will not contribute to profit and would only incur holding costs if they were to contribute to ending inventory within the game window. Currently, we have 93 units on-hand and 602 units in-transit. Specifically, orders from Period 44 (202 units), 45 (300 units), and 46 (50 units) are expected to arrive in Periods 48, 49, and 50 respectively. This totals 552 incoming units before the end of Period 50. Total inventory available to satisfy demand in the remaining three periods (48, 49, 50) is 93 (on-hand) + 552 (arrivals) = 645 units. Given an average demand of ~190 units, total expected demand for the final 3 periods is ~570 units. We already have enough stock to cover this and will likely end with surplus inventory. Therefore, any order placed now is unnecessary and would arrive too late.",

Current on-hand inventory is 134 units, and in-transit inventory is 400 units (ordered in Periods 45, 46, and 47). According to the lead-time logic, the order from Period 45 (300 units) will arrive during Period 49 and be visible in the Period 49 conclude message (read at the start of Period 50). This will bring available inventory to approximately 434 units for the final period (Period 50), which is more than sufficient to cover the average demand of ~200 units.
