Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no history of arrivals or concludes yet, so we cannot verify the actual lead time. The promised lead time is 4. Historical demand for the first 5 samples shows a mean of 91 [(105+36+108+110+96)/5]. Since the current on-hand and in-transit inventory are zero, we must establish a base stock levels to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the review period (1), totaling (L+1)=5 periods. Given that the Profit and Holding Cost are both $1.0, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning the base stock will likely be close to the mean demand over the protection interval. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the initial stats provided.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, 143 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 4. Since the lead time is at least 1, the order placed in Period 1 will arrive during Period 5 at the earliest and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible at Period 6). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales in Period 1 (demand 83, sold 0). The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 91 units per period (105, 36, 108, 110, 96 from user-provided samples, plus 83 from Period 1). Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use the default lead time (4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using all available historical samples (N=6, including Period 1) to ensure the OR backend can establish a base stock that accounts for the current pipeline and high demand variance.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for Periods 1 and 2 was 83 and 125 respectively. The initial training data provided (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) and the observed game history show a mean demand around 94.7 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Periods 1 and 2, we ordered 143 and 136 units (totaling 279 in-transit), but since the lead time is 4, none have arrived yet. Consequently, we have 0 on-hand and are currently losing sales (demand was 83 and 125, but 0 sold). I will use the 'default' method for Lead Time (L=4) as we have no 'conclude' messages yet to suggest otherwise. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (5 from training + 2 from game history = 7 samples) to stabilize the forecast, as demand seems relatively stable around the ~95-100 range.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1-3 are still in transit and are not expected to arrive until Period 5 at the earliest (Arrival Resolution of Period 1+4=5). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts for the first 3 periods. However, this is expected given the lead time. Demand samples are 105, 36, 108, 110, 96 (Note: the user prompt's historical demand data list differs slightly from the game history logs, but I will use the set provided in the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section: [105, 36, 108, 110, 96] for forecasting). The mean demand is approximately 91. The service level q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5, which targets the median. Given we have 422 units in-transit (143+136+143), we are covering the pipeline for the next few periods. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for mu and sigma with N=5 to capture the initial demand profile.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. Therefore, we have seen 0 arrivals so far (up to Period 4 conclude), which is consistent with the promised lead time. Demand history (Periods 1-4) shows a mean of 100.25 (83, 125, 107, 86). However, the supplemental historical demand provided in the prompt for Periods 1-5 (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) differs from the 'Game History' demand. I will prioritize the 'Game History' data for the recent trend while acknowledging the target SKU is a 'Regular' chip with relatively stable demand. Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 521 (the sum of orders from P1-P4: 143+136+143+99=521). I will stick to default lead time and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the observed mean/variance from the game history (N=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-33.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed Period 1) arrived exactly on time in Period 5 (lead_time=4). This confirms the promised lead time is currently accurate. Demand over the first 5 periods has been [83, 125, 107, 86, 55], which averages 91.2 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 26.5. Since the simulation is in its early stages and we only have one confirmed lead time observation, I will use 'default' for L (4 periods). For demand (mu_hat), the average is stable but slightly trending down (P5 was 55); I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full history while staying responsive. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5. The goal is to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With 88 on-hand and 378 in-transit (Total pipeline = 466), and expected demand for 5 periods being roughly 456, the OR backend will calculate the necessary gap to maintain service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical data shows orders from Period 1 and Period 2 arrived exactly in 4 periods (arriving in Period 5 and Period 6 respectively). The current in-transit inventory (242 units) consists of orders from Period 3 (143 units) and Period 4 (99 units), which are expected in Period 7 and Period 8. Demand has been relatively stable, with samples (excluding the initial stockout periods where demand was recorded but sales were 0) showing a mean of approximately 95 units per period (Avg of P1-P6: 83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115). Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. I will use 'calculate' for lead time since the observations match the promise, and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=6 to capture all available data while remaining responsive to the current stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5; P2 order arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-32.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data from Period 5, 6, and 7 confirms an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand has been relatively stable, with recent samples (P1-P7) showing values of 83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115, 110. The average demand across all 7 periods is approx 97.3, and the last 3 periods average 93.3. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend will aim to set the base stock at the median of the demand distribution over the (L+1) period horizon. Pipelines are currently healthy (142 on hand + 224 in transit = 366). I will use recent_N=7 for demand to capture the full available history while acknowledging the stability, and use the default lead time of 4.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. The lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods (as seen in all historical arrivals from P1-P4). The demand history for the last 8 periods is: 83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115, 110, 56. The average demand is approximately 92.1 units per period. There is significant variation between periods (standard deviation approx 25.8). With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Current inventory state: On-hand = 185; In-transit = 246 (Orders from P7=125 and P8=121). Total pipeline = 431. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~460. The OR backend uses a service level logic based on profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), aiming for a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1)). I will use recent_N for both demand mean and standard deviation to capture the most relevant history (all 8 concluded periods) while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time (L) of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. The order from Period 5 was 0 units, which explains 'arrived=0' in the Period 9 conclude message. Demand has been relatively stable since Period 1, with no clear regime shifts or seasonal signals based on the 'Period_X' naming convention. Current demand samples are: 83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115, 110, 56, 104 (mean ~93.4, std ~24.9). With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. On-hand (81) + In-transit (276) = 357 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the observed lead times are consistently 4. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the default method (all samples) as there is no evidence of a sustain change in demand pattern.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a stabilized lead time of 4 periods based on 'Period 7 conclude' carry-over and historical order arrivals (P1-P4 all arrived in 4 periods). However, P5 and P6 had 0 orders, which explains the 'arrived=0' in Period 9 and 10 conclude messages. We expect the Period 7 order to arrive in the Period 11 arrival resolution phase. Historical demand from Period 1 to Period 10 shows a mean of approximately 90.1 units per period (samples: 83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115, 110, 56, 104, 60). Demand appears relatively stable without a strong trend or regime shift. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full recent history after the initial samples provided. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, though the OR backend's capped policy will manage the risk.

However, orders from Periods 5 and 6 (which were zero) resulted in a gap in arrivals at Periods 9 and 10, necessitating recent replenishment. We are currently in a cycle where orders placed now (P12) will arrive in P16. The demand across the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods) needs to be carefully managed. The average demand across all periods is approximately 91.3 units. Given the high parity between Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0), the service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand (base stock = mu_hat). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=11 (all completed demand observations) to capture the overall stability of the SKU, as no significant demand shift is detected.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P7->P11, P8->P12). Note that periods 5 and 6 had zero orders, and orders from period 9 and 10 have not yet arrived (expected in P13 and P14 respectively). Historical demand over 12 periods ranges from 55 to 125, with an average of approximately 93.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 45, and there are 294 units in transit (specifically from orders placed in P9, P10, P11, and P12). Given the lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using all available historical demand samples (N=12) provides a stable baseline for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which the OR backend will use to calculate the base stock and place an appropriate order to maintain the service level while managing holding costs.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14. The promised lead time L=4 is confirmed by recent arrivals (orders from P7-P9 arrived at P11-P13). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 390 units in transit (ordered in P10-P13). Historical demand samples show a fairly stable mean around 93-95 units (ranging from 36 to 125). In the last 13 periods (from game history), demand was: 83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115, 110, 56, 104, 60, 104, 118, 85. Average demand = 92.9. Standard deviation \u2248 24. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 1/(1+1)=0.5, meaning the base stock targets the median demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). However, since we just hit zero stock and demand remains consistent, I will use recent_N (N=13) to capture the overall stability of this demand regime while using the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 after stockouts in Periods 13 and 14 due to demand exceeding arrived quantities. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met as seen in arrivals for Periods 11-14. Demand for chips(Regular) remains relatively stable, with a mean of approximately 95 units across the 14 observed periods. I will use the default lead time (L=4). For demand (mu_hat), recent periods show slightly higher volatility and varying levels, so I will use a recent_N of 10 periods to capture the current mean more accurately while ignoring the initial settling phase. Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 10 periods to reflect recent demand variance. The pipeline inventory (359 units) includes orders from Periods 11-14, which should begin arriving next period (Period 15 arrival phase). The goal is to rebuild on-hand safety stock to prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation for 'chips(Regular)' is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 for the third consecutive period (Periods 13, 14, 15), leading to lost sales. Demand is relatively stable but consistent, averaging approximately 95.3 units per period across all 15 periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages (e.g., Period 15 arrival was ordered in Period 11). The in-transit pipeline (415 units) contains orders from Periods 12 (110 units), 13 (126 units), 14 (75 units), and 15 (104 units). However, those in Period 12 are only arriving during Period 16 (visible in P17). Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is q = 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median demand to balance costs. Given the current stockouts and the lead time of 4 periods, we need to ensure the target base stock covers the demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the slightly higher mean demand recently (~100.2 units) compared to the start, and 'default' for lead time since the 4-period promise is holding perfectly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked significantly to 229, far exceeding the average of ~95. This surge, combined with low arrivals in Periods 13-15, has depleted all on-hand inventory. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with recent arrivals (Period 12 order arrived in Period 16). With profit and holding costs equal, the target service level is 50%, meaning the base stock should target the median demand over the risk horizon (L+1 = 5 periods). Due to the sudden spike in Period 16, I am using a recent window (N=5) to better capture the increased volatility and mean demand, ensuring the replenishment order is large enough to recover from the current stockout while accounting for the high in-transit pipeline (382 units).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 16: demand rose to 229 (240% of previous average). Monitoring if this is a sustained regime shift or a one-time outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $126.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. For the first 15 periods, demand fluctuated around an average of approximately 95 units. However, Period 16 and Period 17 saw demand spike to 229 and 243 units, respectively. This confirms a sustained increase (>200% of previous mean). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). To respond to this shift while being sensitive to the stockouts in Periods 13-17, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this new high-demand regime. Including Period 15 (113) with 16 and 17 provides a conservative but responsive forecast for the new level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the increased volatility associated with this spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: mean demand increased from ~95 to ~236 based on the last two observations (P16: 229, P17: 243). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The demand for the last three periods has been 229, 243, and 187, averaging 219.67 units per period, which is more than double the previous average of ~95. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts since Period 13 due to this unforeseen spike. The in-transit inventory is 719, which includes large orders from Period 17 (225 units) and Period 18 (313 units). However, the Period 15 order (104 units) is expected to arrive this period (P19), followed by the Period 16 order (77 units) in P20. These will not be sufficient to cover the current demand rate. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the new high-demand level (approx 220 per period, totaling 1100 over L+1). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~220) sustained for 3 periods (P16-P18). Service level is critical as stockouts are persistent since P13.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant shift starting at Period 16. Prior to this, demand averaged ~95 units. In the last four periods (P16-P19), demand has spiked to 229, 243, 187, and 205 (average ~216). This shift, combined with lead-time constraints, has resulted in persistent stockouts (ending on-hand inventory has been 0 since P13). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Since the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy and doesn't explicitly account for backlog or current stockouts other than through pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat using the recent 4-period high-demand regime to ensure the orders cover the current trend. For sigma_hat, I will also use the recent 4 samples to capture the increased volatility of this new regime. This approach aims to restore service levels while acknowledging the higher demand environment.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~216) sustained for 4 periods (P16-P19), confirmed transition from previous ~95 avg. Stockouts have persisted for 7 consecutive periods (P13-P19).

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting in Period 16, rising from an average of ~95 to ~212 over the last 5 periods (229, 243, 187, 205, 194). We are currently experiencing an stockout streak (Period 13-20) because orders placed before the shift were insufficient. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since profit and holding costs are both $1.0/unit, the backend target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning it aims for the median. Given the persistent stockouts and the regime shift, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the new demand level (avg ~212 per period). Setting L to 4 reflects the confirmed lead time. This will calculate a base stock covering (4+1)=5 periods of demand, helping the OR backend reconcile the large in-transit pipeline (1003 units) against the new demand reality to bridge the inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~212) sustained for 5 periods (P16-P20). Long stockout streak (8 periods) continues despite consistent lead times of 4 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) successfully transitioned to a high-demand regime starting Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 205 over the last 6 periods (P16-P21). Period 21 finally broke the 8-period stockout streak as the large order from P17 (225 units) arrived. Lead times remain remarkably stable at exactly 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 51, and we have a very large pipeline of 833 units (orders from P18: 313, P19: 268, P20: 197). These massive orders will arrive sequentially in P22, P23, and P24, totaling over 700 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Our forecast (mu_hat) will be based on the recent high-demand regime (N=6, encompassing P16-P21) to ensure the backend recognizes the sustained shift. Although we have a massive pipeline, maintaining recent_N for mu_hat ensures the base stock calculation prevents unnecessary additional ordering while recognizing the new demand mean, allowing the OR backend to cap future orders effectively as the surplus arrives.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~205) sustained for 6 periods (P16-P21). Stockout streak ended at Period 21 due to the arrival of the P17 order (225 units). Large pipeline (833 units) expected to arrive between P22-P25.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, moving from an average of ~95 units to a higher mean. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P16-P22), the average demand is approximately 208.4 units [(229+243+187+205+194+174+227)/7]. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods across multiple observations. After a long period of stockouts, the arrival of orders from P17 and P18 has replenished the on-hand inventory to 137 units. Total pipeline inventory is 663 units (ordered P19-P22). To maintain appropriate stock levels for the L+1 window (5 periods) in this high-demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean accurately. Setting L to 'calculate' to leverage the historical stability of the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~208) sustained for 7 periods (P16-P22); stockout streak ended at P21; lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from an average of ~95 to a new high-demand regime of ~210. The last 8 periods (P16-P23) have shown sustained demand levels (229, 243, 187, 205, 194, 174, 227, 206), averaging 208 units per period. The lead time remains highly stable at exactly 4 periods. My strategy is to capture this new regime using recent_N (N=8) to set the base stock level. The pipeline currently contains 638 units (ordered P20-P23), and the arrival of the P19 order (268 units) in P23 resolved the long-term stockout streak. Since the backend uses a base stock policy (L+1 periods of demand), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 samples to ensure the target inventory level reflects the current 200+ demand reality rather than the historical average of ~132. This approach balances the high service level required for the 1:1 profit/cost ratio against the increased holding risk.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is firmly established, with demand averaging approximately 201 units over the last 9 periods (P16-P24). Lead times remain remarkably consistent at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 207 units, and the pipeline is substantial at 645 units, following the large orders placed to catch up with the regime shift. In the last period (P24), 197 units arrived (from P20), confirming the 4-period lead time. We are currently in a healthier inventory position after a long stockout streak. For the OR parameters, I will use recent_N to capture the new demand regime. Specifically, N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat covers the entire high-demand period (P16-P24), providing a stable but responsive target. The service level (q) target remains 0.5 (given profit $1 and holding cost $1), which the base stock policy will inherently balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 16-24 mean demand is ~201 (standard deviation ~24). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, increasing from a mean of ~95 to ~200. Since Period 16, demand has averaged 203 units (P16-P25: 229, 243, 187, 205, 194, 174, 227, 206, 189, 171). The standard deviation for this new high-demand period is approximately 25. The lead time has remained exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. Currently, we have 91 units on hand and a healthy in-transit pipeline of 768 units. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, which the backend's base-stock logic will target. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to isolate the calculation of mu_hat and sigma_hat to the current high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend uses the appropriate distribution parameters for the current demand environment while keeping the lead time at the stable 4-period mark.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from an average of ~95 to a new higher regime. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 26, the mean demand is approximately 201.5 with a standard deviation of roughly 25. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods throughout the game history. At the start of Period 27, we have 38 units on-hand and 779 units in-transit (orders from Periods 23, 24, 25, and 26). Specifically, the order from P23 (243 units) is expected to arrive during Period 27's arrival phase, making it available to satisfy demand. The OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the review period (1). With \u03bc=~202 and L=4, the expected demand over (L+1) is approximately 1010. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (Periods 16-26) to lock in this higher regime mean. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the volatility of the new regime. L will be set to 'calculate' as the observed lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from ~95 to ~203. Over the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand is 203.9 with a standard deviation of 23.3. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple observations including the most recent conclusion (P27). Currently, on-hand inventory is 58 and in-transit is 729. Since the service level requirement q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, the base stock policy will aim for the median of demand over the (L+1) horizon. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use L='calculate' as the 4-period lead time is well established in the history.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 203 units per period. The most recent observations (Periods 25-28) show demand levels of 171, 196, 223, and 208, confirming this higher plateau compared to the early periods. Since the shift has were sustained for 13 periods, I am using recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific regime's behavior. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P22-P24 orders arrived exactly 4 periods later in P26-P28). The current on-hand inventory is 54, with a substantial pipeline of 757 units. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use the recent demand regime to maintain an appropriate base stock level that prevents the inventory depletion seen in Periods 13-20 while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting at Period 16. Analyzing demand from P16 to P29, the mean demand is approximately 199.3 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 23.4. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in nearly every period since P21. We are currently at Period 30 with 64 units on-hand and 788 units in-transit. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which the backend's base-stock formula (z*=0) naturally targets. I will use the recent_N method with N=14 (the length of the current high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized higher demand and volatility while ignoring the lower pre-P16 data. L is set to calculated as lead times have been stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 30, the mean demand is approximately 201.5 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 22.8 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of shipments from Period 22 through Period 26. Since the demand is stable at this new level (N=15), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=15 to capture this specific regime. L will remain at 'default' (promised lead time of 4) as there is no evidence of drift or loss in recent arrivals. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased demand volume and current volatility, maintaining a high service level while balancing the $1.0 holding cost against the $1.0 profit margin.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from ~95 to ~200+. In the last 5 periods (P27-P31), demand has been 223, 208, 168, 202, and 260, averaging 212. Period 31 saw a spike to 260, leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all recent arrivals (P22-P31 all showed 4-period lead times). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 799 units in-transit. To ensure we cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods) at the higher demand level and protect against recent volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 33), I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the entire high-demand regime starting from P16. This provides a stable mean and variance estimate for the current sustained state.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 32, the average demand is approximately 207 units per period, while the most recent three periods (P30-P32) have shown a slight uptick (202, 260, 241, avg = 234). The current on-hand inventory is 0/empty following two periods of stockouts where demand exceeded available arrivals (P31 demand: 260 vs 209 available; P32 demand: 241 vs 232 available). The lead time has remained consistently 4 periods (P28 order arrived P32). To address the recent uptick in demand and replenish stock to meet the high service level required by the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I am setting mu_hat using the last 17 periods (the high-demand regime) to capture the base shift, while acknowledging that the OR backend's safety stock calculation will help manage the variance. I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 to cover the entire high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-32 is stable at ~207 avg, but recent 3 periods (P30-P32) show increased volatility and a higher mean of ~234.

The mean demand for the last four periods is approximately 233 units (P30: 202, P31: 260, P32: 241, P33: 229), which is higher than the Period 16-29 average of ~201. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since we have experienced stockouts for the last three periods (P31-P33), it is crucial to adjust mu_hat to reflect this recent elevated demand (233 * (1+4) = 1165) and set sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. Using recent_N=4 captures this specific local shift while ignoring the lower historical mean. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period demand, ensuring a high service level while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (P30-P33): mean demand increased to ~233 (+15% from previous regime), with increased volatility (std ~24). Stockouts occurred from P31-P33.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. After a regime change at Period 16 (avg ~207), a more recent spike and increased volatility occurred starting Period 30. The mean demand for the last five completed periods (P30-P34: 202, 260, 241, 229, 190) is approximately 224. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the recent stockout streak from P31-P34, a high service level is required. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the most recent shift) provides a forecast of (1+L)*224, which addresses the increased demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the higher volatility observed in this period, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to break the stockout cycle.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts. The first was at Period 16 (increasing from ~95 to ~205), and the most recent shift occurred at Period 30. From Period 30 to Period 35, demand has averaged approximately 220.6 units per period (P30: 202, P31: 260, P32: 241, P33: 229, P34: 190, P35: 202). Although P34 and P35 were slightly lower, the high service level requirement (profit=holding=$1.0, results in a 50% critical fractile, but the OR backend uses a capped policy that adds safety stock) and recent stockouts from P31-P35 necessitate using the higher recent mean to ensure availability. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the arrival of P31 order in P35. On-hand is currently 0, with 920 units in-transit. I will use the recent_N method with N=6 to capture the most recent demand regime starting at Period 30.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P30-P35 is stable at ~221 avg, maintaining the 15% increase over the previous regime (P16-P29). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P30-P36) shows a mean demand of approximately 210 units with a standard deviation around 37 units. Although the previous regime (P16-P29) was stable around 201, the shift at P30 introduced more volatility and a slightly higher average, though the most recent observation (P36: 150) suggests a potential dip or high variance. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 77 and in-transit at 877 (total pipeline 954), we are positioned to cover approximately 4.5 periods of demand at the current average. To account for the higher volatility observed since P30 and the risk of stockouts seen in P31-P35, I will use the recent 7-period window (P30-P36) to parameterize the OR model, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current volatility and mean accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stabilized regime starting from Period 30, with an average demand of approximately 210 units and a standard deviation of 37. Period 36 and 37 showed slightly lower demand (150 and 203), but the preceding periods (P31-P33) were much higher (260, 241, 229). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 117 and 733 units in transit, the system is finally emerging from a long period of stockouts. To maintain the target service level in this higher-demand regime while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a recent window (N=8) for demand estimation, covering the transition and the stabilization (P30-P37). This N captures the current higher-mean, higher-variance regime without being skewed by the much lower demand of the first 15 periods.

Daily Profit: $181.00, Daily Holding Cost: $209.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-28.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~207 units since the regime shift alert in Period 33, although individual periods fluctuate between 150 and 260. The high-demand regime established in Period 16 (avg ~201) was slightly elevated further from Period 30 onwards (avg ~210). Recent demand (P34-P38) has been 190, 202, 150, 203, 181, which averages 185.2 units, indicating a possible softening or return to the previous high-demand mean. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering P30-P38) to capture the current volatility and mean accurately. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P34-P38). On-hand inventory is healthy at 209, and the pipeline is robust at 659 units. The OR backend needs to maintain this stock level to avoid the significant stockouts seen earlier while balancing the high holding cost ($1.0) which equals the profit ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P30-P38 shows a mean of ~210 with significant variance (std ~32). This maintains the higher volume established after P16 but with more pronounced fluctuations than the P16-P29 period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained relatively stable since Period 30, with a mean demand of approximately 210 units and a standard deviation of 32. Period 39 demand was 202, closely aligning with this average. Since the most recent confirmed shift occurred at Period 30, I am using N=10 (from Period 30 to 39) to capture the current mean and volatility. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P35 order arrived in P39). Currently, the inventory position is 184 (on-hand) + 647 (in-transit) = 831 units. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At an average of 210/period, this requires ~1050 units. The OR backend will order the difference while balancing the profit ($1) vs. holding cost ($1) ratio, which targets a 50% service level for the base stock calculation, though the capping mechanism adds a safety buffer.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a further slight increase in volatility and mean observed from Period 30 onwards. Over the last 11 periods (P30-P40), the mean demand is approximately 202 units per period (Standard Deviation ~31). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by all arrivals through Period 40. I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture this current regime (P30-P40) effectively. This ensures the base stock calculation, which covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, is responsive to the higher volume and variance established recently. The current on-hand inventory (204) and in-transit (662) totaling 866 units are well-positioned against the expected 5-period demand (approx 1010 units), necessitating steady ordering to maintain the service level.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 30, with a mean of approximately 196 units and a standard deviation of 32. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 118, and pipeline inventory is 708. Given the lead time L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use a 12-period window (N=12) for both demand mean and volatility to capture the recent regime (P30-P41), which includes the most recent fluctuations and ensures a stable forecast. This N provides a balance between the stable higher-volume period starting at P16 and the slightly more volatile recent activity starting at P30.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime since Period 16, with a further slight uptick and increased volatility observed after Period 30. The mean demand from Period 30 to 42 is approximately 193 units (standard deviation ~29). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P38 order in P42. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 115 units and a healthy pipeline of 687 units (including orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42). To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations, focusing on the last 13 periods (P30-P42) to capture the current regime's behavior. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed history.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a more recent regime shift identified at Period 30. From Period 30 to 43 (N=14), the mean demand is approximately 201 units. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history (P1-P39 orders). In-transit inventory is currently 725 units, which covers nearly 3.6 periods of average demand. However, with an on-hand stock of only 59 units and 221 units sold last period, maintaining a high service level is critical to avoid the stockout patterns seen in P31-P35. I will continue using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture the stability and volatility of the current regime (P30-P43). L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been extremely stable at 4 periods.

The demand regime has remained stable since Period 30, with a mean demand of approximately 199.5 units and a standard deviation of 26.5.

With 69 units on hand and 754 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P41-P44), our pipeline is sufficient to cover the upcoming 4-period lead time. However, to maintain the desired service level (calculated as profit/(profit+holding) = 50%) and ensure we do not stock out as we approach the end of the game, I will continue to base parameters on the current regime (N=15, from P30 to P44).

Daily Reward (R_t): $152.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 30, following two distinct upward shifts earlier in the simulation. The first shift occurred around Period 16 (from ~95 to ~200) and the second around Period 30 (to ~215). From Period 30 to Period 45, the average demand is approximately 201 units with a standard deviation of 30. Lead time remains very stable at exactly 4 periods, as confirmed by every arrival since Period 5. For Period 46, I am setting L to 'default' (4 periods). I am using 'recent_N' with N=16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime (P30-P45) while excluding the previous lower-demand periods. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that covers 5 periods (L+1) of demand at the currents average of ~200, ensuring we maintain a high service level without excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P30-P45 is stable with a mean of ~201 and std of ~30. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~201 with a standard deviation of ~30 since Period 30, following a more volatile period. Current on-hand inventory is 61 units, and there are 793 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P47-P50), orders placed now (P47) will arrive in P51, which is outside the relevant window for satisfying demand or generating profit within the game's timeframe (P47-P50). However, the OR backend logic requires parameters to manage the current state. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering P30-P46) to reflect the most relevant regime. Lead time remains 'default' at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 30 with a mean of approximately 195 units following a period of higher volatility. The most recent demand (P47) was 179 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P43 order in P47. On-hand inventory is 85 units, and there is a healthy pipeline of 722 units. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50), and a lead time of 4, orders placed now will theoretically arrive in Period 52 (after the game ends). However, to maintain the required service level and safety stock for the final resolution phases of the remaining periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 18 periods (P30-P47) which represent the current regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the ~195 mean and ~30 standard deviation observed in this period, preventing stockouts in the final stretch.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 30, with a mean of approximately 201 and a standard deviation of 30. Despite a brief spike around Period 31-33, the long-term volume remains consistent with the post-Period 16 environment. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrivals of orders from P43 and P44 in P47 and P48 respectively. Currently, the system has 152 units on hand and 668 units in transit. Given that we are at Period 49 out of 50, this is the final decision period. Any order placed now will arrive in Period 53 (4 periods later), which is beyond the game's end. Therefore, the priority is to manage the existing pipeline and on-hand inventory to satisfy the final period's demand without incurring unnecessary holding costs. However, the OR engine requires parameters to function. I will use the established stable regime (P30-P48, N=19) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the default lead time of 4.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~201 units with a standard deviation of ~30 since Period 30, following a series of shifts earlier in the game. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods throughout the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is 141 units and in-transit inventory is 636 units (representing orders from P46, P47, P48, and P49). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I am using recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable regime while providing enough data to smooth out fluctuations. For lead time, I am using the 'calculate' method as it has remained consistently at the promised 4 periods.
