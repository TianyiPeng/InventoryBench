Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 1. The historical data (Periods 1-5 provided in the prompt) shows a mean demand of 108.8 units for chips(Regular). Since we have 0 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately to cover the promised lead time of 4 periods plus the review period (total L+1 = 5 periods). Given the limited historical history provided as samples, I will use a 'recent_N' approach (N=5) to capture the initial demand distribution. The promised lead time is 4, and since no orders have been placed yet, there is no evidence to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised value; therefore, I will use the default lead time setting.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 168 units. Based on the promised lead time of 4 periods, this shipment is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 6 start observation. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 168 units in-transit. Demand for Period 1 was 115, which resulted in 115 lost sales (sold=0) because of zero starting inventory. Historical demand samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) show an average of approximately 108.8 units per period. Since we only have one period of history in the game (P1 demand = 115), I will use the 'default' method for L (promised lead time = 4) and use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting to capture the latest demand profile across the review + lead time window (L+1 = 5 periods). Setting N=5 for demand covers the available historical samples.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because all orders placed so far (Period 1 and Period 2) are still in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 6 start. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game data provided) shows values of 76, 130, 159, 101, 78, while the actual demand in Periods 1 and 2 was 115 and 109. This suggests a relatively stable demand pattern with a mean around 100-110. Since we have no closed arrival data yet to calculate actual lead time, I will stick to the default lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=2) to reflect the most recent live game demand data while incorporating the historical context. The backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) periods, which is essential given our 0 on-hand status and stockouts in the first two periods.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The SKU is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 4. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have a pipeline of 497 units (from orders in Periods 1, 2, and 3). Historical demand for the first three periods observed in the conclude messages (Period 1: 115, Period 2: 109, Period 3: 116) is slightly higher than the pre-game samples (avg ~109 vs ~115). Since no orders have had time to arrive yet, we cannot infer a deviation from the promised lead time. I will use the default lead time. For demand, I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture the slightly higher observed demand levels while ignoring the pre-game seeds which were lower.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (168 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase, which means they will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in Periods 1-4 because no inventory has arrived yet. In-transit inventory is 581 units (sums of orders from P1-P4). Historical demand samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) show moderate volatility with a mean of 108.8. The game history shows slightly different demand values (115, 109, 116, 107), suggesting a mean closer to 112. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for Period 5 plus the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the 'default' method for L (promised lead time) until we verify the actual arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stable demand regime shown in the game history.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Analysis of Period 5's conclusion shows the order from Period 1 arrived after exactly 4 periods (arrived in P5 resolution), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Demand has been relatively stable across the first 5 periods (115, 109, 116, 107, 107), with a mean of 110.8. Since there is no significant trend or regime shift yet, I will use all available samples (N=5) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. The calculation for mu_hat will be (1+L) * mean = 5 * 110.8 = 554. Standard deviation of demand is approximately 4.27, so sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 4.27 \u2248 9.55. These parameters will help the OR backend maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover demand over 5 periods (current + lead time) while balancing the high profit ($19) against low holding costs ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1752.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have 129 units on-hand and 343 units in-transit. Based on the history, orders from Period 1 and Period 2 arrived exactly after 4 periods (as promised). Demand has been relatively stable, with recorded samples including Period 1-5 pre-game (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) and Period 1-6 game history (115, 109, 116, 107, 107, 99). The average demand over the last 6 game periods is approximately 108.8 units. The pipeline inventory (343) covers roughly 3.1 periods of demand, while lead time is 4. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Total inventory needed is approx 5 * 109 = 545. Current total (On-hand 129 + In-transit 343 = 472) is slightly below this. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand to capture the stable game environment, and 'calculate' for lead time since the promised 4 periods has been confirmed twice.

Daily Reward (R_t): $869.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Reviewing 'Period conclude' messages for Periods 5, 6, and 7 confirms that orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 arrived exactly 4 periods later (Lead Time = 4). Therefore, the 'default' method for L is appropriate. Regarding demand, historical samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) and recently concluded demand (115, 109, 116, 107, 107, 99, 58) suggest a relatively stable mean around 100-110 units, though Period 7 showed a dip to 58. Because the total sample size is small (12 periods including pre-game), and demand has been relatively consistent until the last period, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent trend while smoothing the Period 7 outlier. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. The pipeline (In-transit: 277) consists of orders from P4 (84), P6 (97), and P7 (96). An order from P4 is expected to arrive during Period 8 resolution.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical data shows that orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 all arrived with an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. Therefore, L=4 is stable and confirmed. Regarding demand, there is a clear regime shift after Period 6. Demand for Periods 1-6 averaged 109 units (115, 109, 116, 107, 107, 99), whereas demand for Periods 7 and 8 dropped significantly to 58 and 59 units respectively. The initial provided samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) also showed higher variability and a higher mean. Given the recent drop, I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this lower volume (averaging approx 72 units over the last 3 periods), preventing excessive inventory accumulation while maintaining a buffer for the (L+1) period risk window. Pipeline inventory is currently 254 units (orders from P6, P7, P8), and on-hand is 258, which is healthy against current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods across 4 observations. Demand regime shift detected at Period 7: mean decreased from ~109 to ~59 (-45%).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods. The carry-over insights correctly identified a demand regime shift starting at Period 7. Before Period 7, demand averaged ~109 units (Periods 1-6). Since Period 7, demand has dropped significantly: P7=58, P8=59, P9=77, averaging ~64.6 units. This is a sustained drop of approximately 40% compared to the initial periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 181 units, with 254 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, and P8). To prevent excessive holding costs during this lower demand regime, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new mean (~65) and volatility of this lower regime. The lead time L is set to 'default' as it aligns with the observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7 confirmed: mean decreased from ~109 (P1-P6) to ~65 (P7-P9), a sustained shift of -40%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2642.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10 all show L=4). However, the demand regime is showing high volatility. While Periods 7-9 showed a significant decrease (mean ~65), Period 10 spiked to 146. This suggests that the 'downward shift' observed earlier might be part of higher variance or a short-lived dip rather than a permanent regime change. The average demand across all 10 periods is approximately 99, while the average of the last 4 periods (P7-P10) is 85. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will naturally target a high service level. To balance the recent spike with the previous dip, I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand (covering P6-P10: 99, 58, 59, 77, 146) to capture the current volatility while avoiding overreaction to the single Period 10 spike. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Demand volatility increased; Period 10 demand (146) contradicted the previously identified downward regime shift, suggesting either a high-variance environment or a return to the mean (~100).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history has been volatile. Average demand for periods 1-6 was ~109. Periods 7-9 saw a dip to ~65, but periods 10-11 spiked back to an average of 122.5. Over all 11 periods, the mean demand is 97.6. Given the recent spike follows a dip, the environment appears to have high variance or is returning to its initial mean rather than staying in a low-demand regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 129 and in-transit at 209 (Total=338), and expected demand over the (L+1)=5 period horizon being approximately 488 (using the 11-period mean of 97.6), the current position is slightly under-stocked. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent high-volatility behavior (average of 58, 59, 77, 146, 99 = 87.8) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance seen in the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has significantly increased since Period 10, invalidating the previous low-demand regime shift; demand appears to be mean-reverting toward ~100 but with higher variance.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13, the promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12. Demand has shown significant volatility recently: after a low-demand phase (P7-P9 avg: 65), the last three periods (P10-P12) have averaged 116 units (146, 99, 103), suggesting a return to or even exceeding the initial mean (~109). Total demand mean across all 12 periods is approximately 101.9. Given the high stock-out cost (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this 'return to normal' demand regime (avg P7-P12 \u2248 90.3), while using recent_N=12 for sigma_hat to account for the full volatility profile seen throughout the history. In-transit inventory (296) and on-hand (87) appear healthy relative to a 5-period horizon (L+1), but recent spikes necessitate a robust base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean-reversion confirmed: The low-demand regime (P7-P9) has ended; demand for P10-P12 (avg 116) has returned to levels consistent with P1-P6 (avg 109). High volatility persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1653.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory was exhausted (ending 0) due to high demand (157). The pipeline currently consists of 428 units, with the next arrivals expected in Period 14 (ordered P10, but P10 was '0' units, effectively a gap), Period 15 (ordered P11: 148 units), Period 16 (ordered P12: 148 units), and Period 17 (ordered P13: 132 units). Historical demand analysis shows a return to a high-demand regime after a brief dip in Periods 7-9. The mean demand for P10-P13 is approximately 126 units (146, 99, 103, 157). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on arrival history. To ensure the base stock calculation reflects both the recent higher mean and the observed volatility, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current demand level (~126 per period * (1+L)) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to better account for the increased variance observed since Period 7. L is set to default (4) as the historical lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 10-13 mean is ~126 (+15% compared to the overall historical mean of ~109), signaling a sustained high-demand phase following the Period 7-9 dip.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an stockout (On-hand: 0) and missed potential sales in Period 14 (Sold 0 vs Demand 80). The high demand trend observed from Period 10-13 (avg 126) was interrupted by a lower demand of 80 in Period 14, but given the stockout state, we must prioritize service level. Shipments from P9 were 0, however, we expect the orders from P11 (148 units) and P12 (148 units) to arrive in Periods 15 and 16 based on the 4-period lead time. Pipeline inventory is healthy at 620 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher demand regime seen from Period 10-14 (avg ~117), which is higher than the overall average (~103). Lead time L is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2232.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, and P15). We are currently in a high-volatility demand phase. After a brief low-demand dip (P7-P9), demand has mean-reverted. Recent demand samples (P10-P15: 146, 99, 103, 157, 80, 119) average approximately 117 units. Period 13 and 14 experienced stockouts or near-stockouts due to the lack of arrivals in P13-P14, but P15 saw the arrival of the P11 order (148 units). I will set L to 'default' (4) which matches the consistent history. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 (covering P10-P15) to capture the current mean-reverted/elevated demand level (~117 units/period) while ignoring the significant dip in P7-P9. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to account for the heightened volatility observed in this recent regime (StDev \u2248 29), ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to handle demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains elevated post-Period 10; recent 6-period mean (P10-P15) is 117.3, significantly higher than the P7-P9 dip (avg 65).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1543.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a recovery from the Period 7-9 dip (mean ~65) to a higher mean and more volatile regime starting Period 10. The mean demand for the last 7 periods (P10-P16) is approximately 112.8, which is slightly higher than the initial history of 109 but shows significant variance (ranging from 80 to 157). Lead times have consistently been 4 periods (the last two arrivals from P11 and P12 both took 4 periods). Pipeline inventory is very high (518 units), reflecting large orders placed during periods of low on-hand stock and high demand. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), the backend will naturally aim for a high service level. To stabilize the forecast around this more volatile 'new normal,' I am using the last 7 periods (P10-P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and utilizing the 'calculate' method for L since the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1697.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of ~109 units after a volatile period (P7-P9 dip and P10-P13 peak). Averaging the demand from P13 to P17 (157, 80, 119, 86, 96) yields a mean of 107.6, which is consistent with the overall historical mean. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on recent arrivals (P15, P16, and P17 all arrived with lead_time=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 127 and in-transit is 450 (orders from P14, P15, P16, and P17). Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable-but-variable demand regime while using 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $441.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows significant volatility but generally aligns with a mean-reverting pattern around ~102 units. Over the last 9 periods (P10-P18), the mean demand is 102.6, effectively replacing the low-demand regime observed in P7-P9. Period 18 saw an unusually low demand (38), which has driven on-hand inventory up to 281. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P15-P18). To adjust for the recent volatility while centering on the current mean, I am using recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the long-term history with the post-dip behavior. The OR backend will see an ample pipeline (335) and on-hand (281), and the current mu_hat/sigma_hat parameters will allow it to throttle ordering if the total inventory exceeds the calculated base stock for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high, but the mean has stabilized post-dip (P10-P18 mean: 102.6). The high-demand regime suggested at P14 (126) has moderated due to recent lower observations (P16: 86, P18: 38).

Daily Reward (R_t): $992.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe an on-hand inventory of 300 units following a demand of 68 in Period 19. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P15 order arrived in P19). Demand analysis indicates a highly volatile environment. While a lower-demand regime was suspected around P7-P9 (avg 65), demand subsequently spiked (e.g., P13: 157, P15: 119) and has since fallen again (P18: 38, P19: 68). The 10-period mean (P10-P19) is approximately 99.3, which aligns closely with the overall sample mean (~101). Given this volatility, using the last 10 periods (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to capture the recent mean-reverting behavior while accounting for the significant variance observed in P10-P19. The current pipeline (in-transit: 277) plus on-hand (300) is 577, which provides coverage for roughly 5.7 periods at the mean demand of 100.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains significantly elevated post-Period 10; 10-period mean (P10-P19) is 99.3, confirming a return to the long-term mean after the Period 7-9 dip (~65), but with a much higher standard deviation.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P15, P16, P17, P18, P19, P20). Demand analysis shows that the high-volatility regime starting around Period 10 persists. The 11-period mean from P10 to P20 is 100.4 units per period (146, 99, 103, 157, 80, 119, 86, 96, 38, 68, 122), which matches the historical long-term mean (~100-109), but with significantly higher variance compared to the early periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 285 units with 219 units in-transit (orders from P17, P18, P19, P20), totaling a pipeline of 504. For this period, I choose to use L='default' (4) as the lead time is stable. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=11 to capture the stabilized mean and the increased volatility of the most recent demand regime (P10-P20). This balances the need for inventory coverage against the high holding costs by acknowledging the wide demand swings seen recently.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history continues to show high volatility, with Period 21 recording a demand of 150. Over the last 12 periods (P10-P21), the mean demand is 104.3, which aligns with the long-term historical mean of approximately 103 (P1-P21). The 'dip' observed in P7-P9 (avg 65) is clearly an outlier or a temporary regime. Given the high standard deviation observed since Period 10, I will use a larger N for my demand and volatility estimates to smooth out the spikes while acknowledging the higher variance. Regarding lead time, arrivals consistently confirm a 4-period duration (P17 ordered P17, arrived P21). On-hand inventory is healthy (199), and with 284 units in-transit, we are well-positioned for the lead-time window. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the post-dip behavior and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=12 to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Demand mean is confirmed stable at ~104 post-Period 10, but historical volatility remains high with frequent swings between ~40 and ~150.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data consistently confirms this (arrival logic: P18 order arrived P22, P17 arrived P21). I will continue using the 'calculate' method for L to leverage this stable history. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized significantly since the dip in Period 7-9. Although there is high period-to-period volatility, the mean since Period 10 (13 samples) is approximately 106.5 units per period. This is consistent with the pre-dip mean of ~109. Using recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to capture this post-dip regime, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the current mean demand and the heightened volatility observed in recent periods (e.g., P21 demand was 150, P18 was 38). Our current inventory level (On-hand: 152, In-transit: 371) is healthy, tracking toward a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2739.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility, as seen in the recent sequence from Period 20 to 23 (122, 150, 124, 146). The mean over the last 14 periods (P10-P23) is approximately 109.9, which aligns with the overall historical average of ~106. However, the last four periods have averaged 135.5, suggesting a potential high-demand micro-regime. Consequently, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=14 to capture the stable long-term mean while acknowledging the recent volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages (P19 ordered arrived at P23). On-hand inventory is low (35) relative to recent demand, but in-transit inventory is high (480), covering approximately 4.4 periods of average demand. The OR backend needs to balance the current low on-hand stock against the large pipeline to avoid over-ordering while maintaining service levels during this high-demand streak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P20-P23 has transitioned to a higher range, averaging 135.5 compared to the long-term average of 106 (+28%). High volatility persists.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P21-P24) has shifted to a significantly higher regime, averaging 135.5 units per period (150, 124, 146, 122). This is a 28% increase over the long-term mean (~106) and follows the carry-over insight from P24. Currently, the system is stock-out (ending inventory 0 at P24) with a high in-transit pipeline (592 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent prolonged stock-outs in this high-demand, high-volatility regime, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent upward shift (P20-P24). This allows the OR backend to set a higher base stock level for the current cycle (L+1 = 5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 21: mean increased from ~100 to ~135 (+35%) and has been sustained for 4 periods (P21-P24). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1731.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a higher-mean regime starting around Period 21. For the five periods P21-P25, the demand values are [150, 124, 146, 122, 93], resulting in an average of 127. While Period 25 (93) was slightly lower than the recent average, it remains consistent with the volatility seen in this category. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to use the recent 5-period average (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current elevated demand regime (avg ~127) rather than the long-term historical average (~106). This helps avoid stockouts which occurred in Period 24. Pipeline inventory is high (587), so the OR backend's capped policy will moderate the actual order size while maintaining the target service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: mean increased to ~127 (+20% vs long-term mean) across P21-P25. High volatility persists with a range of 93-150.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift detected at Period 21 remains significant, with a mean of approximately 122 units over the last 6 periods (P21-P26), which is higher than the long-term historical mean (~106). Despite the slight relative decline in the last two periods (93, 99), the high volatility (std dev ~23) and the risk of stockouts seen in Period 24 justify focusing on this recent regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 (tracking the P21+ regime) to ensure the OR backend estimates demand for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) based on this confirmed shift. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current high-volatility environment and maintain adequate safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1661.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of high volatility. After a surge (P21-P24 averaging ~135), the most recent three periods (P25-P27) have moderated to an average of 95.7. Taking a broader look at the post-dip regime (P21-P27), the mean is approximately 118, which is slightly higher than the long-term historical mean of 105. Given the high standard deviation and the risk of stockouts (as seen in P24), I am using N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the recent high-demand sequence while incorporating the most recent moderation, providing a balanced forecast for the next 5 periods (+1 for the decision period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: mean across P21-P27 is 118 (+12% vs long-term mean of 105). Volatility remains high, with demand ranging from 93 to 150.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1035.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of high demand (P21-P24 avg: 135.5) followed by a moderation in the last four periods (P25-P28: 93, 99, 95, 67; avg: 88.5). This suggests the previous high-demand regime has cooled off, though volatility remains present. The long-term average is approximately 105. Given the recent downtrend but historical volatility, I will use a recent window (N=8) to capture the blend of the recent spike and the current cooling, which averages 108 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 238, and in-transit is 375, providing a robust pipeline to handle mean demand while the OR backend manages the safety stock via sigma calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: The high-demand spike (P21-P24 avg 136) has moderated; recent 4-period mean (P25-P28) is 88.5, returning demand towards the long-term historical average of ~105.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The demand for Period 29 was 114, which aligns with the long-term mean (~105) rather than the recent dip (P25-P28 average ~89). This suggests the local downward trend has stabilized, returning to the broader historical distribution. To set OR parameters, I utilize L=4 (default). For mu_hat, I detect a stable regime from Period 21 to Period 29 (mean ~112), reflecting the most recent sustained activity level. N=9 is chosen to capture this window. For sigma_hat, I use N=9 as well to account for the sustained high volatility (ranging from 67 to 150) observed throughout this period, ensuring the service level is maintained against demand spikes while managing holding costs on the 248 units currently on-hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $596.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we observe On-hand inventory of 297 and In-transit of 316. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The high-demand spike seen in P21-P24 (avg ~136) has definitively moderated. The most recent six periods (P25-P30) show a mean demand of 89.1 (values: 93, 99, 95, 67, 114, 47), which is a significant drop from the previous regime and slightly below the long-term historical average (~103). Given the high volatility (Standard Deviation ~24 in this recent window), I will use a 6-period lookback (recent_N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward shift and the current variance. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the lower mean demand while maintaining a safety buffer for the observed volatility, considering the current high inventory position.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 25: Mean demand has decreased to 89.1 across P25-P30, compared to 135.5 in P21-P24 (-34%). Volatility remains significant with a range of 47-114.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1505.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a period of high volatility and a temporary spike (P21-P24). Since Period 25, the demand has entered a lower regime with a mean of 89.1 (P25-P31 samples: 93, 99, 95, 67, 114, 47, 94), which is significantly lower than the previous high of 135.5. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this current regime (P25-P31). Volatility remains high, so I will also use recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the current variance. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time, so I will use the default method. The current on-hand inventory (281) plus in-transit (238) is substantial, but given the 4-period lead time, we must maintain a base stock that accounts for future demand across the (L+1) window to avoid stockouts during demand swings.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 25: mean reduced to ~89 (P25-P31) from previous high of ~136 (-34%). Current volatility remains significant with a range of 47-114.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1382.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting around Period 25. The mean demand for the most recent 8 periods (P25-P32) is approximately 89 units, which is a significant decrease from the prior high-demand spike (P21-P24 avg 136). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (271) and significant in-transit units (161), the total pipeline of 432 units comfortably covers the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1), which totals approximately 445 units (89 * 5). To prevent overstocking while demand is in this lower phase, I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture this regime shift for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR backend to adjust the base stock level and potentially reduce ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1537.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 to Period 33 (samples: 93, 99, 95, 67, 114, 47, 94, 87, 93), the mean is approximately 87.7. This is a significant decrease from the Period 21-24 peak (~136). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival in Period 33 of the order placed in Period 29. On-hand inventory is healthy at 230 units, and there are 189 units in transit. Given the lower demand mean and high current inventory levels, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 9 samples (since Period 25) to reflect this moderated demand level and avoid over-ordering while maintaining a safety buffer for the high observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed at Period 25: Mean demand from P25-P33 is 87.7, consistently lower than the P21-P24 peak of 136. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 25. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P25-P34) is 87.5, which is consistent with the previously identified shift from the Period 21-24 high. Volatility remains present but manageable. Lead time is Rock-solid at 4 periods, with the most recent arrival (ordered P30, arrived P34) confirming this. On-hand inventory is healthy at 258 units, and with 172 units in-transit (orders from P31-P34), the pipeline is sufficient but needs replenishment to account for the L+1 window. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current stable regime (P25-P34) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for lead time as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 25. The mean demand for the last 11 periods (P25-P35) is 88.2, which is significantly lower than the P21-P24 peak of 135.5. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 163, and in-transit is 246 (total 409). The expected demand over the lead time (L+1=5 periods) is approximately 441 units (88.2 * 5). Using recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR model on this current stable regime while acknowledging the significant volatility (range 47-114). The order placed in Period 31 was 0, which is normal given the high inventory at that time. I will maintain recent_N methods to track the current demand level.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 25, with a mean demand of approximately 88.5 units and consistent volatility. Recent demand observations (P35: 95, P36: 104) align with this historical average plus some variation. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages in history where orders placed arrive exactly 4 periods later. Currently, there is a large pipeline inventory (341 units), though the last two periods (P35, P36) showed no arrivals. This gap is expected because no orders were placed in Period 31 and 32 (orders that would have arrived in P35 and P36). Arrivals will resume in Period 37 from the Period 33 order. Given the stability of the demand since P25, I will use recent_N=12 to capture the mean and variance of this stabilized regime (starting from Period 25). For lead time, I'll continue with the 'calculate' method as it has proven to be a reliable 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1501.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical observations (Period 5 to Period 37) consistently show an actual lead time of 4 periods. While no arrivals occurred in Periods 35 and 36, these were expected because zero orders were placed in Periods 31 and 32. The order from Period 33 arrived on time in Period 37. As for demand, the environment has stabilized into a regime starting around Period 25. The mean demand for the last 13 periods (P25-P37) is 89.1, with a standard deviation of approximately 18. This regime is distinct from the high-demand peak seen in P21-P24 (avg 136). Using recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the forecast on this stable, lower-demand period while maintaining sufficient history to capture the current volatility levels. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the lead time plus review period (1+4=5 periods) based on the most relevant demand characteristics.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability since Period 25 confirmed: 13-period mean (P25-P37) is 89.1, significantly lower than the P21-P24 peak of 135.5.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand regime has been stable since Period 25, with a mean demand of approximately 88.5 units. Recent observations (P34-P38) are 81, 95, 104, 82, 89, which further confirms this stability around a value slightly higher than 88 but significantly lower than the P21-P24 peak of 136. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple historical data points (e.g., P37, P38). I am using 'recent_N' with N=14 (P25 to P38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime's mean and volatility while excluding the atypical spike from P21-P24. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~88 units since Period 25. The most recent observations (P35-P39) show a slight dip (average ~81), but P39 was particularly low at 35 units, which may be an outlier. I will use the established stable regime from P25 onwards (N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring we cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple \u2018conclude\u2019 statements including the most recent arrival. Current on-hand (99) and in-transit (369) are sufficient, but we must maintain the base stock to avoid future stockouts as older orders arrive and inventory is consumed. The high Profit/Holding-Cost ratio (19:1) justifies maintaining a healthy service level, even with recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P25-P39 is stable with a mean of 85.5 and standard deviation of 19.8, confirming the shift away from the P21-P24 peak (~136). Lead time is highly reliable at 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 25. Analyzing the segment from Period 25 to Period 40 (16 samples), the mean demand is 84.8 with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. This segment represents a clear shift from the high-demand peak seen in Periods 21-24 and is long enough (N=16) to provide a reliable forecast. Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders, confirming the promised lead time remains accurate. For Period 41, I will use recent_N with N=16 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime. The on-hand inventory (79) and in-transit units (308) are sufficient to cover anticipated demand over the lead time, considering the OR backend's capped policy and base-stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 25 to 40 confirmed stable: mean 84.8, std ~21.0 (+/- 5% versus long-term average). Lead time remains highly reliable at 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 25. Analyzing the 17-period window from P25 to P41, the mean demand is 86.6 with a standard deviation of 19.9. This confirms the previously identified shift away from the high-demand peak seen in early P20s. Lead time remains highly reliable at 4 periods, as consistently demonstrated by order arrivals in the conclude messages. The OR backend will use these statistics to maintain a base stock level that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1), effectively balancing the relatively high service level requirement (profit/holding cost ratio) against inventory costs. I will continue to use recent_N with N=17 to capture this stable regime specifically.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 25, though recent periods (P40-P42) have shown a slight uptick in demand (115, 115, 133). The mean demand since Period 25 is approximately 87.8, but focusing on the most recent 5 periods (P38-P42) shows a higher mean of 97.0. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently low (18 units) due to the recent demand surge, but 369 units are in transit, including 87 units due to arrive this period (ordered P39). I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=18 (covering the regime since P25) to capture the stable long-term mean while allowing for the high standard deviation (~23) to inform the safety stock via sigma_hat. This approach ensures we avoid stockouts from recent high demand while not over-ordering based on temporary spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1995.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains relatively stable with a mean of approximately 88.5 units since Period 25. However, there has been a recent uptick in demand (Periods 40-43: 115, 115, 133, 114), which has depleted on-hand inventory to 0 and caused lost sales in Period 43. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With 413 units already in-transit (ordered in P40-P43) and a cycle of 5 periods (L+1) to cover, the system needs to maintain a pipeline that accounts for this recent demand surge while acknowledging the long-term stable mean to avoid overstocking. I will use a recent_N of 19 (P25 to P43) to capture the stable period while weighing the recent volatility appropriately. This balances the risk of stockouts seen in the last period against the inventory holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Demand showed a temporary spike between Periods 40-43 (avg 119.25), leading to a stockout in Period 43. Despite this, the broader regime since Period 25 remains the most reliable baseline for long-term planning.

Daily Reward (R_t): $646.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of depletion with 0 on-hand inventory due to a sustained high-demand period (P40-P44 average ~113 vs P25-P39 average ~85). I need to account for this higher realized demand when setting the base stock levels, as the previous regime (P25-P40) is no longer capturing the current volatility and mean. The pipeline inventory is healthy (511 units), but there's an immediate need to satisfy demand from upcoming arrivals. I will use recent_N for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focused on the last 10 periods (P35-P44) to capture this recent upward trend and increased variance while smoothing out the extreme P43/P44 stockouts. Lead time (L) remains consistently 4 periods, so 'default' is appropriate. These settings will help the OR backend raise the base stock level to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high reward-to-cost ratio (19:1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from Period 40 to 44: mean increased to ~113 (+33% vs P25-P39 mean of 85.5). This has caused consecutive stockouts in P43 and P44.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained high-demand regime since Period 40. The average demand from P40 to P45 is approximately 108.5 units, compared to the previously stabilized mean of ~85. This shift caused stockouts in P43 and P44. Although P45 saw a slight dip to 84 units, the recent 6-period average is the most relevant for capturing this upward shift. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=6 to account for this higher average (108.5 * 5 = 542.5). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect the increased volatility during this period. Lead time remains consistently reliable at 4 periods, which is captured by the 'default' method.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 40: mean increased from ~85 to ~109 (+28%) across P40-P45, leading to inventory pressure and stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1296.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 40. From Period 40 to 46, we observed a mean demand of approximately 103 units (115, 115, 133, 114, 90, 84, 73), which is significantly higher than the Period 25-39 mean of ~85. This surge caused stockouts in Periods 43 and 44. Although the last three periods (44-46) show a cooling trend (90, 84, 73), the regime shift since Period 40 is the most relevant signal given the recent stockouts. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime (Periods 40-46). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data, so the default method is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40 confirmed: mean increased to ~103 (+21% vs previous regime) across P40-P46. Volatility remains high, but recent demand (P44-P46) suggests a possible moderation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1038.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) indicates a volatile but sustained regime. Following a high-demand peak (P40-P43 avg ~119), demand has moderated over the last three periods (P45-P47 avg ~73), but remains higher than the previous trough. To balance the risk of stockouts seen in P43/P44 against holding costs, I am using a recent_N approach for demand estimation. Specifically, N=8 covers the transition from the high-demand spike to the current moderation (P40-P47), capturing the current volatility while grounding the forecast in recent trends. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 40 exhibits significant volatility; the initial peak (P40-P43 mean 119) has moderated significantly in the last 3 periods (P45-P47 mean 73.3), suggesting a stabilization around a mean of ~100 but with high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $729.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant regime shifts. After a high-demand spike from Periods 40-44 (averaging ~113), the last four periods (P45-P48) have seen a sharp decline to an average of 67.75 (84, 73, 63, 51). This suggests the peak has ended and a new lower-demand regime or a return to the structural mean of ~100 is occurring, but with a recent downward trend. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory (240) and significant in-transit stock (291), combined with the recent softening of demand, I will focus on the most recent 6 periods (P43-P48, mean ~79) to set mu_hat, while using a wider window (N=10) for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed throughout the history. This approach seeks to prevent over-ordering during a demand downturn while maintaining a safety buffer for the high variance.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 45: Mean demand decreased significantly from ~113 (P40-P44) to ~68 (P45-P48), a reduction of 40%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1386.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new lower regime starting around Period 45. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P45-P49) is 71.2, which is significantly lower than the preceding period (P40-P44) average of ~113. While a temporary spike occurred between P40-P43 causing stockouts, the current trend is a return toward lower levels, similar to the P25nd-P39 regime. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 229 and 217 units in-transit, we are well-covered for the immediate future. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this recent downward shift and ensure the OR engine doesn't over-order based on the high-demand spike that ended at Period 44.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 45: mean decreased to ~71 (P45-P49) from ~113 (P40-P44), a -37% reduction. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
