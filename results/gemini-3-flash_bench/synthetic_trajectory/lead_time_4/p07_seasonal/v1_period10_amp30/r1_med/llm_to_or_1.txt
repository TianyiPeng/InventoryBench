Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Initial inventory is 0. Based on the 5 historical demand samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78), the average daily demand is approximately 108.8 units with a standard deviation of 33.6. Given the lead time L=4, the review+lead time horizon is (L+1)=5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this recent demand level, as there are no specific calendar dates to suggest a seasonal shift yet. Since there are no concluded periods yet, I will use the 'default' method for L. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover expected demand over 5 periods (~544 units) and set an order cap to mitigate over-ordering.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 168 units, but due to the promised lead time of 4 periods, they are correctly currently in-transit and not yet arrived. Our on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales of 114 units in Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was [76, 130, 159, 101, 78], with an average of 108.8 units. The Period 1 demand (114) is consistent with this mean. Given lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) to capture the initial demand distribution. This will target a base stock level that accounts for the 4-period lead time while waiting for our Period 1 order to arrive in Period 5.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For chips(Regular), we have 335 units in-transit (orders from Period 1 and Period 2) and 0 on-hand. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, no arrivals were expected yet (Period 1 order with L=4 should arrive in Period 5). Historical demand samples are [76, 130, 159, 101, 78], with an average of 108.8. The observation data for Period 1 and 2 shows demand was 114, which is consistent with the initial samples. Because on-hand is zero and we are waiting for the lead time to pass, current sales are zero (stockout). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent distribution until the pipeline starts arriving. I will stick with the promised lead time 'default' as there is no evidence yet of deviation.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). We are currently experiencing stockouts (0 units sold) because no inventory has arrived yet. Demand samples provided are [76, 130, 159, 101, 78], with an average of 108.8 units per period. The history shows slightly different demand (114, 114, 86) for Periods 1-3, likely due to stochasticity. Given the lead time L=4, we must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Mean demand is approx 109, implying a base stock target of roughly 545 plus safety stock. Current in-transit is 497 (168+167+162), which is slightly below the 5-period requirement. I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture recent volatility and the promised lead time 'default' for L.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (168 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible in Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 524 units in-transit (orders from Periods 1-4). Demand samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) show an average of approximately 109 units per period with significant variance. Since we haven't confirmed any arrivals yet (as expected with L=4), I will stick to the default lead time. For demand forecasting, I will use all 5 available samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as we are still establishing a baseline and haven't detected a sustained regime shift yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $437.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since L=4, the system requires enough inventory to cover the review period plus lead time (1+L = 5 periods). Looking at demand history (P1: 114, P2: 114, P3: 86, P4: 118, P5: 121), the mean demand is approximately 110.6 units per period. The pipeline inventory is currently 377 (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), while the order from P2 is expected to arrive this period (P6). On-hand inventory is 47, which is low given current demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the full history of demand, as there's no clear regime shift yet, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock target based on the 5-period horizon (current period + 4 lead time periods).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand is stable around 110 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $161.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand inventory is 139 units, and in-transit is 344 units (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Demand has shown some volatility but averages approximately 105 units over the six completed periods (114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75). Since the stock-out in the first four periods was due to lead-time delay, the focus is now on maintaining a stable pipeline. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current mean of ~105 units and stick with the promised lead time (L=4) as it aligns with observations. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. Historical demand for the first 7 periods has been 114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75, and 74 (average ~100.3). Recent demand (Periods 6-7) has dropped slightly to an average of 74.5, but given the earlier volatility, a broader sample is safer. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (based on P1, P2, and P3 arrivals). The on-hand inventory is 227 units, and in-transit is 259 (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7), totaling 486 units. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At an average demand of ~100, we need ~500 units. Since current pipeline is 486, the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order or wait. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the full history's mean while excluding the initial sample seed, and 'calculate' for lead time since the 4-period lead time is consistent with the promised value.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. Looking at the history, orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 have all arrived with a consistent lead time of exactly 4 periods (arriving in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8 respectively). This matches the promised lead time. The demand history across the first 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 102.6 units (114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75, 74, 119) with noticeable fluctuations but no clear regime shift yet. The Carry-over Insight from Period 6 noted demand around 110 units. Recent demand (Periods 5-8) averages 97.25, while the full window averages 102.6. Given the stability of the lead time at 4 periods, I will stick with the default lead time (4). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture all available completed data points to buffer against the observed variance while maintaining a stable average. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is currently 288 units (orders from P5, P6, P7, P8), which covers roughly 2.8 periods of demand, and on-hand is 135. Total coverage is approx 4.2 periods, which is close to the (L+1)=5 period coverage goal.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (orders from P1-P5 arriving in P5-P9) consistently confirms the actual lead time is 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 54, with 396 units in-transit. Demand over the last 9 periods has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 102.5 units (ranging from 74 to 121). Since the lead time is stable at 4, the target should cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The current pipeline (on-hand 54 + in-transit 396 = 450) roughly covers 4.4 periods of demand at the average rate. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it is currently matching the promised 4 periods. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent stability in demand (approx 89 units avg over the last 5 periods) while accounting for the slight downward trend compared to the first four periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Observation of historical arrivals from Period 1 to Period 6 confirms a stable lead time of L=4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability but remains within a recognizable range. From Period 1 to Period 10, the observed demand values are: 114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75, 74, 119, 102, 140. Looking at the last 5 periods (P6-P10), the mean demand is 102 units/period, compared to the overall mean of ~106. Since the demand is relatively stable but shows a slight uptick in Period 10 (140), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent behavior while smoothing out noise. On-hand inventory is 48, and in-transit is 347, which is significant relative to the expected demand across the (L+1)=5 period horizon (~510 units), but the OR backend will calculate the correct order to reach the base stock target based on these parameters.

Demand over the last 11 periods averages 103.7 units, with the most recent sample at 78 and the training samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) also averaging around 109. Calculating recent demand (last 6 periods from Period 6 to 11): (75+74+119+102+140+78)/6 = 98. This indicates relatively stable, if slightly volatile, demand. I will use 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand (N=11 to include all realized period data) to compute the base stock. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 419 units, which is quite high compared to the 5-period demand window (~520 units), but ensures we replenish against the current on-hand of 47.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we experienced a stockout (demand 158 vs. 103 on-hand), leaving ending inventory at 0. Looking at the arrival history, the lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as seen from Period 5 through Period 12). Current in-transit inventory is 458 units (orders from Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12). Period 9's order of 129 units is scheduled to arrive during Period 13 resolution, which will bring inventory back to usable levels. Demand has shown higher volatility recently, ranging from 74 up to 158 units. To ensure inventory stability and cover the (L+1) horizon, I am using a recent window for demand (N=7 covers periods 6-12) to capture this increased volatility (max demand reached 158 in P12). Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 will weigh this higher recent demand and its variance appropriately against the confirmed lead time L=4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Periods 10-12 (mean ~125 vs previous ~100). Stockout occurred in Period 12 due to spike in demand (158).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14. We have experienced stockouts in Period 12 and 13 due to a sustained increase in demand levels. Analyzing the history, demand from Period 1 to 9 averaged 102.5 units, whereas from Period 10 to 13 it averaged 131.5 units, with the last two periods hitting 158 and 150. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With 0 units on hand and 468 units in transit, we need to adjust our base stock to account for this higher demand regime to prevent further lost sales. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand/high-volatility regime, and 'calculate' for L as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 10-13 average demand is ~132, significantly higher than the previous average of ~102. Volatility has also increased during this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $340.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that started around Period 10. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 130 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~100. We have experienced stockouts in Periods 12, 13, and 14 because demand (158, 150, 124) exceeded available on-hand inventory (which was limited by earlier conservative orders). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, but there is significant pipeline inventory (575 units). To address the regime shift and recover from stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher mean and increased volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock level to satisfy this elevated demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 10-14 average demand is 130 units, characterizing a ~25% increase from the initial baseline of ~103.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift identified in Period 14 remains active. Since Period 10, demand has averaged 124.8 units compared to the initial baseline of ~103 units. Stockouts occurred in Periods 12, 13, and 14 due to this upward shift and increased volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I am using recent_N (N=6, covering Periods 10-15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and its associated volatility, ensuring the base stock level (target inventory) is high enough to prevent future stockouts while accounting for the significant 'In-transit' quantity of 561 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17. Looking at the history, the lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from Periods 1 through 12). Demand has shown a shift; the initial baseline (Periods 1-9) averaged ~103, but from Period 10 onwards, it became more volatile with a higher average. Specifically, the last 7 periods (P10-P16) have a mean demand of 115.2, though there was a significant dip in Period 16 (58 units). Given the stockouts in Periods 12, 13, and 14, it is crucial to maintain enough inventory to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (Review period = 1), totaling 5 periods of demand. The 'recent_N' approach will be used to capture the current demand regime. I will set N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to encompass the post-shift performance starting from Period 10. The on-hand inventory is 87, and there is a significant amount in-transit (538 units), which covers the upcoming 4 periods of arrivals. Using recent demand stats will allow the OR backend to calculate a safety stock level appropriate for the recent volatility.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, the demand history from Period 10 to 17 shows a higher mean and increased volatility compared to the initial baseline. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 8 periods (P10-P17) is approximately 113.75, but with significant swings (standard deviation ~35), including peaks of 158 and lows of 58. The Carry-Over Insights already identified a regime shift starting around Period 10. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with the observed arrival data (e.g., Period 13 order arrived in Period 17). To capture this higher demand regime and its volatility while remaining responsive to the recent stockouts (P12-P14), I am using N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This covers the confirmed regime shift period while smoothing out the noise from the low demand observed in Period 16. The base stock level will be calculated for (L+1) = 5 periods to cover demand until the next order arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 10-17 shows increased volatility (std ~35) compared to P1-P9, with mean stabilizing slightly lower (~114) than the P10-P14 peak (~130) but higher than the initial baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-85.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift in behavior. From Period 1 to 9, the mean demand was approximately 103. From Period 10 to 18, the mean demand shifted to approximately 111, but with significantly higher volatility (std dev ~36 vs ~20 in the early period). Specifically, the last four periods (P15-P18) have shown a downward trend: 99, 58, 103, 46. This suggests that the high-demand regime observed between P10-P14 (avg ~130) has dissipated or corrected. The current on-hand inventory (269) plus in-transit (321) is 590, which is very high given the recent mean demand of ~76 units over the last 4 periods. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent overstocking and excessive holding costs, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture the cooling trend over the last 9 periods (the entire post-baseline period), while keeping sigma_hat at a recent_N of 9 to account for the elevated volatility seen since Period 10.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime cooled between Periods 15-18 (average 76.5) compared to the Period 10-14 peak (average 130.2), though volatility remains higher than the initial baseline (P1-P9).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe that on-hand inventory is high (303 units) following recent large arrivals and a period of lower demand (average demand P15-P19 is 81.4 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The high volume of arrivals from Period 14 (192 units) and Period 15 (135 units) has significantly bolstered on-hand inventory, while the pipeline (203 units) contains orders from Periods 16-19. Given the recent demand cooling (P15-P19 mean ~81), using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for \u03bc\u0302 will help the OR backend adjust to this lower demand regime and avoid excessive holding costs from the current high on-hand position. L is set to calculated as the 4-period lead time is consistently confirmed through Period 19.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooled significantly between Periods 15-19, averaging 81.4 units compared to the Period 10-14 peak of 130.2 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-30.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. Following a high-demand period (P10-P14, avg ~130), the most recent window (P15-P20) has shown a significant cooling, averaging 79.3 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently high (306 units) due to the delayed arrival of orders placed during the previous peak, while demand has since dropped. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current cooled demand, I will focus on a more recent demand window to avoid over-ordering. I'll use recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime (approx 80 units/period) while maintaining an appropriate buffer for the observed volatility in this segment (std ~23). This approach aims to reduce holding costs as the system is currently overstocked.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime cooled significantly between Periods 15-20 (average 79.3) compared to the Period 10-14 peak (average 130.2). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted twice. After a high-demand period (P10-P14 mean ~130), demand entered a 'cooling' phase from P15 to P21, averaging 83.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22 units. This is significantly lower than the previous peak and even slightly lower than the initial P1-P9 baseline. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods across all 17 completed arrivals. Current on-hand inventory (220) plus in-transit (115) totals 335 units, which is high relative to current demand trends. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this lower demand regime (P15-P21). By using the most recent 7 periods, the OR engine will calculate a base stock reflecting the current mean (~84) and volatility, helping to prevent excess inventory buildup as the pipeline clears while still maintaining a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime cooled and stabilized from Period 15-21: mean 83.6 (vs ~130 in P10-P14), std ~22. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $369.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit shifting patterns. After a significant cooling period (P15-P21 average demand ~83.6), Period 22 observed a spike to 136 units. However, looking at the recent history since Period 15, the average demand remains relatively lower than the P10-P14 peak. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (mu_hat) with N=8 (Periods 15-22) to capture this lower/stabilized regime while accounting for the recent uptick. Since there is a high stock on-hand (175) and 150 units in transit (ordered in P19-P22), the OR backend will naturally scale back ordering to avoid excessive holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time settings. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=8 to reflect the current volatility of this regime.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown an increasing trend over the last two periods (P22: 136, P23: 130) compared to the 'cooled' regime identified between P15-P21 (average ~84). The current on-hand inventory is 62 units, and the pipeline (in-transit) is 273 units. To address this potential shift back to higher demand levels while accounting for the stable 4-period lead time, I am increasing mu_hat. I will use a recent_N of 4 periods (P20-P23) for demand mean calculation to capture the recent upward movement (avg ~111) while maintaining responsiveness. Lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same recent period to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected starting Period 22: Average demand for P22-P23 is 133 units, up from P15-P21 average of 84 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, there was a stockout with on-hand inventory hitting 0 and an unmet demand of 80 units (demand 142, sold 62). The order from Period 20 (0 units) concluded, confirming that even though in-transit inventory is 434, the actual arrivals in the near term are precarious. A clear demand rebound is underway: the average demand from Period 22-24 is 136 units (136, 130, 142), significantly higher than the preceding Period 15-21 average (~84). This period's order must account for this higher mean and the observed volatility. I am setting L to 'calculate' as lead time has been consistently 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent and relevant upward trend in demand. For sigma_hat, 'recent_N' with N=5 will be used to capture the recent volatility associated with the demand rebound and the transition from the previous cooling period.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound shift confirmed: Period 22-24 average demand is 136 units (up ~60% from P15-P21 average of 84). Stockout occurred in Period 24 due to this sustained spike.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 22. Average demand from Period 22 to Period 25 is 137 units (136, 130, 142, 140), significantly higher than the preceding Period 15-21 average of ~84 units. This rebound has led to stockouts in Period 24 and 25 because the arrival pipeline was lean based on the previous low-demand period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P21 order arrived at P25). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this confirmed high-demand regime (P22-P25) and prevent further stockouts. The OR backend will use these values to target a 0.8 service level (4.0 profit / (4.0 profit + 1.0 holding cost)), which is appropriate for this high-margin product.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed Period 22-25: average demand 137 units, up from Period 15-21 average of 84 units (+63%). Stockouts occurred in P24-P25 due to low pipeline inventory from previous cooling period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $359.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a high-demand regime starting around Period 22. Between Periods 22 and 26, demand levels were 136, 130, 142, 140, and 97, averaging approximately 129 units per period. This is a significant increase from the previous 'cooling' period (P15-P21) where demand averaged ~84. Lead time consistsently matches the promised 4 periods (P22 order arrived P26). While demand dropped to 97 in P26, the overall trend of the last 5 periods remains elevated. To account for this new regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N where N=5 to capture the mean (~129) and the associated volatility of this specific period. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility phase following a significant rebound that started in Period 22. While the mean demand for the rebound period (P22-P25) was approximately 137 units, the most recent two periods (P26 and P27) show a cooling trend with demand at 97 and 55 units respectively. Given this high variance and the risk of both stockouts (seen in P24-P25) and excess holding costs, I am targeting the most recent demand regime starting from P22. I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the rebound and the subsequent cooling. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which is consistently observed in recent completions (P27 arrived order from P23, L=4). Although P24's order hasn't arrived, this is expected as it is only Period 28 (P24+4=P28, visible in P29). Inventory is currently recovering with 114 on-hand and substantial units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high after Period 22 rebound: P22-P25 average ~137, while P26-P27 average ~76. Lead time confirmed as stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently with a significant rebound starting around Period 22. In the last seven periods (P22-P28), demand has fluctuated between 55 and 142, with an average of approximately 111.4 units. Specifically, the most recent three periods (P26-P28) averaged 77.3 units, while the peak during the rebound (P22-P25) averaged 137 units. This volatility makes predicting a precise mean challenging. Given the Profit of $4 and Holding Cost of $1 (critical ratio \u2248 0.8), the OR backend aims for a reasonably high service level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am setting L to 'calculate' (stable at 4). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=7 to capture the entire rebound and subsequent cooling (covering the periods since the major shift detected in carry-over insights). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=7 to reflect the high volatility seen in this period, ensuring the safety stock is sufficient to handle potential spikes like those seen in P22-P25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in recent periods. We observed a high-demand regime (Periods 22-25) averaging ~137 units, followed by a cooling phase (Periods 26-29) averaging ~84 units. This pattern is similar to the volatility seen between Periods 10-14 (high) and 15-20 (low). Given the current on-hand inventory of 277 and in-transit of 242 (total pipeline 519), we are well-covered for the immediate 4-period lead time segment. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the history. To balance the risk of another demand rebound against holding costs, I am using a recent_N approach for demand estimation (mu_hat) with N=8 (covering Periods 22-29) to capture both the recent spike and the subsequent cooling. This results in a balanced mu_hat that reflects the current oscillating regime rather than just the most recent low points.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in an oscillating regime: Periods 22-25 averaged ~137, while Periods 26-29 averaged ~84. Lead time is consistently stable at 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to exhibit oscillating demand between 'high' (approx. 136 units) and 'low' (approx. 80 units) regimes. The most recent sequence (P26-P30) shows a cooler phase with an average demand of 80.0 units. Given the historical oscillation observed in the carry-over insights, this lower phase might persist or slightly rise. I will use a recent_N window of 9 periods (P22-P30) to capture the average across both high and low oscillations, which yields a more robust mean (~101) than focusing solely on the last 4 periods (~75). Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by multiple consecutive cycles. Target inventory needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is calculated using the same 9-period window to account for the current high volatility caused by these regime shifts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $163.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to oscillate. Recent demand (last 6 periods, P26-P31) shows a mean of 84.7 units, which is significantly lower than the P22-P25 peak (~137) but higher than the P15-P21 cooling period (~81). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 269 and in-transit arrivals spanning from orders in P28-P31 (total 213 units), the immediate stock position is healthy. I will use a recent_N strategy for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current oscillating regime (encompassing both high and low phases from P22-P31) to avoid overreacting to short-term dips while maintaining protection against the rebound spikes observed previously. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 22-31 is characterized by high-amplitude oscillations, alternating between ~137 and ~85 unit averages; composite mean for last 10 periods is approx 106 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an oscillating pattern. After a high-demand phase (P22-P25 average ~137), the most recent period (P26-P32) shows a cooling phase with an average demand of approximately 86 units. The composite mean over the last 11 periods (P22-P32) is approximately 105 units. Given the oscillations, using a 'recent_N' approach with N=11 captures one full cycle of this behavior. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P28 order arrived P32), so L=4 is appropriate. On-hand inventory is 200, and in-transit is 295. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that accounts for (L+1)=5 periods of demand and variability, helping to buffer against the next potential upward oscillation while minimizing holding costs during the current lower-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $367.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an oscillating pattern. Over the last 12 periods (P22-P33), the demand has averaged approximately 111 units, with notable volatility (standard deviation ~28). The most recent period (P33) saw demand at 124 units, which is slightly above the long-term average but consistent with the current fluctuating regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival of the P29 order in P33. Currently, there are 129 units on-hand and 327 units in-transit (orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33). To maintain a proper buffer against the observed demand oscillations and avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am using a recent_N strategy for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). Given the regime change around P22, I am setting N=12 to capture this specific behavior (P22-P33). This targets an inventory level across the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) that accounts for the composite mean and higher variance observed in recent periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a fluctuating pattern. Since Period 22, demand has alternated between high-demand weeks (averaging ~137) and lower-demand weeks (averaging ~84). The most recent few periods (P33-P34) have seen demand climb back up to 124 and 130, suggesting we are entering another high-demand phase. The current on-hand inventory is 92, and we have a significant pipeline (364 units), but given the 4-period lead time, we must maintain a robust base stock to avoid the stockouts seen in P24-P25. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=13 (covering the start of this oscillating regime in Period 22) to capture the composite mean of approximately 106 units per period, while maintaining sufficient safety stock via sigma_hat to handle the high volatility (std approx 30 during this regime). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 22-34 is characterized by high-amplitude oscillations between ~84 and ~137; the composite mean is approximately 107 units with high volatility.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to oscillate between high (~130-140) and moderate (~80-100) levels. Period 35 demand was 103, following a peak of 130 in Period 34. The average demand over the last 14 periods (P22-P35) is approximately 108.6 units. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the system targets a high service level (80%). The current on-hand inventory is low (32 units), but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline (459 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (most recently P31 order arriving in P35). To address the continued high-amplitude oscillations and prevent stockouts during the upward swings, I will use a recent_N window (N=14) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific oscillating regime's mean and volatility while maintaining a standard lead time expectation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 22-35 remains in a high-amplitude oscillation pattern; the composite mean for this 14-period window is ~109 units with significant standard deviation (~27).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high-amplitude oscillations within the established regime starting at Period 22. The 15-period window from Period 22 to 36 shows a composite mean of approximately 109 units with a significant standard deviation (~27). Recent arrivals confirm the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the current period's decision must cover demand for L+1 periods (5 periods), and given the high volatility, I will use a 15-period 'recent_N' window to capture the current oscillating regime's mean and variance. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that accounts for the frequent spikes (up to ~140) and troughs (down to ~55) observed in the recent cycle, preventing stockouts while managing holding costs during lower-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an oscillating pattern. After a high-demand phase (P33-P36 averaging ~118 units), Period 37 saw a drop to 54 units. Historical data indicates this is likely a cyclical dip rather than a permanent downturn, following the pattern established since P22. The 14-period window from P22-P35 has a mean of ~109 units, while the more recent window (P22-P37) has a mean of ~105.7. To balance the risk of stockouts during the next expected upswing against holding costs, I am using a recent_N window for mu_hat covering these oscillations (N=16, from P22 onwards). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. While on-hand inventory is low (54), the in-transit pipeline (483) is substantial, including large orders from P34-P36 (130, 138, 100) arriving in the next three periods. These arrivals will satisfy upcoming demand, so I maintain the current strategy to avoid over-ordering during the downward part of the cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 22-37 is confirmed as a high-amplitude oscillation with a composite mean of ~106 units and high standard deviation. A low demand point occurred at P37 (54 units), consistent with previous cyclical dips.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 22 is characterized by high-amplitude oscillations. Recently, demand has hit a low point (Period 37: 54 units, Period 38: 40 units), which historically precedes a rebound toward the 130+ range (as seen in Periods 22-25 and 33-34). Currently, on-hand inventory is 144 units and in-transit is 395 units (total pipeline of 539). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is 80%. To capture the likely upcoming demand rebound while acknowledging the recent lows, I will set mu_hat using the recent 10-period window (P29-P38) which covers a full oscillation cycle, resulting in a mean of approx 106 units per period. This provides a balanced forecast that accounts for the high volatility (sigma_hat) without over-reacting to the two most recent low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 22-38 continues high-amplitude oscillations; Periods 37-38 represent a 'low' phase (avg 47 units) compared to the 'high' phase (avg ~130 units). Prepare for potential rebound.

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is currently in a high-amplitude oscillation regime. Over the last 18 periods (P22-P39), we've observed distinct 'high' phases (averaging ~130-140 units) and 'low' phases (averaging ~40-80 units). Periods 37-39 represent a low phase with demands of 54, 40, and 90 units. Based on previous cycles, a rebound toward the high phase is expected. Since current on-hand inventory is 192 and the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we need to ensure enough stock is in the pipeline to cover the next 5 periods (L+1). A recent_N of 18 periods for mu_hat accurately captures this oscillating mean (~106 units), while a recent_N of 18 for sigma_hat captures the high volatility (std ~30) inherent in this pattern. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as lead times have been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand oscillation continued into Period 39; the 'low' phase (P37-P39) averaged 61.3 units, significantly lower than the P22-P39 composite mean of ~106 units. Anticipate a rebound to 130+ units based on history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-amplitude oscillatory pattern. We are currently in a 'low' phase (Periods 37-40), where demand averaged 62.8 units (54, 40, 90, 67). History suggests this is frequently followed by a 'rebound' to a 'high' phase averaging ~130 units. To prepare for this transition while the current average is suppressed, I will use an 'explicit' forecast for mu_hat. I estimate the upcoming rebound at approximately 125 units per period. Over the review plus lead time (5 periods), this totals 625 units. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=19 (covering the oscillation regime since Period 22) to capture the high volatility inherent in these swings. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P33-P36. On-hand plus pipeline inventory (225 + 269 = 494) is currently below the expected demand for the lead time if a rebound occurs, justifying a significant order to reach a base stock level that prevents stockouts during the next peak.

Carry-over insight: Oscillation regime confirmed (P22-P40): Demand cycles between 'low' phases (~60 units) and 'high' phases (~130 units). Current P37-P40 interval (mean 62.8) represents a low phase; a rebound is expected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a high-amplitude oscillating pattern between 'low' phases (~60 units) and 'high' phases (~130 units). Current demand in Period 41 was 94 units, which is a significant increase from the Period 38-40 lows (40, 90, 67), suggesting the expected rebound towards the 'high' phase is underway. Historically, these oscillations complete a cycle every 8-10 periods. We are currently 5 periods into the most recent cycle that started with a downturn at Period 37. To capture this cyclicality while ensuring enough stock for the impending peak, I am using an explicit forecast. The expected demand for the next 5 periods (Review + Lead Time) is projected to return to the high phase average (approx. 130 per period). Therefore, mu_hat is set to 130 * 5 = 650. This accounts for the 1-period current demand plus the 4-period lead time. sigma_hat is set to an explicit value of 80 to account for the high variance observed between oscillation phases (stdev ~35 per period across the L+1 window). Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from Period 37-40 'low' phase (avg ~63) started in Period 41 (94). Anticipate sustained 'high' phase demand (avg ~130) for the next 3-4 periods based on historical oscillation cycles.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a high-amplitude demand oscillation pattern. Following a 'low' phase (Periods 37-40, mean ~63), Period 41 (94) and Period 42 (129) indicate the start of the expected 'high' phase. Based on historical cycles (e.g., P22-P25, P33-P36), high phases typically average ~130 units per period. To prevent stockouts during this 4-period lead-time window, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 650 (representing 5 periods * 130 per period) to account for the sustained rebound. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My sigma_hat is also set higher using recent history (N=10) to account for the volatility inherent in these regime shifts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand phase confirmed: Demand rose from 94 (P41) to 129 (P42), consistent with historical rebounding oscillation cycles that average ~130 units per period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a high-amplitude oscillation pattern between approximately 60 and 130+ units. We are currently in a confirmed 'high' demand phase, with Periods 42 and 43 recording demands of 129 and 118 respectively. Based on historical cycles (e.g., P22-P25, P33-P36), these high phases typically last 4-5 periods before dipping again. Therefore, I am forecasting a mean demand (mu_hat) of 130 units per period for the upcoming (L+1) window to ensure sufficient service levels during this rebound. The lead time L is stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (excluding P43's arrival which is expected in the next period's concluding message as P39's order was 0). Sigma_hat is set using a recent_N of 10 to capture the current high-volatility oscillation regime (P34-P43), which covers both the recent low and the current high phase.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a high-amplitude oscillation pattern. Period 44 saw a dip to 70 units, which followed a high-demand phase (P41-P43 averaged ~114). Historically, these phases oscillate between averages of ~60 ('low') and ~130 ('high'). We are currently in a transition period. The most recent oscillations (P37-P44) have a composite mean of ~90. However, to account for the periodic rebounds and the potential for shifts towards the higher end of the range, I will use a recent_N of 8 (covering P37-P44) to capture the full cycle's mean and volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 83, with a healthy pipeline of 557, so the backend's capped policy will manage the order size appropriately.

Carry-over insight: Demand oscillation cycle (P37-P44) confirmed: includes a 'low' phase (avg ~62) and a 'high' phase (avg ~114), resulting in a composite cycle mean of ~90 units. Cycle length appears to be approx. 8 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to follow a cyclical oscillation pattern. Period 45 demand (63) aligns with the 'low' phase (avg ~62) identified in Carry-over insights, following a recent 'high' phase in Periods 42-43. Historically, these low phases last between 2 to 4 periods. Since Period 44 (70) and Period 45 (63) were both low, a rebound towards the 'high' phase (avg ~130) is anticipated imminently. The composite cycle mean is approximately 90-100 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are ordering for Period 50. With 197 units on-hand and 380 units in-transit (Total pipeline: 577), and the game ending at Period 50, we must avoid over-ordering which would lead to high holding costs at the conclusion. We use recent_N (N=9) to capture the current oscillation cycle (from P37) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend accounts for both the recent low and upcoming high volatility. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand oscillation cycle (P37-P45) maintains a 'low' phase average of ~64 (P37-P40, P44-P45) and a 'high' phase average of ~114 (P41-P43), with an overall cycle mean near 90 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) follows an oscillating pattern with a cycle length of approximately 8 periods, moving between a 'high' phase (~110-130 units) and a 'low' phase (~60-90 units). Periods 44-46 (demand: 70, 63, 88) currently represent the late 'low' phase or the early transition to a high phase. Given the game ends at Period 50 and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 47) would arrive in Period 51, which is outside the relevant game horizon. However, to maintain the policy, I estimate demand based on the recent cycle mean. For mu_hat, I use N=10 to capture the full recent oscillation cycle (Periods 37-46), which covers both the low and high extremes, resulting in a balanced mean (~90 units). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect the volatility inherent in these oscillations. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand oscillation cycle P37-P46 remains consistent with a mean of approximately 90 units, alternating between phases of ~65 and ~115 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-57.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a cyclical oscillation pattern. Currently, we are in a 'low' phase that began around Period 44 (P44: 70, P45: 63, P46: 88, P47: 63). The average demand during this low phase is approximately 71 units, compared to the 'high' phase average of approximately 114-130 units. Based on historical cycles (approximately 8 periods per full cycle), we expect to remain in or transition out of this low phase shortly. Given the lead time is 4 periods, looking at (L+1)=5 periods of demand coverage is essential. On-hand inventory is high (309), and in-transit is 117. Total pipeline is 426 units. To avoid excessive holding costs in the final periods of the game (ending at Period 50), I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent cycle average (~90 units) to maintain a lean but safe inventory level. Using recent_N with N=11 covers the most recent full oscillation cycle (P37-P47) to capture both 'low' and 'high' phases for a balanced forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-201.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The current demand regime (P37-P48) follows an oscillating pattern with a cycle length of approximately 8 periods. We have just completed a 'low' phase (P44-P48) where demand averaged 65.8 units. Based on the historical cycle observed in Periods 22-48, we anticipate a rebound to the 'high' phase (~115-130 units) starting within the next 1-2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (381 units) due to arrivals from previous high orders (P40-P44) meeting low demand. However, pipeline inventory is very low (only 24 units in transit). Given the lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 53 (beyond the game end at Period 50). Therefore, the primary objective is to manage the existing 381 units to cover the remaining demand for Periods 49 and 50 while minimizing the holding cost of the excessive stock. Since we cannot receive new stock before the game ends, I will set a small safety order using 'recent_N' to reflect the current cycle's mean demand (~90) and high volatility to ensure the backend logic considers the potential rebound, though the 'cap' will likely limit significant ordering given the high on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand oscillation cycle P37-P48 confirms an 8-period periodicity: 'low' phase (P44-P48 avg 66) is concluding; 'high' phase rebound (~115+) is expected to start around P49-P50.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are at the end of a 'low' demand phase (P44-P49 mean ~67 units) and entering the expected 'high' phase rebound (~115+ units) based on the 8-period oscillation cycle identified in previous periods. The on-hand inventory is high (303) due to low demand in recent periods, while pipeline inventory is low (55 units) because orders were curtailed (P45-P47 ordered 0) to prevent overstocking. Since L=4, the OR backend must account for the next 5 periods of demand (Review + Lead Time). I am setting mu_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9, covering P41-P49) to capture the full oscillation cycle mean (approx 84 units) which balances the historical highs and lows. This will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock that bridges the inventory gap as we transition into the high-demand phase while accounting for the high on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand oscillation cycle P37-P49 confirmed: cycle consists of ~4 periods of 'low' demand (avg ~65) followed by ~4 periods of 'high' demand (avg ~115). Period 50 marks the probable start of a 'high' demand rebound.
