Five periods (L+1) of demand at the recent average of 81.4 units equals 407 units. Currently, the pipeline is sufficient to cover this.

Strategy: The OR recommendation of 154 units is based on the older, higher demand average. Following 154 units would lead to excessive holding costs given current on-hand stock and the lower demand regime. Total current inventory (188) + Pipeline (178) = 366 units.

Expected demand over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) at a mean of ~100/period is 500 units. The current total inventory perfectly covers this. However, since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (P46) will arrive in P50 conclusion (visible at start of P51), meaning they will only be available to satisfy demand in Period 50 if lead time is exactly 4 periods and arrives before demand resolution.
