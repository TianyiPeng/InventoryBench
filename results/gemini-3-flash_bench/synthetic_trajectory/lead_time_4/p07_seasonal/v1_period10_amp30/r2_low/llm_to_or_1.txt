Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips (Regular) with a promised lead time (L) of 4. There is no historical data yet aside from the provided initial samples (P1-P5). Demand samples are: 76, 130, 159, 101, 78. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory. Since the profit to holding cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5 (Z=0), meaning we aim to meet the median demand. I will initialize L to 'default' (4) and use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 5 provided samples to establish an initial baseline. Since demand is somewhat volatile (76 to 159), N=5 is the maximum available and reasonable to capture this initial variance.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 168 units. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms this order was placed, but arrivals haven't occurred yet as the promised lead time is 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning demand in Period 1 (115 units) resulted in lost sales. Historical demand samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) show an average of approximately 108.8 units per period. The Period 1 actual demand was 115, which is consistent with the history. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (the length of provided historical samples) to establish a baseline forecast until we see actual lead time performance. With Lead Time L=4, the backend will target covering (1+4)=5 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), we have experienced 0 sales across Period 1 and 2 because starting on-hand inventory was 0 and no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which explains why the orders from Period 1 (168 units) and Period 2 (167 units) are still in-transit. Based on the demand samples provided (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) and the observed demand in the game history (P1: 115, P2: 109), the mean demand is roughly 110-120 units per period. With a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. The current pipeline (in-transit) is 335 units, which covers approximately 3 periods of demand. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations using the last 5 samples to capture the current demand level while relying on the default promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The historical demand for chips(Regular) across the first three periods is remarkably stable, averaging 113.33 units per period (115, 109, 116). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 4, the initial order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (L=4 means N+L = 1+4=5). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations in the history are expected and consistent with the promised lead time. Currently, we have 497 units in transit (168 from P1, 167 from P2, 162 from P3), and we are stock-out (on-hand = 0) because arrivals haven't started. For the parameters, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the very consistent demand level observed so far. I will stick with the promised lead time (L=default) as there is no evidence yet to suggest it has drifted.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 should arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and become visible in Period 6's update. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (which is expected given the lead time). The historical demand over the first 4 periods is relatively stable: 115, 109, 116, 107 (average of 111.75). The samples provided in the prompt (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) seem inconsistent with the game history demand, so I will prioritize the observed game history for the current regime. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Total demand over 5 periods is approx 558 units. Current in-transit is 567, which covers the expected demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current stable demand mean and standard deviation from the actual game history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Analysis of the history shows that the order placed in Period 1 arrived at the conclusion of Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4. Demand has been relatively stable over the first five periods (115, 109, 116, 107, 107), with a mean of 110.8 and a low standard deviation (~4). Currently, there are 61 units on-hand and 399 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4). Since the in-transit pipeline (399) plus on-hand (61) equals 460 units, and expected demand over the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 5) is approximately 554 units (110.8 * 5), the system needs to maintain a consistent base stock. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the stable recent demand pattern while ignoring any potential noise from the pre-game samples if they differed significantly (though here they are provided separately). The backend will calculate the order to cover the (L+1) horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-30.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The 'Period 5 conclude' and 'Period 6 conclude' messages confirm that orders from Period 1 and Period 2 arrived exactly after 4 periods (Lead Time = 4). Historical demand data provided (6 periods of active demand: 115, 109, 116, 107, 107, 99) shows a stable demand regime with a mean of approximately 108.8 units and a standard deviation of approximately 6.0 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 129 units, and in-transit is 326 units. Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will use the default method for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the demand behavior since the start of the simulation, which reflects a consistent pattern without significant shifts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6). Demand stable around 109 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-175.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7. The inventory position is currently healthy with 233 units on-hand and 254 units in-transit (orders from Periods 4, 6, and 7). Demand has been relatively stable, averaging around 101.5 units across all 7 periods, though Period 7 saw a significant drop to 58 units. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should ideally align with the mean demand over the risk period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the recent mean demand (excluding the outlier in Period 7) to set mu_hat, while using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen lately. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 matches observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-185.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are observing a significant drop in demand. The first five periods averaged 110.8 units (115, 109, 116, 107, 107), while the most recent three periods (P6-P8) have averaged 72 units (99, 58, 59). This suggests a demand regime shift downwards. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (confirmed by P1-P4 arrivals). On-hand inventory is currently high at 244 units, and with 205 units in-transit (orders from P6-P8), we are well-covered. I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the lower demand trend (approx 72 units/period). This results in a target stock covering (1+4)*72 = 360 units, which the OR engine will use to calculate the order size relative to current pipeline inventory. This approach reduces the risk of overstocking and high holding costs in this lower demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg decreased from 111 to 72 (-35%) based on last 3 periods (P6-P8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-90.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are managing chips(Regular). The current environment shows a sustained demand shift that began around Period 6. Historical mean demand was ~111, but the last 4 periods (P6-P9) average 73.25 (99, 58, 59, 77). The previous Carry-over Insight flagged this at Period 9, and P9's demand (77) continues this lower trend. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, P8 concludes all showed LT=4). On-hand inventory is 167, and in-transit is 205 (orders from P6, P7, and P8). Since the total pipeline (372) is high relative to the new demand regime (73.25 * 5 = 366.25), and profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend needs to target a 50% service level. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand and volatility of the current regime, and 'default' for L since it matches the observations perfectly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11. Analyzing lead times: Orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 have all arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods (as confirmed in concluding messages for P5, P6, P7, P8, and P10). The order from Period 5 was 0 units, so no arrival message was expected in P9. Thus, Lead Time (L) is stable at 4. Regarding demand: A regime shift was previously identified at Period 6. Demand for P6-P10 was [99, 58, 59, 77, 146]. The spike to 146 in Period 10 is significant, but the average since Period 6 is approximately 87.8 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 115, and in-transit is 111 (orders from P7 and P8). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the service level q = 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the recent regime including the latest spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean since P6 recalculated to ~88 units/period (was ~72) due to P10 spike (146 units). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

In Period 12, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by the arrival of the Period 7 order in Period 11). Demand has shown significant volatility recently: while the mean from Period 1-5 was ~109, the mean from Period 6-11 is ~90, but with a recent spike to 146 in Period 10 and 99 in Period 11. Specifically, mean(P6-P11) = (99+58+59+77+146+99)/6 = 89.67. Standard deviation in this later period is also higher (std ~34). I will use N=6 for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this more recent, more volatile regime (P6-P11). The target base stock covers lead time + current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current pipeline inventory (169 in-transit) plus on-hand (106) equals 275. With an expected demand of ~90/period, 275 units cover roughly 3 periods, suggesting the backend should place an order to cover the 5-period window.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13. Examining the history and carry-over insights, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, and P12). The demand regime changed at Period 6. Since Period 6, demand values have been [99, 58, 59, 77, 146, 99, 103], with a mean of approximately 91.5 units and a standard deviation of approximately 30 units. The previous insight from Period 11 noted a mean of ~88; the subsequent periods 11 and 12 (99 and 103) have slightly increased this average. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 to capture this post-P5 regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent volatility (the P10 spike) with the more stable demand seen in the most recent periods. Currently, on-hand is low (24), but there is a significant pipeline (292), specifically orders from P11 (148) and P12 (144) which are expected to arrive in P15 and P16 respectively.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 6 refined: mean is ~92 units/period, showing moderate volatility (std ~30). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand spiked significantly to 157 units, exhausting current on-hand inventory and resulting in lost sales (sold only 24). The inventory is currently 0, with 434 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Since Period 6, demand has shown high volatility with two major spikes (P10: 146, P13: 157) and a low of 58. The average demand for the 'recent' regime (P6-P13) is approximately 99.75 units/period. Given the high stock-out risk seen in P13 and equal profit/holding costs ($1.0), I will use the last 8 periods (P6-P13) to capture this higher volatility and mean. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P6 updated: mean ~100 units/period with significant volatility (std ~36). High demand spikes (146, 157) suggest a need for higher safety stock to avoid stock-outs.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 15. The promised lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, which is confirmed by multiple arrivals (P1-P4, P6-P8). However, we are currently experiencing a stock-out (on-hand: 0) because no units arrived in Period 13 or 14 (orders from P9 and P10 were zero units, which is consistent with the decision to not order during those periods of high on-hand inventory). Demand shifted around Period 6. Since P6, demand has averaged approximately 97.7 units per period (879 units over 9 periods), with significant variability including spikes of 146 and 157. To capture the current regime while accounting for recent high demand and preventing future stock-outs, I will use recent_N with N=9 (from Period 6 to Period 14). L will be set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 ensures the backend calculates the base stock based on the post-shift demand distribution (including the recent higher variance).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 6 confirmed: mean ~98 units/period, high volatility (std ~35). Stock-out occurred in P13-P14 due to zero-order decisions in P9-P10 following a lead-time mismatch in inventory peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the on-hand inventory is 29 units. The Period 15 conclusion shows that the order placed in Period 11 (148 units) arrived after a lead time of 4 periods. This confirms the lead time remains stable at 4. Demand for Period 15 was 119 units, which aligns with the high-demand regime identified since Period 6. Based on data from Period 6 to Period 15, the average demand is approximately 99.7 units with a standard deviation of 33.1. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). High volatility and previous stock-outs (P13-P14) suggest N=10 is appropriate to capture the current regime's mean and variance. I will use L=4 and recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the pipeline covers projected demand effectively.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 6 confirmed: mean ~100 units/period, high volatility (std ~33). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we have 87 units on-hand and 326 units in-transit (orders from P13, P14, and P16). Based on the 4-period lead time, P13's order (142 units) is due to arrive at the end of this period (visible in Period 18's start), bringing total expected on-hand soon to 229 units. The demand regime starting since Period 6 shows a mean of approximately 102 units and a standard deviation of 31 units. The recent demand (last 11 periods) reflects this volatility clearly. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple deliveries (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, P11, P12). To maintain a proper buffer against high-demand spikes (like the 146 and 157 units observed earlier) and avoid the stock-outs seen in P13-P14, the base stock targeting (L+1) periods of demand should be adjusted based on the current regime.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, the demand regime since Period 6 remains the focus. Analyzing demand from P6 to P17 (12 samples: 99, 58, 59, 77, 146, 99, 103, 157, 80, 119, 86, 96), the mean is 98.3 and the standard deviation is approximately 29.8. Lead time (L) is consistently observed at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P15, P16, and P17). Current inventory is 133 units on-hand with 264 units in-transit (orders from P14, P16, and P17). The OR backend calculation for base_stock will use (1+L) periods, so 5 periods of demand. With a target service level of 50% (since Profit $1.0 = Holding $1.0), the formula aims for the mean demand. However, historical spikes (146, 157) and the recent stock-out in P13-14 advise using recent samples to capture the increased volatility. I will use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the regime starting at P6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-122.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe an ending on-hand inventory of 160 units following Period 18's demand of 38 units. The lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P14 order arrived P18). Demand analysis: The current regime (since Period 6) shows a mean of ~95.7 units/period with significant volatility (std ~34). Recent demand in Period 18 dropped to 38, but given the historical spikes (157, 146), we must maintain a robust base stock. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for current period + lead time (5 periods total). Pipeline inventory is 294 (orders from P15, P16, P17, P18), and on-hand is 160, totaling 454 units. We will use 'recent_N' with N=13 (covering the regime from P6 to P18) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the current mean and volatility while smoothing out the outlier in P18. This ensures the OR backend maintains a safety stock sufficient to handle the SKU's high volatility (profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a 50% service level target, but the cap and base stock logic will adjust based on the provided sigma).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 6 through Period 18: mean ~96, std ~34. Period 18 demand (38) is a significant low outlier compared to the regime average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the current status is: On-hand inventory of 92 units and Pipeline inventory of 309 units (ordered in P16, P17, P18, P19). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P4, P6-P8, and P11-P14. A demand regime shift was detected at Period 6. From P6 to P19, the mean demand is approximately 92.5 units with a standard deviation of 33.6. Although Period 18 saw a low demand (38) and Period 19 was also below average (68), these appear within the expected volatility range of this regime. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which targets the median of the demand distribution ($z^*=0$). This implies we should target basic coverage of (1+L) periods of demand. I will use a window of the last 14 samples (P6-P19) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this encompasses the entire current demand regime and provides a stable base for the backend OR calculation. L is set to calculated as the lead time is stable at 4.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the current on-hand inventory is 89 units with 248 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated (e.g., P16 order arrived in P20). The demand regime since P6 has been characterized by a mean of approximately 96 units/period and a standard deviation around 34. Recent demand has fluctuated, with a high of 122 in P20 and a significant low of 38 in P18. To capture the current regime while filtering out the outlier from P18 and the older data before the P6 shift, I am setting the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using a recent_N method with N=15. This N covers the history from P6 to P20, balancing long-term stability with recent shifts. Setting L to 'calculate' allows the OR backend to use the confirmed average lead time of 4. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend will aim for a 50% service level plus safety stock calculated via sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 6 through Period 20 confirmed: mean ~96, std ~34. Continued stable lead time of 4 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in a stable demand regime established around Period 6. Based on the data from Period 6 to Period 21, the mean demand is approximately 96 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 34. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods through multiple arrivals (e.g., P17 order arriving in P21). Currently, there are 19 units on hand and 300 units in-transit. The OR backend uses a base stock policy (L+1 periods) where the service level is determined by profit and holding cost ($1 each), implying a target 50% service level for the base stock calculation, though the backend's policy cap uses a 95% threshold. To reflect the most accurate current state, I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=16 (covering the regime from P6 to P21) and 'default' for lead time since the promised lead time of 4 matches the observed actual lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, demand was 124 units but on-hand inventory was only 114, resulting in a stock-out of 10 units. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P18 order arrived in P22). The current demand regime (from Period 6 onwards) is characterized by a mean of approximately 96-100 units/period with high volatility (std dev approx 34). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 360 units (orders from P19-P22). To stabilize the service level given equal profit and holding costs ($1), I will use the recent regime (last 17 periods starting from P6) to estimate demand and volatility. Setting L to 4 reflects the confirmed actual lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The demand regime remains highly volatile with significant spikes; P21-P23 saw demand of 150, 124, and 146, which is substantially higher than the historical average of ~96. The current stock-out state is caused by the small order placed in P19 (15 units) arriving in P23. However, there is a substantial pipeline (480 units) including orders from P20 (58), P21 (132), P22 (155), and P23 (135). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high stock-out risk and recent high demand demand (average ~140 over the last 3 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime since P21 (N=3) to ensure the OR backend targets a higher base stock. Specifically, mu_hat should reflect the mean of P21-P23 (~140) and high volatility to prevent further stock-outs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: mean demand increased to ~140 units/period (from ~96) over the last 3 periods, leading to persistent stock-outs due to insufficient pipeline from earlier periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 21. For Periods 21-24, demand values were 150, 124, 146, and 122, resulting in a mean of 135.5 units/period. The current state is a stock-out (on-hand: 0) due to this increased demand combined with previous lower ordering levels. The lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). To account for the recent shift and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the higher mean (~135.5) and setting sigma_hat with the same window to reflect recent volatility. This will increase the base stock level to better match the current demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: mean increased to ~135 units/period (from ~96) with sustained high demand for 4 consecutive periods (P21-P24).

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 21. While the average for Periods 21-24 was ~135 units, Period 25 dropped to 93 units. However, given the sustained high demand (150, 124, 146, 122) in previous periods and the risk of stock-outs observed in Periods 22-24, I will use a recent window (N=5 for P21-P25) to capture this higher demand regime. The mean for the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is 127 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals, including the P21 order arriving in P25. On-hand inventory is low (39), but in-transit is high (546). The OR backend's base-stock calculation with L=4 and recent demand (N=5) will ensure we maintain a safety buffer for this higher demand level while considering the substantial pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: mean demand increased to ~127 units/period (P21-P25) compared to the previous ~96. High volatility remains present.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 26, demand values were 150, 124, 146, 122, 93, and 99. While the very late values (93, 99) are lower than the initial burst, the average for this 6-period window (P21-P26) is approximately 122.3 units/period, which is significantly higher than the previous regime (mean ~96). I will use N=6 for mu_hat to capture this recent elevated demand level. The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P21 and P22 in P25 and P26. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=6 period to reflect the current volatility (std approx 23.5 in this window), which the backend will use to ensure appropriate safety stock for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: mean demand for P21-P26 is ~122 units/period (compared to previous ~96). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-40.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P21-P27) shows a shift to a mean of approximately 119 units/period (average of 150, 124, 146, 122, 93, 99, 95). While there was a significant spike in demand between P21-P24 causing stock-outs, the last three periods (P25-P27) have stabilized back toward a moderate level (~96 units). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 135 units and 382 units in-transit (covering orders from P24-P27), the pipeline is currently well-stocked. We use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variability regime starting from P21 while acknowledging the recent stabilization, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock for the next 5 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P21-P27 shows a mean of ~119 units/period with high volatility; however, the most recent 3 periods (P25-P27) have moderated to a mean of ~96 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-165.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, demand was 67, continuing a downward trend from the high-demand regime observed between Periods 21-24. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P25-P28) has returned to approximately 88.5 units/period, which aligns closer to the historical average before the Period 21 spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 24 order in Period 28. On-hand inventory is high (232) and there are 294 units in-transit. To avoid high holding costs while maintaining a service level, I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (covering the high spike and the subsequent stabilization) to capture recent volatility without over-reacting to the peak. L is set to default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: mean demand has stabilized to ~89 units/period following the Period 21-24 spike (avg ~135).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-96.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has transitioned from a high-demand spike (P21-P24 avg ~135) to a more moderate regime. From P25 to P29, demand has been 93, 99, 95, 67, and 114, resulting in a mean of 93.6 and a standard deviation of 17.5. The recent carry-over insights support a stabilization around ~89-94 units/period following the Period 21-24 surge. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P25 order arrived on P29). With current on-hand inventory at 210 and in-transit at 236, we are well-stocked to handle the current demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this stabilized demand mean and variance, which allows the OR backend to adjust our base stock level downward from the previous spike, reducing holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: mean stabilized to ~94 units/period (P25-P29) with lower volatility (std ~18) compared to the Period 21-24 spike.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after the high demand spike seen in periods 21-24. Since Period 25, demand has averaged approximately 86 units per period (93, 99, 95, 67, 114, 47), though there is significant variability (std ~24). The 'Period 30 conclude' data shows demand dropped to 47, while previous periods showed a mix of low and moderate values. Given the stable lead time of 4 periods, I am choosing N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this current regime (P25-P30). With on-hand inventory at 213 and 208 units in-transit, the system is currently well-stocked, but ordering must continue to maintain the pipeline as older, larger shipments have already arrived.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 25 through Period 30: mean stabilized to ~86 units/period with moderate volatility (std ~24). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-101.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a more stable, lower-volume regime starting from Period 25. The mean demand for the last seven periods (P25-P31) is approximately 87 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 21. This is a significant decrease from the spike observed between P21-P24 (mean ~135). The lead time remains highly consistent at exactly 4 periods, which I will continue to use. Given the current high on-hand inventory (195 units) and the in-transit pipeline (141 units), the total inventory position is 336 units. With a target base stock reflecting the new lower demand (approx 5 periods of demand at ~87 units/period = 435 units), the existing stock covers most of the requirement. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this stabilized demand regime and allow the OR backend to adjust orders downward, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a sufficient safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P25 through P31 confirmed stabilized: mean ~87, std ~21. This represents a significant and sustained drop from the P21-P24 peak.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-demand regime starting around Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 to Period 32 (8 samples), the mean is 89.375 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 19.9. This is a significant decrease from the Period 21-24 peak (~135 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 32 of the order placed in Period 28. With on-hand inventory at 184 and in-transit at 164, the pipeline is currently very high relative to the new demand levels. I will use the recent_N method with N=8 (the duration of the current regime) to capture this stabilized lower demand and allow the OR backend to adjust orders downward, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the profit/holding cost balance.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 to Period 33, the mean is approximately 88.2 units per period with a standard deviation of 19.3. This confirms the 'stabilized' regime noted in previous carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (125) and substantial in-transit units (217), the current pipeline (342 units) is well-aligned with the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (5 periods * ~88 = 440 units). I will continue using recent_N to capture this stable regime, specifically N=9 (P25-P33), to refine mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will maintain an appropriate service level while managing holding costs as the inventory level transitions back toward the base stock target.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 25 following a significant spike in Periods 21-24. Over the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the mean demand is approximately 87 units per period with a standard deviation of 19. The most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) show a mean of 80.4 units, suggesting a slight continued softening, though staying within the stable range identified in carry-over insights. Lead time is reliably 4 periods (L=4). With an on-hand inventory of 66 and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 292 (orders from P31, P32, P33, and P34), the current inventory position is healthy. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=10) to capture this stabilized regime (covering P25-P34) while maintaining enough history to account for moderate volatility. This helps the OR backend maintain a service level that balances the $1.0 profit and $1.0 holding cost.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P25-P35) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 88.5 units/period with a standard deviation of 17.8. In Period 35, the inventory dropped to zero due to low arrivals from earlier small orders (P30: 22 units, P31: 9 units). However, there is a substantial in-transit pipeline of 360 units (P32: 99, P33: 87, P34: 97, P35: 77), with the next shipment (99 units) scheduled to arrive during Period 36. Given the stable demand and healthy pipeline, I will use a recent window of N=11 (P25-P35) to capture the current stable state and set L to 'default' (4 periods) as observed lead times remain consistent.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a stable regime since Period 25. Analyzing the most recent data (P25-P36, n=12), the mean demand is approximately 91.5 units per period with a standard deviation of 17.5. The recent stock-outs in P35 and P36 were driven by the 'bullwhip effect' and low arrival quantities from P30 and P31 orders, rather than a significant demand spike. Currently, there is 340 units in transit, which covers nearly 4 periods of demand at the current rate. I will maintain L=4 (stable) and use the most recent 12 periods to represent the current demand regime (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to balance service levels while managing holding costs as inventory replenishes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 25 through Period 36 stabilized at mean ~92, std ~18.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 25. The mean demand from Period 25 through Period 37 is approximately 91.5 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 17.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals (P33 order arrived in P37). Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 5 units and a pipeline (in-transit) of 359 units. The pipeline consists of orders from P34 (97), P35 (77), P36 (79), and P37 (106). Since the total pipeline + on-hand (364 units) is expected to cover roughly 4 periods of demand at the current rate (91.5 * 4 = 366), the inventory position is lean but balanced. I will use the recent regime (last 13 periods, P25-P37) to set demand parameters, ensuring we stay responsive to the stabilized mean and lower volatility compared to the earlier spike period.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 to Period 38, the mean is approximately 90.5 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. This confirms the previously noted 'stabilized' regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 38 of the order placed in Period 34. Current on-hand inventory is low (13 units), but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline (341 units). Since the backend OR engine uses a base-stock policy (L+1 periods of demand), and we are in a stable regime, I will use N=14 (P25-P38) to capture this stable period for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a balance between the recent stable demand and the inherent volatility of the product, ensuring the order covers the expected demand during the lead time plus the review period (5 periods total).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting P25) has stabilized around a mean of 86 units/period (P25-P39: 1297 total / 15 periods = 86.47). Recent volatility (std) is approximately 21. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current pipeline inventory (353) is high compared to current on-hand (55), due to recent arrivals and pending orders (P36: 79, P37: 106, P38: 79, P39: 89). Demand in P39 (35) was a notably low outlier, but doesn't yet signal a sustained regime shift. I will continue using the stats from the P25-P39 regime (N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring we cover the (L+1) window (5 periods of demand) while the backend handles the service level logic for chips(Regular) where profit equals holding cost (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 25 through Period 39: stabilized mean ~86, std ~21.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 to Period 40, the mean is approximately 90.4 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 21.0. The most recent demand (Period 40) was 115, which is on the higher end of this regime but consistent with previous fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 19 and a significant pipeline (291 units in-transit), the stock level is lean but replenishment is ongoing. Using 'recent_N' with N=16 (covering the stable period from P25 to P40) for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides the most accurate estimation for the current regime while capturing the observed volatility. The OR engine will use these parameters to maintain a base stock level that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1), accounting for the high holding cost and profit being equal ($1.0), which mathematically targets a 50% service level prior to safety stock considerations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 25 through Period 40: mean ~90, std ~21. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 25, although recent data (P40-P41) shows a slight increase (115 units both periods) compared to the long-term average of ~90. The mean demand from Period 25 to 41 is approximately 91.5 units with a standard deviation of 22. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. My strategy is to set L to the promised lead time of 4 and use a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat that captures the post-surge stability while being sensitive to the recent minor uptick. I will use N=17 (Period 25 to 41) to calculate demand statistics. Current on-hand is low (10 units), but in-transit inventory is high (308 units), covering over 3 periods of expected demand. The OR backend will use these parameters to target a safety stock that balances the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost, effectively seeking a 50% service level offset by the lead-time risk.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 is currently in focus, but recent periods (P40-P42) show a spike (mean ~121). Specifically, P42 demand was 133, following two periods of 115. This suggests the previously stabilized mean of ~90 is currently underestimating demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The inventory is currently 0 with 354 units in transit. To avoid stock-outs during this potential new upward shift, I will use a recent_N approach for demand mean (mu_hat) focusing on the last 18 periods (since P25) to capture the long-term stabilization but will monitor the recent spike closely. I'll use recent_N for sigma to capture the increased volatility (std ~24 over that period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 remains the most relevant, but recent periods (P40-P43) have shown an uptick in demand (averaging ~119 units) compared to the previous stable mean of ~90. This has resulted in on-hand inventory hitting zero in Period 42 and 43. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 366 units in transit (ordered in P40: 17, P41: 123, P42: 125, P43: 101) and a current on-hand of 0, I need to ensure the order covers the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Using the recent 19 periods (P25-P43) captures the stabilized period and the recent rise. N=19 provides a mean of ~93 units. Given the recent stockouts, I will use recent_N with N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect both the stable base and the recent volatility, while maintaining L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean since P25 updated to ~93 units/period (P25-P43) with a noticeable uptick in the last 4 periods (avg ~119), leading to stock-outs in P42-P43.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 42, we have experienced stock-outs due to a demand uptick that started around Period 41. The demand for the last 4 periods (P41-P44) has been 115, 133, 114, and 90, averaging 113 units/period. This is a significant increase from the previous stabilized mean of ~86. Looking at the history, demand spikes often last for several periods (e.g., P21-P24). Despite the drop to 90 units in P44, the previous three periods suggest a regime shift or a cyclic peak. I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to set the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this higher mean (~113) while keeping sigma calculation sensitive to recent volatility. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, but there is a substantial pipeline of 445 units (orders from P41, P42, P43, P44). The order from P41 (123 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P45. Using 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat helps the OR backend adjust to the most recent demand level and volatility to recover from the stock-out state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41: mean increased to ~113 units/period (P41-P44) compared to the previous ~86, causing stock-outs in P42-P44.

=== Period 45 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 41, with the mean demand increasing to approximately 113 units per period (P41-P44 average). Although Period 45 showed a lower demand of 84, the preceding four periods (115, 133, 114, 90) indicate a higher sustained level compared to the previous stable period. This shift led to stock-outs in Periods 42-44 because the pipeline from the previous lower-demand regime (Period 40 order was only 17 units) was insufficient. In-transit inventory is currently high (442 units) due to aggressive ordering since Period 41 to compensate for these stock-outs. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To stabilize and account for the recent higher demand while acknowledging the volatility, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (covering the shift since P41) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41 confirmed: mean increased to ~107 units/period (P41-P45) compared to previous ~86, though volatility remains high (std ~20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-18.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 41, increasing to a mean of approximately 102 units/period (P41-P46) compared to the previous ~86. The last two periods (P45-P46) have shown lower demand (84 and 73), which smoothed the average slightly from the earlier P41-P44 spike (~113). The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. With 91 units on hand and 372 units in-transit (orders from P43, P44, P45, P46), the pipeline is healthy. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the shift beginning at P41, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility (std approx 24 for this period). This approach ensures we maintain sufficient stock for the elevated demand regime while accounting for the high per-period variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41 confirmed: mean increased to ~102 units/period (P41-P46) with significant volatility (std ~24). Previous mean was ~86.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-66.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the system is recovering from a previous demand spike and subsequent stock-outs (P42-P44). Currently, on-hand inventory is 129 with 316 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P43 order arrived in P47). Demand since Period 41 shows an average of ~102 units with significant volatility (std ~24). However, the last three periods (P45-P47) have seen a cool-down in demand (84, 73, 63), averaging 73.3 units. Given this recent drop, using the full regime since Period 41 (N=7) for the mean provides a balanced estimate (~102), but I will use recent_N with N=7 for sigma_hat to capture the volatility from the P42-P43 spike. This helps the OR backend maintain a safe buffer while accounting for the recent deceleration to prevent excessive holding costs. The game is near the end (Period 48/50), so pipeline inventory from earlier large orders (P44-P46) will satisfy remaining periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-123.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward trend over the last 3 periods (P46: 73, P47: 63, P48: 51), moving away from the previously identified elevated mean of ~102 since P41. The average demand of these last 3 periods is ~62.3. However, with only 50 periods total and this being Period 49, the game is ending. We currently have 174 units on-hand and 255 units in-transit (orders from P45, P46, P47, P48), totaling 429 units of pipeline inventory. Given that only two demand resolutions remain (P49 and P50) and our current pipeline is extremely high relative to recent demand (covering ~7 periods at the recent rate), the priority is minimizing holding costs. I will set the demand parameters using the last 8 samples (capturing the P41 shift and the recent decline) and use 'calculate' for lead time as it remains stable at 4. The backend will likely order 0 or very small amounts due to the high pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-124.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent downward trend, with the last four periods (P46-P49) averaging approximately 68 units/period, compared to the previous regime (P41-P45) which averaged around 107 units/period. The current high on-hand inventory (209 units) and pipeline (158 units) are more than sufficient to cover demand for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (5 periods total), especially given the moderating demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for potential demand volatility (which has been historical for this SKU), I will use the recent N method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current lower-demand regime. Specifically, using N=9 captures the transition from the high-demand spike back to the current lower levels (P41-P49), balancing the forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 46: mean demand has decreased to ~68 units/period (P46-P49) compared to the previous Period 41-45 mean of ~107.
