Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The on-hand inventory is 0. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have very few historical demand samples (5 periods total: 76, 130, 159, 101, 78), the mean demand is approx 108.8 and the standard deviation is approx 35.5. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current demand level. For the lead time L, I will use the 'default' method (promised lead time of 4). The OR backend will compute a base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 4/(4+1) = 0.8, which translates to a z-score of ~0.84. This conservative approach ensures we start building inventory to meet the observed demand while waiting for the first delivery in Period 5.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 168 units, but due to the promised lead time of 4 periods, they are in-transit and won't arrive until roughly Period 5. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we lost 115 units of demand in Period 1 because the game starts with 0 inventory. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including what we've seen so far) shows: 76, 130, 159, 101, 78. Current demand (115) is within the expected range. Since we have no actual lead time arrivals recorded yet, I will use the 'default' lead time (promised L=4). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' which calculates the mean and standard deviation across all available samples (Period 1-5 data provided in the prompt), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the lead time. Total in-transit is 331 units (168 from P1, 163 from P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order from P1 is expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in P6. Historical demand for the first two periods (115, 109) is slightly higher than the provided historical samples (mean ~109 vs 76-159 range). Since we only have 2 periods of active game history, I will use a balanced approach. I'll stick to 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to incorporate the available data points, acknowledging that early stockouts (sold=0) are expected given L=4.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 haven't arrived yet, which is expected since the earliest they would arrive is during Period 5 (L=4). Demand at the start of the game was higher than the provided historical samples (Mean: 110 over P1-P3 vs Mean: 109 over Historical Period 1-5). Demand has been stable: Period 1 (115), Period 2 (109), Period 3 (116). We currently have zero on-hand inventory and 493 units in-transit (P1-P3 orders). Using recent_N for demand parameters since the active game demand (N=3) is slightly higher and more consistent than the initial historical data provided. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4 until arrival data proves otherwise.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, an order was placed; according to the 'Promised Lead Time' definition, this order (placed in Period 1) should arrive during Period 1+4=5 and its arrival will be confirmed in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (visible at the start of Period 6). Therefore, current stockouts (0 sold) are expected as no arrivals have occurred yet. Historical demand for the 5-period sample provided shows a mean of 108.8 units [(76+130+159+101+78)/5] and a standard deviation of approximately 34.6. However, looking at the game history for Periods 1-4, the demand recorded (115, 109, 116, 107) is extremely stable with a mean of 111.75. Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet, there is no evidence that the actual lead time differs from the promised lead time (L=4). I will use the default lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stability observed in the actual game history over the last 4 periods, which ensures we are ordering enough to cover the (L+1) window of ~558 units.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4. Analysis of 'Period 5 conclude' shows the Period 1 order arrived exactly in 4 periods (ordered P1, arrived P5), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Demand has been incredibly stable: samples are 115, 109, 116, 107, 107 (Mean \u2248 111, Std Dev \u2248 4). The 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the prompt (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) appears to be either pre-game data or from a different context, as the actual game history (Periods 1-5) shows a much tighter range around 110. I will prioritize the 5 observed periods of game history. Currently, On-hand = 61 and In-transit = 406 (from orders in P2, P3, P4). Since the lead time is 4, demand for the current period (P6) plus lead time (P7, P8, P9, P10) must be covered. I'll use L=4. For demand forecasting, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture that stable mean of ~111, which results in a mu_hat of approx 555 for the (1+L) period. Sigma is very low, but I will allow the backend to compute standard deviation from these 5 samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand regime is stable with a mean of ~111 over the first 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $271.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand over the first 6 periods has been relatively stable, with values of 115, 109, 116, 107, 107, and 99 (Mean \u2248 108.8). The promised lead time (L) is 4, and the last two arrivals (orders from P1 and P2) confirmed an actual lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 125, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 339 (orders from P3, P4, and P6). Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) = 464. Based on a lead time of 4, we need coverage for 5 periods (L+1). With an average demand of ~109, the expected demand over 5 periods is 545. Our current total inventory (464) is slightly below this, likely triggering an order from the backend. Since the demand and lead time are stable, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the most relevant data, and 'default' for L since it aligns with observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (P1-P3 arrivals) confirms an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. Since P5, we have seen consistent arrivals, ending the period of stockouts caused by the initial lead time delay. Demand history for the first five periods averaged ~109 units (115, 109, 116, 107, 107). However, in Period 7, demand dropped significantly to 58. It is too early to call this a regime shift, as it might be a random fluctuation. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=7) to incorporate the recent data while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility introduced by the Period 7 drop. On-hand and in-transit units are currently high due to the catch-up of early orders, but since Lead Time = 4, we must maintain a pipeline to cover the 5-period window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-15.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analyzing the history, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). There is a significant demand regime shift starting around Period 7. While early demand (P1-P5) averaged ~111, the last two periods have dropped significantly to 58 and 59. This suggests a new demand regime or a seasonal drop. My strategy is to set L to the promised 4 periods (since it is matches observations) and adjust mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P6-P8) to capture this downward trend (averaging (99+58+59)/3 = 72). A lower mu_hat will prevent over-ordering and minimize holding costs while the on-hand inventory (251) and in-transit (236) are already high relative to current sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 7: Demand dropped from a mean of ~110 to ~60 (-45% decrease).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10. Based on history, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). A significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 7: the mean demand dropped from ~109 (P1-P6) to ~65 (P7-P9). The in-transit inventory is 236 units (P6: 96, P7: 92, P8: 48). No order was placed in P9, which was correct given the high on-hand stock (174) and pipeline. We expect arrivals in Period 10 (from P6 order), Period 11 (from P7 order), and Period 12 (from P8 order). To account for the recent demand drop, I am setting N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations (capturing Periods 7, 8, and 9). The L parameter remains at the promised lead time of 4.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Analyzing the history: The promised lead time is 4. Concluded orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 all confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. The order from Period 5 was 0. The order placed in Period 7 (92 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 11 (visible at start of Period 12). Regarding demand: A regime shift occurred around Period 7. Demand for Periods 1-6 averaged ~109. Demand for Periods 7-10 was [58, 59, 77, 146], averaging 85. However, Period 10's 146 is a significant outlier compared to the 60-70 range seen in Period 7-9. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new regime (including the recent spike) for both mean and standard deviation. L remains 4. On-hand is 124, and in-transit is 140 (sum of orders from P7:92 and P8:48). Total pipeline (264) covers approximately 3 periods of the new average demand, so the OR backend will decide if a new order is needed to meet the (L+1)=5 period coverage goal.

Period 5 (no order) and Period 9 (no arrival because no order P5) follow this logic. Demand context: Initial 6 periods averaged ~108.8; Periods 7-9 saw a dip (~64.7); however, Periods 10 and 11 show a significant recovery (146, 99). The mean of the last 5 samples (P7-P11) is 87.8. Given the recent rebound in P10 and P11, using N=5 for demand better captures the current mix of lower and recovering demand without overreacting to the single spike in P10. Inventory update: On-hand is 117, in-transit is 202 (orders from P8, P11, and others). Lead time L is set to calculate as it is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased after Period 9: Demand rebounded from a low mean of ~65 (P7-P9) to a recovery mean of ~122.5 (P10-P11). Baseline demand now reflects a higher variance regime.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 10-12) shows a recovery from the low-demand trough of Periods 7-9. Demand for the last three periods has averaged 116 units (146, 99, 103), which is very close to the initial mean of 111 observed in Periods 1-5. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of shipments from Periods 1 through 8 (all showing exactly 4 periods). We currently have an on-hand inventory of 62 and a large pipeline of 302 units (orders from P11 and P12). With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the recent_N method with N=3 for demand parameters (mu and sigma) captures the recovery regime while ignoring the temporary drop in Periods 7-9. This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock level that accommodates the return to 100+ unit demand while maintaining the 4-period holding cost and service level trade-off.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime recovery confirmed starting Period 10: mean demand has returned to ~116 (previously ~65 in P7-P9). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory was exhausted (sold 62 units out of 157 demand), resulting in significant lost sales. No arrival occurred in Period 13 because no order was placed in Period 9. The pipeline (In-transit: 461) consists of orders from Periods 10, 11, 12, and 13. With a confirmed stable lead time of 4 periods, the next arrival (Period 10 order) will occur during Period 14. Demand has clearly recovered from the P7-P9 dip. The last 4 periods (P10-P13) show demand values of 146, 99, 103, and 157, averaging 126.25. This is higher than the initial regime mean of ~111. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand, higher-variance recovery phase. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 matches the consistently observed actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Significant stockout occurred in Period 13 (demand 157 vs on-hand 62). Demand mean in recovery phase (P10-P13) is 126.25, reflecting higher volume and volatility than the pre-dip baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an inventory crisis for chips(Regular) with 0 units on-hand and a stockout in both Period 13 and Period 14. This occurred because orders from Period 9 (0 order) and Period 10 (0 order) resulted in no arrivals during Periods 13 and 14, given the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. The demand has stabilized into a higher volatility 'recovery' regime since Period 10. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 117, but it includes wide swings (80 to 157). Given the stockout and the lead time of 4, we need to ensure the pipeline of 636 units (ordered P11-P14) covers the next (L+1)=5 periods. Setting L to 'default' (4) is correct as it remains stable. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 (P10-P14) captures the current higher-volume/volatility state better than the long-term average which includes the P7-P9 dip. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to provide the OR engine with the updated volatility necessary to calculate an appropriate safety stock and help recover service levels.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand volatility (P10-P14) is higher than the initial baseline (std dev ~31 vs ~3), requiring higher sigma estimates to avoid stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $441.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following a dip (P7-P9), with the current recovery phase (starting P10) showing a higher mean and increased volatility compared to the initial periods. The mean demand from P10 to P15 is approximately 117.3, with a significant spike of 157 in P13 followed by 119 in P15. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P11 order in P15. Current on-hand inventory is 35 units, while the pipeline is 493 units covering the next 4 periods. Given the high demand variance (std dev ~31 during recovery), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current regime characteristics (P10-P15). L is set to default as the promised 4 periods aligns with observed performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery phase (P10-P15) confirmed: mean demand ~117 (increased from the P7-P9 dip of ~65), accompanied by higher volatility (std dev ~31).

Daily Reward (R_t): $247.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following a dip in Periods 7-9. Since Period 10, the mean demand is approximately 115 with higher volatility compared to the initial periods. Significant stockouts occurred in Periods 13 and 14 due to a temporary lull in arrivals (Periods 9, 13, and 14 had no arrivals). Recent lead times remain consistent at 4 periods (P11 arrived P15, P12 arrived P16). I will use a recent_N window of 7 periods (P10 to P16) to capture the current post-recovery demand mean and variance accurately while accounting for the recent stockout events. The in-transit inventory is high (460), but the backend OR policy will handle the order quantity based on the pipeline. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 ensures we cover the expected demand and buffer for the observed volatility in this current regime.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-mean, higher-volatility regime following the dip between Periods 7-9. In the current 'recovery/stable' regime (Period 10 to 17), the average demand is approximately 110.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27.2. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Since the system must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, and there is a significant pipeline of 364 units (plus 160 on-hand), the backend will calculate the necessary order. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (covering Periods 10-17) to lock in the characteristics of the current demand regime and ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed volatility to mitigate stockout risks like the one seen in Period 13. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to rely on the confirmed 4-period history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability (P10-P17): Mean demand is ~111 with a standard deviation of ~27. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-145.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 10, following a dip between Periods 7-9. Although the most recent demand in Period 18 was low (38), the average demand from Period 10 to Period 18 is approximately 108 units with a standard deviation of roughly 36, confirming higher volatility than the initial baseline. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 297 units on hand and 272 units in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18), the pipeline inventory is 569. Given the promised lead time L=4, the base stock targets demand over 5 periods (L+1). A mean demand of 108 units per period suggests a total expected demand of 540 over the look-ahead window. Since current inventory (569) already exceeds this, the OR backend will likely order minimal units. I will use a recent_N of 9 (P10-P18) to capture this stable but volatile recovery regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain L at 'calculate' as lead times have been steady at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 10 from a mid-game slump (avg ~65) to a recovery phase (avg ~105 from P10-P19). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current demand is stabilized around a mean of 105 with a standard deviation of approximately 34 over the last 10 periods (P10-P19). The on-hand inventory is 240 units and in-transit is 273 units. Since we are in Period 20, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 * 105 = 525 units. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) = 513 units, which is close to our target. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-slump behavior correctly, accounting for the increased volatility (P18-P19 saw demand of 38 and 68, contrasting with the P13 peak of 157).

Daily Reward (R_t): $255.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a new regime since Period 10, following a temporary dip between Periods 7-9. Over the last 11 periods (P10-P20), mean demand is approximately 101 units with a standard deviation of approximately 34. Recent periods (P18-P20) were slightly lower (avg 76), but high variance persists. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 233 and in-transit at 208 (total 441), current coverage is sufficient for roughly 4 periods of demand at the regime average. To maintain a high service level while managing volatility, I will use a recent_N window (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-dip behavior without overreacting to the low P18-P19 values. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 1+L (5 periods) exposure time.

Carry-over insight: Post-dip demand stability (P10-P20) indicates a mean of ~101 units/period with significantly higher volatility (std dev ~34) compared to the initial 5 periods. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 10 has stabilized into a higher volatility phase compared to the start of the game. For the last 12 periods (P10-P21), the mean demand is approximately 105 units with a standard deviation of approximately 34. Recent demand in Period 21 was high (150). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory (146) plus in-transit (275) is 421, and a base-stock level for 5 periods (L+1) at a mean of 105 would be roughly 525, the system will logicially place an order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full recovery/stability phase starting from Period 10, which provides a better representation of both the current mean and the elevated volatility than the full history.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volatility regime following the recovery in Period 10. For the segment from Period 10 to Period 22 (13 periods), the mean demand is approximately 106.8 with a standard deviation of 34.6. In the most recent 3 periods (P20-P22), demand has trended higher (122, 150, 124), suggesting the mean for the immediate future may be slightly higher than the long-term average. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 105 and a significant in-transit pipeline (356 units, including large orders from P21 and P22), the OR backend needs to maintain a safety stock that buffers against the observed volatility (std dev ~35). I am using recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-recovery regime's characteristics while smoothing across the period of stability since P10.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 10) shows a higher mean and significantly higher volatility compared to the initial periods. Period 23 ended with a stockout (demand 146, on-hand 117), confirming that current inventory levels are insufficient to cover demand spikes in the current regime. Over the last 14 periods (P10-P23), the mean demand is approximately 109.5 and the standard deviation is approximately 32.5. We are using N=14 to capture this sustained recovery regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The OR backend needs to account for this higher variance to prevent further stockouts, as the critical ratio for this product (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.8) favors a reasonably high service level. The parameter L is set to 4 (promised and verified), mu_hat is set to the recent mean of the recovery regime, and sigma_hat is set to the recent standard deviation to handle the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high post-recovery (P10-P23): mean demand is ~110 with a standard deviation of ~33, significantly higher than pre-dip levels.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a stockout at Period 25 (on-hand: 0). The demand regime since Period 10 has stabilized around a mean of ~111 with high volatility (std dev ~33). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. In the last two periods (P23-P24), demand (146, 122) exceeded available arrivals (12, 50), leading to stockouts. To recover, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=15 (covering the stable but volatile regime from P10 to P24). The backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand, while the OR engine's 'cap' mechanism will help manage the large pipeline inventory (564 units) relative to recent demand spikes.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 10 has stabilized around a mean of ~112 with significant volatility (std dev ~33). Recent inventory levels have been low due to high demand spikes in Periods 21-24 causing partial stockouts, though Period 25 saw a full arrival of 130 units. The pipeline inventory (486 units) is healthy, but we need to ensure local base stock covers the lead time (4) + review period (1). I am using 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the stable distribution since the recovery in Period 10, specifically targeting the mean and volatility observed in this post-dip regime to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable in its post-recovery phase (since Period 10) with a mean and variance significantly higher than the initial periods. Over the last 17 periods (P10-P26), the average demand is approximately 111.4 units with a standard deviation of 31.8. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P22 order arrived in P26). With an on-hand inventory of 102 and in-transit units of 408, we are in a relatively healthy position, though recent stockouts in P23 and P24 highlight the impact of high demand volatility. Using recent_N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this sustained post-recovery behavior accurately, balancing the need to satisfy high-volume peaks while managing holding costs. The lead time parameter is set to 'calculate' as it has proven stable at 4 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a post-recovery regime (starting around Period 10). Analysis of the last 18 periods (P10-P27) shows a mean demand of approximately 111.4 units with a standard deviation of 31.6. Although there was a stockout in P23-P24 due to timing and low arrivals, current on-hand inventory (145) and in-transit units (364) are recovering. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use recent_N with N=18 to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the historical dip (P7-P9) and initial low-variance phase. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the higher observed standard deviation (approx 32) compared to early periods, ensuring better service levels against recent demand spikes (up to 157).

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher volatility regime since Period 10, following a temporary dip between Periods 7-9. Recent demand (last 10 periods, P19-P28) shows a mean of 109.2 with a standard deviation of approximately 27.6. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across the entire history, including the most recent arrival in Period 28. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 210, with 322 units in-transit. To maintain a high service level while accounting for the established high volatility, I am using a recent window of 19 periods (dating back to the start of the recovery phase in P10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend captures the sustained mean and variance shifts noted in the carry-over insights without being skewed by the very early low-variance data or the temporary period 7-9 dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a period of fluctuations. Analyzing the demand from Period 10 to Period 29 (the current stable regime), the mean demand is approximately 107.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 31.2. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistently verified by historical arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 148, and there are 327 units in-transit, which aligns well with the expectation of orders arriving every period to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I will use a recent_N approach (N=20, covering the stable regime since Period 10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained baseline and its associated volatility. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover the mean demand of ~537 units over the 5-period window with a buffer for the observed variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit significant volatility post-Period 10, though the mean has stabilized around ~105-110. In the most recent 10 periods (P21-P30), the mean demand is 111.1 with a standard deviation of approximately 30.5. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of the P26 order arriving in P30. Current on-hand inventory is 187, and in-transit inventory is 355 (orders from P27, P28, P29, P30). The Pipeline inventory (542) is relatively healthy for a 5-period window (L+1). To maintain high service levels while managing holding costs, I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean accurately, and sticking with the consistent lead time calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since the recovery at Period 10, though it exhibits significant volatility. For Period 32, I am analyzing demand from Period 10 to Period 31. During this window, the mean demand is approximately 104 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 31. Specifically, recent demand (last 10 periods, P22-P31) has averaged 100 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as seen in the 'conclude' messages. To respond to the high volatility (std dev ~31) and avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 23-24, I will use a recent window (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent consumption patterns while maintaining a high enough safety stock to handle the observed variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $158.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since the recovery at Period 10. For the last 23 periods (P10-P32), the mean demand is approximately 106 units with a standard deviation of about 30. The most recent 10 periods (P23-P32) show a similar mean of ~97 units and a standard deviation of ~28. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods throughout the history (P1-P28 orders have all arrived with a 4-period lead time). Currently, the inventory position (On-hand 190 + In-transit 278 = 468) is healthy relative to the expected demand over the lead time (L+1=5 periods). I will use a recent_N of 10 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most current demand behavior while maintaining the stable lead time estimate.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a post-recovery regime starting around Period 10. For the most recent 24 periods (P10-P33), the mean demand is approximately 101.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30.6. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and consistent as observed in the concluded history. I am setting L to 'default' (4), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=24 to capture this stable post-recovery mean (~101), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=24 to account for the sustained higher volatility (~31) compared to the initial periods. This approach ensures the inventory position (on-hand + pipeline) targets roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1) while maintaining a sufficient safety stock to protect against the observed demand spikes.

For the most recent 10-period window (P25-P34), the mean demand is 87.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. This is a slight decrease from the high volatility seen in the P10-P24 window (mean ~110, std ~33), but still more variable than the initial baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the P30 order in P34). Current inventory (On-hand: 187 + In-transit: 300 = 487) is robust against the (L+1)=5 period demand window (expected demand ~437.5). I will use a recent_N of 10 for both demand and volatility to capture this slightly lower but still modern mean/variance, ensuring the OR backend maintains a safe but efficient buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability observed P25-P34: mean demand has settled at approximately 87.5 units/period with a standard deviation of ~19, showing less volatility than the immediate post-recovery period (P10-P24).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 25. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P25-P35), the mean demand is approximately 88.2 units/period with a standard deviation of 17.8. This replaces the higher volatility observed in the P10-P24 recovery phase. The lead time remains reliable at exactly 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P31 order in P35. On-hand inventory is 140, and pipeline inventory is 252 (total 392). To maintain optimal service levels and mitigate holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture this stable post-recovery regime. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability P25-P35: mean demand is ~88.2 with a standard deviation of ~17.8. This is a sustained decrease in both mean and volatility compared to the P10-P24 period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stable regime starting from Period 25. For the last 12 periods (P25-P36), the mean demand is approximately 89.5 with a standard deviation of 17.5. This is lower and less volatile than the P10-P24 period. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P36 (ordered P32). With an on-hand inventory of 95 and in-transit inventory of 274 (total 369), the pipeline is well-stocked relative to the projected (L+1) demand of ~448 units. I will use recent_N=12 to capture this stabilized demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use default for L as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 25. Analyzing the window from P25 to P37 (13 periods), the mean demand is approximately 89.8 units per period with a standard deviation of 17.5. This represents a significant decrease in both volume and volatility compared to the high-demand, high-variance recovery phase (P10-P24). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P32 order arriving at P36, P33 order at P37). On-hand inventory is currently at 79 units with 318 units in-transit. Using N=13 capture the current stable regime to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which allows the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base-stock level for this lower-demand environment while accounting for the current lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability P25-P37: mean demand is ~89.8 with a standard deviation of ~17.5. This confirms a sustained lower mean and volatility compared to the P10-P24 period.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 25. Analyzing the demand from P25 to P38, the mean demand is approximately 89.29 units per period with a standard deviation of 17.06. This is consistent with previous carry-over insights that identified a sustained lower mean and volatility compared to the high-volatility recovery phase (P10-P24). Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods throughout the history. The pipeline inventory (269 units) and current on-hand (117) are being managed towards this new baseline. Since the regime has been stable for 14 periods (P25-P38), I will use N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific regime perfectly, and continue using the calculated lead time which reflects the stable 4-period history.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 25. For the interval P25-P39, the mean demand is approximately 86.8 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. In Period 39, we observed a low demand of 35, but this is within the expected range of volatility for this regime. Note that the order from Period 35 (quantity 0) correctly resulted in 0 arrivals during Period 39. To optimize for the current regime, I am using recent_N with N=15 (covering P25-P39) for both mean and sigma calculation. This ensures we capture the lower mean and lower volatility compared to the P10-P24 period, avoiding excessive holding costs while maintaining enough stock to cover the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability P25-P39: mean demand is ~86.8 with a standard deviation of ~21.0. This confirms a sustained lower mean and volatility compared to the post-recovery spikes.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 25. For the interval P25-P40, the mean demand is approximately 88.6 units with a standard deviation of 20.8. I am using recent_N=16 to capture this entire stable period. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 36 order in Period 40. On-hand inventory is 48, and in-transit is 302, totaling 350 units. Given the lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. With a mean of ~89, the expected demand over the lead time is 445 units. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on the high service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) and order accordingly to bridge the gap between current total inventory (350) and target.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability P25-P40: mean demand is ~88.6 with a standard deviation of ~20.8. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 to Period 41, the mean demand is approximately 91.5 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. This represents a sustained lower mean and volatility compared to the high-volatility recovery phase (P10-P24). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 37 order in Period 41. Although there was an arrival gap in Period 39 (due to no order being placed in Period 35), the pipeline inventory is currently 315 units and the on-hand inventory is 43 units. Setting N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering the stable period P25-P41) allows the OR backend to calculate parameters based on this most recent stable regime, ensuring a balanced approach to meeting demand while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $484.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we experienced a stockout with on-hand inventory hitting 0 and demand reaching 133 units, which is significantly higher than the previous Period 25-40 mean of ~88.6. This suggests a potential upward shift in demand or at least increased volatility. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 362 units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P38 order arrived in P42). To address the recent demand surge and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the established baseline, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Given the shift detected at P25 and the further spike in P42, N=18 (P25 to P42) covers the current regime. This will help the OR backend adjust to the recent higher volume (133) and increased standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 42 (demand 133), potentially ending the stable regime observed since Period 25 (mean ~88.6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a demand spike/volatility phase that started around Period 40. Demand for the last four periods has been 115, 115, 133, and 114 (mean ~119), which is significantly higher than the previous stable regime of ~88 observable from P25-P39. The current inventory is 0 on-hand, and although there is a large pipeline (405 units), recent stockouts in P42 and P43 indicate the previous parameters were too conservative for this new demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new elevated demand regime and mitigate further stockouts while waiting for the pipeline to arrive. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility seen in the 133 peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase confirmed starting Period 40: Mean demand shifted from ~88 (P25-P39) to ~119 (P40-P43), a 35% increase.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P40-P44) has shifted to a higher mean of ~113.4, compared to the previous stable regime of ~88. The most recent demand was 90, but P42-P43 saw spikes (133, 114) that resulted in stockouts. Current on-hand inventory is 0. I need to use a recent_N window that captures this shift (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to adjust for the higher mean and increased volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which dictates an inventory coverage for L+1 (5) periods. Setting N=5 for demand parameters will align the order with the current 'sustained increase' regime noted in Period 44.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 40. From P40 to P45, the demand values are 115, 115, 133, 114, 90, 84, resulting in a mean of approximately 108.5 and a standard deviation of 18.5. This is a clear increase from the P25-P39 mean of ~88. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P15, P16, P17, P18, P19, P20, P21, P22, P23, P24, P25, P26, P27, P28, P29, P30, P31, P32, P33, P34, P35, P36, P37, P38, P40, P41, P42, P43, P44, P45 all show lead_time=4). We are currently in Period 46 with only 39 units on hand and a high pipeline, but recent stockouts in P42, P43, and P44 suggest we must maintain a robust base stock. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current demand state for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the calculated lead time which is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand level for P40-P45: Mean ~108.5, Std Dev ~18.5 (reflecting a 23% increase in mean compared to the P25-P39 period). Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $201.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P40-P46) shows a sustained mean of approximately 103 units per period (115, 115, 133, 114, 90, 84, 73). While the last three periods show a downward trend, the overall average for this most recent phase remains significantly higher than the previous stable baseline of ~88. To prevent stockouts like those seen in P42-P44, I am using the most recent 7 periods (P40-P46) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current higher-demand environment and the associated volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods across the entire history, so I am using the calculate method for 'L'. The inventory pipeline is currently very full (413 units in-transit), so the OR backend will naturally scale back ordering if the on-hand plus pipeline exceeds the calculated base stock.

Daily Profit: $252.00, Daily Holding Cost: $159.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 40. While Periods 40-43 showed a spike (mean ~119), the most recent four periods (P44-P47) have shown lower demand (90, 84, 73, 63), bringing the mean for the P40-P47 period to approximately 98.2. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory has recovered to 159, with a substantial in-transit pipeline (336). To account for the recent volume increase compared to the P25-P39 baseline but also the cooling observed in the last 4 periods, I am using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the entire regime since the Period 40 shift, providing a balanced forecast that accounts for the higher volatility (std dev ~26) and the updated mean demand. This setting ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while respecting the current inventory position.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 40: Mean demand for P40-P47 is ~98.2 with significantly higher volatility (Std Dev ~25.8) compared to the stable Period 25-39 regime (mean ~88.6, Std Dev ~20.8).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 40, showing an increase in both mean and volatility compared to the stable P25-P39 period. For P40-P48, the mean demand is 93.1 with a standard deviation of approximately 27.9. However, the most recent four periods (P45-P48) have shown a significant downward trend in demand (84, 73, 63, 51), suggesting another potential regime shift or a mean-reverting correction following the P40-P43 spike. Given we are at Period 49 of 50, the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for the final period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the average since the Period 40 shift, providing a balanced forecast that accounts for the recent high-demand cluster while acknowledging the immediate trailing drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean for P40-P48 is 93.1 with Std Dev ~27.9. Note a significant downward trend in the last 4 periods (P45-P48: 84, 73, 63, 51).

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a downward trend and highly volatile. Over the last five periods (P45-P49), demand has been 84, 73, 63, 51, and 85, resulting in a mean of ~71.2 units per period. This follows a high-demand phase (P40-P44) where the mean was ~113. Given the current on-hand inventory (240) and in-transit units (193), we are well-stocked. To reflect the recent demand drop and maintain adequate service levels despite high volatility (Std Dev ~27.9 for the P40-P49 period), I will use the recent N=10 samples for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the recent regime shift from high to lower/resetting demand. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed starting Period 45: mean dropped from ~113 (P40-P44) to ~71.2 (P45-P49), though volatility remains high.
