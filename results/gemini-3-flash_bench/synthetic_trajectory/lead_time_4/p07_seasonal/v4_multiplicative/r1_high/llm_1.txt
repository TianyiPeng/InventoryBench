According to the execution sequence, an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5 (1 + 4) and be available for demand in Period 5, but I won't see the confirmation until Period 6. I need enough inventory to cover the lead time (L) plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Using the average demand (~130 units), a baseline requirement is 130 * 5 = 650 units.

  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a higher regime of approximately 140-145 units per period (P41-P43), though P44 saw a dip to 80 units. World knowledge suggests chips are a high-volume, relatively stable snack category, but subject to localized fluctuations. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P36 order arriving P40). Our current on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in P43 and P44. We have 690 units in transit: 500 units from P41 (expected P45), 0 from P42, 40 from P43 (expected P47), and 150 from P44 (expected P48). To calculate the order for P45 (covering through P49), we estimate total demand for 5 periods (P45-P49) at ~650 units (5 * 130). Current inventory + pipeline is 0 + 690 = 690. This pipeline nearly covers the expected demand through P49. However, P50 is the final period. Units arriving in P50 (ordered today) will be available for P50 demand resolution. I will place a conservative order of 100 units to ensure service level for the final periods without creating excessive ending inventory, as the game ends at P50.",

Total expected demand for P46-P50 (5 periods * ~130 demand/period) is approximately 650 units.

Historically, demand for this SKU is quite volatile with periodic 'dips' and 'recoveries'. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 338 units. The in-transit pipeline consists of: 40 units (ordered P43, expected P47), 150 units (ordered P44, expected P48), and 100 units (ordered P45, expected P49). Since we are at Period 47 of 50, we only need to cover demand for Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50. Summing expected arrivals (40 + 150 + 100 = 290) and current on-hand (338) gives a total availability of 628 units for the remaining 4 periods. Even at the higher mean of ~140, total demand would be ~560. At the more recent local average including the dip (~100), total demand would be 400. Ordering more now would likely result in unnecessary holding costs for units that won't sell before the game ends at Period 50, especially since an order placed today (P47) would not arrive until P51 (after the game ends).",

Current on-hand is 378 units. In-transit inventory includes: 150 units ordered in P44 (expected P48 resolution, visible P49) and 100 units ordered in P45 (expected P49 resolution, visible P50).

Even at the highest recent mean of ~140, 628 units effectively cover the remaining 3 periods of demand (48, 49, 50).

Current on-hand inventory is 417 units. Considering the demand has fluctuated between 0 and 153 units recently, 417 units is more than enough to cover the demand for the remaining two periods (Period 49 and 50).

Historical demand has settled around a long-term mean of ~110, but recent volatility shows fluctuations between 0 and 150. Current on-hand inventory is 434 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the demand for the final period (Period 50) and several periods beyond, should the game have continued.
