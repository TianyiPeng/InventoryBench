Historical data for the first 4 periods shows a mean demand of approximately 146 units (150, 163, 134, 139), while Period 5 shows a significant drop to 69. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, an order placed now will arrive in Period 5. To cover demand for Periods 1 through 5 (the lead time L=4 plus the current period), I need to account for approximately 145-150 units per period, while noting the potential drop in Period 5. My goal is to build a pipeline to satisfy demand starting from Period 5 onwards. I will place an initial order to cover 5 periods of average demand (approx 150 * 5 = 750) to establish a safety buffer, but since I am starting from zero and have no stock for the first 4 periods, I must initiate the supply chain immediately. I'll order 700 units to cover the expected demand cycles through the lead time and provide a buffer for the arrival in Period 5.",

We are currently stocked out on-hand, but the influx of 800 units over the next 3 periods is substantial. However, to ensure we don't stock out again in P20/P21 after the P14 large shipment is consumed, we look at the pipeline: total in-transit is 950. Target for 5 periods @ 140/period is 700 units. Since 950 > 700, the pipeline is currently well-saturated. I will place a maintenance order of 150 to keep the arrival rhythm consistent for Period 20.",

I will order 100 units to provide a safety buffer against the high variance and ensure sales in the final period, as the profit margin ($19) significantly outweighs the holding cost ($1).",

Starting Period 47, we are in the endgame (out of 50 periods). On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory consists of: 130 units (ordered P43, arriving P47), 200 units (ordered P44, arriving P48), 100 units (ordered P45, arriving P49), and 100 units (ordered P46, arriving P50). Total units available to cover the remaining periods (47, 48, 49, 50) is 530 units. Total expected demand for the remaining 4 periods is approximately 440-460 units (110-115 per period). Since the incoming pipeline (530 units) exceeds the expected total remaining demand until the end of the game (Period 50), no further orders are required to maximize profit and minimize holding costs. Any additional order would arrive at the start of the next game (if it continued) or simply incur holding costs in Period 50.",

There is a total of 400 units in-transit: 200 units (ordered Period 44) scheduled to arrive in Period 48, 100 units (ordered Period 45) in Period 49, and 100 units (ordered Period 46) in Period 50. This sequence is confirmed by a consistent 4-period lead time (most recently, P43 order arrived in P47). The demand regime has been averaging ~113 units/period (P38-P44), though Period 47 saw a sharp drop to 31. Assuming a standard demand of ~100-110 units/period, the arrivals in P48 (200), P49 (100), and P50 (100) are more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods of the game. Specifically, for Period 48: Starting OH (99) + Arrival (200) = 299 units vs. expected demand of ~100. For Period 49: Remaining OH (~200) + Arrival (100) = 300 units vs. expected demand. For Period 50: Remaining OH (~200) + Arrival (100) = 300 units vs. expected demand. Adding more orders now would only result in high holding costs at the end of Period 50, as no new orders placed now would arrive before the game ends (P48 order would arrive in P52). Thus, the optimal move is to order 0.",

Recent demand (P47-P49) has decreased to an average of ~54 units/period, down from the previous regime of ~113 units/period (P38-P44). Currently, on-hand inventory is 268 units, with 100 units expected to arrive in Period 50 (ordered in P46, lead time 4) and 100 units in Period 51 (ordered in P47, lead time 4). This results in a total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) of 468 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 50 plus the 4-period lead time (total 5 periods). At the current conservative demand of ~54 units/period, the 5-period requirement is 270 units; at the historical higher average of ~113, it is 565 units. Because the current inventory of 468 units safely covers the lower bound and a significant portion of the higher bound, and considering the recent downward trend, no additional order is placed this period to avoid excessive holding costs.",
