On-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units currently in transit. The product is 'chips(Regular)', which typically has stable demand, but the initial 5 samples show significant variance (Mean: 102, StdDev: 37). The OR recommendation of 164 units uses a base-stock policy (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302) where \u03bc\u0302 is the demand for 5 periods (L+1). Specifically, \u03bc\u0302 is approx 510, but the recommendation is 'capped' at 164. Given we start with 0 stock and a 4-period lead time, we will face stockouts until Period 5 regardless of the order size. The capped OR recommendation (164) is cautious, likely aiming to prevent overstocking due to the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which results in a low critical fractile (0.50). A fractile of 0.50 means the OR algorithm essentially targets the mean demand without significant safety stock.

Historical demand for the first 3 periods was 125, 135, and 78 (average ~113). In Period 4's decision phase, we must plan for a lead time of 4 + 1 (review period) = 5 periods.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand is [137, 92, 110, 43, 128]. Average demand is approximately 102 units/period.

The In-transit pool consists of orders from P35 (38 units), P36 (140 units), P37 (146 units), and P38 (165 units). The P35 order will arrive during Period 39 (visible at start of P40). Therefore, in P39, including current demand, we will still have 0 units until the very end of the period. The OR recommendation of 4 units is extremely low because it calculates 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Our pipeline (489) currently exceeds the OR base stock (~413 based on old demand or slightly adjusted). However, given the sustained demand surge (135, 141, 153, 48 - note P38's low demand was restricted by stockout, so 'demand=48' might be an underestimate or a fluke, but the trend is high), we must ensure we don't stock out again once the pipeline clears. Total demand for L+1 (5 periods) at the new average (143) is 715. Our current pipeline is 489. To reach a safe stock level that accounts for the new regime, we need roughly 715 - 489 = 226 units.

While a demand shift was noted in P38 (average increasing from ~95 to ~143), recent demand in P38 and P39 has been significantly lower (48 and 42).

At a regime of 143/period, 5 periods of demand is ~715 units; at a lower average, it is even less. However, since the current pipeline is very close to the 5-period requirement and we have 0 on-hand, adding a small buffer to handle potential demand spikes while moving toward the end of the game (Period 50) is prudent.

In-transit inventory is 300 units, consisting of orders from Period 42 (120 units), Period 44 (180 units), and Period 45 (0 units). Expected arrivals: Period 46 (P42 order: 120), Period 48 (P44 order: 180). \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand in the recent regime (since P35) is approximately 107 units per period, though the last few periods (P42-P45) have averaged lower at 79.7 units. \n4. **Strategy**: With 197 on-hand and 120 units arriving this period (P42 order), total availability for Period 46 is 317 units. Total demand over the L+1 window (5 periods) at the higher regime rate (143/period) would be ~715 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 497 units (197 + 300). This leaves a gap of roughly 218 units to cover a 5-period window at peak demand levels. However, we are nearing the game end (Period 50). Orders placed now (P46) will arrive in Period 50. Period 50 is the final period. Orders placed after P46 will not arrive in time. \n5. **Adjustment**: The OR recommended 0. However, to ensure we don't stock out in the final periods (49-50) given the 300 units already in the pipeline are spread out, a moderate order is needed to reach the base stock level for the remaining duration.

Even at the high demand regime average of ~143 units/period, 418 units easily cover the maximum expected demand of ~430 units.

The primary goal is to maximize the final total reward, which is calculated as Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory. Since the game ends after Period 50, any order placed now (Period 49) will not arrive until Period 53 (given the confirmed lead time of 4 periods). Therefore, an order placed in Period 49 will have zero impact on sales for the remainder of the game but will incur no holding costs either as it remains in transit. However, more importantly, the current on-hand inventory is 208 units. Based on recent demand history (approx. 90-100 units per period), the inventory on hand is more than sufficient to cover the demand for the final two periods (Period 49 and Period 50) without stockouts. Even if demand spikes to 140+ (as seen in the Period 38 regime shift), 208 units covers two periods. Adding to the 'In-transit' pipeline is unnecessary for the objective.
