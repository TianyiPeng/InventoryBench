Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.00 and a holding cost of $1.00. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The initial demand history shows an average of 102 units over 5 periods (137, 92, 110, 43, 128). Since we have no specific calendar dates or product descriptions beyond the basic category, I will use the available historical data to set the initial parameters. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and the mean of the available historical samples to set the base stock level. The 'recent_N' for mu_hat is set to 5 to capture all available historical points. This will help the OR backend calculate an appropriate base stock (mu + z*sigma) to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, an order of 164 units was placed (In-transit), and 0 units arrived (expected, as lead time is 4). Since the starting on-hand inventory was 0, the demand of 126 units in Period 1 resulted in 0 sales and 0 ending inventory. My goal is to set parameters that will cover demand once the pipeline starts arriving. I have 5 historical samples plus the Period 1 demand (126). The mean of the 5 samples is 102. The Period 1 demand of 126 is slightly higher but within reasonable variance. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods) and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat initially to let the OR backend utilize the provided historical distribution, as there is no significant evidence of a regime shift yet (only one new data point).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 328 units in transit (164 ordered in P1 and 164 in P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Based on the rules, orders placed in P1 will arrive during P(1+4)=P5, and we will only see that arrival in the P5 conclude message (accessible at start of P6). Thus, seeing 'arrived=0' in P1 and P2 conclude messages is expected and does not indicate a delay or loss yet. Current demand history (P1: 126, P2: 119) is slightly higher than the pre-game samples (Avg ~102). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior (including pre-game samples) while waiting for the pipeline to arrive. The base stock calculation for the OR backend will use the promised lead time L=4, effectively looking at a 5-period window (L+1).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (164 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 arrival resolution and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Consequently, our on-hand inventory has remained at 0, resulting in lost sales for periods 1-3. Total in-transit inventory is 492 units (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has shown significant volatility: P1 (126), P2 (119), P3 (51). The provided historical samples (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) suggest a mean demand of approximately 102 units. Given the lost sales and lead time, we must maintain the base stock level to cover the lead time (4) plus the current period (1). I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4) and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture the most relevant recent volatility while waiting for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 were expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Consequently, our current on-hand inventory is 0 and we have had 0 sales since Period 1 despite demand occurring. In-transit inventory is 548 units (orders from P1-P4). The demand history (137, 92, 110, 43, 128 - note: provided history in prompt varies slightly from conclude logs, I will use the prompt's explicit sample list) shows an average of ~102 units per period. Since no orders have reached the 'conclude' phase yet, there is no evidence to change the lead time from the default of 4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the full available history while remaining responsive to the observed variance. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~510 units), and since in-transit is already 548, the order in Period 5 will likely be zero or capped per the policy to avoid excessive holding costs once the P1-P4 pipeline arrives.

Daily Reward (R_t): $256.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). There are still orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4 in transit (total 164+164+56 = 384 units). On-hand inventory is 80 units after satisfying Period 5 demand. Demand has been quite volatile (126, 119, 51, 18, 84). The mean demand across all 5 periods is 81.6 (total 408 / 5). The sample standard deviation is approximately 43.8. Although the demand in Periods 3 and 4 was low (51, 18), Period 5 showed a recovery to 84. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we need parameters to cover the current period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods total). I will use 'default' for L to stick with the promised 4 periods, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full recent history while allowing the system to react as more data arrives.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The inventory on-hand is 86 units, with 240 units in transit (orders from P3, P4, and P6). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data confirm this: the P1 order arrived in P5 and the P2 order arrived in P6. Demand has been volatile (ranging from 18 to 158). Using all available demand samples (5 historical + 6 observed = 11 samples), the mean demand is approximately 105.5. Given a lead time L=4, the coverage required is (1+L)=5 periods. mu_hat should target ~527 units. The current pipeline (86 on-hand + 240 in-transit = 326) is below this requirement. I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead times match the promised ones. For demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (all available data) to capture the full variance while stabilizing the forecast after the recent high demand in Period 6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability (range 18-158). The average demand over the last 7 periods is approximately 98.6 units. Lead time analysis: Orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 all arrived with a lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time (L=4). Currently, there are 116 units on-hand and 246 units in-transit (orders from Period 4: 56, Period 6: 20, and Period 7: 170). The order from Period 4 (56 units) is expected to arrive during Period 8 (concluding at the end of Period 8), as L=4 and it was placed in Period 4. To ensure sufficient stock for the lead time plus current period (L+1=5), I will use 'recent_N' for demand forecasting (N=7) to capture the overall average while accounting for the high volatility. mu_hat will be set to (1+L) * mean demand, and sigma_hat will use the default standard deviation calculation to maintain a safe service level given the high holding cost-to-profit ratio (1:4).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1, P2, P3 orders arrived in P5, P6, P7 respectively).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of past 'conclude' messages confirms the actual lead time is 4 periods (as promised), with orders from Periods 1-4 arriving in Periods 5-8 respectively. Demand history shows significant variability (range: 18 to 158). The average demand over the first 8 periods is approximately 93 units. With an on-hand inventory of 117 and in-transit inventory of 360 (from orders in Periods 6, 7, and 8), we are currently well-covered for the lead-time window. The OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers the next (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the volatility, I will use all available data (N=8) to estimate the mean and standard deviation to ensure a balanced service level versus holding cost. Method 'calculate' for L will use the confirmed 4-period history.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 45 units. Examining the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed (P1-P4 all arrived exactly at L=4). However, in Period 9 conclude, we see that 0 units arrived. Looking back, Period 5 was the transition where an order of 0 was placed, which explains the zero arrival now in Period 9 (L=4). Demand has been somewhat volatile over the last 9 periods (mean ~91, ranging from 18 to 158). The most recent 5 periods (P5-P9) show a mean of 80.6, while the pre-game samples were higher. I will use the default lead time (4) as it is verified. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use a recent_N of 9 to capture the full live history which reflects a slight downward shift compared to initial seeds. This maintains a buffer for the pipeline which currently has 441 units in transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9).

Daily Reward (R_t): $260.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are at zero on-hand inventory with a significant stockout occurring in Period 10 (demand 80 vs available 65). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 all arrived exactly after 4 periods). However, the order from Period 5 was for 0 units, which creates a 'gap' in arrivals for Period 9, contributing to our current stockout. The mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 94.7 units. With lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The in-transit pipeline (476 units) consists of orders from P7(170), P8(170), P9(81), and P10(55). The P7 order (170 units) is expected to arrive during Period 11 (visible in P12). To stabilize, I will set mu_hat based on the average of all 10 periods to capture the range of demand (18 to 158). Method 'default' for L (4), mu_hat (approx 473.5), and sigma_hat (approx 94.9) will be used as the historical data is relatively stable around the mean despite the recent stockout.

Note: The P5 order was 0 units, which is why P9 showed 0 arrivals. Demand shows significant variability but no clear seasonal trend yet (P1-P11 demand: 126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158, 134, 55, 72, 80, 149). The current on-hand inventory is 21, with 376 units in-transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, P11). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. The average demand across all 11 periods is ~86 units/period. The total pipeline + on-hand is 397 units. 5 periods * 86 = 430 units. We are slightly below the required base stock level to maintain the 80% service level (q = 4/(4+1)). I will use recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full range of observed demand volatility while keeping L at the promised/confirmed value of 4.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (P1-P8 orders) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 101, with 370 units in-transit (orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12). Order from P9 (81 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P13. Demand history for the first 12 periods + 5 seeding samples is relatively stable, showing an average of ~95 units per period. The standard deviation across all 17 samples is approximately 41. Since no calendar data is provided, I will use a conservative approach: 'calculate' for lead time (averaging observed values), and a 'recent_N' approach for demand parameters using the last 12 periods of game play + 5 seeding samples (total N=17) to capture the overall variability without overreacting to short-term fluctuations. This ensures our base stock (covering L+1 periods) remains robust against demand spikes.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 104 units, and there are 379 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on recent delivery history (Periods 5 through 13). The pipeline consists of orders placed in Periods 10 (55), 11 (70), 12 (164), and 13 (90), totaling 379. Demand has shown moderate volatility with a mean of approximately 95 units over the last 13 periods (sum=1239/13\u224895.3). However, demand in the first few periods was higher, and the most recent 5 periods (P9-P13) averaged 93.8. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime which seems lower than the initial spike. With L=4, the backend will calculate base stock for 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand history shows significant volatility but no clear structural shift, with a total average of approximately 92 units per period across all available data and a slightly lower recent average (P8-P14) of 78.4. My objective is to maintain a base stock that covers the next (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. With 134 units on-hand and 382 in-transit, our current pipeline inventory is 516 units, which roughly covers 5-6 periods of demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time (L) based on the consistent observation of 4 periods. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture a stable average from the duration of the actual game while smoothing out high-volatility spikes seen in early periods. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=14 to ensure the safety stock reflects the observed game variance.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 111 units with 321 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by every arrival since Period 5 (P11 order arrived in P15). Historical demand shows significant variation: earlier periods (P1-P3, P11) had high demand (126, 119, 149), while recent periods (P14-P15) show a dip then an increase (25, 93). Given the promised lead time of 4, our look-ahead window is (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N for both mu and sigma allows for responsiveness to recent demand fluctuations. I will use N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the variability from Period 5 onwards, which represents the phase since inventory first arrived.

Daily Reward (R_t): $635.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met, as confirmed by arrivals from Periods 1 through 12. Current demand (Period 16: 182) shows high volatility compared to the previous week (Period 14: 25). The last 10 periods (P7-P16) represent a stable but high-variance regime with an average demand of approximately 99 units. Inventory on-hand (93) plus in-transit (264) totals 357 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods (L=4), we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My forecast for total demand over this window is approximately 495 units (5 * 99). The current pipeline (357) is slightly below the required base stock levels for this high-variance SKU. I will use the last 10 samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility while maintaining a stable average, ensuring the OR backend targets a sufficient service level for this $4 profit item.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility, with values ranging from 25 to 182 units per period. The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 88.5 units. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods, meaning we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Specifically, recent peak demand (Period 16: 182) suggests we need to maintain a robust base stock. On-hand inventory is 110, with 347 in transit. The in-transit includes orders from P14 (58), P15 (9), P16 (107), and P17 (173). The order from P14 is expected to arrive in the current period (P18 resolution). I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent demand variability while ignoring the very early startup data. L remains at the confirmed 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 19. Looking at historical arrivals from Period 5 through Period 18, lead time has been consistently 4 periods (promised = 4). No shipments appear to be lost or excessively delayed. Demand shows some variability: recent samples (Periods 11-18) are [149, 90, 78, 25, 93, 182, 73, 71], with an average of approximately 95 units per period. The standard deviation is relatively high due to spikes (e.g., Period 16). Given L=4, the pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current pipeline = 97 (on-hand) + 366 (in-transit) = 463. Projected demand over 5 periods based on the recent average is roughly 475. To maintain service levels against volatility, I will use recent trends. I'll use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been stable at 4, and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the mean shift and volatility observed in the last two weeks of data.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has fluctuated but shows no clear long-term regime shift. The average demand across all periods (including seed data) is approximately 91.56 units. Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. Currently, we have 59 units on-hand and 462 units in-transit (covering orders placed in Periods 16, 17, 18, and 19). The pipeline is quite full compared to the average demand of ~91 units per period. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=15) to capture recent variability while smoothing out noise, and rely on the promised/calculated lead time of 4. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility but remains relatively centered around a mean of ~101. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by historical arrivals (Orders from P1 to P16 all arrived with a 4-period lead time). Currently, on-hand inventory is 80 units, and there are 381 units in-transit (orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20). I will use a recent window (N=10) for demand estimation to capture current volatility while maintaining the standard lead time of 4. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent demand patterns (Review + Lead Time = 5 periods). The backend OR will calculate the base stock level and order the necessary amount to cover the pipeline, considering the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), which implies a target service level of 0.8.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) fluctuates significantly but has maintained a consistent historical average. The mean demand across all 20 concluded periods is approximately 91.95 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by all arrivals from Period 5 through 21). Therefore, a lead time L=4 is reliable. Current status: On-hand is 130, In-transit is 281 (orders from Periods 18, 19, 20, 21), totaling 411 units. Given (L+1)=5 periods of demand coverage needed, and using the long-term mean (5 * 91.95 = 459.75), our current inventory position (411) is slightly below the target. I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead times are consistent. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' to leverage the full 26 samples (21 history + 5 seed) to smooth out the high variance (std ~49) seen in the recent history (e.g., Period 11=149, Period 14=25, Period 16=182).

I will use the last 15 samples to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the most relevant recent demand volatility (roughly 94 units/period). With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80%. The current on-hand inventory is 82 units, and pipeline inventory is 338 units, totaling 420 units. Setting L to 4 means we need to cover demand for 5 periods (Review + Lead Time). I'll use method 'calculate' for L as it matches the promised lead time reliably.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-77.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 165 units, and there are 339 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P1 through P19 (P19 arrived in P23). Demand exhibits significant variance but no clear structural break in the mean over the last 15 periods. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 5 to Period 23 is approximately 91 units per period, while the mean of the most recent 5 periods (P19-P23) is lower (~80) and the previous 5 (P14-P18) was slightly higher (~84). Since demand is volatile (ranging from 22 to 182), I will use a recent window of N=15 to capture the general average while allowing for recent variability to influence the safety stock. This window size covers a broad enough range to stabilize the mu_hat against the recent low demand of 22 in Period 23. This approach ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for an average demand of ~450-500 units against the current total position (on-hand + in-transit) of 504.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of Period 24, where the Period 20 order arrived). Therefore, I will continue using L=4. Demand for chips(Regular) has shown some variability but no distinct regime shift or seasonal spike that can be definitively identified from the last 24 periods. The mean demand across all 24 periods is approximately 89.2. To maintain a responsive inventory level while balancing the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1) ratio (suggesting an 80% service level), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=10 to capture recent trends in the last two weeks of data. The pipeline inventory (329) plus on-hand (120) currently totals 449 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of average demand (approx 450 units), aligning with the L+1 coverage requirement.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows relatively moderate demand, though it can spike (e.g., Period 16: 182). Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the mean demand is approximately 86 units. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the recent 10-period demand average to capture the current consumption rate while maintaining sufficient safety stock via sigma_hat. The OR backend will calculate a base stock target covering (L+1) = 5 periods. With 83 units on-hand and 339 in-transit (covering 22, 23, 24, 25 orders), the pipeline is healthy. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to reflect the most stable recent demand regime.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability with no significant regime shifts detected. The mean demand for the last 10 periods is approximately 85.8 units, while the overall experimental mean (including pre-game samples) is 88.5 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 324) plus on-hand (97) totals 421 units, which covers nearly 5 periods of average demand (85-90 units/period). I will use a N=10 window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility and volume while smoothing out the lower demand seen in Period 23 (22 units). This provides a robust base-stock level to manage the 4-period lead time effectively given the Profit/Holding ratio which favors a high service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $357.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 21 to 27 shows a slight increase in mean demand compared to the earlier history, with recent values often exceeding 110 units. The average demand of the last 7 periods is approximately 110.4 units, whereas the global average is lower. I will use recent_N=7 to capture this slightly higher demand regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P25, P26, and P27 which all had a lead time of 4). Service level q = 4 / (4+1) = 0.8. Using recent_N will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the elevated demand while accounting for the confirmed lead time stability. On-hand plus pipeline (91 + 287 = 378) is substantial, so the ordering policy will likely be moderate to avoid excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed around Period 21: average demand increased to ~110 units from previous lower levels (~80-90). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 25, with recent demand values being 110, 120, 112, and 100 (averaging 110.5). Prior to this, demand was more volatile with lower troughs. I am using a recent window (N=8) for mu_hat to capture this upward shift while maintaining some stability against individual period noise. Recent demand is significantly higher than the early period average (approx 80-90). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by every shipment that has arrived so far. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (7 units) because the arrival in Period 28 was small (16 units), but the in-transit pipeline is substantial (432 units), which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate (110 * 4 = 440). Using N=8 for sigma_hat provides a volatility estimate reflective of the current regime's variance.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting around Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 29, demand has averaged approximately 111 units per period (123, 125, 22, 71, 110, 120, 112, 100, 107), significantly higher than the earlier periods. Period 29 ended with zero on-hand inventory and lost sales, indicating current base stock levels are insufficient for this higher demand regime. To adapt, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture the statistics of this new regime. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (promised: 4, actual: 4), confirmed by consecutive arrivals (e.g., Period 25 order arrived Period 29). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 466 units in-transit (orders from P26-P29). The OR backend parameters will now target a base stock level that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1) at this higher mean, helping to rebuild stock and avoid further stockouts.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 21-30) shows a sustained shift to a higher mean of approximately 105 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since On-hand inventory is currently 0 and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts in Periods 29 and 30, the primary goal is to ensure the pipeline inventory covers the 5-period window (L+1). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 4-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat), I am using N=10 to focus on the high-demand regime that started at Period 21. For sigma_hat, I am also using N=10 to capture the increased volatility of this higher-demand period, which helps the OR engine set a slightly higher safety stock.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of inventory stockout (On-hand: 0) while waiting for upcoming shipments. As noted in the carry-over insights from Period 28, demand shifted upwards starting around Period 21. Analyzing demand from Period 21 to Period 31, the average demand is approximately 114.9 units (123, 125, 22, 71, 110, 120, 112, 100, 107, 120, 146). Note that the demand in Period 23 was a significant outlier (22); excluding it gives an average of 124 units. Conversely, recent demand (last 3 periods) has been high (107, 120, 146). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Since we have shifted into a higher demand regime, I am using a recent N of 11 (correlating to the identified changepoint in Period 21) to capture this higher mean while smoothing volatility. This ensures 'mu_hat' represents the expected demand over the (L+1) horizon (4+1=5 periods) correctly.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 21, and recent demand has shown extreme volatility and a significant upward trend, with the last 12 periods (P21-P32) averaging ~112 units, and the last 5 periods (P28-P32) averaging ~131 units. The most recent demand was 183. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) due to demand exceeding recent arrivals. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand phase, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the recent 12-period average (N=12) to capture the regime shift while smoothing the recent spike. I am also using a recent_N window (N=12) for sigma_hat to better capture the increased volatility (Std Dev significantly higher in this regime), ensuring a sufficient safety stock buffer in the base_stock calculation.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 21-33) shows a stable regime shift identified in Period 28. Calculating the average demand from Period 21 to Period 33: (123+125+22+71+110+120+112+100+107+120+146+183+82) / 13 = 101.6. Removing the clear outlier in Period 23 (22 units), the average is 108.2. Since Period 28, demand has consistently been around or above 100 units, with a notable spike in Period 32 (183). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (L=4), meaning we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current inventory state: On-hand is low (35) and recent stockouts occurred (Periods 29-32). Pipeline inventory is high (486), but we must ensure the base stock calculation reflects the higher demand regime to maintain the target service level. I will use recent_N with N=13 to capture this entire high-demand regime while smoothing the high volatility seen recently.

Before the shift, demand fluctuated between 20-100 units; since Period 25, demand hasn't dropped below 80 except for the most recent period (Period 34), which appears to be a local low. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the average demand is approximately 111.1 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 95) are relatively low given the pipeline inventory (493), which reflects orders from Periods 31, 32, 33, and 34 arriving in Periods 35, 36, 37, and 38 respectively. I will set L to 'calculate' to use the observed history. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the higher-demand regime and current volatility accurately, ensuring the base stock level reflects the ~110 unit average rather than the lower long-term mean.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-mean regime that started around Period 21. Over the last 15 periods (P21-P35), the average demand is approximately 101 units, though it has been volatile with spikes up to 183. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 157 units, and there are 407 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 32, 33, 34, and 35). To maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (critical ratio 0.8), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 15-period demand average to capture this elevated regime, while using the recent 15-period standard deviation for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed in this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $582.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 21 to a higher average. In the most recent periods (P29-P36), demand has averaged approximately 105 units per period, despite high volatility (ranging from 31 to 183). The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals from P33-P36. Currently, on-hand inventory is 82 and in-transit is 337 (total pipeline = 419). Given L=4, the base stock targets demand over 5 periods (L+1). My forecast for the next 5 periods is approximately 525 units (105 * 5). Lead time is estimated using 'calculate' since historical performance is reliable. I will use a 'recent_N' of 15 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing recent volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to reflect the current high variance observed in the last 15 periods (e.g., the spike to 183 in P32).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in high-state (avg ~105) since Period 21, but volatility has increased significantly in the last 10 periods (P27-P36), with demand swings between 31 and 183.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 21 has stabilized at a higher mean (avg ~105) compared to the early game, but volatility has increased significantly in the last 10 periods (P27-P36), with demand ranging from 31 to 183. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Since the shift in mean occurred 17 periods ago (P21 to P37), and the volatility shift is more recent (last 10-11 periods), I will use recent_N with N=17 for demand mean (mu_hat) to capture the full length of the current high-demand regime, and N=11 for volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the more recent increase in variance. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to account for both the increased average demand and the recent 'spikiness' to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 21 to a higher mean (~105-110 units). Since Period 27, volatility has increased significantly with demand ranging from 31 to 183. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 183, but with the high variability and the service level requirement (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we must maintain a robust base stock to cover demand over 5 periods (L+1). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=18, covering the high-demand regime since P21) and sigma_hat (N=12, focusing on the high-volatility window starting P27) to accurately capture the current distribution while ignoring the lower-demand history from early periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in the high-demand regime established around Period 21. Since Period 21, the mean demand is approximately 107 units per period. However, as noted in Period 37, volatility has increased significantly. For the mu_hat calculation, I am using recent_N with N=19 (covering Periods 21-39) to capture this regime accurately. For volatility (sigma_hat), I am using recent_N with N=10 to reflect the higher variance observed in the most recent periods (P30-P39, ranging from 31 to 183), which is essential for maintaining a proper service level and avoiding stockouts during spikes. The lead time (L) is consistently observed as 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time, so I will continue using the default setting. The inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is currently 531, which is roughly 5 periods of average demand, providing a safe buffer given the lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 21 has stabilized at a higher mean (avg ~105 since P21, with P31-P40 avg ~100), but with high volatility (standard deviation ~50). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Current inventory standing is 116 on-hand and 424 in-transit. By using recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat, the backend will capture this higher demand regime (avg ~105) and scale it for the 5-period risk window (L+1). For volatility, recent_N (N=14) is chosen to capture the increased variance observed from Period 27 onwards (range 31-183). This combination ensures that the base stock calculation adequately covers potential demand spikes while acknowledging the high current pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $626.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is in a high-volatility regime that started around Period 21. Over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), the mean demand is approximately 101.5 units, with a very high standard deviation (approx 54 units) due to swings between 31 and 184. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the current period is 42 and the game ends at 50, we have 9 periods remaining. The backend logic for base stock is calculated as (1+L) * mu_hat + z * sigma_hat * sqrt(1+L). With L=4, we are covering 5 periods of demand. To capture the recent high volatility and mean, I will use a recent_N window of 21 (covering the start of the regime shift) for mu_hat to stabilize the mean forecast, and a recent_N window of 10 for sigma_hat to reflect the recent spike in variance seen since Period 32. This ensures we carry enough safety stock to prevent stockouts like those seen in P29-P32 while managing holding costs.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained increase in volatility since Period 27, even as it maintains a high mean level (approx 105-110 units). In the most recent periods (P37-P42), demand has fluctuated between 59 and 184 units. Current on-hand inventory is 125, with a pipeline of 354. Given the lead time L=4, we must provide for 5 periods of demand (L+1). Specifically, orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42 are in flight. To capture the recent high demand state and its significant variance, I am using recent_N with N=20 to cover the regime starting around Period 21. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock target that ensures a high service level while managing the holding costs against the $4/unit profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 21 to a higher mean (~105-110 units) and has exhibited significantly higher volatility since Period 31 (range 31-184). For Period 44, I am using a recent window (N=13, from P31 onwards) to capture this increased variance, which is crucial for determining the safety stock with a profit/holding cost ratio of 4:1 (target service level ~80%). The lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals from P34 through P43. Current on-hand (128) and in-transit (423) seem sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), but the high volatility requires larger mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters to prevent stockouts like those seen in P29-P32.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P41-P44) has shown a dip (averaging ~101 units) relative to the high-volatility regime observed since P21. However, the overall mean since the P21 shift remains approximately 105-110 units. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods across all recent arrivals (P37-P44). Given the 4.0 profit and 1.0 holding cost, the critical ratio q is 0.8, meaning the OR backend aims for the 80th percentile of demand over the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=24 to capture the entire high-demand regime from P21 to P44 (24 periods), which encompasses both the high peaks and the recent troughs, ensuring \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 are representative of the current sustained market behavior. No new sustained changes are detected that deviate from the P21/P28/P37 insights.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent high-demand regime (starting Period 21) continues to be the most relevant data segment, with an average demand of approximately 100-110 units. Examining the last 15 periods (P31-P45), demand has averaged 96.6 units but with significantly increased volatility (standard deviation ~52). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (L=4). For Period 46, on-hand inventory is 61, and in-transit inventory is 407 (representing orders from P42-P45). To account for the sustained high variance observed since P27 (as noted in carry-over insights), I will use the last 15 periods (recent_N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This capture the higher service level required for the volatile period while maintaining the base stock level relative to the established demand mean. The OR backend will compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean + z*sqrt(1+L)*std, effectively covering the pipeline delay plus the current period's demand.

=== Period 46 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $482.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P21 onwards) shows a sustained shift to a higher mean (avg ~105) with significant volatility (highs of 184, lows of 31). In the last 10 periods (P37-P46), demand has averaged 105.5 units. The shipment lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods. Given we are at Period 47 (near the end of the 50-period horizon), and on-hand inventory is 110 with 336 units in-transit (covering orders from P43-P46), we need to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=26 (covering the entire high-demand regime since P21) for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a robust estimate of the current mean (~105) and the increased variance observed in later periods. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during high-demand swings against the cost of carrying inventory for the final few periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $459.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. Demand analysis shows that the regime shift detected around Period 21 has sustained an average demand of approximately 105-110 units. However, volatility remains high, with the most recent three periods (P45-P47) showing demand of 114, 148, and 137 respectively (average 133), suggesting a potentially higher demand peak or cluster. My target is to maintain enough stock for the remaining 3 periods of the game (P48, P49, P50), while considering that orders placed now (P48) with a 4-period lead time will arrive in the arrival phase of P52, which is after the game ends. However, the backend OR logic processes orders based on the 'pipeline inventory' and 'base stock' targets for the lead time duration. Given the high demand in the last 3 periods, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 7 to capture the recent uptrend (avg ~110-120), and sigma_hat using recent_N to account for the high volatility observed since Period 27. L is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed high since Period 27; recent 3-period demand (P45-P47) averaged 133, higher than the P21 regime average of 110.

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the high-volatility regime identified around Period 27. Recent performance shows demand fluctuating significantly (e.g., 148 in P46, 137 in P47, then dropping to 67 in P48). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P39-P48) is approximately 105.2, which aligns with the sustained high-state demand regime (~110) observed since Period 21. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on all recent 'conclude' messages. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio ($4/$1), the system targets a high service level (~80%). I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility period while providing enough samples to stabilize the forecast against recent spikes and dips. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to rely on the consistent historical evidence of 4 periods.

Daily Profit: $344.00, Daily Holding Cost: $30.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $314.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 50, the demand data confirms a high-volatility regime that started around Period 27. Recent demand (P45-P49) has averaged approximately 110 units, but with significant swings (between 67 and 148). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on arrival history (P45 order arrived in P49). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (30 units) while in-transit inventory is high (471 units), comprising orders from P46, P47, P48, and P49. These are expected to arrive in Periods 50, 51, 52, and 53 respectively. To maximize reward while managing the high volatility and relatively low profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I am using L=4 (promised), and for mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=20 to capture the current high-volatility regime behavior and average since Period 29.
