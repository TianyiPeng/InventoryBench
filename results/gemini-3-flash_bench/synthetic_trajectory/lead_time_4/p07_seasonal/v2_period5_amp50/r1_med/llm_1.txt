Since we are in Period 1, no arrivals have occurred yet. Actual lead time must be monitored via future 'conclude' messages. d) Inventory: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. e) Order logic: To avoid stockouts during the lead time (L=4) and the subsequent period (L+1=5 total), I need to cover demand for the next 5 periods. Using the historical average of 102 units/period, target inventory is 102 * 5 = 510 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are 0, I will order 510 units. This is a conservative start given the high variance and the long lead time.",

Therefore, for Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4, I will have 0 on-hand inventory and will suffer lost sales. I see from history that demand for chips(Regular) ranges between 43 and 137, with an average of approximately 102 units per period. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms a demand of 126 in the first period. To calculate the necessary order for Period 2, I need to account for the lead time (L=4). The next order placed now (Period 2) will arrive in Period 6. By the start of Period 6, I need to have enough stock to satisfy demand for Period 6. However, my 'inventory position' (on-hand + in-transit) must cover the lead-time window plus the arrival period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current in-transit is 510, which covers approximately 5 periods of demand (510 / 102 \u2248 5). Since the current in-transit (510) is intended to cover the demand from Period 5 (when it arrives) through roughly Period 9, and I am only in Period 2, I should place a supplemental order to ensure continuity. However, placing an order now only affects Period 6 onwards. Given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4), I must avoid overstocking. 510 units covers demand for roughly 5 periods. I will order another 100 units to maintain a rolling pipeline that matches the average demand per period.",

Given the game ends at Period 50, we have 7 periods remaining after this decision (P44-P50). Total units currently available + incoming = 261 + 300 = 561 units. If demand averages ~90 units/period, we need roughly 630 units for the rest of the game (90 * 7). Since holding costs ($1) are significant relative to profit ($4), and we are approaching the end of the game, I will order a small amount to maintain service levels without overstocking at the end.",

At an average demand of 100/period, we only need ~500 units to finish the game. Ordering more now would likely result in unnecessary holding costs and ending inventory that cannot be sold.
