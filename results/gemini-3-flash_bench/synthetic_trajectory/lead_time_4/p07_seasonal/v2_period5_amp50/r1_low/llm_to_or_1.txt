Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 4 periods. The initial demand history for the first five periods is {137, 92, 110, 43, 128}, which gives a mean of 102 and a standard deviation of 33.3. Since we have no observation for Period 0 (we are making our first decision), and inventory is currently 0, we must place an order to cover (L+1) periods of demand. Given L=4, we need to cover 5 periods. Using the 'default' methods here will allow the OR backend to use all provided samples. There is no seasonality or calendar data yet to justify an 'explicit' override.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 164 units (based on the OR backend's initial calculation) during the decision phase. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, this order is in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 (visible in Period 6 start). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 164 in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 126, which resulted in lost sales because we started with 0 inventory. The historical demand samples (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) plus the observed Period 1 demand of 126 suggest a mean demand of approximately 106 units per period. Since we have no lead time observations yet to suggest a deviation from the promised L=4, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, N is set to 6 (5 historical samples + 1 observed period) to capture the full recent baseline. The system will target (1+L)=5 periods of demand (approx 530 units) to cover the lead time gap.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Currently, we have 0 units on-hand and 328 units in-transit (orders from Period 1 and Period 2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Based on the timing rule, an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 4 will arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, seeing arrived=0 in Period 1 and 2 concluding messages is expected and does not yet indicate a lead time shift or lost shipment. Demand for the first two periods was 126 and 119, while the historical samples provided (Periods 1-5) show an average of 102. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand (z=0). I will use the default methods for now as there is insufficient evidence for a regime shift in demand or lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (N=1) are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (N+L = 1+4) and will be first visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Therefore, the fact that arrived=0 in the history (up to Period 3 conclude) is expected and consistent with the promised lead time. Demand history shows values of 137, 92, 110 (from user prompt data) and recently 126, 119, 51 (from game history). The average demand over these 6 samples is roughly 105.8. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have a significant amount in-transit (489 units), we need to ensure our parameters correctly reflect the lead time and the expected demand over the (L+1) window to avoid over-ordering while maintaining the service level. Given the current information, I will stick to the default promised lead time and calculate demand based on all available samples as there is no clear sustained change yet.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1-4 are still in transit (164+164+161+15 = 504 units). Based on the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which I will read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, the zero arrivals seen so far are consistent with the promised lead time. Demand has been volatile (126, 119, 51, 18), but the latest sample for P5 is 128 (from historical data provided). Given the inventory is currently 0 and we are waiting for the first wave of shipments, I will use all available demand samples to forecast. The mean demand over 5 periods is 102. I will set parameters to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. No lead time evidence yet to deviate from default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (actual lead time = 4), confirming the timing mechanism. Historical demand across the first 5 periods is: 126, 119, 51, 18, 84 (Mean: 79.6). Currently, we have 80 units on hand and 340 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4). Since lead time is 4, demand from P6 to P10 needs to be covered. The in-transit inventory is quite high relative to the recent drop in demand (P3=51, P4=18), though P5 recovered slightly (84). I will use the default lead time (4) and use the last 5 samples (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the initial demand was higher than the recent two periods. This helps the OR engine prevent over-ordering while maintaining enough safety stock for the recovery seen in Period 5.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being met (Order P1 arrived P5; Order P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 86, and in-transit is 176 (from P3 and P4 orders). Demand has been volatile: the mean of the first 5 samples provided in the prompt was 102, but the actual realized demand in periods 1-6 was [126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158], averaging 92.6. Recent demand (last 2 periods) has rebounded significantly (84, 158). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the OR backend will target a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1)). To avoid overstocking while accounting for the recent demand surge, I will use a recent_N method for demand forecasting (N=6 to capture all realized game history) and the default lead time. Sigma_hat will also be calculated based on recent history to capture the observed high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the first 7 periods shows a mean of approximately 98.6 units (126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158, 134). However, ignoring the outliers in Periods 3 and 4 (51 and 18), the more stable demand seems to hover around 120-130 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and the concluded data for Periods 5, 6, and 7 confirms an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods for the first three orders. Current on-hand inventory is 113, and there are 194 units in-transit (orders from Period 4 of 15 units and Period 7 of 179 units). Because the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0 each), the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which means the base stock policy will target the median demand. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=7 to capture the available history) and default for lead time as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (consistently observed in shipments from P1, P2, and P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-18.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from periods 1 through 4. The current inventory status shows 73 units on-hand and 360 units in-transit (ordered in periods 7 and 8). Demand has been somewhat volatile but recently averaged around 100 units per period across the first 8 periods (mean = 93). Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using all available data (8 conclude messages + 5 pre-game samples = 13 samples) provides a stable estimate. Setting L to default (4) as it matches observation. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to default to leverage all historical samples for a conservative stock level, as holding costs are high ($1) relative to profit ($1).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is virtually depleted (1 unit). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. No order was placed in Period 5 or 6, meaning there will be zero arrivals in Period 10 and Period 11, leading to stockouts since current on-hand is only 1. The in-transit pipeline (410 units) consists of orders from P7 (179), P8 (181), and P9 (50). These are expected to arrive in P11, P12, and P13 respectively. Demand has been volatile, ranging from 18 to 158. Over the 9 concluded periods, the mean demand is 90.7 units with a standard deviation of 47.9. Given Lead Time (L)=4, the window for coverage is (L+1)=5 periods. I will use the 'default' method for L (which is 4) and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full sample mean and standard deviation, as there is no clear evidence of a sustained demand regime shift yet. This strategy aims to rebuild stock to cover roughly 450 units (5 * 90) plus a safety buffer, accounting for the large pipeline already in flight.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). This means the orders from P5 and P6 were expected to arrive at the end of P9 and P10, but they were size 0, so no arrivals occurred. The current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand in Period 10 (80) exhausted the remaining 1 unit from Period 9. The pipeline contains orders from P7 (179), P8 (181), P9 (50), and P10 (63), totaling 473 units. The P7 shipment (179 units) is expected to arrive during Period 11. Historical demand for periods 1-10 is: 126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158, 134, 55, 72, 80. Average demand across these 10 periods is ~89.7. Given L=4, the review+lead window is L+1=5 periods. Expected demand over this window is roughly 450 units. Since current in-transit (473) already covers this, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a small or zero order. I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead times match the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full range of historical volatility while emphasizing the actual demand levels seen so far.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12, the promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals (P1, P2, P3, P4, and P7). The order placed in Period 7 arrived in Period 11, confirming L=4. However, orders from Period 5 (0 units) and Period 6 (0 units) arrived as expected in P9 and P10 (resulting in 'arrived=0' messages). We have 294 units in transit (from P8, P9, P10). Demand has been somewhat volatile: the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaged 98 units, while the full history (P1-P11) averages 95. There's no clear evidence of a significant sustained regime shift yet, as the demand fluctuates around a mean of ~100. I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the slight uptick in noise and maintain a safety buffer, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. L stays at the default 4.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory is 121 and 279 units are in-transit (orders from P9, P10, and P12). History confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as seen in successful arrivals from P1, P2, P3, P4, P7, and P8). The orders from P5 and P6 yielded 0 units, indicating they were either 0-unit orders or lost (they have not arrived by P13). Demand has shown high variability with an average around 102 units per period over the 12 observed periods (excluding the seeding samples). Recent demand (last 3 periods) has been slightly higher (avg ~106). Since Profit equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level (q=0.5). To ensure we manage the current pipeline accurately and account for the confirmed lead time, I will set L to 4 explicitly and use the full 12-period historical sample for demand to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which provides a balanced view of the volatility seen so far.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-15.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate variability with a mean of approximately 94 units over the last 13 periods. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on game history (P7, P8, P9 orders all arrived with L=4). However, orders from Periods 5 and 6 appear to be lost as they are well past the 4-period window. I am sticking with L=4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), I will use the average of the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the recent stable but fluctuating demand while smoothing out the early period spikes. Sigma_hat is calculated using the same N=10 window to provide an appropriate safety stock buffer given the equal trade-off between profit and holding cost ($1.0 each).

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 5 (ordered 0, though history shows no order placed) and Period 6 (ordered 0) are irrelevant, but more importantly, no orders were placed in those periods. Pipeline inventory is currently 303, consisting of orders from P10 (63), P12 (166), and P13 (74). Expecting P10 arrival in P14 conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-106.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 10 order. The current on-hand inventory is 131 units, and the pipeline inventory is 303 (orders from Periods 12, 13, and 14). Specifically, the order of 166 units from Period 12 is expected to arrive in Period 16 conclude, which will significantly boost inventory. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown high variability but has recently averaged around 94 units per period across all 14 periods. However, recent demand (last 3 periods) has been lower (Avg: 64). To avoid overstocking while maintaining a 50% service level (since Profit=$1 and Holding=$1), I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation. I will set N=10 to balance the recent lower demand against the higher early-game volumes, capturing a more stable mean of approximately 88 units. This prevents the system from over-ordering due to the large 166-unit shipment coming in next period.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 38 units on-hand and 332 units in-transit. The game history confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (as seen in the receipt of orders from Period 1 to Period 4, and Period 7 to Period 10). The order placed in Period 11 was 0, which explains why no shipment arrived during Period 15. We expect the shipment from Period 12 (166 units) to arrive during Period 16 and become visible at the start of Period 17. Demand has been fluctuating but manageable, with the most recent sample at 93. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 to capture the mean demand volatility over the last 10 periods (P6-P15), which averages approximately 93.4. Calculating mu_hat (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat sqrt(1+L)*std via the OR backend for L=4 provides a balanced buffer against stockouts versus holding costs (given profit and holding costs are equal, the target service level is 50%).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 22 units, and the in-transit inventory is 263 units (orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16). Historical arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P11, P12, P13, P14, P16) consistently show a lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand has been volatile, ranging from 18 to 182, with an average around 95-100 units across the most recent periods. Specifically, the last 8 periods (P9-P16) average approximately 96 units/period. Period 16 saw a significant spike (182), so I will use a recent_N calculation with N=8 to capture the current demand level while smoothing out the noise. The lead time L will remain 'default' as it is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with recent_N (N=8) balances the need to account for recent volume while acknowledging high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P11-P17) shows a mean demand of 98.7 units with a standard deviation of approx 52.8. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 23, and in-transit inventory is 365, totaling 388 units of inventory exposure. We expect the shipment from Period 14 (63 units) to arrive in Period 18 and the shipment from Period 15 (29 units) in Period 19. Given the volatility (demand range 25-182), I will use the recent 7 periods (P11-P17) to capture current demand levels for forecasting. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock level that covers L+1 (5 periods) of demand. With Profit and Holding cost equal at $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5 (ordering enough to cover the median demand). Since mean and median are roughly aligned in this regime, recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to balance stockout risk and holding costs.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 14-18) shows a mean of approximately 82.8 units per period, which is slightly lower than the all-time mean (approx. 101 including startup samples). However, the variance is notable, and we must account for the 4-period lead time. Shipments have arrived consistently with a 4-period lead time (P10 at P14, P12 at P16, P13 at P17, P14 at P18). P11 was ordered as 0. We expect P15's order (29 units) to arrive in Period 19 conclude, followed by larger orders from P16 (97) and P17 (176) to replenish the on-hand stock and cover future demand. I will use a recent_N of 10 to capture recent demand trends (approx 92/period) while ignoring the very early startup volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 20. The on-hand inventory is 0, with 413 units in-transit. Based on the game history, lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by recent arrivals from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15 all having L=4). The primary goal is to ensure the pipeline covers demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Historical demand shows fluctuations but has averaged approximately 101 units across the first 19 periods. However, recent demand (last 5 periods) has been slightly lower (avg ~69). Stockouts occurred in Period 19, suggesting a need for a robust safety stock. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=10) to balance long-term mean with recent trends, and use a larger N=15 for sigma_hat to capture the underlying volatility. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is stable and well-documented.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Period 21. Reviewing the history, the lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully arrived shipments (P1-P4, P7-P10, and P12-P16). The pipeline inventory of 347 units includes orders from Period 17 (176), Period 18 (105), Period 19 (35), and Period 20 (31). The order from Period 17 (176 units) is expected to arrive during Period 21. Demand has been relatively stable with some fluctuations; the last 10 periods show an average demand of approximately 88 units per period, which is higher than the long-term average (approx 85). Given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend naturally targets a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1)), but because demand can be volatile (e.g., P16 demand was 182), I will use the last 10 samples to capture the recent mean and variance more accurately. The 'recent_N' method with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will help stabilize the base stock around the current 80-90 unit demand regime while accounting for recent variability.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 260 units, consisting of orders from P18 (105), P19 (35), P20 (31), and P21 (89). The order from P18 is expected to arrive during Period 22 resolution. Demand has shown some volatility but remains within a consistent range. Given the balance of a $1 profit and $1 holding cost, the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the backend to aim for the median demand. I am using the recent_N method (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (approximately 80-90 units/period) while acknowledging the recent dip and recovery.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a moderate upturn compared to the earliest periods but remains within a volatile range. Over the last 10 periods (P13-P22), the average demand is approximately 90.5 units per period. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across almost all processed arrivals (P1 through P18 orders). The pipeline inventory of 265 units is composed of orders from P19 (35), P20 (31), P21 (89), and P22 (110). Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect the P19 order to arrive in the current period (P23), though it will not be visible until the P24 start. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend will calculate. To respond to the recent demand level while accounting for volatility, I am using a recent_N window of 10 periods for demand (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat), and setting the lead time (L) to 4 as observed.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility, with a mean observed over the last 10 periods (P14-P23) of approximately 84.7 units, compared to the overall historical mean (including pre-game samples) of approximately 95 units. Current on-hand inventory is 57, and in-transit inventory is 373, which includes orders from P20 (31), P21 (89), P22 (110), and P23 (143). Based on the lead time of 4 periods, order P20 (31 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 24. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting the OR backend will target the median demand over the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to weight the most recent demand regime, and 'calculate' for lead time as the 4-period lead time has remained stable (P5-P23).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate volatility but remains within a consistent range (10-period rolling average ~82). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (arrived units in P21-P24 all show lead_time=4). With on-hand inventory at 17 and in-transit at 342, the pipeline is relatively healthy. My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the review period (1). Using recent_N for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focused on the last 15 periods provides a balanced view that smooths out extreme outliers from the early periods while capturing recent patterns. I will set mu_hat to use the last 15 periods to align with the current demand regime, and calculate L based on the consistent historical evidence.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 82 units over the last 10 periods (P15-P24). Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 333 units, consisting of orders from P22 (110), P23 (143), P24 (0), and P25 (80). Based on the consistent 4-period lead time observed throughout the game, the P22 order (110 units) is expected to arrive during Period 26 and will be visible in the next conclude message. The demand regime has shifted since Period 15, stabilizing at a lower average compared to the start of the game. Over the last 11 periods (P15-P25), the average demand is approximately 91.8 units, while the last 5 periods (P21-P25) show a slightly higher average of 90.2 units with some volatility (e.g., 125, 123, 110). I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this stabilized demand regime while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which I will confirm using the 'calculate' method to utilize the solid historical data of 4-day arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Average demand from P15-P25 is ~92 units, significantly lower than the P1-P14 average of ~95 (with high spikes reaching 182).

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we observe that on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 26 where demand (120) exceeded available stock (110). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 345 units, consisting of orders from P23 (143), P24 (0), P25 (80), and P26 (122). The order from P23 is expected to arrive during Period 27's arrival phase. The demand regime has shifted slightly higher recently, with an average of approximately 88.3 units over the last 12 periods (P15-P26), compared to the earlier periods. To ensure we cover the risk of stockouts while accounting for the high holding cost (equal to profit), I will use a recent_N window of 12 for the demand mean and standard deviation to capture this stabilized regime. The target service level should be around 50% given the equal profit and holding cost (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), which the base stock policy handles. Using N=12 sessions for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a balance between responsiveness to the current regime and statistical stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Average demand from P15-P26 is ~88 units. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent upward trend, with the last three periods (P25-P27) averaging 114 units, compared to the P15-P24 average of 82. The inventory position is currently tight, with on-hand units at 31 and an in-transit pipeline of 325. Since L is confirmed at 4 periods, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using manual calculation for clarity: the average demand of the most recent regime (P21-P27) is approximately 97.7 units. Therefore, mu_hat for the (L+1) window should be roughly 488 (5 * 97.7). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this higher demand average and prevent stockouts while balancing the equal profit and holding costs (target service level ~ 50%). Lead time L remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: Demand increased from an average of ~82 (P15-P24) to ~114 (P25-P27), indicating a higher mean for the current cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29, the system has 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 28, where demand (100) exceeded available stock (31). The order from Period 24 (which was 0 units) resulted in no arrival this period, as expected given the stable lead time of 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (457) consists of orders from Period 25 (80), 26 (122), 27 (123), and 28 (132). Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect the 80 units from Period 25 to arrive during Period 29 (visible in Period 30). Demand has shifted upwards starting at Period 25; the mean demand from P25-P28 is (110+120+112+100)/4 = 110.5. To capture this recent higher-demand regime and protect against further stockouts, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. L is set to 'calculate' as the historical lead time has been extremely consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: Average demand (P25-P28) is ~111 units, up from ~88 in the previous cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand cycle (P25-P29) exhibits a sustained increase in mean demand compared to the P15-P24 period. The average demand across these 5 periods is approximately 110 units (110, 120, 112, 100, 107), which matches the carry-over insight of a shift around Period 25. Actual lead time has remained extremely stable at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in P25, P26, P27, and P29. While P28 showed 0 arrivals, this is consistent with the fact that 0 units were ordered in P24. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand exceeding supply in recent periods. We have 473 units in-transit (P26: 122, P27: 123, P28: 132, P29: 96), and since the lead time is 4, we expect the 122 units from P26 to arrive in Period 30. To stabilize the service level and account for the higher demand regime, mu_hat is set to reflect the mean of the last 5 periods (P25-P29) and L is kept at calculate to leverage the consistent 4-period observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 sustained: Mean moved from ~88 to ~110 (+25%) over 5 periods (P25-P29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 25. For the last 6 periods (P25-P30), the average demand is 111.5 units, compared to the previous regime (P15-P24) of approximately 88 units. This represents a sustained 26% increase. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent arrivals from P25 and P26. The on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (2 units), so we must rely on the incoming pipeline. Given equal profit and holding costs ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (the median), while the cap ensures protection against extreme variance. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to accurately reflect volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 sustained: Mean demand (P25-P30) is ~112 units, up from ~88 in the previous cycle (+27%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 25. The mean demand for the last 7 periods (P25-P31) is approximately 119.3 units, compared to the previous regime of ~88 units. This reflects a ~35% increase. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts in 4 of the last 7 periods (P25, P26, P28, P29, P31), indicating that we are under-ordering for this higher demand level. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. I am setting N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher-velocity demand regime (P25-P31) while ignoring the lower demand data from earlier periods. This will increase the base stock calculation to better cover the current consumption rate and reduce stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed and sustained: Mean demand (P25-P31) is ~119 units, a 35% increase from the P15-P24 average of ~88.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 25. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P25-P32) is approximately 124.75 units, compared to the previous regime of ~88 units. This represents a sustained increase of over 40%. The lead time remains highly stable at exactly 4 periods. In Period 32, we experienced another high demand spike (183), leading to a stockout despite a large arrival (132). Current inventory is 0 with 442 units in transit (ordered in P29, P30, P31, P32). To capture this new higher-demand, higher-volatility regime, I am using N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=8 focuses the OR backend on the recent sustained shift while maintaining enough samples to account for the increased variance observed in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed and sustained: Mean demand (P25-P32) is ~125 units, a 42% increase from the P15-P24 average of ~88. Volatility has also increased during this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 25. Analyzing the demand from P25 to P33, the mean demand is approximately 119 units per period (110, 120, 112, 100, 107, 120, 146, 183, 82), which is a clear increase from the previous regime (~88). Although the demand in Period 33 was lower (82), the overall trend and recent peak (183 in P32) suggest sustained higher volatility. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on consistent 'conclude' messages. Pipeline inventory currently includes orders from P30 (76), P31 (129), P32 (141), and P33 (170). For Period 34, I will use recent_N with N=9 (P25-P33) to capture this higher demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level accounts for the recent 35%+ increase in volume and associated volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 sustained: Mean demand (P25-P33) is ~119 units, a 35% increase from the P15-P24 average.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 25 is well-established, with the mean demand for Period 25 to Period 34 being approximately 111.1 units. This represents a significant increase from the Period 15-24 average of ~88 units. Recent volatility has been high (reaching 183 in P32 and dropping to 31 in P34), suggesting the base stock needs to account for both the higher mean and increased variance to protect against stockouts. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use the last 10 periods (P25-P34) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this encompasses the entire new regime and provides a stable basis for the OR backend's inventory calculation. Current on-hand is 59 and in-transit is 510, which includes orders from P31 (129), P32 (141), P33 (170), and P34 (70). We expect the P31 order (129 units) to arrive during Period 35.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 25. While the initial surge (P25-P32) saw mean demand around 125, the most recent three periods (P33-P35) have shown a significant cooling (82, 31, 66), bringing the average from P25-P35 down to ~107. The 'recent_N' with N=11 (P25-P35) captures this increased volatility and the recent stabilization at a higher mean than the P15-P24 period (88). On-hand inventory is healthy (122), and pipeline inventory is substantial (381), comprising orders from P32 (141), P33 (170), and P34 (70). The order from P32 is expected to arrive in Period 36. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=11 to reflect the sustained post-P25 regime while acknowledging the recent dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 25. Analyzing the most recent segment (P25-P36), the mean demand is approximately 120.5 units (110, 120, 112, 100, 107, 120, 146, 183, 82, 31, 66, 166). Although the last few periods show high volatility (standard deviation ~45), the 12-period window provides a stable basis for the new regime. Lead time is confirmed and consistent at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (97) and significant in-transit stock (272), the pipeline is well-saturated. I will use the recent_N method with N=12 to align with the detected regime shift at Period 25 while the OR backend manages the safety stock for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: Mean demand (P25-P36) is ~121 units, significantly higher than P15-P24 (~88). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-39.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 25 and has remained elevated. Since P25, the mean demand is approximately 117 units (calculated from Period 25 to 37: 110, 120, 112, 100, 107, 120, 146, 183, 82, 31, 66, 166, 114). The most recent demand (P37) was 114. The pipeline inventory is 283 (orders from P34, P36, P37) and On-hand is 153. Given the Promised Lead Time (L=4) is consistent with the observed lead time, the inventory position is roughly 436 units. This needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using the recent 13-period window (P25-P37) provides a stable estimate for this higher demand regime. L is kept at 'default' (4) as shipments have consistently arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 sustained: Mean demand (P25-P37) is ~117 units, maintaining the ~33% increase observed previously.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-105.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context shows a sustained higher demand regime that began around Period 25. The mean demand for the last 14 periods (P25-P38) is approximately 114.2, which aligns with carry-over insights citing a shift from ~88 to ~117+. Specifically, the most recent 10 periods (P29-P38) show a mean of 115.4 with significant volatility (std dev ~48). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 164, and in-transit inventory is 338 (orders from P35-P38). The pipeline is relatively full, but given the 4-period lead time and current demand levels, I will use a recent window of N=14 (since the Period 25 shift) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the higher volume demand seen recently while acknowledging the high variance and preventing over-stocking during potential dips like Period 34/38.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-28.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 25. Analyzing the most recent data (P25-P39), the average demand is approximately 111.9 units, demonstrating a clear sustained increase compared to the P15-P24 period (~88 units). While recent demand in P38 (59) and P39 (68) was lower, the overall variance in this regime is high (std dev ~42). The lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods, confirmed by multiple consecutive arrivals (P33-P38). Currently, on-hand inventory is 96 and in-transit is 378 (orders from P36, P37, P38, P39). I am using recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime starting from Period 25. This ensures the base stock calculation accurately reflects the ~112 mean demand and its associated risk across the (L+1) exposure window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 25 refined: Average demand (P25-P39) is ~112 units, with increased volatility (std dev ~42). Shipment from P35 was for 0 units, explaining the 'arrived=0' in P39 conclude, confirming lead time remains 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-4.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 25. Analyzing demand from P25 to P40 (16 periods), the mean demand is approximately 107 units per period. Recent demand (P33-P40) has slowed down slightly to an average of 72, but the overall volatility remains high (standard deviation approx 41.5). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival from P36 in P40. The current pipeline inventory is 400 (Orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40), and on-hand is 66. To ensure sufficient coverage for the L+1 window (5 periods) given the recent volatility and the risk of stockouts seen in the P25-P32 window, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat based on the regime starting at P25 (N=16) to capture the sustained higher mean while acknowledging the recent dip. This balances the risk of over-ordering against the need to satisfy the underlying higher demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 25 sustained: Mean demand (P25-P40) is ~107 units. Volatility remains significant (std dev ~42). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 shows a mean of approximately 107 units with sustained volatility (std dev ~42). The most recent period (P41) saw a spike to 184 units, which is consistent with the higher volatility observed in this cycle. Current on-hand inventory is 63, and in-transit inventory is 268 (total pipeline of 331). Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and the fact that we just came off a high-demand period, I will continue using the recent regime (last 17 periods, P25-P41) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend captures the current higher mean and significant variance while accounting for a 4-period lead time + 1-period review cycle (L+1=5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 shows a shifted mean compared to the earlier history (P15-P24). Analyzing demand from P25 to P42, the average is approximately 107 units per period. Recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with high spikes (e.g., P41: 184) and moderate troughs. The lead time remains firmly established at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival pattern (P37 arrived P41, P38 arrived P42). On-hand inventory is 75, with a pipeline of 324 (Orders from P39, P40, P41, P42). Since the demand regime has been stable in its higher state for 18 periods (P25-P42), I am using N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific regime's mean and volatility while excluding the lower-demand period P15-P24. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the observed ~27% increase in demand and the associated higher variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-27.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 shows an average demand of approximately 107 units with significant volatility (std dev ~42). The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 71 units, and in-transit units total 425. These in-transit units represent orders from Periods 40 (54), 41 (49), 42 (181), and 43 (141). The next arrival expected in Period 44 (concluding in Period 45) is the Period 40 order of 54 units. To sustain the current 42% mean demand increase while managing the observed volatility, I will use a N=19 period lookback for mu_hat (covering Periods 25-43) and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime shift and its variance accurately. This ensures we cover approximately 5 periods of demand (L+1) in our base stock calculation.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 25 and has remained elevated. Over the last 10 periods (P35-P44), demand has averaged approximately 105.9 units with a standard deviation of 51.5, showing high volatility. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Since we are in Period 45 out of 50, and the lead time is 4, any order placed now (P45) will arrive in Period 49. Orders placed in P46 or later will arrive too late to be fully utilized. Therefore, I will use a N=10 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility and the average demand levels of the current regime. This ensures we cover the expected demand for the remaining periods while accounting for the high observed variance (~51) to avoid stockouts in the final stretch.

=== Period 45 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 25 and has remained elevated. Since P25, the mean demand is approximately 107 units with a standard deviation of about 43. Current on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 359 units (orders from P42, P43, P44, P45). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P46-P50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. Choosing recent_N=21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the post-P25 regime (P25-P45). The OR backend uses the formula (1+L)*mean, where L=4, effectively covering 5 periods of demand (the current period plus the four-period lead time), which aligns perfectly with the end of the simulation.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we observe a steady lead time of 4 periods. The demand regime shifted around Period 25 and has remained elevated. Over the last 10 periods (P37-P46), the average demand is 107.5 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 48.6. This recent window captures both the high-demand spikes (like 184 in P41) and lower dips (44 in P43). Given that we are near the end of the game (P47 of 50) and current on-hand inventory is low (33), we need to ensure the order covers the remaining periods and lead time. Using a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR backend to react to this sustained high-demand/high-volatility regime. L is set to 'calculate' as the lead time has been consistently 4 periods and we have ample data points for a stable average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 37-46 shows an average of ~108 units with high volatility (std dev ~49). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 has stabilized at a higher level than the initial phase. For the most recent 10-period window (P38-P47), the mean demand is approximately 107 units with a standard deviation of 48. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple arrivals (orders from P38 through P43). Currently, we have 37 units on-hand and 311 units in-transit (orders from P44-P47). To ensure sufficient stock for the remaining 3 periods of the game (L+1 coverage), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current high-volatility, higher-mean state, while keeping L at the default promised value of 4, which aligns with observed actuals.

Daily Profit: $64.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are at the end of the simulation. Period 48 conclude showed a demand of 67, and on-hand inventory is currently 0. The pipeline inventory is high at 432 units, with arrivals expected from Period 45 (10 units), Period 46 (157 units), and Period 47 (117 units) across the next few periods. The demand regime from Period 37-48 shows an average demand of approximately 107 units with a standard deviation of 48. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since this is the final decision period (Decision 49 for arrival in Period 53, while the game ends at Period 50), the system needs to maintain coverage. I will set mu_hat based on the recent demand (last 12 periods, N=12) to reflect the high volatility and current mean (~107), and use the standard lead time L=4. This ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for the (L+1) window, although ending stock will be the primary driver for reward now.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P37-P48 average ~107 units, std dev ~48. Stockouts in P45 and P48 due to high demand spikes (>110) while starting inventory was insufficient.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we start with 0 On-hand inventory. The order from Period 46 (157 units) is due to arrive this period (L=4). Demand since Period 25 has been characterized by a higher mean (~107-112) and significant volatility (std dev ~42-49). Recent data (P37-P49) shows a consistent average of ~107 units. Stockouts occurred in P45, P48, and P49 due to spikes exceeding available stock and delayed pipeline replenishment. To prevent a stockout in the final periods of the simulation, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 (covering the stable regime since P37) and N=13 for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P37-P49 remains stable: average ~107 units, std dev ~48. Stockouts in P45, P48, and P49 reinforce the need for a higher safety stock due to volatility spikes.
