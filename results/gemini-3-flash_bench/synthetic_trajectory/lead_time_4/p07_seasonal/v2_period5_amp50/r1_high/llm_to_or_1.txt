Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no history to analyze yet, but we are provided with 5 periods of demand history for chips(Regular): 137, 92, 110, 43, 128. The mean of these samples is 102 and the standard deviation is approximately 33. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the base-stock formula, the order should cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. I will use the 'default' method which utilizes all available historical samples to set the initial baseline. The OR backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4) * 102 = 510 and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+4) * 33 \u2248 73.8. Since on-hand and in-transit are both 0, this will trigger an initial order to fill the pipeline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 164 units. Based on the promised lead time of 4 periods, this order is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1 (demand was 126). The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the first 5 samples provided shows significant volatility (137, 92, 110, 43, 128), with an average of approximately 102 units per period. Since we have very little confirmed history in the game itself (only Period 1 demand of 126), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand metrics to capture the pre-game samples plus recent activity. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4 periods as we have no 'conclude' messages to suggest otherwise yet. The goal is to build up inventory to meet future demand while managing the lead time gap.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, with 322 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since P1's order only arrived during the RESOLUTION phase of P5 and will be visible in P6, the 'arrived=0' messages for P1 and P2 are expected and do not indicate lost shipments or lead time shifts yet. Total demand for the first two periods was 126 and 119, with additional historical samples 137, 92, 110, 43, 128. Currently, 7 data points are available. Mean demand is ~107.8. Standard deviation is ~33. Since there is no seasonal data or date-specific context provided, I will use all available samples (N=7). L remains at the promised default of 4. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (totaling 483 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (164 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and will be first visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message read at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts for the first 3 periods. Historical demand data shows a mean of approximately 102 units with significant variance (samples: 137, 92, 110, 43, 128 - note: user provided samples differ slightly from game history demand logs, I will use game history for calculations). Average demand from P1-P3 history is (126+119+51)/3 = 98.6. Including the sample data provided in the prompt (137, 92, 110, 43, 128), the mean is 102. I will set the lead time to the promised 4 periods and use all available samples (N=5) to estimate demand and volatility. Since we are in a stockout situation, ensuring the pipeline covers L+1 periods of demand is critical.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4. According to the lead time sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (164 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced 100% stockouts for the first 4 periods. The 'In-transit' total of 624 units matches the sum of orders from Periods 1-4 (164+158+161+141). Demand has been volatile (126, 119, 51, 18). Since no orders have reached the 'conclude' phase yet, I cannot confirm the actual lead time, so I will stick with the promised L=4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), the average of the first 5 samples provided (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) is 102. Given L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=5 periods, resulting in 510. I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to utilize its internal statistical calculations over the available history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1516.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on history, the promised lead time L=4 is confirmed (Order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 conclude, meaning it arrived during Period 5 resolution). Demand has shown significant volatility: P1-P2 was high (~122), P3-P4 was very low (~34), and P5 was moderate (84). Given the limited sample size (5 periods), the 'default' or 'recent_N' methods are currently most appropriate to capture the mean. However, the initial stockout (Sold=0 for P1-P4) means we are currently catching up. On-hand is 80, and there is a large pipeline (460 units) consisting of orders from P2 (158), P3 (161), and P4 (141). These are expected to arrive in Periods 6, 7, and 8 respectively. I will use 'default' for lead time since the promised L=4 is accurate. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to encompass the full range of observed demand (mean ~80) while being slightly more responsive than the whole-history 'default' as more data accumulates. This ensures the base stock calculation covers the (L+1)=5 periods of demand effectively.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived during P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2922.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand history (P1-P6) shows a high initial variance: 126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158. The average demand over these 6 periods is approximately 92.7. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (based on P1 and P2 orders arriving in P5 and P6). With L=4, the pipeline inventory logic (1+L) requires us to cover demand for 5 periods. The current on-hand is 80 and in-transit is 328 (from orders in P3, P4, and P6). Total pipeline = 408. My goal is to ensure the base stock (1+L)*mu + z*sigma is sufficient. Given the wide range in demand (18 to 158), using all available samples (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is safer than a smaller subset to capture this volatility. L is set to default as the promised 4 matches observed reality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2439.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3. The current on-hand inventory is 107, with 346 units in transit (orders from P4, P6, and P7). Demand has shown significant variability over the first 7 periods (range: 18 to 158). Using a 'recent_N' approach for demand (N=7) captures the full variability of the realized demand so far (mean ~98.5). Since L=4, the base stock objective covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Setting L to 'calculate' lets the backend use the observed 4-period lead time. Using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend accounts for the high variance observed in the early game while keeping the target stock level sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the decision period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $852.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of past concluding messages (Periods 5 through 8) consistently confirms an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand history shows significant variability: Period 1 @ 126, Period 2 @ 119, Period 3 @ 51, Period 4 @ 18, Period 5 @ 84, Period 6 @ 158, Period 7 @ 134, Period 8 @ 55. The mean demand across all 8 periods is approximately 93.1, while the mean of the most recent 3 periods (P6-P8) is 115.6. Given the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19), the target service level is high (q=0.95). Current inventory (On-hand 193 + In-transit 386 = 579) is healthy, covering about 6 periods of average demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand and volatility to capture the full historical context including the early high demand and the recent fluctuations, and 'default' for L as it is stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1247.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). No order was placed in P5, which explains why 'arrived=0' was reported in the Period 9 conclude message. The pipeline remains healthy with 452 units in transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Demand has shown significant volatility, ranging from 18 to 158. However, the most recent 9 periods of demand (available from conclude messages) provide a more relevant mean (~90.7) than the seed data. I will use a recent_N approach (N=9) to capture this demand distribution. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is high (~0.95), suggesting the backend should maintain a high service level. Setting L to 4 matches the observed and promised lead time.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Historical observations from Periods 5-10 confirm a stable lead time of 4 periods (matches promised L=4). Period 10 conclude confirms the order from Period 6 arrived (26 units). Note: There was no order in Period 5, explaining the 'arrived=0' in Period 9 conclude. The pipeline currently consists of orders from Periods 7, 8, 9, and 10 (179+181+66+51 = 477 units). Demand has shown significant variance (range: 18-158). Using recent_N for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=10 captures the full context of the actual observed demand since the game started. L is set to 'calculate' to use the consistently observed 4-period lead time.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Analysis of the concluded periods (P5-P8, P10-P11) confirms the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). The expected arrival for P9 from the P5 order (ordered=0) correctly resulted in arrived=0. Historically, demand has fluctuated but stays within a stable range. The total mean demand per period over the 11 observed periods is approximately 95 units. Looking at the last 5 periods (P7-P11), the mean is slightly higher (~98), but given the variability (range 18 to 158), I will use the mean of the last 11 samples for mu_hat to maintain stability. For sigma_hat, I will also use all samples to capture the historical variability. I am using the 'default' method for L (which is the promised 4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=11 to encompass all available performance history.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility. Looking at the last 12 periods, the demand values are: 126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158, 134, 55, 72, 80, 149, 90. The mean demand is approximately 94.7 units per period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on several 'conclude' messages (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12). For Period 13, I will use a window of the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture the overall demand profile since the initial start. The system has 188 on-hand and 352 in-transit, which is quite high compared to the cycle demand (L+1=5 periods). However, I will maintain the recent_N strategy to ensure we stay responsive to the baseline demand shifts while letting the OR backend naturally scale down the order if pipeline inventory is sufficient.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as verified by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13. While demand shows high variability (range: 18 to 158), the mean demand over the last 13 periods is approximately 93.7. Using a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) captures the recent behavior, which includes both the lower demand troughs and the spikes. This provides a stable base-stock calculation for the OR backend to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current on-hand (176) plus in-transit (378) equals 554 units, which is ample compared to the expected demand of roughly 470 units over the next 5 periods, so the OR engine will likely moderate the current order to avoid excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $273.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P1-P4 and P6-P10, all concluding exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is currently high (202 units) and the pipeline remains full (392 units), totaling 594 units of cover. Demand over the last 14 periods has been volatile, ranging from 18 to 158 units, with a mean of approximately 88.6 units. Given the high service level target (q=0.95) and the 4-period lead time, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current inventory position (594) compared to expected 5-period demand (5 * 88.6 = 443) suggests we are well-stocked. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture the full observed demand range while maintaining a stable forecast against the high recent variance (e.g., P14 demand was only 25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1593.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over 15 periods, the lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods as promised (L=4). Demand analysis shows moderate fluctuation with no clear sustained regime shift or seasonal pattern visible in the 'Period_N' sequence. The average demand across all 15 periods is approximately 85.3 units, while the last 5 periods (P11-P15) averaged 67 units, showing a slight decrease. Given the relatively stable demand and consistent lead time, I will use a moderate look-back period (recent_N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach balances responsiveness to recent lower demand while maintaining a buffer for historical peaks. With an on-hand inventory of 174 and in-transit of 337, the total pipeline is 511 units, which covers about 6 periods of average demand, protecting against stockouts during the L=4 lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3296.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 162 units and there are 278 units in-transit (orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16). Historical data confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods. Since the start of the game, demand has been volatile but shows no clear regime shift, ranging from 18 to 182 units. The mean demand of all historical samples (including seed and game periods) is approximately 101.4 units per period. With a lead time (L) of 4, the target window (L+1) is 5 periods. The OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to calculate a base-stock level; I will use the 'default' method for L as the promised lead time of 4 is being consistently met. For demand parameters, I'll use the 'default' method to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 across the entire history to smooth out the periodic volatility while ensuring sufficient safety stock to cover demand spikes like that seen in Period 16 (182 units).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as verified by all concluding shipments (P1 through P13). Current on-hand inventory is 181 units, with 355 units in transit (expected arrivals from P14, P15, P16, and P17). Historical demand varies significantly, with a mean of 95.8 and a standard deviation of 45.4 over the 17 concluded periods. Specifically, demand has ranged from 18 to 182. Given the lead time L=4, we must account for demand over 5 periods (L+1). Using all 17 available data points provides a more robust estimate of volatility in the face of these fluctuations. Calculations: Mean (17 pts) = 95.8, Std Dev (17 pts) = 45.4. For L=4, mu_hat = 5 * 95.8 = 479, sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 45.4 = 101.5. These parameters will help the OR backend maintain a service level consistent with the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 95% target).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 19. Historical demand across 18 periods shows a mean of approximately 95 units per period. The confirmed lead time is consistently 4 periods (as evidenced by arrivals from periods 1-4, 6-14). Currently, on-hand inventory is 175 and in-transit is 390 (orders from P15: 10, P16: 111, P17: 169, P18: 100). The total pipeline plus on-hand is 565 units. With a lead time of 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). 5 periods * 95 demand/period = 475 units. I will use 'default' for L to maintain the stable 4-period lead time. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent demand fluctuations (average demand in the last 10 periods is 84, slightly lower than the overall mean), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a stable actual lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand over the last 19 periods has shown significant volatility but oscillates around a mean of approximately 92.5 units per period. Specifically, the last 10 periods (P10-P19) show a mean of 83.9, while the very recent 5 periods (P15-P19) show a mean of 93.2. Given this variance and lack of a clear seasonal trend in the 'chips(Regular)' category for this specific timeline, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances responsiveness to recent mean shifts while smoothing out the high period-to-period noise (e.g., P16 demand was 182, while P19 was 47). The OR backend calculation (1+L)*mean will correctly set the base stock for the 5-period risk horizon (current period + 4 lead periods).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the historical data (confirmed from Period 6 through Period 20). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability but no distinct seasonal or trend-based regime shift in recent periods. The mean demand over all samples (Periods 1-20) is approximately 86.85, with a standard deviation of about 45.4. Recent demand (last 5 periods) is slightly lower at 71.8. Given the lead time L=4, the pipeline should cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Currently, On-hand is 163 and In-transit is 364, totaling 527 units. This total inventory level comfortably covers the expected demand for the lead time plus current period (approx. 435 units using long-term mean). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the history is stable and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full historical profile for statistical stability while the OR backend manages the safety stock based on the profit/holding ratio.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown moderate fluctuations without a clear seasonal or structural shift in recent periods. The mean demand across all observed periods (1-21) is approximately 91.5, while the mean of the last 10 periods (12-21) is approximately 92.2, suggesting relative stability. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory on-hand (209) and in-transit (283) total 492, which covers roughly 5.3 periods of average demand (L+1.3). To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I will use a window of the last 10 periods (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility (e.g., the spike to 182 in Period 16) while smoothing shorter-term noise. Lead time (L) remains at the default/calculated value of 4.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized over the last few periods (P18-P22) with a mean of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation of about 33. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P18 order in P22 'conclude' message. Pipeline inventory (282) plus on-hand (184) equals 466 units, which roughly covers 4.6 periods of demand (466 / 101). Given L=4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand to ensure high service levels. I will use the recent 10-period window (P13-P22) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while smoothing out outliers. This window length (N=10) provides a balanced response to the observed demand shifts since Period 13.

Daily Reward (R_t): $202.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to show high volatility with no clear seasonal trend identifiable from the generic date labels, though recent periods show a slight softening compared to the initial weeks (Period 23 demand was only 22 units). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as established in previous 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is healthy at 216 units, and there is a significant in-transit pipeline of 377 units (orders from P20-P23). Since demand variation is high (ranging from 18 to 182), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the mean and standard deviation of the most representative recent demand cycle while smoothing out outliers like Period 23. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1) while respecting the high service level target implied by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 186 units with 341 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (Periods 5-8, 10-24). Demand over the last 24 periods has shown significant fluctuations but no clear sustained regime shift, averaging around 88 units/period. The calculation L=4 is reliable based on the history. For demand forecasting (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), using the recent_N method with N=20 provides a stable estimate of the current demand profile while filtering out early noise. This setting balances the target service level (95%) against the holding cost of $1/unit.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate volatility without a clear trend or seasonal spike visible in the recent periods. The mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 81 units, while the full history (excluding the first few initialization periods) reflects a similar magnitude. Lead time is consistently tracking at 4 periods as promised, with arrivals from orders P1-P21 all confirming a 4-period duration. The current inventory position (On-hand: 164, In-transit: 337) is healthy. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the stable but variable demand pattern observed over the middle to late phase of the game history. Method 'calculate' for L is appropriate as lead times have been consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2137.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals through Period 26 (e.g., Period 22 order arrived in Period 26). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability but no clear regime shift; the mean demand over the last 15 periods (roughly 85) is slightly lower than the all-time mean (roughly 92), while the most recent periods (P25-P26) are above 100. Using recent_N=15 for mu_hat captures this moderate trend without over-reacting to short-term spikes. Pipeline inventory (346) plus On-hand (143) is 489, which covers approximately 5-6 periods of average demand, providing a comfortable buffer given the lead time L=4. I will use 'calculate' for L to maintain the confirmed observation and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to balance recent history with enough sample size (N=15) to maintain stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1948.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods as observed in the historical records (e.g., Period 23 order arrived during Period 27 resolution). In-transit inventory matches orders from Periods 24-27 (5 + 84 + 108 + 102 = 299), showing no lost orders. Demand has been relatively stable but exhibits significant variance (ranging from 22 to 182). Over the last 15 periods (approx. three lead-time cycles), the mean demand is approximately 91.8. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical ratio is high, favoring a higher service level. I will use a recent_N of 15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility and mean while smoothing out the extreme low observed in Period 23.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 29. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability but has experienced moderate fluctuations. Looking at the last 15 periods (since Period 14), demand has averaged approximately 90 units, though the most recent periods (P25-P28) show a slight uptick to an average of 110.5 units. To ensure sufficient coverage for the pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods) while accounting for this recent increase in demand and maintaining a high service level (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=15 to capture the general level while responding slightly to the recent trend. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=15 to reflect the current volatility. The In-transit inventory is 415, and On-hand is 85, totaling 500 units of pipeline inventory.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown relative stability over the last 15 periods, with a mean demand of approximately 90.7 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrival data (e.g., Period 25 order arriving in Period 29). On-hand inventory is currently at 62 units, and there are 438 units in-transit, which effectively covers the next several periods of demand considering the 4-period lead time. To maintain the target service level given the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1), specifically aiming for a critical ratio of 0.95, I will utilize 'recent_N' with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime. Lead time (L) remains at the default/promised 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 25-30) has remained relatively stable with a mean of 111.5 units, which is slightly higher than the overall average but consistent within normal fluctuations. Leading into Period 31, on-hand inventory is 50, and there are 450 units in transit (specifically: 102 from P27, 121 from P28, 107 from P29, and 120 from P30). The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting (N=10) to capture the current regime of stabilized demand around 100-110 units while maintaining the 'calculate' method for lead time as it is stable. These parameters ensure the OR backend maintains a base stock to cover demand for (L+1) i.e., 5 periods, while accounting for the significant pipeline inventory currently in transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2768.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is critically low (6 units) following a demand spike (146 units in Period 31). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 27 order in Period 31). Demand has shown a significant upward trend over the last 6 periods, increasing from around 100 units to 146 units. To prevent a stockout in the coming periods before the substantial in-transit orders (471 units) arrive, I am focusing on the most recent demand regime. mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 6 to capture the current elevated demand level (averaging approx 117.5 units per period), and sigma_hat is also calculated based on this recent period to reflect current volatility. The L parameter remains at the promised 4 periods, which is consistent with historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 25: average demand increased to ~118 units compared to earlier periods, with Period 31 reaching a peak of 146.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2413.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we experienced a stockout (demand 183 vs. on-hand 127). This confirms that a significant demand regime shift is occurring, likely exceeding the previous estimate of ~118 units. To prevent further stockouts while inventory levels recover, I am adjusting the demand forecast. I will use the last 8 periods (Period 25 to 32) as the regime window, capturing the recent ramp-up from ~110 to 183. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 494 units in-transit (orders from Periods 29-32). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) will allow the backend to adjust the base stock to cover the (L+1) window effectively during this period of high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Demand reached 183 in Period 32, leading to a stockout. Period 25-32 average is ~125 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1533.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 25. The early baseline (Periods 1-24) averaged approximately 88 units/period. However, from Period 25 to 33, demand has increased to an average of ~120 units, with a notable peak of 183 in Period 32 causing a stockout. In Period 33, demand was 82, likely a slight stabilization, but the overall trend remains elevated. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (25 units) and we have a large pipeline in-transit (557 units) due to aggressive ordering in previous periods (Orders from P30-33 are pending). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a ~95% service level), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the higher demand mean and variance since the regime shift started in Period 25, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects this new reality while accounting for the high in-transit volume to avoid over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at higher level: Periods 25-33 average approx 120 units/period (compared to pre-P25 average of ~88). Peak volatility observed (max 183 units).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift around Period 25. Prior to Period 25, mean demand was approximately 88 units. Since Period 25 (Periods 25-34), the mean has increased to approximately 111.1 units, despite two lower demand observations in Periods 33 and 34 (82 and 31 units respectively). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0, implying a high service level requirement), I must protect against the high volatility observed in the recent regime (peak of 183 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime while factoring in the recent volatility and the slight dip in the last two periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 25 to a higher level. Over the last 11 periods (P25-P35), the average demand is 107 units, but with significant volatility including a peak of 183 and a recent low of 31. Current on-hand is 171, and in-transit is 464, which is quite high relative to the average demand. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high in-transit amount, I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the higher mean and volatility of the current regime while allowing the OR backend to manage the current inventory surplus. I choose N=11 to reflect all data points since the confirmed regime shift at Period 25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3005.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant shift starting around Period 25. Prior to P25, the average demand was approximately 88 units. From P25 to P36, the average demand has risen to approximately 107 units, with high volatility (peaks of 183 and 166). The current on-hand inventory is 149, and there are 367 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the sustained higher demand and high volatility during this new regime, I am using a recent window (N=12) to capture the higher mean and standard deviation. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent upward trend and increased risk of stockouts, while avoiding over-weighting the lower historical baseline from the first 24 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift from P25 confirmed: Average demand increased from ~88 to ~107 units per period (+21%) with increased volatility (standard deviation nearly doubling).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1961.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (since Period 25) shows a higher mean and increased volatility compared to earlier periods. The average demand from Period 25-37 is approximately 107 units, with a standard deviation significantly higher than the baseline. Period 38 starts with an on-hand inventory of 205 and in-transit units of 378. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods according to the game history (e.g., Period 33 order arriving in Period 37). To account for the shifted demand regime and the high volatility (recent peaks of 183 and 166), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the period since the confirmed shift at P25). This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand level and covers the 5-period risk window (L+1). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period observed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $849.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly around Period 25. While the pre-P25 average was approximately 88 units, the average from P25 to P38 is approximately 107 units with significantly increased volatility (standard deviation increased from ~40 to ~45). Leading into Period 39, we have 272 units on-hand and 376 units in-transit. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19:$1), the target service level is high (~95%), necessitating a robust base stock that accounts for the most recent demand behavior and the 4-period lead time. I will use a recent_N of 14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this newer, more volatile regime while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 25. Since Period 32, we have observed high volatility with demand values ranging from 31 to 183. The average demand from Period 25 through Period 39 is approximately 107 units. The last 5 periods (P35-P39) show a mean of 94.6, but given the earlier spikes, I will use a window of 15 periods (starting from the regime shift at P25) to capture the higher mean and increased variance. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 228 units on-hand and 396 in-transit, we have sufficient cover for the next few periods, but we must maintain the base stock to account for the L+1 (5 period) risk horizon during this high-volatility regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant regime change starting around Period 25. Prior to P25, the average demand was approximately 88 units; since P25 (covering 16 periods), it has increased to approximately 105 units with significantly higher volatility (peaks up to 183). In the most recent 5 periods (P36-P40), demand has been slightly lower (avg 94), but given the previous volatility and the risk of stockouts during high-demand spikes (as seen in P32), I will use a window of the last 16 periods (representing the entire high-demand regime) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the higher sustained demand and increased variance. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods across all historical arrivals, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3286.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to display significant volatility within the high-demand regime that began around Period 25. The most recent demand (Period 41) was 184 units, reinforcing the observation that while the mean has shifted upwards (approx. 107-110 units), the variance is substantially higher than the initial periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 210 units and 271 units in-transit, there's a healthy pipeline. I will continue using 'recent_N' with N=17 (covering Period 25 to 41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-mean, high-variance regime without being overly influenced by the much lower early-game data. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to prevent stockouts during demand spikes (like the 184 units seen twice recently) while accounting for the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting around Period 25 has stabilized at a higher mean with significantly increased volatility. Recent demand (P25-P42) averages ~106 units per period, compared to the early-game average (~88). Period 41 saw a spike of 184 units, reinforcing the need for higher safety stock. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current inventory (On-hand: 221, In-transit: 328) is robust, but with a 4-period lead time, the pipeline must cover demand through Period 47. I am using recent_N (N=18) to capture the full extent of the current demand regime (P25 to P42) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the higher mean and the increased variance observed in this phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $615.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 25. Analyzing the last 19 periods (P25 to P43), the average demand is approximately 105.8 units per period, representing a ~20% increase from the early-game average of ~88. Volatility has also increased significantly, with demand ranging from 31 to 184. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals for P37, P38, and P39). To properly parameterize the OR engine for the (L+1) period cycle, I will use recent_N=19 to capture this higher mean and the associated increase in standard deviation. This approach ensures the base stock reflects the current demand environment while providing protection against the observed high-variance spikes (e.g., P41 demand of 184).

Daily Reward (R_t): $985.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a higher baseline starting around Period 25. The current on-hand inventory is 212 units, with 411 units in-transit. Over the last 10 periods (P35-P44), average demand is approximately 90.3 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), the optimal service level is high (95%). Demand has been volatile, with a recent spike of 184 in P41 and a low of 44 in P43. To capture this recent behavior while accounting for the established elevated regime from P25 onwards, I will use recent_N with N=20 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the policy has enough historical breadth to handle the current volatility without overreacting to single-period outliers. The backend will calculate base_stock to cover (L+1) periods, reconciling the 411 units in-transit against the target level.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing chips(Regular). The current on-hand inventory is 147 units with 414 units in transit. Reviewing the history, the lead time has remained stable at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 41-45). Demand remains in the higher regime established around Period 25. Since Period 37, demand has shown significantly higher volatility, with values ranging from 44 to 184 and several spikes above 160. To ensure high service levels while managing inventory, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=20) to capture the higher mean of this current regime (~102 units/period, compared to the early-game ~88). Similarly, for sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=20) to account for the increased standard deviation observed in the last 20 periods. The backend logic will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1), which is appropriate given the 4-period lead time.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues in the elevated regime identified since Period 25. Analyzing the last 20 periods (P27-P46) reveals an average demand of approximately 104 units, with significant volatility (standard deviation ~43). The recent Period 46 demand was high (148). The current status shows 180 units on-hand and 348 in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the target service level is high (~95%). I will use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher demand level and volatility while filtering out older, lower demand data.

=== Period 47 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $2411.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 25 to a higher mean and increased volatility. Since Period 25, the demand has averaged approximately 106 units per period, with a standard deviation significantly higher than the initial phase (approx 44 vs 33). Lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods. In Period 48, we are near the end of the simulation (Period 50). The pipeline inventory (357) plus on-hand (192) is 549, which covers more than 5 periods of average demand (~106 * 5 = 530). However, given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend will favor a high service level. I will use recent_N with N=23 (covering the start of the regime shift at P25 to P47) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current demand distribution and volatility while maintaining the lead time at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1116.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 49. Historically, demand has shifted upwards since Period 25, averaging approximately 107 units per period with significant volatility. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages ~105 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent arrivals (e.g., Period 48 conclude shows Period 44 order arrived with L=4). I have 157 units on hand and 465 in transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current demand regime and its volatility (from P29 to P48), ensuring sufficient base stock to cover demand across the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1511.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 50, and the demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a higher regime since Period 25. Analyzing the most recent 25 periods (since the shift), the mean demand is approximately 104 units per period with a standard deviation of 42.6 units. The lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods throughout the history. The current inventory position is 123 on-hand and 480 in-transit. Since we are at the final period of visibility (Period 50), the OR backend will calculate the final order based on the provided parameters. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=25 to capture the characteristics of this sustained higher-demand regime while filtering out the lower demand from the first half of the game. I will keep L at 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is verified by all arrival history.
