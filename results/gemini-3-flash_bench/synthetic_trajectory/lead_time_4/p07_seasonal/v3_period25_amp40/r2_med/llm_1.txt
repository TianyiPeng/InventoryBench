The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 will arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and be visible/usable for Period 6's decision. Thus, the current order plus existing inventory must cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, I need to order enough to cover approximately 5 periods of demand. 158 units/period * 5 periods = 790 units. I will order 800 units to establish a baseline stock while accounting for variability observed in the history (e.g., the spike to 211).",

The current inventory status shows 440 units on-hand and 260 units in-transit (scheduled arrivals of 130 in P45 and 130 in P46). The game is approaching its conclusion at Period 50. Given the lead time of 4 periods, an order placed now in P45 would arrive in P49, just before the final period. With 700 total units currently in the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) and only 6 periods remaining (P45-P50), the total expected demand for the rest of the game is approximately 402 units (based on the current average of 67/period). Therefore, the current inventory and impending arrivals are more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand until P50. Adding more inventory would only increase holding costs without contributing to additional sales. Consequently, no new order is placed.",

Given the game ends at Period 50, and there are only 5 periods remaining (P46-P50), the total expected demand for the rest of the game is approximately 300 units (assuming ~60/period). With 533 units on-hand and an additional 130 units in-transit (ordered in P42, arriving in P46), the total pipeline of 663 units is far more than enough to cover all remaining demand. Ordering more would only incur additional holding costs of $1.0/unit/period without any potential for additional sales profit.

With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now in Period 47 would only arrive during Period 51, which is outside the simulation's timeframe.

The game ends at the conclusion of Period 50. Inventory on-hand at the start of Period 48 is 502 units. Current demand is in a lower regime, with the most recent 5-period average (P43-P47) being approximately 63 units/period (63, 55, 37, 78, 83). Lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in the arrival resolution phase of Period 52. Since the game ends after Period 50, any order placed now will never arrive to satisfy demand. Furthermore, the existing on-hand inventory of 502 units is vastly more than enough to cover the remaining demand for Period 48, 49, and 50 (estimated at ~60-80 units per period, total ~180-240 units). Because holding costs are charged on ending inventory each period, ordering more would only decrease the total reward without providing any benefit for sales. Therefore, the optimal action is to order 0 units and bleed off the excess inventory.",

Currently, there are 459 units on-hand. Historical demand in the most recent periods has been low (P47: 83, P48: 43). Even if we assume a high-end demand of ~100 units/period for the remaining two periods (P49 and P50), the total demand would be ~200 units, leaving over 250 units in ending inventory.

Given that the current on-hand inventory is 354 units and recent demand has stabilized between 60-100 units per period (the most recent Period 49 demand was 105), we have more than enough stock to cover the final period's demand. Placing any additional order would not result in any additional sales within the game's timeframe but would potentially incur inventory charges if the system were to continue.
