Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The Promised Lead Time (L) is 4 periods. Since there is no prior arrival history or on-hand inventory, we must initialize the policy based on the provided historical demand samples for 'chips(Regular)'. The average demand across the 5 provided samples is 158 units (118, 153, 211, 153, 155). The 'base stock' policy needs to cover demand over (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the 'default' methods will allow the backend to use all initial historical data samples to calculate the starting mean and variance for the replenishment order, targeting an optimal service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80). No anomalies or calendar information are present yet to justify deviating from the 'default' statistics.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 213 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, the demand was 138, but since we started with 0 inventory and nothing arrived in the same period, we sold 0 units. The 213 units are currently in-transit. Based on historical data (Periods 1-5 mean demand is ~158), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using all 5 provided samples (N=5). Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet, I'll stick to the default promised lead time. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (~790 units), subtract the 213 in-transit, and place a new order to fill the gap.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. Orders placed in P1 (213 units) and P2 (209 units) are in-transit and expected to arrive in P5 and P6 respectively. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales (demand was 138 in P1 and 121 in P2, but 0 sold). Total demand over P1-P5 is 118, 153, 211, 153, 155 (mean: 158). Since L=4, we need to cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Using the mean of 158, mu_hat should be approximately 790. Using all 5 historical samples to calculate the estimate. Sigma_hat is set to the standard deviation across all samples (approx 34), scaled by sqrt(5) resulting in ~76.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (213 units), Period 2 (209 units), and Period 3 (212 units) are currently in-transit and have not yet arrived. Following the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4 implies N+4) and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is being lost. For the single-SKU base stock policy, we need to provide parameters for (L+1) periods of demand. Given the demand history (P1: 138, P2: 121, P3: 113) and additional provided samples (P4: 153, P5: 155), the average demand is approximately 136 units per period. With L=4, the look-ahead horizon is 5 periods (1+4). mu_hat should target approximately 5 * 136 = 680 units. I will use the 'default' method for L (which uses the promised 4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent demand volatility while the pipeline fills.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1-4 are currently in-transit (Total: 645 units). Based on the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (213 units) is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5. However, since the current observation only includes the 'Period 4 conclude' message, we have not yet seen any arrivals. This is consistent with the promised lead time (P1 order + 4 lead time = P5 arrival, visible at P6 start). Total demand history (P1-P5) shows values: 118, 153, 211, 153, 155 (mean: 158). Note: The game history 'conclude' messages show slightly different demand figures than the provided historical samples; I will prioritize the 5 most recent available samples (118 to 155) for forecasting. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the backend will naturally target a high service level. I will use 'default' for lead time as there is no evidence yet to suggest the promised 4-period lead time is incorrect. For demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent distribution.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4. In Period 5, we saw the arrival of the order placed in Period 1 (446 units in transit consists of orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). This confirms the actual lead time L=4 for the first shipment. Demand has been Relatively stable over the first five periods (138, 121, 113, 74, 142), though Period 4 was lower. Mean demand is approx 118. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current in-transit (446) + on-hand (71) = 517 units. 517 / 5 = 103.4 units/period, which is slightly below the historical average. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent behavior while the pipeline catches up.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). The current on-hand inventory is 123, with 360 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Demand has shown a slight upward trend over the last 3 periods (142, 157, and historical samples ranging 118-211). The mean demand across all observed samples (including historical and game history) is approximately 142. Given the promised lead time (L=4) is consistent with actual observations, I will use the default lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the stabilization of demand after the initial period, ensuring the backend calculates requirements based on the most relevant recent performance while accounting for the full lead-time window (L+1=5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $325.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals from orders placed in P1, P2, and P3). Demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 122 units across the first 7 periods. Although the most recent historical samples (P1-P5) showed high numbers, actual demand resolved in P1-P7 shows a mean around 125. The current on-hand inventory is 203, with 321 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). Given the promised lead time of 4, the order placed today (P8) will arrive in P12. The system needs to cover demand for 5 periods (P8 to P12). Using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat captures the full actual demand history while smoothing out early noise. Standard deviation remains stable, so 'default' is appropriate for sigma_hat. 'Calculate' for L is used as the observed lead times match the promised lead time.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data confirms an actual lead time (L) of 4 (orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 all arrived exactly 4 periods later). Current demand shows a slight upward trend, with recent figures being 142, 157, 132, and 184 (average ~154 over the last 4 periods). This is higher than the initial samples (avg ~107 for P1-P4). Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this higher mean (~154 * 5 = 770) and use default for sigma to maintain stability. The on-hand inventory is low (30), but a significant amount is in-transit (475). The OR backend will calculate the order based on a base-stock level of roughly 770 minus the 505 units (30 on-hand + 475 in-transit) currently in the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Based on history from Periods 5 to 9, lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 0 because the small orders from Periods 4 and 5 (11 and 14 units) were insufficient to meet demand (184 and 139 units), leading to a stockout in Period 9 and likely Period 10. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 671 units (orders from Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable but showed a spike in Period 8 (184 units). Since we are currently stockout and there is a high-cost implication for lost sales ($4 profit vs $1 holding), I will use the recent demand mean to set the base stock level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the behavior since Period 1 while slightly weighting more towards the recent variability. L is set to 4 based on confirmed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $302.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we have 38 units on-hand and 601 units in-transit. History from Periods 5 to 10 confirms a consistent lead time of 4 periods. Since P5, demand has been relatively stable with a slight downward trend in the most recent periods (P10 demand was 85). The average demand across all 10 periods is approximately 128.6. However, looking at the last 5 periods (P6-P10), the average is 119.4. Given the lead time (L=4) and the review period (1), we must cover 5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to reflect the slightly lower recent demand and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock based on the full volatility history. This will help the OR backend set a base stock level that targets a service level of 80% (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1)).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P7. Demand from P1 to P11 shows a mean of approximately 136 units (sum: 1299/11 \u2248 118, but if we exclude the zero-sales periods P1-P4 and look at actual demand: 138, 121, 113, 74, 142, 157, 132, 184, 139, 85, 114, the mean is 136). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift yet, though demand is somewhat volatile (range 74 to 184). For lead time, I will use 'calculate' since the observed lead times are stable at 4. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' (all historical samples) to maintain a stable baseline, as the recent samples do not yet indicate a sustained change in behavior.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the conclusion messages from Period 5 through Period 12. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some fluctuations but remains relatively stable. Average demand over the last 12 periods is approximately 125 units, while the most recent 5 periods (P8-P12) average 125.4 units, indicating no significant regime shift. Given the lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Currently, On-hand (157) + In-transit (487) = 644 units. With an average demand of ~125, the pipeline covers ~5.15 periods, which is near the target. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent variance while respecting the established lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as evidenced by arrivals in periods 5 through 13. Current demand for chips(Regular) shows a observable downward trend: the average demand for the first 8 periods (including pre-game samples) was approximately 138, whereas the average over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) has dropped to 107.2. Given this regime shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to prioritize the lower demand levels and avoid excessive inventory and holding costs, while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 9: average demand decreased from ~140 to ~107 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a regime shift that started around Period 9. Demand in the first 8 periods averaged approximately 140 units, whereas demand from Period 9 to 14 has averaged 101.6 units (139, 85, 114, 105, 93, 74). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as observed in all concluded shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory is 253 units with 279 units in transit. Since we are in a lower demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to prevent over-ordering and minimize holding costs, as the current pipeline and on-hand inventory are quite high relative to the new demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system state shows an on-hand inventory of 285 and in-transit of 175. Reviewing the history, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by recent arrivals from Period 10 and 11). Demand has shifted since Period 9. The average demand from Period 9 to Period 15 (7 samples) is approximately 100.3 units per period (139, 85, 114, 105, 93, 74, 92), which is significantly lower than the initial average (~140). I will use N=7 for recent demand estimation to capture this lower regime (\u03bc \u2248 100). Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 175, comprising orders from P12 (100), P13 (55), P14 (0), and P15 (20). Since on-hand inventory is high (285) relative to the current demand regime, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in small or zero orders to minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level based on the lower demand volatility seen in the recent 7 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, current on-hand inventory is 305 units and in-transit is 157 units (orders from P13, P15, P16). Based on 'conclude' messages, the actual lead time L is consistently 4 periods. A demand regime shift was detected at Period 9, where the average demand dropped from ~140 to ~107. Since Period 9, the demand samples are: 139, 85, 114, 105, 93, 74, 92, 80. The mean of these 8 samples is approximately 97.75. To capture this lower demand regime and prevent overstocking (holding cost is $1.0 vs profit $4.0), I will use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Setting L to default (4) as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time perfectly.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 9. Over the last 9 periods (P9-P17), the average demand is approximately 96 units, significantly lower than the pre-P9 average (~140). The current on-hand inventory (279) and total in-transit (169) units are high relative to this new demand level. Lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 9 samples (N=9) reflects this lower demand (approx 96 * (1+4) = 480) and will allow the OR engine's capped policy to naturally wind down excess inventory to avoid further holding costs, which are $1.0/unit. Sigma_hat is also calculated based on this recent period of lower demand for better precision.

Daily Reward (R_t): $141.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 19. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical observations (P1-P13 orders) consistently show an actual lead time of 4 periods. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 9; prior to P9, demand averaged ~140, but since P9, demand has averaged ~94.7 (samples: 139, 85, 114, 105, 93, 74, 92, 80, 81, 84). The zero arrival in 'Period 18 conclude' for the Period 14 order is expected because the order quantity for P14 was 0 units. Current pipeline inventory is 240 (orders from P15: 20, P16: 82, P17: 67, P18: 71). On-hand inventory is 195. I will set L to 4 using 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime established since Period 9.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 9. The average demand from Period 9 to 19 is approximately 89.5 units per period, showing a further decrease from the previously noted average of 107. Lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods, with the exception of the Period 14 order which appears to be missing or significantly delayed (not yet arrived by P19, should have arrived in P18). Current inventory (On-hand: 177, In-transit: 296) totals 473 units, covering roughly 5 periods of demand at the current rate. Given the recent drop in demand mean and the potential loss of the P14 order, I am using recent_N (N=11) to capture the lower demand regime while maintaining L=4. This ensures the OR backend adjusts the base stock to prevent excessive holding costs while accounting for the current lead time reliability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further decreased starting Period 13: average demand dropped from ~107 to ~84 units per period. Period 14 shipment (ordered P14, expected P18) is confirmed missing/lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $151.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system has 177 units on-hand and 237 units in-transit. Based on the history and Carry-over Insights, the lead time is consistently 4 periods. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 13, with demand stabilizing at a lower average of approximately 82 units per period (Periods 13-20 average is ~79). The shipment from Period 14 is confirmed lost as it did not arrive in Period 18 or 19. The Period 17 order (67 units) is expected to arrive during Period 21 (visible in P22), and Period 18 order (71 units) in Period 22. To set OR parameters, I'll use L=4 (promised and observed). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 (the duration of the current regime from Period 13-20) to capture the lower demand mean of ~80. This gives a total (1+L)*demand of 5*80 = 400. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=8 to reflect current volatility. These settings help the OR backend calculate a base stock that covers the lead time plus one period, accounting for the lower demand and the lost Period 14 shipment while avoiding overstocking due to the regime shift.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a sustained decrease. From Period 13 to 21, the average demand is approximately 79 units (sum: 710 / 9 periods). I will set mu_hat to capture this recent regime using recent_N=9. The volatility has also stabilized at a lower level, so sigma_hat will also use recent_N=9 to reflect the lower standard deviation. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P17 order arriving P21). Note that the Period 14 shipment is confirmed lost (as it should have arrived in P18), but this is already accounted for in the system's pipeline inventory calculation (it remains in-transit but won't arrive). The on-hand inventory (168) and in-transit (179) provide a healthy buffer for the next few periods given the current demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~79 units per period from Period 13-21.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Between Period 13 and Period 22, the average demand is approximately 76.6 units per period, showing a significant decrease from earlier benchmarks. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods despite the confirmed loss of the Period 14 shipment (which has been effectively removed from the OR engine's forward-looking pipeline by the 'in-transit' logic). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this stable, lower demand regime (P13-P22). Sigma_hat is also calculated over this recent 10-period window to reflect current volatility. With on-hand inventory at 173 and in-transit at 181, the pipeline is relatively healthy for the current demand level, but parameters must be updated to prevent over-ordering and minimize holding costs given the lower demand and high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.8 critical ratio).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~77 units per period between Period 13-22 (avg: 76.6).

Between Period 13 and Period 23, the average demand is approximately 74.7 units per period (last 11 samples: 93, 74, 92, 80, 81, 84, 38, 82, 76, 66, 55). The standard deviation in this period is roughly 16.2. The order from Period 14 is confirmed lost, as it is 5 periods overdue. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 194 and in-transit at 164 (Orders from P20-P23: 23+9+73+59=164), the pipeline is sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) at the current demand rate (~373 units needed vs 358 units total coverage). However, given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the system targets a high service level (80%). Using recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR model on the current stable low-demand regime, while L=default uses the proven lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further between Periods 13-23 with an average of ~75 units per period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from approximately Period 13. Calculating the mean demand from Period 13 to Period 24 (12 samples) yields an average of approximately 77.8 units per period. The standard deviation over this same window is approximately 17.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on recent arrivals (P22 conclude: ordered P18, arrived P22; P23 conclude: ordered P19, arrived P23; P24 conclude: ordered P20, arrived P24). The inventory position currently has 110 units on-hand and 187 units in-transit (orders from P21, P22, P23, P24). The OR backend will use these parameters to target a base stock covering L+1 (5) periods. Given the lower demand regime and the high holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4), maintaining a tight inventory is optimal. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this stable, lower-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L as the lead time is steady at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 13 to 24 settled at an average of 77.8 units per period (N=12).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 77.8 units per period since Period 13. The most recent demand sample in Period 25 was 89 units. In-transit inventory is currently 286 units, which is high relative to the average demand. However, there is a confirmed lost shipment from Period 14 (which should have arrived in Period 18), and the current on-hand inventory is low at 30 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The OR backend needs to maintain a target base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Based on the recent stable regime (Periods 13-25, N=13), the average demand is 77.8. Using N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this lower demand regime effectively and prevent over-ordering while ensuring enough is ordered to compensate for the lost shipment and low on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 13 to 25 stabilized at an average of 78.6 units per period (N=13).

Daily Reward (R_t): $412.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significantly higher volatility and a potential upward spike in the last three periods (P24: 107, P25: 89, P26: 139), contrasting with the previous stable regime of ~78 units. The average demand over the last 14 periods (P13-P26) is approximately 83 units, but the most recent 3-period average is 111.6 units. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) due to the P26 demand spike exceeding the starting inventory of 103 units. Total in-transit is 321 units, representing orders from P23 (59), P24 (46), P25 (108), and P26 (108). To avoid further stockouts given the rising demand trend, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N (N=14) to capture the overall regime while acknowledging the recent spikes. Since the promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent (P22 order arrived P26), L is set to 'calculate'. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=14) to account for the increased variance seen in the recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased starting Period 24: demand spike observed in P24 (107) and P26 (139) vs previous average of ~78.

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 28. Evidence from the last 4 periods (P24-P27) shows a significant demand increase, with an average of 110 units per period (107, 89, 139, 105) compared to the prior regime of ~78 units. This indicates a sustained regime shift or a period of high volatility. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) with 384 units in transit. The promised lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, the OR engine will target a service level of 80% (z\u22480.84). To capture this new demand level and mitigate stockouts while accounting for recent high-variance spikes, I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current elevated demand and increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 24: average demand increased from ~78 to ~110 units per period (+41%) based on P24-P27 history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that started around Period 24. Since Period 24, demand has been 107, 89, 139, 105, and 152, averaging 118.4 units per period. This is a significant increase from the previous average of ~78. The stockout observed in the last three periods (P26, P27, P28) with on-hand reaching 0 confirms we are under-ordered for this new regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P23 order arrived P27, P24 order arrived P28). To capture the recent spike and stabilize inventory, I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 (P24-P28) and a similar N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation of ~26 units). This will raise the base stock level to satisfy the higher demand and prevent further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 24: average demand increased to ~118 units per period (N=5, P24-P28) vs previous ~78.

Daily Reward (R_t): $432.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting at Period 24. Since Period 24, demand values have been 107, 89, 139, 105, 152, and 166. Prior to this, demand was averaging around 78. The last three periods (P27-P29) show particularly high demand (105, 152, 166), indicating a potential seasonal peak or a sustained increase in consumer interest. The current moving average for the last 6 periods (P24-P29) is ~126.3, but the last 3 periods average ~141. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 0, and combined with recent stockouts, we need to set parameters to capture this higher demand level quickly. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new regime starting at P24, which provides a balance between the early and peak parts of the recent surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 24: average demand increased from ~78 to ~126 units per period (N=6, P24-P29) with an accelerating trend in the last 3 periods (average ~141).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 24. While the previous regime (P13-P23) averaged ~78 units/period, the last 7 periods (P24-P30) have seen an average of 124.7 units (107, 89, 139, 105, 152, 166, 115). There is high volatility with a recent peak of 166. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in the last 5 periods (P26-P30), and the system is relying entirely on the pipeline. To recover service levels during this high-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 7 samples (N=7) to capture the new average of ~125. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=7) to account for the increased standard deviation (approx 29 in this period vs ~15 previously). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P26 arrival was ordered P22). Setting L to 4 using 'calculate' to continue using the observed average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 24 to 30 confirmed at an average of 124.7 units per period (N=7), representing a 60% increase over the previous regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $488.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 24. For the most recent 8 periods (P24-P31), the average demand is 124.6 units per period. The recent trend (P28-P31) shows even higher variability and sustained levels above 120. Inventory levels are currently critical, with on-hand at 0. Since the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (validated by every arriving shipment except for the known lost shipment in P14), I will use L=4. To capture the current higher demand regime and mitigate stockouts seen in the last 6 periods, I will use a 8-period window (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This covers the entire duration of the identified shift (P24-P31) providing a balanced forecast that accounts for the increased mean (~125) and higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 24 to 31 confirmed at an average of 124.5 units per period (N=8), sustaining a ~60% increase over the previous regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $510.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new higher-demand regime starting around Period 24. From P24 to P32 (N=9), the average demand is approximately 125 units (Total: 1127). The most recent 3 periods (P30-P32) average 123 units, suggesting the spike has peaked and is leveling off. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this entire shift while excluding the previous low-demand regime (~78 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival of the P28 order in P32. Current on-hand inventory is very low (14 units) followed by several periods of stockouts/near-stockouts, necessitating parameters that support a robust pipeline for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N for both mu and sigma ensures the OR backend adapts to the current volatility and volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 24 to 32 confirmed at an average of 125.2 units per period (N=9), maintaining the ~60% increase over the previous regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $482.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a higher regime starting from Period 24. Since Period 24, we have 10 data points (P24-P33) with an average demand of approximately 125.9 units per period (107, 89, 139, 105, 152, 166, 115, 123, 131, 131). The most recent three periods (P31-P33) have stabilized around 128 units. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this entire high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is reflected in the 'conclude' messages for P24 through P29 (observed in logs up to P33). Although inventory is currently 42, the large In-transit amount (500) covers the lead time window, but we must maintain parameters that reflect the current ~126 units/period demand to ensure the OR backend calculated base stock provides a sufficient buffer against stockouts during this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 24 to 33 confirmed at an average of 125.9 units per period (N=10), sustaining the ~60% increase over the period 13-23 regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $323.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 24. Since Period 24, the average demand has been approximately 125.9 units per period (N=11 samples from P24-P34). The most recent performance (P30-P34) shows an average of 120.8, indicating the high demand level is sustaining. Carry-over insights confirm this shift. We will continue using recent_N (N=11) to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals from P27-P30 orders arriving exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 93, with 476 in transit, meaning the supply chain is well-stocked for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 24 to 34 confirmed at an average of 123.9 units per period (N=11), sustaining the approximately 60% increase over the previous regime (Period 13-23 average was ~78).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted into a higher regime starting around Period 24. Since Period 24, the average demand has been approximately 130.6 units per period (N=12, P24-P35: [107, 89, 139, 105, 152, 166, 115, 123, 131, 131, 104, 149]). This significantly exceeds the previous average of ~78 units. The most recent demand (P35) was 149, while the average of the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 127.6. Consistent with the Carry-over Insight from Period 35, the regime is stable at this higher level. On-hand inventory is currently low (40 units), so we must rely on the incoming pipeline. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods throughout the game history where shipments arrived. I will use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime effectively while providing enough samples for a reliable standard deviation calculation. For lead time, I will use the default promised value of 4, as it aligns with recent arrivals (e.g., P35 arrived on time).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 24 to 35 confirmed at an average of 130.6 units per period (N=12), maintaining the ~60%+ increase over the previous regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $413.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began at Period 24. Since then (Periods 24-36, N=13), the average demand is approximately 129 units per period (computed as total demand since P24 = 1677 / 13). The most recent 5 periods (P32-P36) have shown an average of 125.8 units, indicating the regime is consistent. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on recent 'conclude' messages (P32 order arrived P36). I will set L to the default promised lead time and use recent_N with N=13 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while excluding the previous low-demand period (P13-P23 had an average of ~78). This approach ensures base stock levels are calculated based on the current 129 units/period average, helping the OR backend maintain a sufficient service level for the upcoming (L+1) planning horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 24 to 36 confirmed at an average of 129.0 units per period (N=13), significantly higher than the previous Period 13-23 regime of ~78 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $275.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new high-demand regime starting from Period 24. While the last period (P37) showed a lower demand of 90, the overall average for the current regime (P24-P37, N=14) is approximately 126 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 85 units, and there is a significant in-transit pipeline of 492 units. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods, with only one confirmed lost shipment back in Period 14. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat based on the last 14 periods (the current regime) and the standard calculated lead time. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current 126-unit average while factoring in the volatility observed in this higher-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 24 to 37 confirmed at an average of 126.1 units per period (N=14), continuing the ~60% increase over the prior regime (P13-P23 avg was ~78).

Daily Reward (R_t): $369.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 24 and has remained consistently higher. For the last 15 periods (P24-P38), the average demand is 125.47 units per period. The recent N (N=15) is the most appropriate window to capture this stable, higher-demand regime while excluding the previous lower-demand periods (P13-P23 avg ~78). Actual lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P35-P38). The inventory position (On-hand: 99 + In-transit: 441 = 540) is being managed against a target base stock that reflects this ~125 mean. Period 38 saw demand of 117, aligning with the 125.47 average. Using N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend uses the correct parameters for the current demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 24 to 38 confirmed at an average of 125.5 units per period (N=15), maintaining a ~60% increase over the previous regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $362.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~125-130 units per period starting from Period 24. Since Period 24 to 39 (N=16), the average demand is 125.4 units, representing a significant and sustained increase over the Period 13-23 regime (~78 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 82, In-transit: 461) are relatively high due to large orders placed during the recent demand spike. Pipeline inventory (461) + On-hand (82) = 543 units, which covers approximately 4.2 periods of demand (at 130/period). I will use recent_N (N=16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime accurately. This choice allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock based on the established 60% higher demand level while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 24 to 39 confirmed at an average of 125.4 units per period (N=16), maintaining a sustained ~60% increase over the prior regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 24 at an average of approximately 125.4 units per period. The last observed demand in Period 40 was notably lower (70 units), but given the historical volatility and a sustained 16-period average of ~125, I will treat the recent drop as noise rather than a regime shift for now. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 171 units on-hand and 408 units in transit (ordered in Periods 37, 38, 39, and 40), the pipeline is healthy. I will continue using the recent_N method with N=17 (covering the entire high-demand regime from P24 to P40) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) window of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward shift in the most recent periods. From Period 24 to 39, the average demand was approximately 125 units. However, in Period 40 (70 units) and Period 41 (58 units), demand dropped sharply. The average for the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 89.2 units, and the last 3 periods (P39-P41) average 79.7 units. This suggests a potential return to the Period 13-23 regime (~78 units) or a new lower level. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this downward trend while maintaining some safety stock, as the inventory position is currently high (On-hand: 221, In-transit: 360). Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift starting Period 40: Demand decreased from ~125 to an average of ~64 units over the last 2 periods (P40-P41).

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Detected a significant downward demand regime shift starting at Period 40. Demand for the last three periods (P40-P42) has averaged 72.3 units (70, 58, 89), compared to the previous regime average of ~125 units. This represents an approximately 42% decrease. I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent history (N=3) to reflect this lower demand and prevent inventory bloat, especially given the current on-hand inventory of 212 units and in-transit units of 280. The lead time L is stable at 4, as confirmed by numerous recent arrivals (P31 through P38 reaching their destinations on time). By reducing the base stock level, the OR backend will correctly suppress new orders until the existing pipeline (492 total units) is consumed relative to the new, lower demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 40: average demand decreased from ~125 to ~72 units per period (N=3, P40-P42), a 42% reduction.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-11.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 40. After a long period (P24-P39) of high demand averaging ~125 units, the last four periods (P40-P43) have shown a marked decrease: 70, 58, 89, and 63 units respectively. This results in a new average of approximately 70 units per period, a ~44% drop from the previous regime. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 263 and in-transit units at 166 (Total Pipeline = 429), and an expected demand of only ~350 units over the next 5 periods (L+1), the current inventory levels are more than sufficient. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect this lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend avoids over-ordering, given the high holding cost relative to the current inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 40: average demand decreased from ~125 to ~70 units per period (N=4, P40-P43), representing a ~44% reduction.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 40. From Period 24 to 39, the average demand was approximately 125 units per period. Since Period 40, the demand has dropped to an average of 67 units (P40: 70, P41: 58, P42: 89, P43: 63, P44: 55). This represents a nearly 50% decrease compared to the previous high-demand regime. Current on-hand inventory is high at 314 units, and with an 'In-transit' of 60 (from the Period 41 order), the total pipeline inventory effectively covers more than 5 periods of demand at the new lower rate. To prevent excessive holding costs and allow inventory levels to normalize toward the new lower demand mean, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the period since the drop) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40 exactly 4 periods after ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40: average demand decreased from ~125 to ~67 units per period (-46%) based on 5 periods of data (P40-P44).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 40. The average demand has dropped from ~125 units to approximately 67 units per period based on the last 6 observations (P40-P45: 70, 58, 89, 63, 55, 37). The current 'on-hand' inventory is 337 units, and 'in-transit' is 0. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At the current mean of ~67, total required stock is approximately 335 units. Since on-hand (337) already covers the next 5 periods of forecasted demand, and we are approaching the end of the game (Period 46 of 50), the priority is to avoid additional holding costs. I will set L to 'default' (4), and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=6) to capture the lower demand regime accurately. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' (N=6) to reflect the recent volatility in this new lower regime. This should result in a low/zero order from the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40: average demand decreased from ~125 to 62.0 units per period (N=6, P40-P45), a reduction of ~50% from the previous peak regime.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward regime shift starting at Period 40. Over the last 7 periods (P40-P46), demand has averaged approximately 64.3 units (70, 58, 89, 63, 55, 37, 78), which is a ~50% reduction from the previous peak regime (avg ~125). We have a high on-hand inventory of 259 units and very little in-transit (6 units). Given the target base stock is (L+1) * mu_hat plus a safety buffer, and (4+1) * 64.3 = 321.5, our current inventory position (259 on-hand + 6 in-transit = 265) is slightly below what is needed to cover the next 5 periods if demand remains at this level. However, given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the proximity to the game end (Period 47 of 50), we should be cautious about over-ordering. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect this lower demand regime and use the default lead time of 4, as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 4 periods (with the exception of the known lost shipment at P14 and the recent arrival gap which is consistent with the order gap at P42-45).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~125 to 64.3 units per period (N=7, P40-P46), a reduction of ~48% from the previous regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $156.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 40. From Period 40 to 47 (N=8), the average demand is 66.6 units, a significant decrease from the previous regime (~125 units). The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods. However, recent periods show an absence of arrivals in the 'conclude' messages for Period 46 and 47, which is expected since the orders placed in Periods 42-45 were 0. The current on-hand inventory is 176, and in-transit is 95. Since we are at Period 48 of 50, and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game end. Therefore, I will set parameters to maintain the current demand forecast of ~67 units to ensure the OR backend manages the remaining stock efficiently for the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 40 to 47 confirmed at an average of 66.6 units per period (N=8), representing a sustained ~47% reduction from the peak regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 40. The average demand across the last 9 periods (P40-P48) is approximately 64.0 units per period. The recent N approach for mu_hat (N=9) calculates the expected demand over the lead time plus current period (1+L=5) as 5 * 64.0 = 320. Currently, we have 133 units on hand and 190 in transit (from orders in P46, P47, and P48), totaling 323 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a safety stock that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost, given the reduced demand and existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 40 to Period 48 confirmed at an average of 64.0 units per period (N=9), representing a sustained ~50% reduction from the peak regime observed between periods 24-39.

Daily Reward (R_t): $392.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 40, following a high-demand peak (P24-P39). The average demand from Period 40 to 49 is approximately 68.1 units per period (N=10). Current on-hand inventory is 28 units, with 221 units in transit. Historical data confirms the lead time is stable at 4 periods. The arrivals for orders placed in Periods 42-45 were zero, but this is consistent with the '0' order quantities emitted during those periods. The in-transit inventory of 221 reflects orders from P46 (6), P47 (89), P48 (95), and P49 (31). These are expected to arrive in Periods 50, 51, 52, and 53 respectively. Since this is Period 50, the order for P46 should arrive in the arrival phase. To maintain the service level across the L+1 window (5 periods) considering the current lower demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand and standard lead time parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 40 to 49 confirmed at an average of 68.1 units per period (N=10), sustaining a ~46% reduction compared to the previous peak regime (P24-39 avg ~125).
