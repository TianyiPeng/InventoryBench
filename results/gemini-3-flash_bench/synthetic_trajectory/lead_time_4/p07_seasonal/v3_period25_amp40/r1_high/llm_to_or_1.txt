Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' and historical demand for the first 5 periods (which we can use as a prior) ranges from 118 to 211, with an average of 158. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My strategy is to set a baseline demand forecast using all 5 available historical samples to establish a stable starting point (mu_hat calculation: (1+L) * 158 = 5 * 158 = 790). Since there is no actual lead time data yet, I will use the promised lead time of 4. This ensures the first order covers the demand for the current period plus the 4-period lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 213 units was placed for 'chips(Regular)'. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect this arrival until Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales in Period 1 (demand was 64, units sold was 0). The historical demand samples provided (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggest a mean demand of approximately 158 units per period. However, Period 1's actual demand was lower at 64. Given we are only at Period 2 and the sample size is small, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (counting the 5 historical samples provided in the prompt + the new observation from Period 1) to stabilize the forecast against the lower Period 1 observation while acknowledging the higher historical average. L is set to 'default' (4), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to capture the volatility of the provided samples.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. In the first two periods, we had 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales as demand was 64 (P1) and 87 (P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (213 units) are expected to arrive in Period 5 (L=4), and Period 2 orders (234 units) in Period 6. The current in-transit total of 447 accurately reflects these two orders. Since no orders have arrived yet, we cannot infer a deviation from the promised lead time. Historical demand samples (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggest a mean of approximately 158. However, actual demand in the game history (64, 87) is significantly lower than the provided pre-game samples. Since we have very few game samples (2), I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand with N=5 (incorporating 3 pre-game samples + 2 game samples) to balance the high pre-game expectation with the lower observed reality. L is set to 'default' (4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (totaling 678 units) are currently in-transit and none have concluded yet. Based on the lead time definition (Lead Time 4 means an order placed in Period 1 arrives in Period 5), we expect the first arrival in Period 5. Historical demand for periods 1-3 was 64, 87, and 134, while the provided external sample data for periods 1-5 suggests a mean demand of approximately 158 units. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced significant lost sales (sold=0), we need to ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5). I will use the recent_N method for demand (N=5) to capture the upward trend seen in both the game history and the historical samples provided, and default lead time as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory and 0 sales for the first 4 periods as no shipments have arrived yet. In-transit inventory is 761 units (sum of orders from P1-P4: 213+234+231+83). Demand samples for P1-P5 are [118, 153, 211, 153, 155], with the P5 demand occurring after the current decision. The mean demand is approximately 158. The OR engine needs to cover demand for (L+1) periods. Since we have not yet observed any 'conclude' messages for arrivals, we stick to the default promised lead time of 4. We use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the available demand history which shows a slight increase from P1-P3 followed by stabilization. This will help the back-end set a base stock level that targets a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, the first order (placed Period 1) arrived at the start of Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. The demand for the last five periods has been [64, 87, 134, 127, 134], showing an upward trend compared to the initial seed data. Specifically, the mean of the last 3 periods is 131.67, significantly higher than the initial samples. Since we have orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4 (totaling 548 units) in transit and scheduled to arrive in Periods 6, 7, and 8, the system already has a significant pipeline. To account for the observed demand shift while maintaining the promised lead time, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the higher recent volume, and 'default' for L.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2187.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the actual lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in P5, Period 2 order arrived in P6), which matches the promised lead time. The demand statistics are stabilized: P1-P6 demand values are [64, 87, 134, 127, 134, 125]. The first two periods appear to be a ramp-up phase, while P3-P6 show a stable regime with a mean around 130 units. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stable regime (Avg ~130, Std ~4). On-hand inventory is 188 and In-transit is 351 (orders from Periods 3, 4, and 6). Since L=4, the base stock should cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. 5 * 130 = 650. Total pipeline (188 + 351) = 539. The OR engine will likely order another ~111 units depending on the safety stock calculation. The parameters are set to maintain high service levels given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P5 and P6 arrivals). Demand regime stabilized from Period 3 onwards at approximately 130 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2541.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing chips(Regular). The promised lead time is 4, and historical data from Periods 5, 6, and 7 confirms that the actual lead time is indeed 4 periods. The demand appears to have stabilized after an initial ramp-up; the last 5 periods (Periods 3-7) show demand values of 134, 127, 134, 125, and 148, averaging 133.6 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 271, with 249 units in-transit (orders from Period 4, 6, and 7). To calculate mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this stable regime (Avg ~134). For sigma_hat, N=5 provides a representative volatility estimate for this period. Since the lead time is stable at the promised value, I will use the default method for L.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2166.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8 (all ordered 4 periods prior). The demand has stabilized since Period 3. Average demand over the last 6 periods (P3-P8) is approximately 132.3 units. Using L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 315 units and on-hand is 228 units, totaling 543 units. With an expected demand of ~132/period, 5 periods of demand equals 660 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable regime, and 'default' for L since the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1592.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). The zero arrival in Period 9 is expected since no order was placed in Period 5. Demand has stabilized: the mean demand from Period 3 through Period 9 (7 samples) is approximately 126.1 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 137, with 462 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Using L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stable regime while ignoring the initial ramp-up in Periods 1-2. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current ~126 demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: stable at mean ~126 units/period since Period 3. Lead time stable at 4 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are managing chips(Regular). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10 concludes) confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. The arrivals for the orders placed in Period 5 (0 units), Period 7 (129 units), Period 8 (149 units), and Period 9 (147 units) are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Periods 9 (already passed), 11, 12, and 13 respectively. Note: Period 5 order was 0 units, which explains the zero arrival in Period 9. The demand from Period 3 through Period 10 has stabilized. Mean demand since Period 3 is approximately 125.25 units/period (sum: 134+127+134+125+148+126+91+117 = 1002 / 8). Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat captures this stable regime. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation of these 8 samples is approximately 16.9. I will use recent_N=8 to allow the backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock. On-hand is low (57), but the pipeline (523) is substantial based on recent orders.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

The actual lead time L is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory reconciliation: we have 63 units on-hand and 502 units in-transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). Note that Period 5 was an empty order (0 units). The order placed in Period 8 (149 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 12 and will be visible at the start of Period 13. Given the current on-hand inventory (63) and expected demand for the current period (~125), we are likely to face a small stockout this period before the P8 shipment arrives. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the stable demand regime since Period 3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'default' for L as it is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand in Period 12 dropped significantly to 41 units, compared to the stable mean of ~126 observed previously. However, this is only a single data point and could be noise or a temporary fluctuation. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The pipeline is currently full with 470 units in transit following orders in periods 9 through 12. To avoid overreacting to the single low demand point while acknowledging the recent stabilization, I will use recent_N for demand forecasting (N=10, covering Period 3 to 12) to capture the stable regime while including the recent dip. For lead time, I'll continue with the 'calculate' method as it has been very stable at 4 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU shows a consistently stable demand profile and reliable lead time. Historical demand since Period 3 has averaged approximately 124 units (with Period 12 being a curious low outlier at 41). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on clinical arrivals in periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 199 units and 377 units in transit (orders from P10-P13). At the start of P14, the order from P10 (98 units) is expected to arrive during the period (4-period lead time), which will boost on-hand inventory before demand hits. Given the stability, I will use a window of the last 11 periods (P3-P13) to capture the stable demand regime while ignoring the initial startup volatility. The lead time L is set to the promised 4 periods. mu_hat will be calculated using recent_N (N=11) to represent (1+L) periods of demand, and sigma_hat will similarly use N=11 to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1503.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a recurring pattern where demand periodically dips (Period 9: 91, Period 12: 41, Period 14: 90) compared to the established mean of approximately 126. Between Period 3 and Period 14, the average demand is roughly 113. However, excluding the outlier in Period 12 (41), the average is closer to 120. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 5 through 8 and 10 through 14. I will set L to 'default' (promised lead time 4). For mu_hat, I will use a recent_N of 12 (covering Periods 3-14) to capture the current demand regime which is slightly lower than the initial forecast. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N of 12 to reflect the recent volatility which includes these intermittent drops in demand. This configuration allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the lead time (L) plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by several recent deliveries. Demand has shown a slight downward trend and higher variance in the most recent periods (Periods 12-15: 41, 119, 90, 87). The mean demand since Period 3 is approximately 116 units, but the mean of the last 7 periods (Periods 9-15) is approximately 95 units, suggesting a potential softening of the market. To avoid overstocking and excessive holding costs, I will use a recent window (N=13) for demand estimation, which captures the stable regime since Period 3 while allowing the more recent lower values to weigh in. Lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised and observed 4 periods. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 13 periods (from Period 3 onwards) to define the current stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: mean demand decreased to ~95 units over Periods 9-15 compared to ~126 previously.

Daily Reward (R_t): $935.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17. Looking at the history, the lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. Regarding demand, we are observing a sustained decrease. As noted in the Carry-over Insight from Period 16, the demand mean shifted around Period 9. The most recent demand samples are: P12: 41, P13: 119, P14: 90, P15: 87, P16: 64. The mean of the last 7 samples (P10-P16) is approximately 91.6, and the mean of the last 4 samples (P13-P16) is 90.0, both of which are significantly lower than the ~126 seen earlier. Given this softening, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and volatility regime while maintaining enough data points (since Period 10). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening confirmed: mean demand since Period 10 is approximately 92 units/period, down from the previous average of ~126.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1945.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 12, sales have fluctuated, with a recent 6-period mean of approximately 85.8 units (Periods 12-17: 41, 119, 90, 87, 64, 114). The promised lead time L=4 remains consistent with historical performance (last seen in Period 17). On-hand inventory is 221 units, and in-transit inventory is 268 units, totaling 489 units. Given the target base stock aims to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, current levels (489 units) are well above the expected demand (5 * ~86 = 430). Therefore, the OR backend likely won't place a large order, which is correct given the high holding cost risk. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime accurately while keeping lead time as 'default' (4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $865.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a confirmed downward shift. Since Period 12, demand has averaged 82.1 units/period (P12: 41, P13: 119, P14: 90, P15: 87, P16: 64, P17: 114, P18: 60). This is a significant decrease from the earlier regime of ~126 units. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs, I am shifting the forecast to reflect this recent lower-demand period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (275) plus in-transit (204) is high relative to the recent demand mean (~82), so OR backend parameters need to target the lower demand level to avoid excessive safety stock.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 19: Mean demand has decreased to ~82 units/period (based on Periods 12-18) from previous levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $787.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear downward trend, stabilizing at a lower regime. Since Period 12, demand has averaged approximately 78 units per period (Periods 12-19: 41, 119, 90, 87, 64, 114, 60, 57). The last 4 periods average even lower at 72.75 units. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this lower volume accurately while allowing for the observed volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current inventory (on-hand 296 + in-transit 164 = 460) is high relative to the current demand regime (~78 units/period), which covers nearly 6 periods of supply. Setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (average ~78) results in a total demand across L+1 periods of 390 units. Given current total inventory exceeds this, the OR system will naturally order very little or zero, which helps reduce the holding cost of the current excess inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1128.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained downward trend. Comparing the recent demand (Periods 14-20) to earlier periods, the mean demand has dropped significantly. The average demand since Period 12 is approximately 78 units, while the very recent demand (last 3 periods) is around 64 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations. On-hand inventory (297) plus in-transit stock (127) totals 424 units. With (L+1)=5 periods of demand at a rate of ~78, we need approximately 390 units. Current inventory levels are sufficient, and the OR backend's inventory cap should prevent excessive over-ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the behavior since the confirmed shift around Period 12 while maintaining enough samples for variance calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Average demand from Period 12 to 20 is ~78 units/period, a significant drop from the previous regimes (~126 then ~92). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $423.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained decrease. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P12-P21) is approximately 73.5 units, significantly lower than the initial ~126 units and the subsequent ~92 units. The most recent 5 periods (P17-P21) show an even lower average of ~68.4 units. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this lower regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, moving away from the higher historical averages. The on-hand inventory (261) plus in-transit (193) currently totals 454 units, which is quite high relative to recent demand (approx. 6 periods of coverage at current rates). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical arrival data. By using N=10, the OR backend will calculate a base stock target that reflects the lower current demand, likely resulting in smaller or zero orders until the excess inventory is reduced, thereby balancing the high holding cost against the lower risk of stockouts during this low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: Average demand from Period 12 to 21 is ~74 units/period, down from previous regimes. Current inventory level is high relative to this new demand trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $789.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward regime shift. Starting from roughly 130 units in the early periods, it dropped to ~92 and has recently settled into a lower range. Over the last 5 periods (P18-P22), demand has been {60, 57, 75, 36, 55}, averaging 56.6 units per period. The current on-hand inventory of 256 units plus in-transit stock of 165 units (total pipeline of 421) is extremely high compared to this new demand level (covering ~7.4 periods of demand). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and the sustained decline in demand, I am using a recent window (N=11, covering the period from P12 onwards where demand first notably dipped) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will lower the replenishment targets and prevent further excess inventory accumulation, acknowledging that the OR backend will naturally reduce orders as the pipeline exceeds the new base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed and sustained: Average demand from Period 12 to 22 is ~64 units/period (compared to early averages of ~130). Recent 5-period average (P18-P22) has further dropped to ~57 units/period.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward regime shift. The initial demand (Periods 1-11) averaged ~126 units/period, but recently (Periods 12-23) it has dropped to an average of ~74 units/period, and even lower in the last 6 periods (~65 units/period if we include the surprise spike of 107 in Period 23). Period 23 saw a sudden spike to 107 units, which is higher than the recent trend but still below the original regime's mean. I must determine if this is a reversal or an outlier. Given the sustained low trend previously, I will treat it as a high-variance event within a low-demand regime for now. On-hand inventory is 187 and in-transit is 170 (Total 357). With a lead time of 4, the OR engine covers 1+L = 5 periods. With a mean demand near 65-70, 357 units covers over 5 periods of demand. No large order is needed. I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the trend since Period 12, which reflects the lower demand state, ensuring we don't over-order based on the early high-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand spiked to 107 units after 11 periods of sub-90 demand. Monitoring to see if this is a regime reversal or a one-off outlier; recent 12-period average is now ~76 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1934.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, demand remained high at 108 units following the spike to 107 in Period 23. This suggests a potential demand regime shift or a temporary peak, moving away from the previous low-demand regime (~64 units/period). The last 13 periods (P12-P24) averaged ~78 units/period, but the most recent 2 periods average ~107. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 118, with 253 units in-transit (orders from P21, P22, P23, P24). Total pipeline + on-hand is 371 units. Given (L+1) = 5, 371 units covers about 74 units/period, which is slightly low if the 100+ unit demand persists. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the recent two-period uptick using a limited sample size (N=5) to capture the trend while acknowledging the longer-term lower mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: Periods 23 and 24 showed a sustained increase in demand to ~107 units/period, ending the long low-demand regime (P12-P22 avg ~71). Monitoring to confirm if this 100+ level is the new mean.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand pattern for chips(Regular) shows a shift back toward higher levels after a prolonged slump (P12-P22). Periods 23 and 24 saw demands of 107 and 108 respectively. Period 25 dropped back to 59, suggesting high volatility or a stabilizing point between the old low regime (~70) and the mid-game regime (~130). Calculating the average of the last 3 periods (P23-P25) gives ~91 units/period. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this transition. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P18, P19, P20, and P21), so I will use the 'calculate' method to track the 4-period historical average. The current inventory (On-hand: 125 + In-transit: 314 = 439) covers approximately 4.8 periods of demand at the 91 unit/period rate. The OR engine will use these parameters to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: Mean demand for the last 3 periods (P23-P25) is approximately 91 units/period, rising from the previous low-demand regime (P12-P22 avg ~71). Monitoring for stabilization around the 90-100 range.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift away from the low-demand regime (P12-P22 average ~71). Over the last four periods (P23-P26), demand has been 107, 108, 59, and 101, averaging 93.75 units/period. While P25 was lower, the frequency of ~100+ demand returns suggests a mean shift to approximately 90-95 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P22 order arriving in P26). With on-hand inventory at 46 and demand trending higher, I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this new average of ~94 units across the 5-period window (L+1). I am using recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture this transition, and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand since Period 23 has increased to ~94 units/period (P23-P26), up from the previous low-demand regime of ~71.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1691.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upwards significantly starting from Period 23. The mean demand from Period 23 to Period 27 is 97.4 units/period (values: 107, 108, 59, 101, 112). This is a distinct increase from the previous low-demand regime (Periods 12-22 avg ~71). At the start of Period 28, the on-hand inventory is 0 because demand (112) exceeded starting inventory (89) in Period 27, leading to lost sales. There are 483 units in-transit, which are the orders from Periods 24-27 (122, 127, 121, 113). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the stock-out and higher demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current higher demand level (~97 units/period) and maintain a lead time of 4. This will target a pipeline that supports approximately 100 units/period for the (L+1)=5 window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand since Period 23 (P23-P27) is 97.4 units/period, significantly higher than the previous regime (P12-P22 avg ~71).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2018.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly shifted upward starting at Period 23. From Period 23 to Period 28, the demand samples are [107, 108, 59, 101, 112, 107]. This yields an average of approximately 99 units per period, which is a marked increase from the previous low-regime average of ~71. I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and volatility. Lead time is consistently behaving at the promised 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of Period 28, where the order from Period 24 arrived). On-hand inventory is low (15 units) and we recently inventory-stocked out in Period 27, though we recovered in Period 28. Robust parameters are needed to ensure the base stock levels calculated by the OR backend account for this sustained higher demand and the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Mean demand since Period 23 (P23-P28) is ~99 units/period, compared to the previous regime of ~71.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2698.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 23. Average demand from Period 23 to 29 is approximately 105 units/period (107, 108, 59, 101, 112, 107, 142), which is significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime (avg ~71). The stockout in Period 29 (142 demand vs 142 starting on-hand, ending at 0) confirms that the previous estimates were too low for this increased volatility and volume. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there is a high risk of stockouts given the recent demand surge (especially the 142 in Period 29), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this newer, higher demand regime while smoothing the variance. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to reflect the increased volatility seen in this period. Setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Mean demand since Period 23 (P23-P29) is ~105 units/period, with a recent peak of 142 in Period 29.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2299.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly upward since Period 23. Over the last 8 periods (P23-P30), the mean demand is approximately 109 units/period, with a higher peak of 142 in Period 29 and 136 in Period 30. This is a clear departure from the 'low demand' regime (P12-P22) which averaged ~71. The current on-hand inventory is 0, indicating a stockout occurred in Period 30 despite an arrival of 121 units, as demand (136) exceeded supply. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on systematic arrivals from P23-P26 orders arriving in P27-P30. Given the high demand and current zero on-hand status, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (recent_N=8) to capture this higher mean (~109) and the increased volatility of the new regime. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a higher base stock to recover from the stockout and meet the sustained demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Mean demand since Period 23 (P23-P30) is ~109 units/period, showing significant growth from the previous regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2147.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 23. The average demand from Period 23 to Period 31 is approximately 112 units/period (Calculated: (107+108+59+101+112+107+142+136+139)/9 = 112.3). The most recent three periods (P29-P31) have seen demand spikes of 142, 136, and 139 respectively, indicating the regime might be settling closer to 135-140 rather than the earlier mean of 112. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and despite a large in-transit pipeline of 490 units, historical stockouts (ending inventory 0 for the last five periods) suggest we must maintain high parameters to capture this increased demand. Given the promised lead time of 4, we base calculations on the (L+1)=5 period horizon. L remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns. I will use a recent_N of 9 for mu_hat to capture the entirety of the current high-demand regime, and a similar recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Mean demand since Period 23 (P23-P31) is ~112 units/period, with the last three periods (P29-P31) averaging ~139 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1615.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant and sustained upward shift. Since Period 23, the average demand has risen from ~71 to ~112 units/period. More critically, the last four periods (P29-P32) have seen a sharp acceleration with demands of 142, 136, 139, and 189 units. This suggests a new high-growth regime. My on-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), and I have missed some demand in the last six periods. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To navigate this, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent growth while smoothing the outlier jump in Period 32. I'm also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to account for the increased volatility accompanying this higher demand level. The goal is to rebuild on-hand inventory to prevent further lost sales during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Mean demand since Period 29 has jumped further to ~151 units/period (compared to ~112 units/period for P23-P31). Period 32 hit a peak demand of 189 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2052.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime. Since Period 29, demand has been 142, 136, 139, 189, and 163, averaging ~154 units/period. The previous average (P23-P28) was ~108. Total in-transit inventory is 618 units, covering roughly 4 periods of this new demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. However, the system is currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) because arrivals from the lower-demand ordering period (P29 order: 108 units) are insufficient to meet current demand (P33 demand: 163). To adjust the OR backend to this new 'Step' in demand, I am using the most recent 5 samples (P29-P33) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will target a higher base stock level to mitigate the current stockout situation and account for the increased volatility observed in Period 32.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime confirmed since Period 29: average demand increased to ~154 units/period (P29-P33), compared to ~108 units/period in the preceding 6 periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained high-growth regime since Period 29. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P29-P34) is approximately 148.5 units, with significantly higher volatility (peak of 189 in P32). Historical analysis shows a clear shift from the ~110 range (P23-P28) to this new level. The most recent period (P34) saw 122 units, but previous periods have been much higher. To ensure a high service level given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), I will use the last 6 periods (P29-P34) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current elevated demand level and the increased volatility observed in the last 2 weeks. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P34 arrival was ordered P30, lead_time 4).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P29-P34) confirmed: mean demand increased to ~148.5 units/period with higher standard deviation compared to previous regimes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2065.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to fluctuate within its current high-demand regime (starting around Period 29). The mean demand for the last seven periods (P29-P35) is approximately 142 units, despite a slight decrease since the peak in Period 32. This regime is significantly higher than the earlier high of ~112 and the low of ~71. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this current regime (P29-P35) and setting sigma_hat with recent_N=7 to account for the increased volatility observed in this period. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods throughout the history (P35 arrival confirmed order from P31, LT=4), so I will use the default method for L. The inventory position is relatively tight relative to demand, but with a large in-transit volume (656 units), the OR backend's capped policy will prevent over-ordering while trying to meet the target base stock for this (L+1) period horizon.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime remains active since Period 29: average demand for P29-P35 is ~142 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1562.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently, with a significant spike between Periods 29-33 (averaging ~150) followed by a cooling trend in Periods 34-36 (averaging ~108). The inventory position is currently recovering with an on-hand balance of 129 and a large in-transit pipeline of 594 units. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Given the shift from the extreme peak back toward a more moderate but still high-demand regime, I am using a recent_N of 8 periods (covering P29-P36) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the full high-demand pulse and the current softening, providing a balanced forecast of ~134 units per period (multiplied by 1+L). This approach ensures we maintain sufficient stock for the elevated demand level while accounting for the recent deceleration to avoid excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime moderating: The extreme peak (P29-P33 avg ~150) has softened over the last 3 periods (P34-P36 avg ~108). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1905.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has visibly moderated following a significant peak between Periods 29-33 (average ~150). Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has averaged 108.25 units (122, 112, 89, 110), signaling a shift away from the high-growth regime toward a more moderate one. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 185 and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 501 units (covering orders from P34-P37), the system is currently over-indexed for the 150+ units/period regime. To avoid excessive holding costs as demand softens, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window that captures this stabilization. I've selected N=15 for mu_hat to include the transition behavior and a shorter N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of the recent peak and subsequent cooling. This will allow the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level and naturally scale back ordering via the pipeline-inventory-informed policy.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a moderate level: Mean demand for the last four periods (P34-P37) is ~108 units/period, down from the peak regime (P29-P33 avg ~150). Inventory pipeline is currently high (501 units).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has moderated and stabilized following an extreme peak (P29-P33 avg ~150). For the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 104.6 units/period (122, 112, 89, 110, 90), confirming a shift away from the high-growth phase. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages. We are currently in a high inventory position with 286 units on-hand and 332 units in-transit (total pipeline of 618). To align with the current moderated demand of ~105 units/period, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this lower but stable level. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to reflect the current volatility. This approach helps the OR backend recognize that the previous peak has passed, preventing excessive over-ordering while maintaining sufficient safety stock for the current ~105 unit regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~105 units/period (P34-P38) following the high-demand peak of P29-P33 (~150).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1590.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a moderate level after the peak observed between Periods 29-33. The average demand over the last six periods (P34-P39) is approximately 104 units/period (values: 122, 112, 89, 110, 90, 101), which is consistent with the 'moderate level' identified in the carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (329 units) and 188 units are in-transit (orders from P36-P38), totaling 517 units in the pipeline. With a forecast of ~104 units/period and a lead time of 4, the required base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) is approximately 520 units. Since current pipeline inventory (517) nearly matches this requirement and the holding cost is $1.0 vs $19 profit, the OR backend will likely place a small or zero order to prevent excessive inventory. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~104 units/period (P34-P39 average) following the high-demand peak of P29-P33.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a moderate regime following the high-peak observed between Periods 29-33. Over the last seven periods (P34-P40), the average demand is approximately 104.4 units/period, significantly lower than the previous peak of ~150. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on recent arrivals. Currently, there is a high on-hand inventory (315 units) and an in-transit pipeline of 147 units (from orders in P37, P38, P40), totaling 462 units. Given a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At the current mean (~105), required coverage is ~525 units. The current inventory position is slightly below this, but given the carry-over from P39 (where 0 was ordered) and the moderate holding cost compared to profit, I am using recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent stable regime (P34-P40) and allow the OR backend to adjust our order quantities to maintain optimal service levels without excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1172.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units/period after a significant peak (P29-P33) followed by a cooling period. Specifically, the average demand from Period 34 to 41 is 101.1 units. The previous peak average (P29-P33) was ~154, and the current regime is significantly lower. We are currently holding 310 units on-hand with 179 in transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will aim for a high service level. To align with the stabilized demand, I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-peak behavior (P34-P41). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the Period 41 arrival of the Period 37 order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~101 units/period since Period 34 (average for P34-P41 is 101.1), confirming the moderate level follows the P29-P33 peak.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a moderate mean of approximately 101 units per period since Period 34, following a high-demand peak (P29-P33). The standard deviation during this period (P34-P42) is approximately 13.9. With a profit of $19.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is high (q \u2248 0.95), suggesting a base stock level that covers roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1, where L=4). Current on-hand inventory is 238, and in-transit units are 227 (total pipeline: 465). Since the expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 505 units (5 * 101), the current pipeline is slightly below the target base stock. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=9, covering P34-P42) to capture this stable regime for both mean and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $742.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a moderate regime following the high-demand peak (P29-P33). Since Period 34, the average demand is approximately 100.8 units per period (P34-P43). Although there was a low demand of 49 in Period 43, the overall trend since P34 remains consistent. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 189 and in-transit units at 315, the current pipeline is sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window ((L+1) = 5) at the current mean demand. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this stabilized regime (P34-P43) while smoothing the recent outlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 34: Mean demand for P34-P43 is ~101 units/period, down from the P29-P33 peak of ~150.

Daily Reward (R_t): $919.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a moderate level since Period 34. The average demand from Period 34 to 44 is approximately 97.4 units/period, which is consistent with the 'moderate level' identified in previous carry-over insights (~101 units/period). However, the last two periods (P43 and P44) have shown significantly lower demand (49 and 58 units), which may indicate a further softening or is simply natural variance. I will use a recent_N of 11 (Periods 34-44) to capture the current stable-but-softening regime. Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods (as evidenced by the P40 order arriving in P44). On-hand inventory is 183, and in-transit is 312, totaling 495 units. Given L=4, the base stock targets demand for 5 periods (L+1). With an average demand of ~97.4, the pipeline covers approximately 5 periods of demand, which is appropriate for balancing service level and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 34 appears stable but slightly softening, with an average of 97.4 units/period across P34-P44. Lead time consistently held at 4 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean compared to the peak observed in Periods 29-33. Since Period 34, the average demand is approximately 97 units/period. The most recent 5 periods (P41-P45) show a further softening with an average demand of ~72 units. The on-hand inventory is 209 and the pipeline is 255 (orders from P42-P45), totaling 464 units. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. Using recent data (N=12, covering P34-P45) captures this stabilized moderate regime while incorporating the recent slight softening. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on historical conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 34 is stable at a moderate level of approximately 97 units/period, significantly lower than the P29-P33 peak of ~150. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1041.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since Period 43. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P43-P46) have seen demand drop to an average of 63 units/period (49, 58, 79, 66), which is significantly lower than the preceding regime average of ~100 units/period (P34-P42). Current on-hand inventory is 213 units with 256 units in-transit, totaling 469 units. Given a lead time of 4 periods and the current demand rate, we are overstocked. I am setting L=4 based on consistent arrival patterns (most recent being Period 46). I am adjusting mu_hat using the last 4 samples (N=4) to reflect the recent softening in demand while maintaining sigma_hat on the last 13 periods (since Period 34) to account for volatility observed across the broader moderate-demand phase. This approach allows the OR backend to naturally reduce orders while maintaining a safety buffer for potential demand recovery as we approach the end of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime softening at Period 43: Average demand decreased to ~63 units/period (P43-P46) from the previous average of ~100 units/period (P34-P42). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1179.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted downward again starting around Period 43. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P43-P47) is approximately 65.2 units/period, down from the previous ~101 units/period regime. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 227, In-transit: 168) are high relative to this new, lower demand, totaling 395 units. Given that the total pipeline and on-hand inventory already covers approximately 6 periods of demand at the current rate (395 / 65.2 \u2248 6.05), and we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 48 of 50), the primary objective is to avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer. I will use a recent_N method for demand (N=5) to capture this latest softening. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand softening confirmed at Period 47: Mean demand for P43-P47 is ~65 units/period, compared to the previous ~101 units/period regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1244.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted to a lower level since Period 43. Analyzing demand from Period 43 to 48 (the last 6 periods), the values are: 49, 58, 79, 66, 74, 76. This gives a mean of 67.0 and a standard deviation of 11.24. This confirms the carry-over insight from Period 48 identifying a regime softening to approximately 65 units/period. The current lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 200 units on hand and 119 in transit, our total pipeline (319 units) is significantly higher than the expected demand over the lead time plus current review period (approx 5 * 67 = 335 units). However, given the high service level context (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), we need to maintain a safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to target this new lower mean and variance, ensuring the OR backend adjusts the base stock level downwards to avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against the slight upward trend seen in the last two periods (74 and 76).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2032.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a softened regime that began around Period 43. While Period 49 showed a spike to 114 units, the overall average for the last 7 periods (P43-P49) remains approximately 74 units/period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With 134 units on-hand and 130 units in-transit (ordered P46 and P49), the total pipeline of 264 units is sufficient to cover approximately 3.5 periods of demand at current rates. Given the lead time is 4, we need to ensure the base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is maintained. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this recent softening while acknowledging the latest spike, and N=7 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. This approach balances the risk of another spike against the high holding costs of excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 43 is stabilized at a lower mean of ~74 units/period, despite a Period 49 spike of 114. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
