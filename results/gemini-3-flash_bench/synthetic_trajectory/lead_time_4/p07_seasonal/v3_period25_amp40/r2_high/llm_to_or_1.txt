Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, we have no prior order history or arrival data. The promised lead time is 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 118, 153, 211, 153, 155. The mean of these 5 samples is 158 and the standard deviation is 33.6. Since we are at the start of the sequence, I will use all 5 available historical samples to set the parameters. I will use 'default' for L (promised lead time = 4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the baseline demand statistics provided. This will set the base stock level to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 213 units of 'chips(Regular)'. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we expect this arrival in Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 start message). No units arrived in Period 1 (which is normal for L=4), so 138 units of demand were lost as we started with 0 inventory. The historical demand average across the 5 provided samples is 158.0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), the backend naturally targets a high service level. Since we only have 5 historical samples and there is no calendar date provided to infer specific seasonality, using all available samples is the most stable approach for now. I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR engine to calculate based on all available data.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 and P2 are still in transit and are not expected to arrive until P5 and P6 respectively (Lead Time Definition: Order P1 arrives Arrival Resolution P5, visible Period 6). On-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales during the lead time gap. My objective is to set parameters for the OR backend to calculate the base stock for Period 3. Average demand over the first 5 samples is ~158, but recent concluded demand (P1=138, P2=121) is slightly lower. Since we only have 2 concluded periods of observation, I will use a recent_N of 3 (the minimum allowed given samples) to capture the trend while the backend integrates provided historical demand. The L=4 remains the baseline until evidence suggests otherwise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (213 units), Period 2 (206 units), and Period 3 (166 units) are currently in-transit, totaling 585 units. According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and since arrivals happen after the decision phase, we are currently experiencing stockouts. However, the pipeline is full. The historical demand for the first three periods was 138, 121, and 113 (average ~124). The demand samples provided in the prompt (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggest a higher variance or a slight upward shift compared to the first three 'concurred' periods. Since L=4, the backend needs to cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and standard deviation to capture the recent volatility seen in the sample data (mean ~158), while keeping L at the default promised value of 4 until we have arrival data to prove otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are at a critical juncture. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have concluded yet, leading to lost sales since Period 1. The demand history (138, 121, 113, 74) shows a downward trend, but N=4 is too small for a definitive regime shift. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior while being mindful of the promised lead time (L=4). Using recent_N for L helps detect if the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 once arrivals start concluding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2627.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The first order (placed in Period 1) arrived at the end of Period 5 with an actual lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Currently, we have 71 units on hand and 537 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4). Demand over the first 5 periods has been [138, 121, 113, 74, 142], yielding a mean of 117.6 and a standard deviation of 26.5. Since the promised lead time is confirmed by the first arrival, I will use L=4. Given that we have a significant pipeline (537 units) relative to recent demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'default' method (all available samples) to allow the OR backend to stabilize the stock level against the incoming pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2863.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have 120 units on-hand and 528 units in-transit. Based on the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (orders from P1 and P2 arrived in P5 and P6 respectively). Demand has been relatively stable, with the most recent three periods (P4-P6) showing a mean of 124.3 and the full history (P1-P6) showing a mean of 124.2. There is no evidence of a regime shift yet. I will set L to 'calculate' to rely on the confirmed lead time of 4. Since demand is stable, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full recent distribution for the stock-up level (which covers 1+4=5 periods of demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2354.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand shows a stable range between 74 and 157 units across 7 periods (mean ~125). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 exactly 4 periods later. Currently, we have 154 units on-hand and 442 units in-transit (orders from Periods 4, 6, and 7; Period 5 had 0 ordered). Since the in-transit pipeline (442) plus on-hand (154) totals 596, and the expected demand over the (L+1)=5 period horizon is roughly 625 (125 * 5), we are positioned reasonably well but need careful management. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the full actual demand history while excluding the initial provided samples that were higher (118-211) than the realized demand (74-157). L is set to 'default' as the promised 4 periods matches observed actuals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3361.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals from Periods 1 to 4). Current inventory is 135 on-hand plus 406 in-transit (orders from P6, P7, and P8). Demand has been relatively stable but showed a slight increase in Period 8 (184 units). The mean demand over the last 8 periods is approximately 132.6 units. Given the lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat captures the recent demand levels while keeping the variance estimation stable. The backend OR logic will use these to calculate the base stock level (target pipeline inventory) and place an order to bridge the gap between 541 units (on-hand + in-transit) and that target. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) justifies a higher service level, which the OR backend will handle via the quantile calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2565.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, on-hand inventory was depleted to 0 due to a demand of 139 versus 135 units on hand. Although no shipment arrived in Period 9 (reflecting the zero order in Period 5), a shipment ordered in Period 6 is expected to arrive during Period 10, given the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. The average demand across these 9 periods is approximately 133 units. To maintain a robust service level while accounting for the current stockout and the 4-period lead time (requiring coverage for 5 periods of demand), I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting (N=5 to capture recent volatility) and the 'default' method for lead time, as it aligns with the confirmed 4-period pattern. The target base stock will be roughly (1+L) * mean_demand + safety_stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1503.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10). Note that the order from Period 5 was 0 units, which explains why Period 9 showed 0 arrivals. The demand seems to be fluctuating around a mean of 130-140 units. Recent demand in Period 10 was lower (85), but looking at the last 5 periods (P6-P10), the mean is approximately 129.4. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. On-hand is 112 and In-transit is 580, totaling 692. Since our target pipeline (5 * 130) is around 650, current levels are adequate. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture the most recent behavior while maintaining the lead time L as 'default' (which is the promised 4).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 78 units. We have 640 units in-transit. Comparing the audit of orders: P1-P4, P6-P7 have arrived. P5 was a 0 order. The order from P8 (129 units) is expected to arrive during P12 and be visible in P13 (lead time 4). The order from P9 (186 units) is expected in P13. Historical demand (P1-P11) shows an average of 127.1 units/period. Over the last 5 periods (P7-P11), the average is 130.8. There is no clear shift in regime, so I will use a slightly more stable average based on the last 7 periods to account for recent volatility while maintaining robustness. With a lead time (L) of 4, our coverage needs to span L+1 = 5 periods. Demand volatility (sigma) is roughly 33. I will set L=4, and use recent_N for mu and sigma to capture the current demand environment.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13. Examining the history, the lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in Period 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12 conclusions). The order from Period 5 (ordered=0) would have arrived in Period 9, which explains why 'arrived=0' was recorded in the Period 9 conclude message. The pipeline is healthy (in-transit=589), and recent demand has stabilized between 85 and 114 units over the last three periods. The mean demand across all 12 periods is approximately 125 units. Since there are no clear seasonal shifts (mean and variance are relatively stable), I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) to capture the slightly lower average demand of the most recent periods (~112 units/period) while maintaining the Lead Time as default (4). The base stock calculation (1+L) * mean will target ~672 units, which is being well-tracked by the current on-hand (102) and in-transit (589).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' exhibit a stable demand pattern with a recent decline. Over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), the average demand is 107.2 units, compared to the overall average of 122.9 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, and P9 orders all arrived with L=4). However, the order from Period 5 (ordered 0) effectively created a gap. The on-hand inventory is 195 units, and there are 480 units in-transit (orders from P10, P11, P12, and P13). Since lead time is stable at 4, I will use lead time 'default' (4). For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent lower demand trend (approx 107 units/period), covering the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect current variance. This approach prevents over-ordering while maintaining enough stock for the 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1100.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing chips(Regular). The current on-hand inventory is 306 units, with 295 units in-transit. The history consistently shows an actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand analysis shows a downward trend: after an initial average of around 150 (Periods 1-8), the last 5 periods (Periods 10-14) have averaged approximately 94.2 units per period (85, 114, 105, 93, 74). To prevent overstocking as demand softens, I will use a recent_N method (N=5) for demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this lower volume. The target service level is high (q \u2248 0.95), so the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover expected demand over the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 5 periods). With current on-hand + in-transit totaling 601, and expected demand for 5 periods being ~471, the system will likely place a small or zero order to align with the current lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: average demand decreased from ~150 to ~94 per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1394.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 16. Analyzing the demand history, there was a significant regime shift starting at Period 10. From Period 1 to 9, the average demand was approximately 139 units. From Period 10 to 15, the average demand dropped to approximately 93.8 units per period. The standard deviation for this recent period is also lower. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-8 and 10-15). As of the start of Period 16, we have a high on-hand inventory of 354 units and 155 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 12 and 13). Given the current demand of ~94 units/period, the coverage needs to span L+1 = 5 periods, requiring about 470 units. With 509 units total inventory (354 on-hand + 155 in-transit), we are well-stocked. To reflect the lower demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift since Period 10. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 10. Prior to Period 10, the mean demand was approximately 150 units. From Period 10 to Period 16, the mean demand dropped to approximately 93 units (85, 114, 105, 93, 74, 92, 80). Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 352 units, which is significantly above the required base stock for a 5-period window (L+1) under the new demand regime. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the lower demand trend since Period 10. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 10. Prior to Period 10, demand averaged ~137; since Period 10, the demand has stabilized at a lower average of approximately 90.5 units per period (N=8: [85, 114, 105, 93, 74, 92, 80, 81]). Current on-hand inventory is 348 units, which is quite high relative to the new demand level (covering nearly 4 periods). With an in-transit quantity of 82 (likely the orders from Period 16 and 17), the total pipeline covers the lead time of 4 plus the current period (L+1=5). I will use recent_N=8 to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation, ensuring the OR backend stops over-ordering. The lead time L is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 10, averaging approximately 90 units per period (last 9 periods show mean=89.7). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on historical arrivals (all observed arrivals followed a 4-period lag, though Period 14-17 were from the Period 10-13 orders). Currently, we have 264 units on-hand and 155 units in-transit (orders from P16: 13, P17: 69, P18: 73). The order from Period 14 seems to be missing as it should have arrived in Period 18 based on L=4; however, looking at the history, Period 14 and 15 actually had 'ordered=0', so there was no shipment to arrive in Period 18 or 19. The total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 419 units, which covers over 4 periods of the current demand (approx 90/period). I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the current demand regime (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), and use the calculated L which has consistently been 4.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 10. Prior to P10, demand averaged ~137; from P10 onwards, the average has dropped to ~85. The last few periods (P18-P19) show even lower demand (specifically P19 with 38), though I will use a larger window (N=10) to stabilize the mu_hat against this variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by concluded cycles. On-hand inventory is healthy (226) and in-transit is 232. To avoid overstocking in this lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the current lower average demand while accounting for recent volatility. The L is set to default as the promised and historical actual lead times are both 4.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 10, averaging approximately 84 units per period (P10-P20 average is ~84.4). The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 20 of the Period 16 order. Current inventory metrics show an on-hand balance of 157 and an in-transit pipeline of 259. To optimize for this lower demand regime and avoid excessive holding costs (holding cost is $1 vs $19 profit), I will use the last 11 samples (P10-P20) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This represents the stable demand period after the detected shift. Setting L to 'default' uses the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 10, dropping from a mean of ~150 to ~94. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P10-P21), the mean demand is 83.3 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 17.6. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P20 and P21). The 'In-transit' inventory of 267 units matches the sum of orders from P18 (73), P19 (77), P20 (40), and P21 (77), confirming no lost shipments. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. My goal is to maintain the lower demand profile (approx 83/period) while accounting for the recent variance. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to focus on the current regime starting from Period 10.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 10, averaging approximately 85 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on recent delivery observations (P16 arriving at P20, P17 arriving at P21, P18 arriving at P22). The high inventory on-hand (157 units) and in-transit (264 units) are a result of historical ordering patterns during the higher demand regime; however, we must maintain parameters that align with the current lower demand and standard lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the start of the lower demand regime from P10 to P22) to accurately reflect the current mean and variance. Lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time of 4.

The lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P22 and P23 both arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering). I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect this stability. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture the current lower-demand regime while excluding the higher noise from the first 9 periods. This ensures the base stock calculation (1+L periods of demand) is tuned to recent behavior (approx 5 periods * 80.4 = 402 units), preventing excessive inventory as we are currently holding 179 on-hand with 246 in-transit.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 10. For Periods 1-10, the average demand was approximately 135 units/period. From Period 11 to Period 24 (the last 14 periods), the average demand dropped to approximately 82 units/period (total 1152 units / 14 periods). There is no specific calendar date provided, but the demand has remained relatively stable in this lower range for over 10 periods. The lead time is consistently 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P20 order arrived P24). Current on-hand (112) plus in-transit (254) totals 366 units. At the current demand rate (~82), this covers approximately 4.5 periods of demand, which is tight given the L=4 lead time. I will use recent_N with N=14 to capture this stable, lower demand regime (starting from Period 11) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the inventory level targets the current consumption rate rather than the higher initial levels, avoiding excess holding costs while maintaining a 95% service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~82 units (down from ~135). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 11, stabilizing at a lower average. For the last 15 periods (Period 11 to 25), the average demand is approximately 81.3 units, with a standard deviation of about 19.3 units. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (observed across multiple concluded orders: P16-P20, P17-P21, P18-P22, P19-P23, P20-P24, P21-P25). Given the current on-hand inventory (100) and in-transit (293), totaling 393 units, we are well-positioned. The base stock calculation for L=4 (covering 5 periods of demand) using recent_N=15 for mu_hat (5 * 81.3 = 406.5) and sigma_hat (sqrt(5) * 19.3 = 43.1) ensures we maintain a sufficient service level for this high-margin product (Profit $19 vs Holding $1) while accounting for the lower demand regime. I will use recent_N=15 to capture this stable post-shift performance.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent increase in volatility and mean. While the long-term regime since Period 11 was ~82 units, the last three periods (P24-26) have seen demand levels of 107, 89, and 139 (avg ~112). This suggests a potential upward shift or a seasonal spike. I will use a recent window (N=16) to capture the shift from the lower regime (starting P11) while including the recent spikes to ensure the service level is maintained. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently low (31), but a significant in-transit pipeline (315) is expected to arrive over the coming periods (from orders in P23-26). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=16 balances the stable lower period with recent growth.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1710.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 24-27) shows a sharp increase with an average of ~110 units (107, 89, 139, 105), which is significantly higher than the previous regime of ~82 units. I am designating Period 24 as the start of a new 'high demand' regime (N=4). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced a stockout in Period 27 (sold 90 vs demand 105). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock targets (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat will adjust to this higher demand level quickly. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility observed in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime identified starting Period 24: average demand increased from ~82 to ~110 units (+34%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $912.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: Inventory is depleted (0 on-hand) and demand has spiked significantly starting around Period 24. The average demand across Periods 24-28 is approximately 118 units, compared to the previous regime of ~82. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My priority is to raise the base stock level to satisfy this higher demand regime and recover from stockouts. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 479 units, which includes orders from P25 (116), P26 (92), P27 (126), and P28 (145). The next arrival should be the P25 order (116 units), arriving during Period 29. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this new demand regime (Periods 24-28: 107, 89, 139, 105, 152), resulting in a mean demand of 118.4 per period. Total coverage (L+1) will be 5 periods, targeting approx 592 units total in pipeline + on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 24-28 average demand increased to ~118 units (+44% from previous regime), likely requiring higher base stock levels to prevent sustained stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2204.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 24. For the last 6 periods (P24-P29), demand has averaged approximately 126 units (107, 89, 139, 105, 152, 166), which is significantly higher than the previous regime (~82 units). Currently, the system is experiencing stockouts because previous orders were based on the lower demand regime. On-hand inventory is 0. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (L=4). To recover service levels, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this higher demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This sets mu_hat based on (1+L)*126 = 630. With a profit margin of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (~95%), necessitating this shift to prevent further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 confirmed: average demand increased from ~82 to ~126 units (+53%). Current stockouts at P27-P29 are a direct result of this shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1748.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting Period 24. For the most recent 7 periods (P24-P30), demand has averaged approximately 124.7 units (107, 89, 139, 105, 152, 166, 115). This is a clear increase from the previous average of ~82 units. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 since P27) because the arriving orders were placed during the lower-demand period. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting L=4 and mu_hat using recent_N=7 will capture this higher demand mean (~623.5 for 5 periods) and allow the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level to satisfy the current regime. Sigma_hat is also calculated over these 7 periods to capture the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 confirmed: Mean increased from ~82 to ~125 units (+52%) based on 7 periods of data (P24-P30).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2334.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting Period 24. For the last 8 periods (P24-P31), demand has been: 107, 89, 139, 105, 152, 166, 115, 123. The average for this recent period is approximately 124.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is critically low (3 units) due to the sustained demand spike exceeding previous order quantities. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 601) consists of orders from P28 (145), P29 (162), P30 (177), and P31 (117). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. To stabilize service levels and account for the high volatility seen in this new regime (standard deviation is roughly 25-30), I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this higher demand average (~124.5) and the increased variance. This ensures mu_hat is set to (1+L)*124.5. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level, which is appropriate given the recent stockouts.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 24. Since Period 24, demand values have been: 107, 89, 139, 105, 152, 166, 115, 123, 131. The mean of these last 9 samples is approximately 125 units per period. This shift is corroborated by multiple carry-over insights and recent stockouts. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods via the 'conclude' messages (e.g., Period 32 shows the Period 28 order arriving, which is a 4-period lead time). Therefore, I am setting L to 4. For mu_hat, I'm using the last 9 samples (since the Period 24 shift) to capture the higher demand level (approx 125 * 5 = 625 total across lead + review period). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=9 to reflect the increased volatility in this higher demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2441.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 24. Since Period 24, observed demand values are: 107, 89, 139, 105, 152, 166, 115, 123, 131, 131. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (N=10) is approximately 125.8 units, which aligns with previous carry-over insights of ~125. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (order from P29 arrived on P33). I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and its volatility while filtering out the older, lower-demand data (approx 82 units). This ensures the base stock calculated (target for L+1 periods) reflects the current consumption rate and service level requirements (19/20 = 95%).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 remains stable at a mean of ~126 units (last 10 periods average 125.8). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 24. Since Period 24, the demand has averaged approximately 125.8 units per period (1384 total demand over 11 periods). The most recent demand (P34) was 104 units, but the overall trend remains elevated compared to the preceding low-demand regime (P11-P23 avg ~82). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals, including the P30 order arriving in P34. Current inventory (On-hand: 121) and pipeline (489) are now recovering from previous stockouts. I will continue to use a recent_N method with N=11 to capture this high-demand regime (P24-P34) precisely while ignoring the older low-demand history. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current 125+ unit mean and associated volatility correctly for the 4-period lead time.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 24. For the last 12 periods (P24-P35), the average demand is approximately 126 units (1512 total / 12 periods), which is a sustained and significant increase from the previous regime (~82 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals through Period 35. With 'In-transit' at 466 units and 'On-hand' at 89, the pipeline is substantial. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=12 captures this current demand level (mean ~126), and sigma_hat with recent_N=12 captures the recent volatility (std ~23.5). This ensures the base stock calculation, which covers 5 periods of demand (L+1), accurately reflects the higher demand environment to prevent future stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 24 and has remained consistently high. Since Period 24, the average demand is approximately 126.5 units. In the last 5 periods (P32-P36), the mean is 122.4, but the individual samples show volatility (ranging from 104 to 149). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=13 (covering the period since the last major shift at P24) ensures the OR backend uses the current high-demand mean (~126). Setting sigma_hat with recent_N=13 captures the increased variance seen in this higher demand regime, which helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient safety stock to prevent the stockouts witnessed earlier (P27-P30).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1582.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 24 remains the primary driver for forecasting. Over the last 14 periods (P24-P37), the average demand is approximately 123 units, with the most recent 10 periods (P28-P37) averaging 119.5 units. The demand shows some volatility but has stabilized around this new higher mean compared to the previous regime. Lead time remains consistent at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by the P33 order arriving in P37). The current on-hand inventory of 128 units, combined with an in-transit pipeline of 489 units, is being managed by the OR engine to meet the target service level. I will continue using recent_N with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this stable high-demand regime, and 'calculate' for the lead time as it is reliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2083.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 24, moving from an average of ~82 units to a higher mean of ~125.8 units (calculated from Period 24 to 38, excluding initial stockout periods that might bias variance). Currently, the last 5 periods (P34-P38) show an average demand of 114.8, while the last 15 periods (since the shift) average 125.8. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 140 and in-transit at 442, we have a total pipeline of 582 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Estimating ~126 units/period, we need ~630 units. Using 'recent_N' with N=15 (covering the entirety of the current high-demand regime) provides the most stable and representative estimate for the OR backend to calculate the base stock while accounting for current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1986.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 24 and has remained consistently higher. Over the last 16 periods (P24-P39), the average demand is 121.5 units, which is significantly higher than the previous regime (~82 units). Over the most recent 10 periods (P30-P39), the mean is approximately 119 units with a standard deviation of 17.5. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 35 order in Period 39. I will use recent_N with N=16 to capture the full extent of this higher-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased demand and volatility observed since the shift, balancing the high profit margin ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1) to maintain a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 remains stable with an average of approximately 121 units (P24-P39). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 24 to a higher regime. For the last 17 periods (P24-P40), the mean demand is 120.9 units. The lead time has remained extremely stable at 4 periods. Since Period 40's demand was significantly lower than the recent average (70 units vs. ~121), I will use the last 17 periods (N=17) to calculate the mean and standard deviation to capture this regime accurately while smoothing out the most recent dip. The on-hand inventory is 213, and in-transit is 405, providing a total pipeline of 618 units. Given L=4, the base stock targets demand over 5 periods. 5 * 121 = 605, suggesting the current pipeline is well-positioned, and the OR backend will adjust orders accordingly to maintain this level.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 24 (mean ~121 units) appears to be shifting again. The last five periods (P37-P41) show demand levels of 90, 117, 111, 70, and 58, which averages to 89.2 units. This represents a significant decrease from the previous average of ~121. While I will not yet declare a permanent regime shift in the carry_over_insight until more data is available, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to allow the OR engine to react to this potential downward trend and avoid excessive holding costs. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which I will confirm using the 'calculate' method.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~112 units per period over the most recent 19 periods (P24-P42), following the significant regime shift at Period 24. While the average for the entire post-P24 regime was previously calculated at ~121, the last 10 periods (P33-P42) show a slight cooling to an average of ~107 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and reliable based on every arrival since Period 5. Currently, on-hand inventory is healthy (254 units) and in-transit inventory is sufficient (282 units). Given the high service level target (critical ratio q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95), the backend should target a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (L+1). I am using recent_N with N=19 to capture the entirety of the current stable demand regime while filtering out the volatile historical data from Periods 1-23.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 remains stable; the average demand for the period P24-P42 is ~112 units. Lead time remains strictly confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $894.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has shown a consistent average around 112-126 units, but recent demand from Period 40 to 43 (70, 58, 89, 63) suggests a notable softening or potential downward shift. The average over the last 4 periods is ~70 units, while the average from P24-P43 is ~110. To avoid overstocking in the final periods of the game (ending P50), I am selecting a recent_N window of 7 periods (P37-P43) which captures the start of this deceleration while maintaining safety. This results in a mu_hat calculation based on an average demand of approximately 77 units per period. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand (303) and in-transit (305) stocks are high relative to these recent demand levels, so the OR backend will naturally scale back ordering to optimize holding costs against the $19 margin.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand softening observed starting Period 40: average demand decreased from ~120 to ~70 units over the last 4 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has significantly softened starting around Period_40. Average demand across the last five periods (P40-P44) is approximately 67 units (70, 58, 89, 63, 55), a stark decrease from the previous regime average of ~121. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 353 units, and there are 200 units in-transit (orders from P41 and P43). Given the current holding cost ($1.0) and high service level target implied by the profit margin ($19.0), the backend will naturally reduce orders due to the high pipeline relative to the new demand levels. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this recent demand drop while maintaining L at the stabilized lead time of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 40: average demand decreased from ~121 to ~67 units (-45%).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward regime shift starting at Period 40. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P40-P45) is approximately 62 units (70, 58, 89, 63, 55, 37), compared to the previous regime (~120 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 381 units and in-transit is 135 units (ordered P43), totaling 516 units. With the current low demand, this total inventory covers more than 8 periods of demand at the new rate, which is well above the required protection levels for a 4-period lead time. No new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to reflect this lower demand and avoid triggering excessive orders from the OR backend while maintaining the stable lead time of 4.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 40 onwards shows a significant decrease. The average demand across Periods 40-46 is approximately 64.4 units, representing a 45% drop from the previous regime (Period 24-39 average of ~121). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 303 and In-transit at 135 (Total Pipeline = 438), we are significantly overstocked relative to the new demand levels. Specifically, the required base stock for a 5-period horizon (L+1=5) at current demand levels (~65 units/period) is roughly 325-350 units. Since 438 units are already accounted for, the Capped Policy will result in zero orders. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect this lower demand regime (P40-P46) and ensure the OR backend's service level logic aligns with the current softening. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been stable and reliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed starting Period 40: average demand decreased from ~121 to ~64 units (-47%) based on 7 periods of data (P40-P46).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained low-demand regime starting from Period 40. The average demand across these last 8 periods (P40-P47) is approximately 65.25 units, which is a significant drop from the previous average of ~121 units. Current on-hand inventory is 355 units with nothing in transit. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4, the OR backend logic uses 1+L=5 periods of demand to set the base stock. With an average of ~65 units/period, the target base stock would be around 325-350 units. Since on-hand inventory (355) already exceeds this level, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this lower demand regime accurately. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $505.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are nearing the end of the simulation (Period 50). The current demand regime (starting Period 40) shows a significantly lower mean of approximately 64 units compared to previous periods. Given that the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 49) will arrive in Period 53, which is beyond the game's horizon of 50 periods. Therefore, placing large orders now would only incur holding costs or contribute to ending inventory without the possibility of being sold. The current on-hand inventory of 312 units is far more than enough to cover the demand for the final two periods (Period 49 and 50), especially since the current average demand is around 64. I will set the parameters to reflect the recent demand regime (last 9 periods, P40-P48) to maintain accuracy in the backend model, but the OR logic will naturally minimize ordering given the high on-hand stock and the pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1788.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime following a shift starting at Period 40. The average demand from Period 40 to Period 49 is approximately 68 units per period (70, 58, 89, 63, 55, 37, 78, 83, 43, 105). Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (207) and units in-transit (74), the current inventory position is sufficient to cover expected demand over the lead time. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this current demand regime (Periods 40-49) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'calculate' method for L as the lead time has been stable and confirmed throughout the history.
