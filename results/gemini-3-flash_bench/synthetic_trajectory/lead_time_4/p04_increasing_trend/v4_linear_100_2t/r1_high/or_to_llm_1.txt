The historical demand samples (Period 1-5) are 75, 90, 0, 170, and 127, giving an average of 92.4 units per period. The OR recommendation is 197 units, based on a capped base-stock policy. Since we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and the lead time is relatively long (4 periods), we must order now to cover demand starting from Period 5 (L=4). Using the formula (L+1) * mean demand (5 * 92.4 = 462) as a loose guide for the inventory position needed, the OR's capped recommendation of 197 seems conservative for an initial stock-up phase.

Demand in Period 1 was 79 (zero sales due to zero stock). Historical samples (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) show a mean of ~92.4. Since the lead time is long (L=4), we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Strategy: Total units available to cover demand until the Period 14 order arrives (Period 18) = On-hand (200) + In-transit (381) = 581 units.

Previous demand was ~105, but the last 12 periods (P15-P26) averaged ~152. Recent volatility is high (P24: 271, P26: 60), but the upward trend remains valid. \n3. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 127. Pipeline (557) is substantial, specifically the deliveries arriving in P27 (70 units from P23) and P28 (55 units from P24). \n4. OR Comparison: The OR recommendation of 134 units is based on whole-history stats, which likely underestimates the recent 150+ average demand. \n5. Strategy: Total inventory (On-hand 127 + Pipeline 557) = 684. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand. At the current high-regime average (~155), we need ~775 units. 775 - 684 = 91 units.

In the last five non-zero demand periods, average demand is approximately 293 (ignoring the outlier 0 in Period 37). The current pipeline contains 1,370 units, but with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we must ensure the 'inventory position' (On-hand + In-transit) covers the demand over the next lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current inventory position is 288 (on-hand) + 1,370 (in-transit) = 1,658 units. Estimated total demand for 5 periods, based on the recent high-volatility average of ~330 (weighted towards the higher regime), is roughly 1,650 units. The OR recommendation of 0 exists because the pipeline (1,370) is significantly higher than the OR's historical-average-based base stock. However, looking at the arrival schedule: P35 order (210), P36 (420), P37 (420), P38 (320) are in transit. P35 (210) arrives in P39; P36 (420) arrives in P40. We have 288 now + 210 arriving soon = 498 against potentially 350-400 demand. While the pipeline is technically full, the extreme volatility (688 peak) and the need to maintain supply through Period 44 (P39 order arrival) suggests we are safe to pause ordering briefly to let inventory settle, as 1,658 units covers approximately 5 periods of high-regime demand (~330 avg).",

However, our pipeline of 1160 + current 394 = 1554 units already provides significant coverage. \n5. **OR Recommendation Reconcile**: The OR recommendation is 0 because the pipeline inventory is very high relative to the long-term historical mean.

Current on-hand inventory is healthy at 639 units. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 740 units, consisting of orders from P37 (420 units), P38 (320 units), and zero orders from P39 and P40.

By the end of P42, without further ordering, total available stock would be approximately 1379 units. Given recent demand trends, a base stock level calculation for L+1 (5 periods) using a mean of 215 and significant safety stock suggests we need around 1500-1800 units in the system.

This means the order placed now (P45) will arrive in Period 49 and be available for Period 50. Orders placed after P45 will not arrive before the game ends. Current inventory on-hand is 522. In-transit inventory consists of: P41 (250) arriving P45 (visible P46), P44 (300) arriving P48 (visible P49). Total supply available for the remaining 6 periods (including current demand resolution) is 522 (on-hand) + 250 + 300 = 1072. Estimated demand for 6 periods (P45-P50) at the current rate of ~350/period is 2100 units. Even at a more conservative average of 200/period, we would need 1200 units. To cover the final periods and mitigate the risk of a late-game stockout during this high-demand regime, I will increase the order quantity significantly above the OR's recommendation to 400 units.

This aligns with the 'second demand regime shift' noted in the Carry-over insights. \n4. **Target Calculation**: To cover the lead time (4) + current period (1) = 5 periods of demand at the high-regime average (~315), target inventory is approximately 1,575 units. \n5. **Action**: The current pipeline is 1,230. 1,575 - 1,230 = 345 units. The OR recommends 0 because its capped model likely weighs older, lower-demand periods (50-150 range) too heavily or hit its internal cap.

Even if we consider the arrival resolution at Period 51 (47+4), it still falls outside the scoring window of Periods 1-50. Current levels are: On-hand = 353, In-transit = 1050. The in-transit inventory consists of orders from P44 (300), P45 (400), and P46 (350). Based on the 4-period lead time, the P44 order (ordered P44) is expected to arrive during Period 48, the P45 order during Period 49, and the P46 order during Period 50. Given that recent demand (P43-P46) has averaged ~280 units per period, the existing on-hand stock and the expected arrival in P48 (300 units) will be sufficient to cover demand for the remaining 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50).
