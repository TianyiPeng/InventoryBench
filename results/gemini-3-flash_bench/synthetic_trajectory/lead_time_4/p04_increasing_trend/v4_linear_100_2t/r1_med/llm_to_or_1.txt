Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical performance or concluded arrivals to analyze yet. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Given the demand samples provided (75, 90, 0, 170, 127), the average demand per period is approximately 92.4 units. To ensure we cover the lead time plus the decision period (L+1 = 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the 'default' method, which the backend will calculate as (1+4) * 92.4 = 462. Given the high variance in the samples (especially the 0 and 170), the default sigma_hat should provide a sufficient buffer for the initial safety stock calculation until we observe actual lead times and demand patterns.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 197 units which is currently in-transit. The inventory started at 0, and since the promised lead time is 4 periods, no arrivals occurred in Period 1, resulting in 79 lost sales due to zero on-hand stock. Historical demand samples (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) show high volatility (CV \u2248 0.6). The mean demand across available samples is 92.4. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the review+lead time window is 5 periods. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand over these 5 periods. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the full range of the provided historical context while the game starts. The goal is to build up on-hand inventory to stop the lost sales cycle once the first order arrives around Period 5.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have only completed Period 2, it is perfectly normal that no orders have arrived yet (at L=4, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 5 and be visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to stockouts in Periods 1 and 2 because starting inventory was 0 and lead time prevents immediate replenishment. Demand in Period_1 was 79 and Period_2 was 114 (average 96.5). The standard deviation for these two points is approximately 24.7. Demand in Period_3 is recorded as 0 in the provided data history, but the prompt's historical demand section shows Period_3: 0, Period_4: 170, Period_5: 127. There appears to be a disconnect between the Game History and the provided sample list. I will treat the sample list (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) as the primary indicator for variability. I'll use L=4 (promised) and forecast based on the mean of the available samples to maintain a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4 sequence: P1 decision -> P5 arrival resolution -> P6 start observation). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 568 units in transit (197 from P1, 198 from P2, 173 from P3). Demand has been increasing significantly: P1=79, P2=114, P3=164. Based on the provided historical samples (P1: 75, P2: 90, P3: 0, P4: 170, P5: 127), there is high volatility and a clear upward trend in the 'conclude' messages. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent growth trend (mean of {79, 114, 164} = 119), while maintaining a conservative variance estimate. Lead time (L) remains 'default' as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The base stock policy needs to cover demand over the lead time (L=4) plus the current review period (1), totaling 5 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 75, 90, 0, 170, 127 (mean ~92.4; std ~64). However, the 'conclude' messages show recorded demands of 79, 114, 164, 87 (mean ~111). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 699 units in-transit (orders from Periods 1-4). Since the promised lead time is 4, the order from Period 1 (197 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (at the start of Period 6). There are no concluded arrivals yet, so we cannot confirm if the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4. Given the high volatility in early demand samples and the stockout situation (on-hand 0), I will use the recent 4 samples of demand from the game history to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick to the default promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $413.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Promised lead time is 4. Period 5 conclude shows the first delivery (ordered P1, arrived P5), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since P1, P2, P3, and P4 orders were placed, we have significant in-transit inventory (502 units). Historical demand across 5 periods (75, 90, 0, 170, 127 based on seeds; 79, 114, 164, 87, 122 based on 'conclude' history) suggests an average of ~113 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 75. The OR backend needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand better captures the realized demand variability (std ~33) compared to the initial seeds. Since the pipeline is already heavy (502 units) and the confirmed lead time matches the promised 4, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to stabilize the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5). Demand average over first 5 periods is approximately 113 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $362.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). This matches the promised lead time (L=4). Demand for the first 6 periods has been: 79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127. The average demand is 115.5 units per period. There's no clear seasonal shift yet, but demand shows moderate variability (standard deviation ~29). The current on-hand inventory is 146 units, with 357 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, and P6). Since L=4, the pipeline should cover 1+L = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent average of 115.5 for mu_hat (1+4=5 periods) and the observed volatility, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the full history (N=6) to ensure the base stock levels remain stable given the confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand average stabilized around 115-120 units over the first 6 periods. Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (Period 1 arrived in P5, Period 2 in P6, Period 3 in P7). Demand has shown high variance but has averaged 110.3 units over the last 7 periods (79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127, 79). I will continue using the promised lead time of 4. For demand (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the full history as it appears to be a single regime with high variance. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to accurately reflect this volatility (std dev ~29), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to handle peaks without excessive holding costs, especially given the 'Regular chips' category tends to have stable but slightly noisy demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $179.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the arrival of orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8 respectively. Demand has shown stability with samples: 79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127, 79, 110. The average demand across these 8 periods is 110.5 units. With L=4, the review plus lead time period is (L+1)=5 periods. mu_hat is calculated using the recent 8 samples to reflect the established demand level (110.5 * 5 = 552.5). The on-hand inventory is currently 261, and in-transit is 240 (orders from P6, P7, and P8), totaling 501 units. This is slightly below the target base stock, but ensures we don't over-order given the holding cost of $1.0 vs $4.0 profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand average over the first 8 periods is confirmed at approximately 110-111 units/period with no significant trend or shift detected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $159.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 177 with 345 units in transit. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, and historical data (P5 through P8 arrivals) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. No order arrived in P9, which is consistent with the decision to order 0 units in P5. The demand history (P1 to P9) shows values: 79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127, 79, 110, 84. The mean of all samples is approximately 107.3, and the standard deviation is approximately 28.5. No significant demand regime shift or trend is detected; the volatility is moderate but stable. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to align with the observed history and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical data points for a stable base-stock calculation, as there are no clear changepoints in demand patterns.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with no clear seasonal trend or regime shift. The mean demand across 10 periods is approximately 107 units. The lead time is confirmed to be exactly 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). Note that in Period 9, 'arrived=0' is correct because no order was placed in Period 5. The order from Period 6 arrived in Period 10 as expected. Currently, on-hand inventory is 126 and in-transit is 360 (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Using L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Mean demand = 107; mu_hat (5 periods) = 535. Sigma is relatively low. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the stable recent behavior and ensure the OR backend minimizes holding costs while maintaining the service level.

LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 11 of the order placed in Period 7. Demand across the first 11 periods is fairly stable, with a mean of approximately 108 units (Total=1190). The most recent demand samples (P8-P11: 110, 84, 104, 120) average 104.5. Given the promised lead time L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current inventory position is 466 (139 on-hand + 327 in-transit). The backend calculates the base stock level; I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to utilize the consistent history of L=4. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will switch to 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full stable regime since the beginning of the game, as no significant trend or shift is detected.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Through Period 12, the average demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable at approximately 107 units per period (total demand of 1285 units over 12 periods). Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12. Note that Period 9 saw no arrivals as no order was placed in Period 5. The current on-hand inventory is 98, with 397 units in-transit. Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will continue using 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use the 'default' method to calculate statistics over all 12 historical samples to ensure a robust baseline, as no significant demand regime shift or seasonal spike is currently detectable.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU shows a consistently stable demand pattern and reliable lead times. Based on 'conclude' messages from Period 5 through Period 13, all orders have arrived with an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand data (including the seed samples) shows a mean of approximately 104 units with a standard deviation of roughly 36. Over the last 13 periods, the mean is approximately 104.6. No significant shifts, seasonal spikes, or missing shipments have been detected. Therefore, I am using the 'default' calculation for lead time (4 periods). For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the full stability of the observed game history while excluding the seed samples (Periods 1-5 mean was higher, but the last 8-9 periods have stabilized around 100). For sigma_hat, I am using 'default' to account for the full variability seen to date, ensuring a robust safety stock in the OR backend's base-stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 150 units with 399 units in-transit. Comparing history (P10-P14), there is a noticeable decline in demand, with P14 dropping to 46 units. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 88 units, compared to the overall average of approximately 107 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (L=4), meaning the base stock must cover L+1 (5) periods. Given the recent softening of demand, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend and prevent over-ordering which would lead to high holding costs. The profit margin ($4) versus holding cost ($1) justifies a relatively high service level, which the OR backend will naturally target using the provided mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 12: average demand decreased from ~110 to ~88 units/period (-20%) over the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $425.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant regime shift. Between Periods 1 and 11, the average demand was approximately 107 units per period. However, from Period 12 to Period 15, the demand has fluctuated but averaged lower at approximately 87.75 units per period. The last two periods (P14-P15) show high volatility (46 vs 135). Given the current on-hand inventory (115) and a large in-transit pipeline (299), totaling 414 units, we are well-covered for the 5-period cycle (L+1) even at the previous higher demand average. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering Periods 11-15) to capture the recent lower-demand trend while accounting for the high volatility seen in P15. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to properly reflect this increased variance in the new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $676.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system inventory status shows 56 units on-hand and 299 units in-transit. Reviewing the 'Period 16 conclude' message, the order from Period 12 arrived exactly after 4 periods, confirming the lead time (L) remains stable at 4. Demand in Period 16 spiked significantly to 183 units, which is a stark departure from the lowercase demand regime (avg ~88) noted in the Carry-over Insights for Periods 12-15. This spike, combined with the earlier high demand in Period 15 (135), suggests a potential new upward demand shift or high volatility phase. To handle this, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) for the mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent increase without being overly influenced by the older, lower-demand periods. Given L=4, the backend will calculate requirements for a 5-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: Period 15-16 saw a notable increase (avg 159) compared to the Period 12-14 average (72), suggesting the previous downward trend has reversed or volatility has spiked.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU went out of stock (ending on-hand: 0) due to a spike in demand (212 units), which is significantly higher than the long-term average (~110). There has been a clear shift in demand regime: the last 3 periods (P15-P17) saw demands of 135, 183, and 212, averaging 176.6 units. This contrasts sharply with the earlier periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a significant demand uptrend evidenced over the last 3 samples, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this increased volatility and volume. L remains at the promised/calculated value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: significant upward trend starting P15. Last 3 periods average 177 units, compared to previous averages of ~110. Current on-hand is 0, indicating a stockout in P17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $332.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 15. The demand over the last four periods (P15-P18) has been 135, 183, 212, and 220, resulting in stockouts in P17 and P18. The mean demand for these last 4 periods is 187.5 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and 560 units in-transit (ordered in P15-P18), the priority is to aggressively raise the base stock level to cover the (L+1)=5 period lead time plus review period. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this upward shift in both mean demand and volatility (sigma). This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the current 180+ unit demand levels. I am setting L to default as the promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by arrival history.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 15-18 average demand is 187.5 units, a significant increase from the previous average of ~110 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained high-demand regime starting around Period 15. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 183 units (135, 183, 212, 220, 166), which is significantly higher than the initial average of ~110. The system is currently in a stockout situation (on-hand: 0) with a large number of units lost in Period 19 despite a lead time of 4. Observation of the history shows that the order from Period 15 is missing; it was expected to arrive in Period 19 (ordered P11 arrived P15, ordered P12 arrived P16, ordered P13 arrived P17, ordered P14 arrived P18, but Period 19 conclude shows arrived=0 for an order placed on P15). This missing order of 0 units suggests the shipment might be lost or significantly delayed, as lead time was consistently 4 before this. To respond to this high-demand regime and the missing shipment, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the ~183 units/period average, and sigma_hat using the same N=5 to reflect the increased volatility. Lead time L is kept at 'calculate' as the historical consistency of 4 is well-documented, though I will remain alert for further missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Verified missing shipment from Period 15 (was due in Period 19 resolution). Sustained high-demand regime (Periods 15-19) average is 183 units/period (+66% from baseline).

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the firm faces a critical stockout situation (on-hand inventory = 0) despite the arrival of 124 units in Period 20, which were immediately exhausted by demand of 150. A major shipment from Period 15 is officially confirmed lost (expected in P19, still not arrived by P20 conclude), creating a significant gap in the pipeline. Demand shifted significantly at Period 15; the average for the high-demand regime (P15-P20) is 177.7 units/period, compared to the previous baseline of ~110. For Period 21, I am using L=4 (promised/observed). I will set mu_hat to explicitly cover (L+1) periods of the current high-demand regime: (4+1) * 178 = 890 units. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for recent high volatility (stdev of P15-P20 is ~33, and sqrt(5)*33 is ~74). This inventory-up-to level (base stock) will signal the OR backend to place an order that refills the pipeline to compensate for the lost Period 15 shipment and the higher consumption rate.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of Period 15 shipment (124 units); pipeline inventory must be adjusted to compensate. High-demand regime (P15-P20) average demand is 178 units/period, a ~62% increase from the initial baseline.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P15-P21) shows a significant increase, averaging 166.5 units per period. Although demand in P21 dropped to 100, this follows a string of very high demand (135 to 220), and the drop may be related to replenishment cycles or minor fluctuation rather than a full regime reversal. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (P15-P21) to capture this higher average and provide enough stock (95 on hand) while accounting for the confirmed loss of the P15 order. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the inventory position needs to cover 5 periods (L+1), \u03bc\u0302 should reflect approximately 5 * 166.5 = 832.5. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat will dynamically calculate this. Pipeline inventory is currently high (763), so the OR engine will modulate orders accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (P15-P21) average confirmed at 166.5 units/period. P21 demand drop to 100 noted but not yet treated as a trend reversal.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, the current on-hand inventory is 178 units with a pipeline of 578 units (orders from P19-P22). The order from Period 15 is confirmed lost as orders from Period 16, 17, and 18 have already arrived. Demand analysis shows a clear regime shift starting Period 15. While demand peaked around 210-220 units in Periods 17-18, it has since moderated but remains significantly higher than the initial baseline of 110 units. Over the last 8 periods (P15-P22), mean demand is 165.5 units. To ensure the OR backend captures this shift and the associated increased volatility, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods for all non-lost shipments, so I will use the 'default' method for L.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (beginning P15) confirmed: Average demand for the last 8 periods is 165.5 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~110. Peak demand observed in P17-P18 (~216 units) followed by moderation.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the inventory position for chips(Regular) has significantly improved with an on-hand balance of 349 units following the arrival of 251 units from Period 19. Demand in the most recent two periods (P22: 158, P23: 80) shows a decline from the high-demand regime (P15-P20 avg: 178). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P20-P23) averaged 122 units, suggesting the peak has passed and demand is moderating back toward the long-term baseline of ~110. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high current on-hand inventory (349) plus in-transit stock (473), and the observation that Period 23 demand was notably low (80), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this moderating trend (averaging ~122 units/period). This provides a base_stock target of approximately 610 units (122 * 5). Since current pipeline inventory (349 + 473 = 822) significantly exceeds this target, the OR backend will correctly skip ordering this period to avoid excessive holding costs as demand cools.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderation observed: Period 20-23 average demand fell to 122 units/period, down from the P15-P20 peak average of 178 (-31%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $835.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been highly volatile in recent periods. A high-demand regime started around Period 15, peaking at over 200 units, then moderated to ~120 units, and then spiked again to 271 units in Period 24. Averaging the demand from the start of this high-volatility regime (Period 15 to Period 24, N=10) yields an average of approximately 167 units/period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory levels (on-hand 249 + in-transit 302) are substantial. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to reflect this current regime's mean (approx 167), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the high volatility (std dev is significantly higher than the initial baseline). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand during the lead time plus current period (5 periods total), while accounting for the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged again in Period 24 (271 units). The high-demand regime (P15-P24) average is now 167.4 units/period, with significantly higher variance than the P1-P14 baseline.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the demand context remains highly volatile. After a moderation in demand (Periods 20-23 averaging ~122), Period 24 saw a surge back to 271, followed by 182 in Period 25. The high-demand regime established in Period 15 continues with significantly higher variance than the initial baseline (P1-P14). The most recent 11 periods (P15-P25) have an average demand of 168.8 units. Although two orders (P15 and P24 - the latter had 0 order qty) are accounted for as either lost or empty, the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high criticality of stockouts observed in the P17-P20 window and the current high volatility, I will use a recent window (N=11) to capture the current high-demand regime's mean and variance. This ensures the OR backend uses the elevated demand profile to set a safer base stock level, protecting against the erratic spikes like the one seen in P24.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P15-P25) average confirmed at 168.8 units/period, characterized by high volatility (range: 80 to 271).

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is currently in a high-volatility regime that started around Period 15, with an average demand of approximately 169 units/period, though recent periods show significant fluctuations (e.g., 271 units in P24 vs. 60 units in P26). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' inventory of 667 units includes shipments from P23 (146), P25 (262), and P26 (259). Note: The P23 order is expected to arrive in Period 27 resolution. Current on-hand is 163. To account for the high volatility and prevent stockouts during demand spikes while managing holding costs, I am using a recent 12-period window (P15-P26) for demand forecasting (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat), which captures the current high-demand, high-variance regime. Setting L to default (4).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P15-P26) average demand confirmed at 159.8 units/period, with continued high volatility (P26 demand dropped to 60 units). Pipeline remains heavy with large orders from P25-P26.

Daily Reward (R_t): $886.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the chips(Regular) SKU is in a high-volatility regime that started at Period 15. The demand mean from Period 15 to Period 27 is approximately 165 units, but with a wide range (60 to 271). Most recently, demand spiked to 239 in Period 27 after a low of 60 in Period 26. Since Period 15, the average demand is 165.2 units, which is significantly higher (+50%) than the Period 1-14 baseline of ~110. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical conclusions. On-hand inventory is currently low (70), but the pipeline is very large (604 units), primarily due to significant orders placed in Periods 25 (262 units) and 26 (259 units) to replenish stock. These orders are expected to arrive in Periods 29 and 30. Given the high volatility and the large incoming pipeline, I will use recent_N=13 for mu_hat (covering the entire high-demand regime) and recent_N=13 for sigma_hat to capture the increased variance. This allows the OR backend to maintain a sufficient service level for potential spikes without over-ordering into an already saturated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P15-P27) mean demand confirmed at 165.2 units/period with significantly elevated variance (range 60-271).

Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, demand was 225, leading to a stockout (ending on-hand 0). The shipment from P24 (0 units ordered) was 'arrived=0' as expected. Pipeline inventory is currently 872 units, consisting of orders from P25 (262), P26 (259), P27 (83), and P28 (268). Since lead time is consistently 4 periods, the P25 order (262 units) is due during Period 29's resolution. The demand regime from P15 to P28 shows a mean of 169.7 units/period but with extreme volatility (standard deviation ~60.3). I will use the recent 14-period regime (P15-P28) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) periods of this high-variance demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P15-P28 has a mean of ~170 units/period and an elevated standard deviation of ~60 units, significantly higher than the P1-P14 baseline.

Daily Profit: $276.00, Daily Holding Cost: $193.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the order from Period 25 arrived (262 units), confirming the standard lead time of 4 periods (P25 to P29 is 4 periods). However, the order from Period 24 (which was 0 units) did not contribute to the inventory in P28, resulting in a stockout in that period. The current on-hand inventory is 193. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 705) consists of orders from P26 (259), P27 (83), P28 (268), and P29 (95). The demand regime from P15 to P29 remains highly volatile but has a significantly higher mean (avg ~174 units/period) than the initial baseline (avg ~110). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P25-P29) had demands of 182, 60, 239, 225, and 69, showing extreme swings. Given the high demand variance and the goal to balance a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=15 to capture this high-demand/high-volatility regime (P15-P29). I will stick to the 'default' lead time as 4 periods remains the stable observation.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand/high-volatility regime (P15-P29): Mean demand ~174 units/period (+58% from baseline), with standard deviation increasing significantly (~68 units). P24 had an order of 0, contributing to the P28 stockout.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 has been characterized by high volatility and a higher mean compared to the initial baseline. From Period 15 to Period 30 (16 samples), the mean demand is approximately 169.1 units/period, with a significant standard deviation (~66 units). The recent demand in Period 30 was 110, following 69 in Period 29, showing a possible return to lower levels or simply continuing the high volatility. However, to maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (80% critical ratio), I will use the last 16 periods (P15-P30) to capture this high-volatility regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 342, with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 487 units. Using 'recent_N' with N=16 for demand parameters ensures the OR backend accounts for the increased mean and variance observed since the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: High-demand/high-volatility regime (P15-P30) confirmed: mean demand ~169 units/period, standard deviation ~66 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $700.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 remains characterized by high mean (approx. 169 units/period) and high volatility (standard deviation approx. 66). Period 31 demand was high (225), which is consistent with this regime. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy (200), and there is a significant pipeline (496). The most critical factor is the confirmed loss of the Period 15 shipment, which has been factored into the pipeline inventory. Given the high volatility and current on-hand levels, I will use the recent regime (P15 onwards, N=17) for demand and standard deviation to ensure the OR backend sets a base stock that protects against stockouts during this high-variability phase while being mindful of the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to be in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that started around Period 15. Over the last 18 periods (P15-P32), the mean demand is approximately 166 units with a high standard deviation (approx 65 units). The most recent demand (P32: 119) is lower than the regime average, but variance remains the primary concern. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 349 and a healthy pipeline of 472 units (including orders from P29, P30, P31, and P32), we are well-positioned. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=18 to capture this specific holiday/high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects current market conditions while the backend OR logic manages the balance between service levels and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P15-P32) mean stabilized at ~166 units/period with persistent high volatility (StdDev ~65). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

chips(Regular): ordered=105, arrived=95 units (ordered on Period 29, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=444, demand=399, sold=399, ending on-hand inventory=45
Daily Profit: $1596.00, Daily Holding Cost: $45.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1551.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we observed a massive demand spike of 399 units, the highest in the history of the SKU. While the 'chips(Regular)' category often shows high volatility, this specifically indicates a potential new demand peak or a high-variance event within the existing regime. The mean demand for the high-demand regime (P15 onwards) has shifted from ~169 to ~176. However, to be responsive but not over-reactive to a single extreme outlier, I will use recent_N with N=19 (covering the regime from P15 to P33). This balances the earlier baseline with the recent surge. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (45) after satisfying the P33 surge, but pipeline inventory is robust (482 units), with significant arrivals expected from orders placed in P30-P33. The chosen parameters aim to maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio while accounting for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P15-P33 mean demand increased to ~176 units/period due to a record peak of 399 units in Period 33. Volatility (StdDev) has increased significantly in the last 5 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, demand was 87, and we started with 86 units on-hand, leading to a minor stockout (ending on-hand 0). The high-demand/high-volatility regime that began in Period 15 remains extremely active, highlighted by the massive demand spike of 399 in Period 33. The mean demand for the last 20 periods (P15-P34) is approximately 172 units, but volatility is very high. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the backend's target service level is 80%. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture this high-demand regime while smoothing out the extreme P33 outlier. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=20 to ensure the inventory policy accounts for the significantly increased variance observed recently. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P27-P30 in four-period intervals.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P15-P34) mean demand is 171.6 units/period with significantly elevated volatility (standard deviation ~77 units), driven by extreme spikes like P33 (399 units).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an extremely volatile regime starting Period 15, with a massive spike in Period 35 (demand=688), following a spike in Period 33 (demand=399). This has completely depleted on-hand inventory (0 units). A lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed. To recover from this massive stockout and protect against these unprecedented spikes, I am extending the demand calculation window to cover the entire high-demand regime (starting P15, N=21) to capture the increased mean and significantly higher variance. The OR backend needs to set a high base stock to handle this surge, especially with the 4-period lead time delay.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand surge detected: Period 35 demand (688) is ~4x the previous high-regime mean. Mean demand (P15-P35) is now ~196 units/period with extreme volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $671.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered an extremely high and volatile regime since Period 15. Specifically, Period 35 saw a massive spike of 688 units, which is roughly 4x the existing high-regime mean. While Period 36 moderated to 183 units, the uncertainty and potential for massive spikes require a robust inventory position. My strategy is to use the recent high-demand regime (starting Period 15) to calculate parameters, as the older baseline (P1-P14) is no longer relevant. I will set N=22 (the number of periods since the shift in P15) to capture the full breadth of this new volatility. Current on-hand is low (61) and recent stockouts in P34-P35 indicate we are under-buffered for spikes. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 22 periods will allow the OR backend to account for the mean of ~196 units/period and the significantly increased standard deviation, ensuring a higher base stock to mitigate against future 400+ unit demand events.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand spike in Period 35 (688 units) confirms a ultra-high volatility phase within the existing high-demand regime (P15 onwards). Mean demand for P15-P36 is approximately 195.8 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-166.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, demand dropped to 0, which is highly unusual given the recent extreme volatility (peak of 688 in P35, 183 in P36). Since P15, we have been in a high-demand/high-volatility regime. The mean demand from P15 to P37 is approximately 187 units/period. The extreme outlier in P35 (688) significantly skewed the statistics, but the zero demand in P37 suggests either a reporting lag, a temporary saturation, or a shift in the pattern. Given the 'chips(Regular)' category and the high volatility, I will maintain a high service level while slightly moderating the mu_hat to account for the P37 zero. I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent high-volatility behavior (P28-P37) while balancing it against the P35 spike and P37 drop. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The large in-transit inventory (1058) reflects heavy ordering from P34-P37 to recover from stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P15-P37 displays extreme volatility (range 0-688) with a mean of ~187. Period 37 recorded 0 demand after extreme highs, requiring close monitoring for a potential regime reversal or data anomaly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $485.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 remains characterized by extreme volatility and high mean. Period 35 saw an unprecedented spike (688), followed by Period 37 which recorded 0 demand, and Period 38 returning to a more typical high-regime level (192). The mean for this entire high-demand period (P15-P38) is approximately 187 units/period. However, the standard deviation is extremely high (approx 135 units) due to the outliers. I am using the method 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the behavior of this sustained high-volatility regime while smoothing out the most extreme single-period fluctuations. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy (283) and the pipeline remains significant (956), which is necessary given the potential for further 300+ unit demand spikes. Using N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend recognizes the shifted mean and the significantly increased risk from volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P15-P38 mean demand is ~187 units/period with extreme volatility (StdDev ~135). The regime is prone to radical outliers (0 to 688 range).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-16.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows extreme volatility and high mean shifts starting from Period 15. The mean demand for the high-demand regime (P15-P39) is approximately 184.8 units, but the last 5 periods (P35-P39) have experienced wild swings, including a massive spike of 688 and a drop to 0, resulting in a 5-period average of 233.4 units. To handle this ongoing volatility while acknowledging the most recent moderation (average of 148 units over the last 3 periods), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture the current high-demand context without over-reacting to the single 688 outlier or the 0 demand period. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' because the long-term standard deviation now reflects this extreme regime's uncertainty, ensuring a sufficient safety stock buffer for potential spikes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P38 and P39).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme in the high-demand regime: Period 35-39 average is 233.4, but individual values range from 0 to 688. Mean demand for the entire P15-P39 period is ~185 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41. The current state is: On-hand = 578, In-transit = 510 (ordered in P37, P38, P40). Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The demand regime from P15 onwards is characterized by extreme volatility (0 to 688) and a significantly higher mean than the initial baseline. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) is 130.8 units, while the average since the major surge began in P35 (P35-P40) is approximately 223.7 units. The cumulative average from P15 to P40 is approximately 185 units. Given the extreme outlier in P35 (688) followed by a 0 in P37, simple averages are unstable. However, the backend OR requires mu_hat and sigma_hat to represent (1+L) periods. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=26 (from P15 to P40) captures the correct regime mean (~185) and the high volatility. On-hand + In-transit (1088) is currently quite high relative to the expected 5-period demand (5 * 185 = 925), which will likely result in a small or zero order this period from the backend, helping to reduce holding costs after the large arrivals in P39 and P40.

Carry-over insight: Sustained extreme volatility regime (P15-P40): Mean demand ~185 units/period with standard deviation ~130. Range remains erratic (0 to 688). Inventory position is currently high (1088 units total) following the recovery from the P35 stockout.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history continues to show extreme volatility within the high-demand regime established since Period 15. Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand has been 0, 192, 104, 175, and 90, showing a significant cooling from the extreme spike in Periord 35 (688), yet remaining unpredictable (Mean P37-P41: 112.2). However, looking at the broader high-demand regime (P15-P41), the mean is approximately 181 units with a very high standard deviation (~125). We are currently in a high inventory position (On-hand: 663) following the arrival of large orders placed during the P35-P36 demand surge. Total pipeline (663 + 403 = 1066) covers approximately 5.8 periods of the long-term high-regime mean (181) or nearly 9.5 periods of the most recent 5-period average (112). To prevent excessive holding costs while the backend manages the high variance, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current high-volatility regime while allowing the moderation in the last few periods to slightly influence the mean. Lead time L is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme but the immediate 5-period average (P37-P41) has moderated to ~112 units/period compared to the P15-P40 average of ~185.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, though the most recent 5-period average (P38-P42) has moderated significantly to 110.4 units/period, compared to the broader P15-P42 average of ~180. The inventory position is currently very high (On-hand: 804, In-transit: 325, Total: 1129) due to large orders placed during the P35-P36 super-spike arriving now. With demand showing signs of cooling (last 5 periods: 192, 104, 175, 90, 66), I will reduce \u03bc\u0302 by using a more recent sample window (N=10) to prevent further inflating the surplus while maintaining a high \u03c3\u0302 to account for the persistent risk of another extreme spike. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderation observed: Period 38-42 average demand fell to 110.4 units/period, back toward the original baseline, despite the extreme volatility seen in P33-P35.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we are managing chips(Regular). The historical demand exhibits extreme volatility, particularly visible from Period 33 onwards (ranging from 0 to 688). However, the most recent 6 periods (P38-P43) show a moderation in demand with a mean of ~150 units, compared to the P15-P40 average of ~185. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P40-P43) have a mean of 170.75 units. The Period 15 missing shipment remains a historical fact, and Period 39 had a 0 order, which is why 'arrived=0' was expected in Period 43. Current inventory is healthy: On-hand (452) + In-transit (570) = 1022. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.8. Since demand recently moderated but remains highly volatile, I will use a 10-period window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while accounting for the recent moderation compared to the P35 peak. This balances the risk of stockout against holding costs in an unpredictable environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remained high in P43 (352 units) after four periods of moderation (~110 units). The P38-P43 6-period average is 168 units, suggesting the regime is centering closer to 170 than the extreme peaks of P35/P36, though the range (66-352) remains wide.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility and high mean levels relative to the start of the game. Period 43 and 44 demand were 352 and 349 respectively, which is significantly higher than the 66-90 seen in Periods 41-42. This confirms that the average demand remains high, though highly erratic. The 6st 7 periods (P38-P44) have an average demand of 179 units/period, which aligns closely with the overall high-regime mean established since P15. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 7 to capture this current stabilization around 180 units while acknowledging the high variance. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P40 order arrived in P44). The current on-hand (231) and pipeline (762) provide a reasonable buffer, but given the potential for spikes up to 600+ units, I will keep sigma_hat explicit and high to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts like the one in P35.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme with significant spikes (e.g., P43-44 demand ~350). The average demand for the most recent 7 periods (P38-P44) is 179.1 units/period, confirming the high-demand regime continues despite occasional lulls.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 57 with 759 units in pipeline. Demand remains in a high-volatility, high-mean regime that started around Period 15, with recent periods (P43-45) showing sustained high demand (~314 units/period). The shipment from P39 (ordered 0) arrived as expected in P44, and P43's missing arrival in the conclude message confirms a likely lost shipment or delay, though the next large arrivals are due starting in P46-P47. To handle the extreme volatility and recent spikes, I am using an explicit mu_hat based on the recent elevated average (approx 180 units/period * 5 periods = 900) and an explicit sigma_hat set to 180 to account for the high variance (range 0 to 688). This ensures the base stock is sufficiently high to prevent stockouts during the final periods while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive over-ordering if demand dips again.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: High-demand regime (P15-P45) mean is ~178 units/period. Recent 3-period average (P43-P45) increased to 314 units, indicating another potential upward volatility spike within the regime. Pipeline remains heavily loaded to meet these spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $699.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 15-46 is characterized by extreme volatility (std dev ~125) and a mean of approximately 180 units/period. Period 46 on-hand inventory is very low (9 units) with a lead time of 4 periods, meaning we are heavily dependent on the pipeline (866 units) to satisfy demand for the next 4 periods. The immediate demand over the last 4 periods (P43-P46) has been consistently high (352, 349, 242, 177), averaging 280 units/period, which is higher than the long-term regime average. To prevent stockouts during this high-volatility phase, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=32 (P15 onwards) to capture the high-demand regime mean (approx 180) and using an 'explicit' sigma_hat of 125 to account for the frequent large spikes (up to 688). This parameter set ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the elevated mean and significantly increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P15-P46) mean demand approx 180 units/period with extreme volatility (Standard Deviation approx 125; range 0-688).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-254.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility within a high-demand regime that began at P15. The recent demand history shows erratic behavior, including a 352-unit spike in P43, 349 in P44, and 242 in P45, followed by a 0-demand observation in P47. The mean demand for the high-volatility regime (P15-P47) is approximately 180 units/period, with a very high standard deviation (~125) due to outliers like P35 (688) and P47 (0). On-hand inventory is 254 units, and the pipeline is 790 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the critical fractile is 0.8, which justifies maintaining a high safety stock to buffer against the frequent and large demand spikes characteristic of this regime. I will use a recent_N of 33 (covering the period from P15 to P47) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while ignoring the early lower-demand baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $166.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are nearing the end of the simulation (Period 50). The 'chips(Regular)' SKU remains in a high-volatility regime that started around Period 15, with demand mean settling approximately at 180 units/period (recent 34-period average is 181). Period 47 saw 0 demand while Period 48 saw 148, confirming that the high-variance nature persists. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (426) plus in-transit (582) totals 1,008 units. We choose the 'recent_N' method for lead time to reflect the consistently observed 4-period arrival window. For 'mu_hat', we use 'recent_N' with N=34 to cover the entire high-demand/high-volatility regime that began at Period 15, which provides a more robust mean estimate (approx 181 units/period) than the global average. For 'sigma_hat', we also use 'recent_N' for N=34 to capture the significantly elevated standard deviation observed during this specific regime. This configuration allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand over (L+1) periods while accounting for the significant volatility risk, ensuring we minimize stockouts while managing holding costs for the final periods.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are managing a high-demand, high-volatility regime that began around Period 15. The recent demand history shows continued erratic behavior, with Period 49 demand at 338 units, significantly higher than the previous period's 148, but lower than historical peaks. The average demand for the most recent 10-period window (P40-P49) is approximately 194 units, which aligns well with the long-term high-regime mean of ~185-190 units identified in earlier carry-over insights. Volatility remains extreme, with a standard deviation across the high-demand regime (P15 onwards) of approximately 125-130 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 153 units on-hand and 656 in-transit, the pipeline is moderately healthy, but must be maintained to buffer against recurring spikes (like the 338 in P49 or 352 in P43). I will use recent_N with N=35 to capture the full breadth of the high-volatility regime spanning from Period 15 to the present for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the extreme variance while keeping L at the confirmed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P15-P49) mean demand is ~181 units/period with extreme volatility (StdDev ~127, range 0-688). Recent 10-period demand (P40-P49) confirms this with an average of 194.1 units/period.
