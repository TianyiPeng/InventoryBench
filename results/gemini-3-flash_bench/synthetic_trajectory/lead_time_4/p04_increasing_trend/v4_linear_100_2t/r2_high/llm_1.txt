  "rationale": "This is Period 1. Based on the historical demand provided (75, 90, 0, 170, 127), the average demand is approximately 92.4 units per period with significant variance. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution) and be visible at the start of Period 6. To cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), I need to account for approximately 462 units (92.4 * 5). Since on-hand and in-transit are currently 0, I will place an initial order to build the pipeline. Given the high variance (one period had 0 demand, another had 170), I will target a slightly safer inventory position of 500 units to avoid stockouts during the long lead time, especially since the profit margin ($19) is much higher than the holding cost ($1).",

With an estimated 5-period demand window (L+1) needing coverage, and using a conservative average of 180 units/period, we need ~900 units. Given the high on-hand inventory (706) and the relatively high holding cost ($1.00 vs $19 profit), we should maintain a steady but smaller inflow to avoid excessive inventory while protecting against demand spikes. I will order 50 units to keep the pipeline moving without significantly inflating the already ample on-hand stock.",

  "rationale": "We are at Period 45 out of 50. The promised and actual lead time is 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the game (45, 46, 47, 48, 49), any order placed in Period 46 or later will not arrive before the game ends (P46 order arrives P50 arrival phase, visible P51; P45 order arrives P49 arrival phase, visible P50). Therefore, Period 45 is the final period where an order can realistically impact sales before the conclusion of the game. Current on-hand inventory is 411 units. In-transit inventory consists of: P41 (300 units, due P45), P42 (150 units, due P46), P43 (200 units, due P47), and P44 (300 units, due P48). Total pipeline (On-hand + In-transit) is 1361 units. Recent demand (P36-P44) has averaged ~182 units. Total expected demand for the remaining 6 demand resolution phases (P45-P50) is approximately 1092 units (182 * 6). Our current pipeline of 1361 units already covers this expected demand with a buffer of ~269 units. Given the $1.00 holding cost and the high probability that additional orders will arrive too late or simply increase ending inventory, I will place a zero order to maximize final profit and minimize trailing holding costs.",

The inventory pipeline is as follows: Period 46 on-hand (419), plus expected arrivals in Period 47 (150 units from P42), Period 48 (200 units from P43), Period 49 (300 units from P44), and Period 50 (0 units from P45). Total cumulative inventory available to satisfy demand for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50) is 1069 units (419 + 150 + 200 + 300). The current demand regime (Periods 33-45) averages approximately 190 units per period. Total expected demand for 5 periods is ~950 units. However, volatility is high, with demand frequently exceeding 300 units. To minimize the risk of stockouts in the final period while avoiding excessive holding costs on the very last day, I will place a final safety order. Ordering 100 units brings the total pipeline to 1169, which comfortably covers 5 periods of average demand plus a safety margin for one high-demand spike. Orders after this period will not arrive before the game ends.",

Because the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as noted in multiple Carry-Over Insights), any order placed in Period 47 will arrive in the arrival resolution phase of Period 51 (47 + 4). Since the game concludes at the end of Period 50, an order placed now or in any subsequent period will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence profit within the game's horizon. Our current on-hand inventory is 547 units. The existing in-transit pipeline of 600 units is scheduled to arrive as follows: Period 47 (ordered P43: 200 units), Period 48 (ordered P44: 300 units), Period 49 (ordered P45: 0 units), and Period 50 (ordered P46: 100 units). Total available inventory for the remaining 4 periods (P47-P50) is 1,147 units (547 on-hand + 600 in-transit). Given the average demand in this high-volatility regime is ~210-230 units, our 1,147 units are more than sufficient to cover the expected total remaining demand (roughly 800-900 units). Ordering more would only increase holding costs without any potential for additional sales.",

Therefore, we must rely solely on existing on-hand inventory and the current in-transit pipeline. Current status for 'chips(Regular)': On-hand: 747 units. In-transit: 400 units (300 units from P44 arriving in P48, 0 from P45, 100 units from P46 arriving in P50). Historical demand is highly volatile, shifting from a ~100 mean to an elevated regime where peaks reach ~400-500. However, even using a high-end buffer, 747 units on-hand is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 3 periods of demand (P48, P49, P50).

Our current on-hand inventory is 749 units. Historical demand in this high-volatility regime averages ~220 units per period. Even with a potential extreme spike (previous max was 509), our current stock of 749 units is more than sufficient to cover the demand for the final two periods (49 and 50).
