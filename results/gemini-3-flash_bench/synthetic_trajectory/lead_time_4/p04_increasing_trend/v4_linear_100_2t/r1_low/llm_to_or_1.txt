Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The Promised Lead Time (L) is 4. Since there is no historical data yet and on-hand inventory is 0, we must initialize the pipeline. Historical samples provided (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) yield a mean of 92.4. Following a base-stock policy where we need to cover demand for (L+1) periods, the mu_hat should reflect the forecast for 5 periods. Using the mean of the 5 historical samples provided: 92.4 * (1+4) = 462. Given the inventory is starting at zero, the OR backend will use these parameters to generate the initial order to establish the pipeline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 197 units based on initial setup. As expected with a promised lead time of 4 periods, nothing arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0). Demand in Period 1 was 79 units, but since our on-hand inventory was 0, we sold 0 units. We currently have 0 on-hand and 197 in-transit. Based on the historical demand samples (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) and the first game period (79), there isn't a clear shift yet. I will use the default methods for lead time and sigma, but use recent_N for mu_hat to weigh the most recent information (including the game period) more appropriately. The OR engine will aim for a base stock level that covers (L+1) periods of demand, which is 5 periods here.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. Orders were placed in Period 1 (197 units) and Period 2 (187 units), totaling 384 units in-transit. None have arrived yet, which is expected as the earliest arrival (Period 1 order) would be in Period 5 (P1 + 4 = P5). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales because demand (79 in P1, 114 in P2) could not be met. Historical demand samples provided (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) show significant variance (mean ~92, std ~63). However, the game history for P1 and P2 shows actual demand of 79 and 114. Given the short history and the promised lead time of 4, I will use 'default' for L and sigma_hat. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the provided sample mean of 92.4, adjusted for the (1+L) factor by the OR engine. The OR engine will target a base stock level that accounts for the lead time plus current period (5 periods total).

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 haven't arrived yet (expected arrival is during Period 5's Arrival Resolution phase, becoming visible in P5's conclude message read at P6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we have sustained 100% stockouts for 3 periods (sold=0). This suggests demand is significantly higher than initial estimates, or at least that we need to build a larger pipeline. Demand has been increasing: 79, 114, 164. Mean demand over the first 3 periods is ~119. However, the external Historical Demand Data provided in the prompt (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) differs slightly from the Game History. Assuming the Game History data (79, 114, 164) is the ground truth for this specific run, the average is increasing. Since we are in the early stages and have 490 units in transit (197+187+106), we are still waiting for a lead time cycle to complete. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent upward trend in demand while the pipeline clears, minimizing further stockout risks once inventory arrives.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (197 units) are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5. Since we are currently in the decision phase of Period 5, these units are not yet on-hand but remain in-transit. Therefore, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced 100% stockouts for Periods 1-4. Historical demand samples are [75, 90, 0, 170, 127] (provided in context) while the game history shows slightly different realized demand [79, 114, 164, 87]. Averaging the realized demand gives ~111 units/period. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Existing in-transit is 595 units, which covers approximately 5.3 periods of demand at the current average. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the realized demand mean while we wait for the first delivery to confirm lead time reliability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 79, 114, 164, 87, and 122 (average \u2248 113). The lead time for the first order was exactly the promised 4 periods (ordered P1, arrived P5). We currently have 75 units on-hand and 398 in-transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4). Since the lead time is 4, we expect the P2 order (187 units) to arrive during Period 6. The current in-transit amount is high relative to the mean demand (approx 3.5 periods of demand), but we must ensure we cover the (L+1) window. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the first data point confirms the promised lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all 5 available samples (default) as there is no clear regime shift yet, just natural variance around the mean of 113.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Current inventory is 135 units on-hand and 252 units in-transit (orders from Periods 3, 4, and 6). Promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data from Period 5 (P1 order) and Period 6 (P2 order) confirms that the actual lead time is indeed 4 periods. Since L=4, my decision needs to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Historical demand samples: 75, 90, 0, 170, 127 (from setup) and the concluded demand from history: 79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127. Total observed demand points: [75, 90, 0, 170, 127, 79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127]. The average of these 11 samples is ~105. Since demand appears relatively stable with moderate variance, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent local demand trend (average ~115) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using L=default reflects the confirmed promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-83.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have enough history to evaluate demand and lead time. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (confirmed by arrivals for orders placed in P1, P2, and P3). Demand has fluctuated between 79 and 164 over the first 7 periods. Taking the mean of all 7 demand samples (79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127, 79) gives 110.29. Since there is no clear trend or seasonal calendar date provided, I will use the full sample history. For mu_hat, the backend calculates (1+L)*mean; with L=4, this covers 5 periods of demand (approx 551). For sigma_hat, the standard deviation of the samples is 29.8, so sqrt(5)*29.8 is approx 66.6. Using 'default' methods for mu and sigma allows the backend to utilize all available data points for its statistical calculations, which is appropriate given the relatively stable but noisy demand pattern. On-hand (162) and In-transit (312) total 474 units, which is slightly below the 5-period expected demand, so a modest order is expected from the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-47.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Looking at historical arrivals, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). This matches the promised lead time. The demand samples [79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127, 79, 110] show some variability but no distinct regime shift or strong seasonality yet. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, aiming for the median demand. With 157 units on hand and 248 in transit (orders from P6, P7, P8 and potentially P5 if one was placed), we have a total pipeline of 405. I will use the last 5 periods (P4-P8) to calculate the mean demand (approx 110) to reflect the most recent average. L=4, so (1+L)=5. mu_hat = 5 * 110 = 550. sigma_hat will be estimated using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a steady demand pattern for chips(Regular). Historically, demand has ranged from 75 to 170 (including pre-game samples), with an average around 106 units per period. The lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods based on the arrivals from P1-P4. The 'arrived=0' in Period 9 is consistent with this lead time, as no order was placed in Period 5. Currently, we have 73 units on-hand and 368 units in-transit (from P6, P7, P8, and P9). The OR engine needs to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock will target the median demand. I am using recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stable behavior since arrivals began in Period 5 (avg demand P5-P9 is ~104.4), and recent_N=5 for volatility (sigma_hat) to reflect the current variance.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is low (10 units). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical concludes (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10). Note that P5 had an order of 0, which correctly resulted in no arrival in P9. Historical demand (excluding P1-P5 which had stockouts) for P5-P10 averages approximately 104 units per period (122, 127, 79, 110, 84, 104). The standard deviation is relatively stable. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this realistic demand period without the influence of the initial zero-sales period (where stock was unavailable). With L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. The OR backend will calculate this automatically using the recent_N method.

Calculating the mean across all available samples (excluding the initialization noise/outliers if any, though here samples are fairly consistent: 79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127, 79, 110, 84, 104, 120), the average demand is approximately 108 units per period. The lead time has consistently been confirmed at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11). Note that Period 5 had an order of 0, explaining why no arrival was recorded in Period 9. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 346, which includes orders from Period 8 (41), Period 9 (120), Period 10 (81), and Period 11 (104). These are expected to arrive in periods 12, 13, 14, and 15 respectively. The current on-hand inventory is 56. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the target service level q = 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand over (L+1) periods. I will use 'calculate' for L to utilize the observed stability and 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the most recent post-startup demand stability (Periods 5-11 avg is ~106).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met, as seen in the arrivals for orders from periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. Note: Period 5 had an order of 0, which explains the zero arrival in Period 9. The demand for chips(Regular) appears stable, fluctuating around a mean of 107 units per period across the historical samples and game history. Specifically, the last 8 periods (since we started seeing inventory movement) show an average demand of approximately 106 units with moderate variance. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 436 units in transit. The oldest orders pending (from Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12) are expected to arrive in Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16 respectively. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's critical ratio q = 0.5, meaning it targets the median demand. Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat captures the current stable demand regime while filtering out the initial noise. Lead time L=4 is confirmed.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14. Historical demand analysis (P1-P13) shows a stable demand regime with a mean of approximately 104 units and a standard deviation of about 25. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on 'Period conclude' messages (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P13). There is one notable gap: the order from Period 5 (where 0 units were ordered) naturally resulted in no arrival at Period 9, which is consistent with L=4. Currently, we have 47 units on-hand and 404 units in the pipeline (orders from P10, P11, P12, and P13 are still in transit). Since the demand and lead time are stable, I will use the last 10 samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent variance while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) shows a recent decrease, with the last period's demand (46) being significantly lower than the historical average (~100). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on several delivery cycles (P1->P5, P2->P6, up to P10->P14). There are no missing shipments as the order from P9 arrived in P13 and P10 arrived in P14. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand to minimize total costs. I will use a recent_N window (N=5) for mu_hat to account for the potential downshift in demand (avg of P10-P14 is approx 88) and sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. L is set to calculate as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 16. The demand history shows a mean demand of approximately 104 units per period (excluding periods with zero sales due to stockouts). Recent demand has fluctuated but remains around this level. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (Periods 5-8 and 10-15) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. The order from Period 5 is noticeably missing from the 'conclude' messages (no arrival reported in Period 9), suggesting a lost shipment for the order placed in Period 5. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) of 270 units covers orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15 (131+88+51+0 = 270). The on-hand inventory is 51. I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand to capture the current regime more accurately, as earlier periods were impacted by stockouts and initial setup. L will be set to default (4). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 10 samples to balance responsiveness and stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $182.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand shows a potential upward shift in Period 16 (183 units), compared to the recent average around 100. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, although a shipment of 88 units placed in Period 13 is expected to arrive during the current Period 17 (lead time 4). However, with demand potentially increasing, the current in-transit pipeline (282) needs to be managed carefully to avoid stockouts. The confirmed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the recent stable demand while partially accounting for the Period 16 spike. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat as well to reflect the recent volatility. The L parameter remains at 'default' (4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand is showing a significant upward trend. Period 16 demand was 183 and Period 17 demand was 212, which is well above the earlier average of ~100. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and lost sales in the last two periods. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With In-transit at 360 units, we need to account for the increasing demand trend to prevent further stockouts. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike in demand and volatility, while keeping L at the confirmed value of 4 via the calculate method.

Carry-over insight: Significant positive demand shift detected starting Period 16 (P16: 183, P17: 212), moving the average from ~100 to ~200.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand: P16=183, P17=212, and P18=220. This indicates a new mean of approximately 205 units per period, compared to the earlier baseline of ~100. Despite a promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4), we are currently facing a stockout (On-hand: 0) because recent orders arriving (P12, P13, P14 orders) were based on previous lower demand levels. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 18 (P14 order arrived). To capture the new demand regime without overreacting to individual spikes, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=3 (P16-P18). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to account for the increased volatility in this higher demand state. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 further confirmed: Period 18 demand of 220 sustains the new average of ~205 units/period.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant upward shift starting at Period 16. In the last four completed periods (P16-P19), demand figures were 183, 212, 220, and 166, averaging approximately 195 units per period. This is nearly double the previous average of ~100. Consequently, on-hand inventory has been depleted to zero, and we've experienced stockouts. Although on-hand inventory is currently 0, there are 793 units in-transit, which includes large orders placed in P16, P17, P18, and P19. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the P15 order was 0, it is expected that Period 19 had 0 arrivals, which is confirmed in the history. The P16 order (143 units) is expected to arrive in Period 20. To ensure the OR backend captures this new high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4, covering the data from Period 16 through Period 19. This will increase the base stock level to match the new demand mean (~195) and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $143.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. In the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 186.2 units/period (183, 212, 220, 166, 150), compared to the earlier average of ~100. Despite a slight dip in the most recent two periods, current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing stockouts. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate (confirmed by P20 arrival which was ordered in P16). To account for the new higher demand regime while smoothing recent volatility, I will use a recent_N window of 5 periods for mu_hat. This will provide a forecast covering the lead time + review period (1+4=5 periods) at the higher mean. sigma_hat will also use a recent_N window of 5 to capture the increased variance seen in this new regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a sufficient service level given the equal cost of holding and stockouts (Profit=1, Holding=1 implies a 50% service level target, which the OR engine will adjust).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 22. Historical lead time is consistently 4 periods. A significant demand shift occurred around Period 16, with demand increasing from ~100 to ~200 units. However, recent periods (20 and 21) have shown a slight cooling (150 and 100), suggesting the peak may be stabilizing or retreating. The mean since the shift (Period 16 onwards) is 155.1 units per period ((183+212+220+166+150+100)/6). Given the critical shortage from P16-P20, we need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat to capture this higher regime while accounting for the recent deceleration. sigma_hat will also use N=6 to reflect the high volatility seen during the shift. Lead time (L) remains at the confirmed 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we are managing a demand regime that shifted upward around Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand (P16-P22): 183, 212, 220, 166, 150, 100, 158. The average of these last 7 periods is 169.8, significantly higher than the initial average of ~100. However, demand in the last 3 periods (P20-P22) has softened slightly (avg 136). The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 548) is composed of orders from P19 (238), P20 (184), P21 (97), and P22 (29). The order from P19 is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 23. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand regime while accounting for the recent slight softening, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=7 to capture the data since the regime shift. Lead time (L) remains at the default/promised 4.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 24. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 16, with demand increasing from an average of ~100 to over 200 units/period (P16: 183, P17: 212, P18: 220). However, the most recent four periods (P20-P23) show a cooling trend with demand values of 150, 100, 158, and 80 (avg ~122). This suggests the peak was either temporary or is highly volatile. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed behavior. I will set the demand forecast using a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 (covering the high-demand burst and the recent cooling) to stabilize the mean. With On-hand inventory at 312 and In-transit at 458, the total pipeline is 770. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for a base stock at the median. Given the recent volatility and the risk of overstocking if demand continues to drop, using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the model to adjust to the current regime (averaging the spike and the recent dip) without overreacting to the single low point of 80.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 peaked at ~200 units but has moderated to ~122 units over the last 4 periods (P20-P23), indicating high volatility or a temporary surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of extreme volatility. After a surge peaking at ~200+ units, demand moderated to ~122 units (P20-P23), but then spiked sharply to 271 in P24. The average demand since the P16 shift (P16-P24) is approximately 171 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current pipeline inventory is healthy (298 in-transit + 225 on-hand), but the high volatility suggests we need to maintain a robust base stock. I will use a recent_N of 9 for demand estimation to capture the entire 'high-demand' regime since Period 16, which provides a mean of ~171. This balanced approach helps protect against future spikes like Period 24 without over-ordering based solely on a single outlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 20; Period 24 spike (271) suggests the high-demand regime is not yet stable at a lower mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 16. After an initial surge to ~200 units, demand fluctuated between 80 and 271 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P21-P25) have seen demands of 100, 158, 80, 271, and 182. The average demand over these 5 periods is 158.2 units, which is a better representation of the current 'high-volatility/high-mean' state than the long-term average. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (arrived consistently). Based on the profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend will calculate using the provided parameters. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility and the higher average demand levels while ensuring we have enough stock to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extremely high: Period 24 demand was 271 followed by 182 in Period 25. The demand regime from P21-P25 averages 158 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-49.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows extreme volatility since Period 20, with demand spikes (271 in P24, 182 in P25) mixed with significant drops (80 in P23, 60 in P26). The carry-over insights correctly identified a regime shift at P16, but the mean since P21 (including the drop at P26) is approximately 142 units per period (100, 158, 80, 271, 182, 60). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 109 units, but the pipeline is high (622 units) due to large orders placed between P23 and P26. Given the high volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the demand environment since the regime shift stabilized into high variance (P20-P26). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the high standard deviation observed recently while recognizing the pipeline already covers roughly 4-5 periods of demand at the average 142-150 range.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme; the mean demand from P21-P26 is ~142 units, but includes swings from 60 to 271. Previous regime shift (P16-P19) has transitioned into a high-variance state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $221.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, swinging from a low of 60 to a high of 239 in the most recent periods. Since Period 16, we've transitioned from a stable regime (~100 units) to a high-demand, high-variance regime. The average demand over the last 12 periods (P16-P27) is approximately 168.5 units, which is significantly higher than the early game. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0), aiming to stock the mean demand over the protection interval. Period 27 ending on-hand inventory is very low (18 units), but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline of 474 units (orders from P24-P26: 24, 269, 181). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To capture the current high-variance state while accounting for the recent range of demand, I will use recent_N with N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This covers the entire period since the major regime shift in Period 16 and provides a robust estimate of the current mean and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the dominant factor; the mean since the P16 shift is ~168 units but includes extreme fluctuations (60-271).

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a transition into an extremely high-variance regime since Period 16. The demand has fluctuated between 60 and 271, with the most recent sample at Period 28 being 225. Because we are currently stocked out (on-hand 0) and the inventory backend must account for the current period's demand (which occurs after our decision) plus the lead time (4 periods), we need to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock effectively (1+L) * mean. While the mean since Period 16 is ~175, the extreme volatility (especially peaks over 200) suggests using a slightly shorter window (recent_N=13) to capture this higher-demand/high-volatility regime. L remains stable at 4 periods. mu_hat will use recent_N=13 to cover the period since the demand shift. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=13 to account for the heightened volatility observed in this timeframe.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme since Period 16: range [60, 271], mean ~175. Standard deviation has increased significantly compared to P1-P15.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 16 has been characterized by extreme volatility (range 60 to 271) despite a higher overall mean compared to Periods 1-15. The average demand since Period 16 is approximately 177 units per period. I will use recent_N with N=14 (the length of this high-variance regime) to capture this updated mean and variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by recent conclusions. By using N=14, the OR backend can better estimate the high sigma_hat required to buffer against the seen 200+ unit demand spikes while acknowledging the higher base demand level. Currently, there is a large in-transit pipeline (595 units), which reflects the aggressive ordering in response to recent stockouts. Setting the parameters based on the recent regime will help the OR backend determine if the current pipeline is sufficient to reach the target base stock without over-ordering further into a high holding cost situation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-161.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 16. While the earlier periods (P1-P15) averaged ~100 units, the more recent window (P16-P30) shows a mean of approximately 166 units but with extreme variance (ranging from 60 to 271). In the last 5 periods (P26-P30), demand has been 60, 239, 225, 69, and 110, averaging 140.6 units. Given the high volatility but a clear step up from the initial 100-unit baseline, I will use a window of the last 15 periods (since the regime shift) to capture the current mean and significantly higher standard deviation. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 271, and in-transit is 446, totaling 717. My parameters aim to ensure coverage for (L+1)=5 periods of demand, which at a mean of ~166 would be ~830 units; thus, the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order to account for the high variance and prevent stockouts seen in Periods 27/28.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility since the regime shift around Period 16. Recent demand values (P27-P31: 239, 225, 69, 110, 225) illustrate high-magnitude swings, with a mean over the last 5 periods of 173.6 units. This is significantly higher than the pre-P16 average of ~100. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. To prevent stockouts during demand peaks while managing holding costs during troughs, I will use a 16-period window (N=16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-variance behavior of the current regime that began at Period 16. This provides the OR backend with an accurate picture of the increased mean and the significant volatility (standard deviation) recently observed.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, a pattern established since the regime shift in Period 16. Recent demands are 225, 110, 69, 225, 119. The mean since P16 is approximately 166 units, but with a wide range and significant fluctuations. Currently, we have an on-hand inventory of 201 units and a high in-transit pipeline of 509 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by the Period 28 order arriving in Period 32). To manage the high volatility while accounting for the significant pipeline, I will use a recent_N window for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current high-variance regime. I've chosen N=17 to cover the entire period since the major shift at P16, providing a stable but responsive estimate of the current high-demand, high-variance environment. This will help the OR backend set a base stock level that balances the risk of stockouts during peaks with the holding costs of the current inventory levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $341.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an extremely high volatility phase. Period 33 recorded a record high demand of 399, causing a complete stockout (ending inventory 0). The mean demand since the regime shift at Period 16 is approximately 172 units, but recent periods (P27-P33) show massive swings (from 69 to 399). Given that Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. However, the high cost of stockouts (lost profit and lost signal) in this volatile environment suggests using a slightly more responsive average. I will use recent_N with N=18 (covering the period since the shift at P16) to capture the current mean and variance. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. In-transit inventory is 474, which roughly covers 2.7 periods of the current average demand (172), but given the stockout and the recent peak, the OR engine needs adjusted parameters to rebuild the safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility reached a new peak in Period 33 (399 units), confirming that the high-demand regime starting at P16 is characterized by extreme variance rather than a stable mean. Previous mean estimate of ~170 remains valid but standard deviation has likely expanded.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility within the high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Recent demands (P31-P34: 225, 119, 399, 87) highlight this instability, with a massive spike in P33 and a subsequent drop in P34. The current inventory is 0 on-hand, and although there is a significant in-transit pipeline (756 units), the high variance makes stockouts a substantial risk. I am setting L to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been consistently observed. For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=19 (from Period 16 to 34) to capture the average of the current high-volatility regime, which is approximately 177 units per period. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to prioritize the most recent extreme fluctuations (including the 399 unit spike) to ensure the OR backend increases the safety stock to handle these unpredictable swings. This approach balances the need to satisfy high peak demand while acknowledging the current stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified further in Period 33 (399 units), confirming the regime from P16 onwards is defined by extreme variance (range 60-399) rather than a stable mean. The average demand for this regime (P16-P34) is approximately 177 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a state of extreme hyper-volatility beginning around Period 33. The latest observation in Period 35 shows a massive demand spike of 688 units, which follows a Period 33 spike of 399 units. This suggests a potential mega-seasonal event or a major regime shift that far exceeds the previous high-demand regime (avg ~175). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts since Period 33 due to these extreme spikes. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level by default. However, to account for the massive increase in both mean and variance without over-committing to a single outlier, I will use a recent_N window of 20 periods (covering the high-demand era since Period 16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent extreme spikes with the slightly more moderate (but still high) demand of the last 20 periods, preventing the inventory from trailing too far behind these massive shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand entered a hyper-volatile state at Period 33 (399 units) and intensified at Period 35 (688 units), suggesting a transition from the previously observed high-demand regime (avg ~175) to an even higher, potentially seasonal, peak.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a hyper-volatile state, likely a seasonal peak. Recent demand samples show an extreme range (P33: 399, P34: 87, P35: 688, P36: 183). The average of these last 4 periods is 339 units. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high mismatch between profit and holding cost (equal at $1.0), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. However, to prevent stockouts during this extreme surge, I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the recent average of 339 units across the (L+1)=5 period window (5 * 339 = 1695). I will also use an explicit sigma_hat to reflect the intensified volatility (standard deviation of the last 4 samples is ~275, and sqrt(5) * 275 \u2248 615). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high-demand regime while recognizing the significant risk of overstocking if demand drops suddenly.

Carry-over insight: Demand entered a hyper-volatile state at Period 33 (399) and intensified at Period 35 (688), with the last 4 periods (P33-P36) averaging 339 units/period, significantly higher than the previous 175 average.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a hyper-volatile state, potentially indicative of a seasonal peak or promotional period. The demand in Period 35 reached 688, and the average over the last four active demand periods (P33-P36) is approximately 339 units. Although Period 37 reported 0 demand, this is likely an outlier given the recent 688 and 183 figures. I am shifting to an 'explicit' L of 4 (as confirmed by recent arrivals like P33 arriving at P37). For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P33-P37) to capture this new hyper-volatile regime while accounting for the recent zero. This provides a (1+L) * mean forecast. For volatility, I am using 'explicit' to significantly increase sigma_hat to 350 to account for the massive swings (0 to 688) seen recently, ensuring the OR backend maintains a high enough service level to avoid the frequent stockouts observed in periods 33-35.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has entered a critical phase: following the 688 spike in P35, demand dropped to 183 in P36 and then 0 in P37. This suggests either an extremely 'lumpy' demand pattern or the end of a very sharp peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-97.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a state of extreme volatility. After a significant peak (688 in P35), demand dropped to 0 (P37) and then rebounded to 192 (P38). The Carry-Over Insights suggest a hyper-volatile regime starting Period 33, with the last 6 periods showing values of 399, 87, 688, 183, 0, and 192 (Average ~258). However, looking at the broader high-demand window from Period 16 to Period 38, the average is roughly 185. Given that demand can swing from 0 to nearly 700, a high sigma is necessary. I will use recent_N with N=23 to capture the entire 'high growth/high volatility' regime since Period 16, which provides a more robust estimate than focusing solely on the erratic spikes from Period 33 onwards. The pipeline inventory is very high (1114 units), so the OR backend will naturally scale back orders unless \u03bc\u0302 is set very high. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains critical: Period 38 demand returned to 192 after a Period 37 zero-demand observation. The average demand since the Period 16 regime shift is approximately 185 units/period with extremely high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-182.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows extreme volatility: P33-P39 values are [399, 87, 688, 183, 0, 192, 104]. This includes massive spikes and zero-demand periods, suggesting a hyper-volatile regime. The average demand since P16 is approximately 185, but the last 7 periods (P33-P39) average ~236. Given the extremely high holding cost relative to the profit ($1 profit, $1 holding cost), the OR engine's critical fractile (q = 0.5) will naturally favor lower stock levels to minimize shelf costs if the demand distribution is symmetric. However, because demand is 'lumpy', I will use the mean since the P33 jump (N=7) to capture this higher activity level while respecting the current downward trend from the 688 peak. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. In-transit is currently very high (1013), and on-hand is healthy (286), so the OR backend will likely order 0 to avoid excessive holding costs until the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains hyper-extreme since P33; the regime P33-P39 averages 236 units/period with swings from 0 to 688. Inventory levels are high relative to the most recent demand samples.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, especially starting from Period 33. The regime since Period 33 (P33-P40) averages 221 units/period, but with a massive range (0 to 688). Period 40 demand was 175. The current on-hand inventory (332) plus a very large pipeline (792, primarily from the P37 order of 792 which is due in Period 41 conclude/Period 42 start) puts the total inventory position at 1124. This is extremely high compared to the cycle-average demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (L=4). Given the massive 792-unit order arriving next period, the focus is on preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for the high variance. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the start of the hyper-volatile period P33) to capture the current mean and high standard deviation, which will lead the OR backend to restrict further ordering due to the high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-volatile demand regime confirmed starting Period 33: Mean ~221, Range [0, 688].

Daily Reward (R_t): $-944.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a hyper-volatile state since Period 33, characterized by extreme swings including a peak of 688 and recent lows of 0, 192, 104, 175, and 90. The average demand since Period 33 is approximately 207 units/period, but the current on-hand inventory is very high (1034 units) due to the large order from Period 37 (792 units) arriving in Period 41. This inventory level covers approximately 5 periods of average demand. Given that the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we are currently overstocked relative to the recent demand mean. The OR backend needs to recognize this surplus to avoid placing unnecessary new orders while demand appears to be moderating from its hyper-peak. I will use a recent_N approach (N=9, covering the hyper-volatile regime from P33-P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high variance and the current mean, allowing the base-stock policy to naturally deplete the current excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-volatile demand regime (P33-P41) shows a mean of ~207 units with extreme variance (0 to 688). Inventory is currently in significant surplus (1034 units) relative to recent demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-902.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of significant inventory surplus (968 units on-hand) following a massive arrival in Period 41 (792 units) that was intended to cover the hyper-volatile demand regime observed between Periods 33-36. However, demand has since moderated significantly, with the last three periods (P40-P42) recording 175, 90, and 66 units respectively. The hyper-volatile regime starting Period 33 (P33-P42) has a mean of ~205, but the very recent trend is downward. Given the high on-hand inventory and the holding cost of $1.0/unit, we must prioritize reducing the surplus while maintaining a buffer for the extreme volatility seen in earlier periods. I am setting L to the confirmed 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the hyper-volatile period (P33-P42) which averages ~205 units/period, ensuring the OR engine calculates a base stock that accounts for these higher spikes while the cap and high on-hand levels naturally prevent excessive new orders. For sigma_hat, I'll use the same window to capture the extreme variance (range 0-688).

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand cooling: Following the Period 33-35 hyper-volatility (peak 688), demand in Periods 40-42 has averaged ~110 units, significantly lower than the P33-P39 average of 236.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-264.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand following the Period 33-35 hyper-volatility (which peaked at 688) has begun to cool, although it remains volatile. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P40-P43) is approximately 171 units (175, 90, 66, 352). We are currently in a significant over-stock position with 616 units on-hand, which stems from the large order placed in Period 37 (792 units) that arrived in Period 41. Given the high holding cost (equal to profit) and the current inventory level, minimizing additional orders is necessary to avoid excessive holding costs. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to a more recent average (N=11, covering the period from the start of the hyper-volatility at P33 through the current period) captures the extreme variance while acknowledging the recent high sample (352). I will use a high sigma_hat to account for the ongoing volatility (0 to 688 range). With 616 on-hand and 32 in-transit, we have 648 units to cover current and future demand throughout the lead time, which should be sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand remains volatile but the mean is moderating from the P33-P39 peak; the average for P33-P43 is ~213 units, but the most recent 4 periods show a lower trend (~171).

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a hyper-volatile state (Period 33-39) into a more sustained high-demand regime, with the last two periods showing significant demand of 352 and 349 units. While the inventory level was previously in surplus, the large demand in P43 and P44 has quickly drawn down the on-hand stock to 267 units. The system now has 446 units in-transit (mostly from the large order placed in Period 44). Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The most recent demand samples suggest a shift from the previous average of ~200 to a higher recent level. I will use a recent_N approach (N=12) for mu_hat to capture the volatile but high average demand since the P33 spike, while maintaining a high sigma_hat to account for the extreme variance (range 0-688). This will signal the OR backend to maintain a high service level without over-ordering excessively as we approach the final periods of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand regime confirmed: Period 43 (352) and Period 44 (349) indicate that after the hyper-volatility, demand remains elevated, averaging ~350 over the last 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $198.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained elevated over the last three periods (P43: 352, P44: 349, P45: 242), confirming the insight from Carry-over Period 45 that the regime has shifted to a higher sustained mean compared to the cooling observed in P40-P42. The average demand over these last three periods is 314 units. Given the high on-hand inventory (44) and in-transit units (833), but the proximity to the end of the game (Period 50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Orders placed now (P46) will arrive in P50. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods to capture this sustained high demand (recent_N=3 implies 314 * 5 = 1570). Sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=13 to cover the high volatility regime starting at P33, providing a robust buffer against the frequent 300+ spikes.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand regime (P43-P45) confirmed with mean of 314 units/period, following the hyper-volatility of P33-P39.

Daily Profit: $57.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility. Following a hyper-volatile phase (P33-P39) and a brief cooling (P40-P42), demand has returned to sustained high levels averaging approximately 255 units over the last 4 periods (P43-P46: 352, 349, 242, 177). Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) as the small arrivals from P41 (19) and P42 (13) were insufficient to cover recent demand. However, a massive pipeline of 1439 units is expected to arrive starting next period (expected arrival of 0 from P43, followed by P44's order of 414 units). This pipeline is significantly larger than current average demand. To stabilize the OR backend, I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime (P43-P46) using N=4, which captures the shift away from the earlier hyper-volatility while recognizing demand is still elevated relative to the beginning of the game. Sigma_hat is set to 'calculate' to account for the persistent high variance observed throughout the second half of the game. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand regime (P43-P46) averages ~255 units/period, following the hyper-volatility of P33-P39.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the simulation (Period 48 of 50). The 'chips(Regular)' SKU has recently experienced a high-demand regime following hyper-volatility, but Period 47 showed zero demand, and On-hand inventory is currently 0. However, the 'In-transit' quantity is very high (1439 units), largely due to substantial orders placed in Periods 44 (414 units), 45 (406 units), and 46 (619 units). Given the lead time of 4 periods, these orders are expected to arrive between Period 48 and Period 50. Specifically, the order from P44 (414 units) should arrive during Period 48, P45 (406 units) in Period 49, and P46 (619 units) in Period 50. Summing the pipeline (1439) against future possible demand (estimated at ~225-255 per period from the recent regime) suggests we are already over-ordered for the remaining 3 periods of the game. Ordering more would only incur high holding costs in the final transition. Thus, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime data (N=5 to capture the P43-P47 behavior) but the system's capping logic and high pipeline inventory will naturally prevent further ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Pipeline inventory (1439 units) significantly exceeds projected demand for the final 3 periods (P48-P50), which is estimated at ~750 units total based on the recent regime average (~250/period).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of a 50-period game. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Any order placed now in Period 49 would arrive in Period 53 (49 + 4), which is past the game's conclusion at Period 50. Total inventory (on-hand 266 + in-transit 1025 = 1291) significantly exceeds any realistic demand for the final two periods (Period 49 and 50). Historically, the highest demand recorded was 688, and recent averages are around 200-250. With over 1200 units already committed, no further orders are needed to maximize profit and minimize holding costs for the remaining duration. Thus, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to 0 to prevent the OR backend from placing additional orders, while keeping L at the default promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the final decision period (Period 50). The game ends after this period's demand resolution. Current state: On-hand inventory is 334 units; In-transit (pipeline) is 619 units. Past demand has been highly volatile, with the most recent sample (P49) at 338 units and a recent regime average around 250 units. Orders placed in Period 50 will not arrive until Period 54 (promised lead time 4), which is past the game's horizon. Since the objective is to maximize reward (Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory), and we already have 334 units on-hand (which likely covers Period 50 demand) plus 619 units already in-transit, any additional order would only increase potential holding costs without the possibility of increasing sales within the game limits. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure no new order is placed.
