Since I started with 0 inventory and missed sales in Period 1, I want to ensure I don't run out once the first shipment arrives. However, since the current inventory plus in-transit (280) roughly covers the expected demand through Period 6 (5 periods * ~55 units/period = 275), and I must be mindful of the $1.00 holding cost which equals the unit profit, I will place a moderate additional order to build a small buffer and account for the higher demand peaks (like the 65 seen in historical Period 4).",

The most recent demand figures are 145 (P40), 150 (P41), 223 (P42), and 177 (P43), resulting in a 4-period average of ~174 units. The established lead time is 4 periods. With only 7 periods remaining in the simulation (P44-P50), our ordering strategy must focus on covering demand for the remaining periods while avoiding excessive terminal inventory. \n\nInventory status at P44 START: \n- On-hand: 15 \n- In-transit: 808 units (Total pipeline)\n  - Arriving P44: 250 (from P40)\n  - Arriving P45: 250 (from P41)\n  - Arriving P46: 150 (from P42)\n  - Arriving P47: 158 (from P43)\n\nCalculation for Period 44 Decision:\nWe need to cover demand from Period 44 to the end of the lead time (P48). Total periods to cover = 5 (P44, P45, P46, P47, P48).\nEstimated demand: 180 units/period (conservative estimate given the recent peak of 223).\nRequired inventory through P48: 180 * 5 = 900 units.\nTotal current pipeline + on-hand: 15 + 250 + 250 + 150 + 158 = 823 units.\nShortfall for safety/expected demand: 900 - 823 = 77 units.\nSince we are approaching the end of the game (P50), and already have 150-250 units arriving for each of the next 4 periods, I will place a moderate order to buffer against another spike like P42 (223) without creating massive holding costs for the final periods.",

Therefore, the order placed in Period 50 has zero impact on units sold but would incur inventory costs if the game were to continue, though within this specific timeline, it simply has no utility. In a standard final period of a finite horizon, the optimal order quantity is 0 because there are no future periods to satisfy. My current on-hand inventory is 20 units. In-transit inventory includes 175 units (ordered P46), which will arrive during Period 50's arrival resolution phase and be available for Period 50 demand.
