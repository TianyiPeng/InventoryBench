Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) shows an upward trend with a mean of approximately 49.6 units per period. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the mean of 49.6, the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (mu_hat) is roughly 248 units. The standard deviation of the samples is approximately 12.8, which scales to a sigma_hat of about 28.6 over the lead time period (sqrt(5) * 12.8). Since this is the first decision and we have 5 historical samples that appear slightly non-stationary, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent demand level, while keeping L at the default promised value of 4.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 71 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected per the timing mechanism, nothing arrived in Period 1 (arrivals happen after the decision phase, and with L=4, it won't arrive until Period 5). Consequently, we had 0 inventory to satisfy the demand of 50 in Period 1, leading to lost sales. Demand history shows values: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 (note: the history provided in the prompt shows 5 data points, while the game history just concluded Period 1). The mean of the provided samples (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) is ~49.6 with a standard deviation of ~12.7. Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the default calculation (1+L) * mean across all samples provides a robust base-stock target for the backend OR engine.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For chips(Regular), on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 140 units in transit (71 ordered in P1, 69 ordered in P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the P1 order is expected to arrive during Period 1+4 = Period 5 arrival resolution. Therefore, seeing 0 arrivals in Period 1 and Period 2 conclude messages is normal and expected. However, demand in P1 (50) and P2 (91) has been completely lost because on-hand inventory was 0. Demand appears to be trending upwards (P1=30 in seed, then 49, 48, 65, 56... wait, the user prompt 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' says 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 for P1-P5, but the 'GAME HISTORY' shows P1=50 and P2=91. I will prioritize the GAME HISTORY for the current run). Since we are in the early stages and promised lead time is 4, I will use 'default' for L (4 periods) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the recent higher demand signals (avg P1-P2 = 70.5) to ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4. No orders have arrived yet (P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5, visible in Period 6). Total demand observed so far (P1-P3) is 50, 91, 60 (avg ~67). The user historical demand list (P1-P5: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56) suggests a slightly lower mean of ~50. I will prioritize the 5 most recent points from the historical list provided in the prompt (P1-P5) to estimate demand. Since L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Mean demand per period ~50 * 5 = 250 for mu_hat. Standard deviation of these 5 points is ~12.9, so sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 12.9 \u2248 28.8. Current pipeline is 243, which is close to our target base stock, but the OR backend will handle the order calculation based on these parameters.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first five periods is [30, 49, 48, 65, 56] (averaging ~49.6 units per period). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 334 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the lead-time definitions, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and will only be confirmed in the 'Period 5 conclude' message seen at the start of Period 6. Therefore, seeing 0 arrivals in the Period 1-4 conclude messages is expected behavior for a 4-period lead time. No shipments are confirmed lost yet. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent consumption patterns as we await the first delivery to satisfy backlogged or future demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1329.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (concluded), confirming an actual lead time of 4. Orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5 are currently in-transit (totaling 299 units). Demand has been relatively stable with some variance: 50, 91, 60, 50, 70 (samples provided in prompt differ slightly from history, using history context: mean is ~64). Current on-hand is low (1 unit). Since lead time L=4 is confirmed, the inventory needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the current demand regime, and 'default' for lead time as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Promised lead time is 4. Historical arrivals (P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6) confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 0, with 314 units in-transit. Demand samples from Period 1 to Period 6 are [50, 91, 60, 50, 70, 70]. The mean demand is 65.17 and standard deviation is 15.37. Recent demand (last 3 periods) shows a slight stabilization around 63.3. To manage the current stockout and ensure the OR backend sets a sufficient base stock, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture recent levels while smoothing early volatility, and 'default' for sigma_hat. The lead time L is consistently 4, so 'calculate' is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 delivered P5, P2 delivered P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1957.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7 (orders from P1, P2, and P3 respectively). In Period 7, we saw a demand spike to 106, which exceeded our starting on-hand inventory of 103, resulting in lost sales. The demand history (30, 49, 48, 65, 56 from baseline and 50, 91, 60, 50, 70, 70, 106 from game history) shows a rising trend or at least higher volatility recently. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P3-P7) is approximately 67.2 units. Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N with N=5 for demand and N=3 for lead time (since we have 3 confirmed arrivals) will capture the recent upward shift in consumption and the stability of the lead time. Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 5 periods to account for the increased variance (ranging from 50 to 106).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: average demand increased to ~67 units over periods 3-7 compared to earlier baseline samples.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8. Currently, we have 26 units on-hand and 309 units in-transit (orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). Demand analysis: The historical samples (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) showed a lower baseline, but the actual demand recorded during the game (P1-P8: 50, 91, 60, 50, 70, 70, 106, 65) shows an upward shift. Excluding the outlier of 106 in P7, the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is approximately 72.2 units. Given the lead time L=4, the OR backend targets a base stock covering L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N helps capture the shifted demand regime (average ~72 vs original samples ~49). I will set N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent volatility and increased mean, while maintaining L at the default promised value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1178.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The most recent demand (Period 9) was 88 units, which follows a period of 65. Looking at the history from Period 4 onwards (P4: 50, P5: 70, P6: 70, P7: 106, P8: 65, P9: 88), there is a clear upward shift in mean demand compared to the initial samples (P1: 50, P2: 91, P3: 60). The average of the last 6 periods is approximately 75 units, whereas the carry-over insight noted a shift to ~67. Given the stockout in Period 9 (sold 62 out of 88 demand) and 0 on-hand inventory, we need to ensure the pipeline covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5). I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime while maintaining L=4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift updated at Period 10: average demand of last 6 periods (P4-P9) is 74.8 units, reflecting a sustained increase from the initial baseline.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, ..., P6 arrived P10). Demand analysis: Recent demand across periods 4-10 (the last 7 samples) is: 50, 70, 70, 106, 65, 88, 47. The mean of these 7 samples is 70.85, which is lower than the previously noted average of 74.8 in Period 10 due to the low demand of 47 in Period 10. However, the overall trend remains significantly higher than the initial baseline (30-56). I will use the last 7 samples (N=7) for demand and standard deviation to capture the current volatility and mean accurately. Setting L=4 (promised) as it has been perfectly reliable. Current on-hand is 37 and in-transit is 362 (orders from P7-P10). The base stock calculation (L+1=5) based on a mean of ~71 will ensure we cover demand until the P11 order arrives in P15.

Calculating the mean from period 4 to period 11, the average demand is approximately 69.1 units (50, 70, 70, 106, 65, 88, 47, 66). This is higher than the initial samples. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P1-P7). Currently, there are 311 units in transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11), which are expected to arrive in periods 12, 13, 14, and 15 respectively. Since on-hand inventory is 54 and the pipeline is well-stocked, the OR backend's base-stock logic will naturally adjust. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime while maintaining L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 48 units. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (P5-P12). The demand shows a sustained increase since Period 4. Calculating the demand mean for the last 9 periods (P4-P12) yields (50+70+70+106+65+88+47+66+112)/9 = 74.88 units. I will use N=9 for mu_hat to capture this higher regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=9 to account for the variability in this recent window (ranging from 47 to 112). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, so 'default' or 'calculate' is appropriate; I will use 'calculate' to rely on observed data. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~75 units (avg of P4-P12 is 74.88) following the initial baseline samples.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant upward shift from the initial baseline samples. Over the last 10 periods (P4-P13), demand has averaged 79.2 units, with the last 5 periods showing an even higher average of 86.2 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 32 units on hand and 273 units in transit (covering roughly 3-4 periods of demand at the new rate), the goal is to maintain a high base stock to avoid stockouts during this higher demand regime. I will use recent_N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized higher demand pattern while discounting the initial lower baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: avg of P9-P13 is 86.2 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline (30-65 range).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1917.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P11-P14) shows a sustained upward shift in demand, with values of 66, 112, 118, and 101. The average demand over the last four periods is 99.25 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~75. To capture this shift while maintaining stability, I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to reflect this higher volatility and volume. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P1 through P10), so I will maintain the default lead time setting. On-hand inventory is very low (2 units), but in-transit inventory is high (323 units), suggesting that we are in a replenishment cycle following the higher demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: avg demand increased to 99.25 over last 4 periods (P11-P14), up from ~75.

Daily Reward (R_t): $646.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a clear upward trend. Demand in the last five periods (P11-P15) was 66, 112, 118, 101, and 94, averaging 98.2 units, which is significantly higher than earlier regimes. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory and have 431 units in transit, but much of that in-transit stock was based on lower historical demand estimates. To prevent lost sales during this high-demand phase, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this higher mean and the increased variance (ranging from 66 to 118). This will raise the base stock level to better cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased to 98.2 over last 5 periods (P11-P15), showing a sustained level near ~100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1083.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), demand has averaged 96.5 units (66, 112, 118, 101, 94, 88), which is a clear increase from the earlier average of ~75. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a high stockout risk as we are entering Period 17 with no starting stock, despite having 506 units in transit. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P9, P10, P11, and P12 all having lead_time=4). To stabilize the service level at this higher demand plateau, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 samples (N=6) to reflect the current regime of ~96.5 units per period. L is set to 'calculate' to rely on the consistent historical performance of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 96-97 units: avg of P11-P16 is 96.5, confirming a sustained shift from the previous ~75 unit plateau.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2147.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P13-P17) shows values of 118, 101, 94, 88, and 113, resulting in a 5-period average of 102.8 units. The carry-over insights correctly identified a shift around Period 11, and the demand has stabilized at this higher level (near 100+). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0, following a period where demand (113) perfectly matched arrivals (113). In-transit inventory is 438, which covers roughly 4.3 periods of demand at the 100-unit rate. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. To maintain the service level across the lead time plus the decision period (L+1 = 5 periods), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility associated with higher demand levels. L is set to calculate as it is confirmed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~103 units based on last 5 periods (P13-P17 avg: 102.8), up from previous ~97 unit plateau.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is virtually depleted (5 units) while in-transit stock is 440 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Since the shift identified around Period 11, demand has stabilized at a higher level; the average of the last 6 periods (P13-P18) is 106.67 units (118, 101, 94, 88, 113, 116). By using 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, we capture this sustained high-demand regime (~106-107 units/period) while ignoring the lower baseline from the early periods. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is calculated against the current average demand of approx 533 total units, which helps mitigate stockouts given the narrow on-hand margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~106 units: avg of P13-P18 is 106.67, confirming a sustained plateau higher than the previous ~97-100 unit range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2295.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained upward trend, with the most recent plateau stabilizing around 106 units (average of P13-P18 is 106.67). The most recent demand in P19 was 122, suggesting the possibility of further growth or high volatility. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 23 units, and there are 426 units in-transit (orders from P16, P17, P18, P19). The pipeline covers the expected lead-time demand, but given the recent spike to 122 units, I will shift mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime to ensure high service levels and avoid stockouts. I will use N=7 for recent_N to capture the period since demand surpassed 100 units consistently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~110 units: avg of P14-P19 is 110.17, indicating another upward shift from the previous ~106 unit plateau.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2065.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent upward trajectory. Recent demand (P14-P20) indicates a stabilization around a higher plateau. Specifically, the average demand of the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 110 units (113, 116, 122, 111). The most recent demand was 111. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages. We set L to the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat, we use the average of the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this new sustained demand regime of ~110 units per period. This results in a forecast of (1+4)*110 = 550 for the review+lead window. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 110 units per period (avg P16-P20 = 114.6; avg P14-P20 = 111.85).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1691.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend and recent volatility. The latest demand in Period 21 was 155 units, the highest recorded, while the average of the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is 117.17 units. The carry-over insights previously identified a stabilization around 110-115, but Period 21 suggests a potential further shift or high volatility spike. To prevent stockouts (which occurred in Period 21 as evidenced by 'ending on-hand inventory=0'), I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime (P16-P21). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by actual arrivals of P17 orders in P21), so 'default' is appropriate for L. This setup ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the most recent growth and variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift upward observed at Period 22: Average demand of last 6 periods (P16-P21) increased to 117.17 units, featuring a peak of 155 units in Period 21.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2217.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its upward trend. Period 21 saw a peak of 155, and Period 22 demand was 117. The average demand of the most recent 7 periods (P16-P22) is approximately 117.2 units (88, 113, 116, 122, 111, 155, 117), confirming the 'Period 22' carry-over insight of a shift toward ~117 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P18 order arrived in P22). To ensure the OR backend captures this higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7. This covers the current elevated demand plateau. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the increased volatility (std dev) seen in these recent periods, particularly following the spike in Period 21. L is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: avg of P16-P22 is 117.2 units, up from the previous ~110 unit plateau.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained upward trend, with the most recent regime stabilizing at a significantly higher level than the initial baseline. The average demand over the last seven periods (P17-P23) is 122.14 units, featuring a peak of 155 in P21. The most recent three periods (P21-P23) average 131 units. Given this growth, I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand plateau and the increased volatility observed in recent weeks. The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P19, P20, P21, P22, and P23 all matching their respective 4-period lead times). I will use L=default to ensure the OR backend uses the promised lead time of 4. With on-hand inventory low (11 units) and demand trending towards 120-130 units, the parameters are set to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of this elevated demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~122 units: avg of P17-P23 is 122.14, confirming a sustained shift from the previous ~117 unit plateau.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to trend upward. The most recent 7 periods (P18-P24) show an average demand of 123.86 units per period, with a recent peak of 155 in P21. The period 21-24 sequence (155, 117, 121, 126) suggests a stabilization near 125-130 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent tracking of ordered-to-arrived data. The critical window covers the current period plus the 4-period lead time (5 periods total). I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 8 to capture this sustained higher demand level while smoothing out the P21 spike (P17-P24 avg: 122.5). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=8 to account for the heightened volatility seen in recent cycles.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~124 units: avg of P18-P24 is 123.86, confirming a sustained shift from the previous ~117-122 unit range.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained upward trend, moving through several plateaus (from ~75 to ~97, then ~110, and now stabilizing around ~124). The average demand over the last 7 periods (P19-P25) is 126.8, and the average over the last 3 periods (P23-P25) is 128.0 units. Given this consistent growth, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this higher stable regime (avg ~127). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P21 order arrived P25), so L remains at 'default'. sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=7 to reflect current volatility accurately. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the contemporary demand level while preventing over-ordering by not over-reacting to the single peak of 155 in Period 21.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~127 units: avg of P19-P25 is 126.86, confirming a sustained plateau at the higher end of the 120-130 range.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained upward trend, recently stabilizing at a higher plateau. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P20-P26) is approximately 122.4 units, despite a lower demand value of 90 in Period 26. However, looking at a slightly longer window to capture the recent growth, the average for P19-P25 was ~127 units. Given the trend, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized higher demand while accounting for the recent fluctuation. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on all observed arrivals (P22 order arrived P26). I've set L to calculate to use the stable historical average of 4. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to reflect the current demand volatility in the safety stock calculation, ensuring we maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~122 units: avg of P20-P26 is 122.4, maintaining the higher plateau established in recent periods despite a temporary dip in P26.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to fluctuate at a high plateau. In Period 27, demand was 107 units, while the previous 7-period average (P20-P26) was approximately 122.4 units. To ensure high service levels while managing inventory, I will stabilize the demand forecast using a 'recent_N' approach. I'll use N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the recent volatility and mean demand (which has seen peaks near 155 and dips near 90). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P23 order arrived in P27). Setting L to 4 uses the promised lead time which is consistent with actual observations.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level than earlier periods. Over the last 6 periods (P23-P28), demand has averaged 119.33 units (121, 126, 137, 90, 107, 135), which aligns with the carry-over insight of ~122 units. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 71 units, and pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 480 units, which reflects orders from P25 (125), P26 (152), P27 (98), and P28 (105). To maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current plateau and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to account for the volatility seen in P26 (90) and P28 (135). L is set to 'calculate' as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~120 units: avg of P23-P28 is 119.3 units, confirming the shift identified in previous periods is sustained.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level, with the average demand over the last seven periods (P23-P29) being approximately 121.0 units (excluding outliers). Recent periods show significant volatility (P29 demand was 161, P26 was 90). The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P25 order arrived Period 29 conclude). To capture the recent high plateau while smoothing the high volatility of the last few periods, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=7 and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 to account for recent increases in variance. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=5 periods). Current inventory position (on-hand 35 + in-transit 467 = 502) is being compared against a target roughly around 5 * 121 = 605, adjusted for safety stock.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a sustained high-demand plateau. Averaging demand from Period 23 to Period 30 (the last 8 periods), we observe a mean of approximately 130.5 units (121, 126, 137, 90, 107, 135, 161, 132). This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' observation that demand has stabilized at a higher level, specifically centered around the 125-135 range despite some volatility. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed 'conclude' messages. To respond to this plateau, mu_hat will be set using a recent window (N=8) to capture this established demand level, while sigma_hat is also calculated over the same recent period to reflect current volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to rely on the consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau for chips(Regular) confirmed at ~130 units (avg P23-P30: 130.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2907.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained increase, with the most recent plateau stabilizing around 130 units. The average demand from Period 23 to Period 31 is approximately 133.3 units, with the most recent demand value at 165 units. Although there's a temporary stockout at the start of Period 32 (on-hand is 0), an order of 105 units from Period 28 is expected to arrive during Period 32 (based on the consistent 4-period lead time). To ensure the backend captures the recent higher demand level, I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (covering Periods 23-31), which represents the current sustained demand regime. This will help the base-stock policy maintain a sufficient service level against the current ~133 unit mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau for chips(Regular) updated: average demand from P23-P31 is 133.3 units, reflecting a sustained high-demand regime compared to previous plateaus.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a significant upward trend, now plateauing at approximately 135-140 units. The average demand of the last 10 periods (P23-P32) is approximately 133 units, with the most recent periods showing even higher peaks (161, 132, 165, 116). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and the demand is volatile at this higher level, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent plateau and ensures the backend sets a base stock sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the increased variance observed in the latest demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~135 units: avg of P25-P32 is 138 units, confirming a sustained shift from the earlier ~130 unit plateau.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained upward trend, with the most recent regime stabilizing near 140-150 units. The average demand from Period 28 to 33 is approximately 144.6 units (135, 161, 132, 165, 116, 179). Period 33 recorded a high of 179 units. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, I must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an avg demand of ~145, mu_hat should be around 725. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this latest high-demand plateau (P28-P33). Sigma_hat will also use N=6 to account for the increased volatility seen in recent spikes (e.g., 179). Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 29 order in Period 33.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: avg of P28-P33 is 144.7 units, indicating a shift from the previous ~135 unit plateau.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained upward trend, with the most recent regime (P28-P34) averaging approximately 144.7 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P30 order arriving in P34). Current on-hand inventory is 31 units, and there is a significant pipeline (661 units) to cover the 4-period lead time. To ensure the OR backend captures the most recent demand level and volatility while accounting for the high service level required (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=7 (covering periods 28-34). This captures the current plateau of ~145 units while ignoring older, lower-demand data. Lead time (L) is set to 'default', as the promised lead time of 4 matches the observed behavior.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained upward trend, with the most recent plateau stabilizing around 145 units per period. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P30-P35) is 144.5 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 34. On-hand inventory is currently 48 units with 620 units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest demand regime (P30-P35) and set L to default (4 periods). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the current demand level of ~145 units across the 5-period (L+1) exposure window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~145 units: avg of P30-P35 is 144.5 units, confirming the high-demand plateau observed in recent periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained upward trend, with the most recent plateau stabilizing around 145-150 units. The average demand of the last 6 periods (P31-P36) is approximately 151.7 units, showing a significant increase from the previous 'stabilized' regime of 144.5 recorded at Period 36. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 14 periods remaining in the simulation, it is critical to capture this latest surge to avoid stockouts, while maintaining a buffer for high variance (demand reached 180 in P36). I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this latest demand shift for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37: avg demand increased to ~152 units over the last 6 periods (P31-P36), up from the previous ~145 unit plateau.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3420.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory. Period 37 saw a demand of 199, and the average over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is 166.6 units, significantly higher than the previous plateau of ~152. To capture this growth and avoid stockouts (as seen in P37 which ended with 0 inventory), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent delivery history. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 10 periods to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Average demand increased to ~167 units over the last 5 periods (P33-P37), up from the previous ~152 unit plateau.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3232.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb. Analysis of the last 6 periods (P33-P38) shows a demand mean of approximately 172.6 units (179, 131, 144, 180, 199, 171), confirming the shift noted in the most recent carry-over insights. I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture this current high-demand regime (~173 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P38 saw P34 arrive). Signal volatility (sigma_hat) will also be calculated based on the recent 6-period window to ensure the base stock accounts for the recent variance in this high-demand state. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the 19:1 profit-to-holding ratio (~95%) for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: avg increased to ~173 over last 6 periods (P33-P38), continuing the upward trend from the previous ~167 unit estimate.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb. Over the last 5 periods (P35-P39), the average demand has reached 173.8 units. The most recent demand in Period 39 was 179 units. Following the established pattern of upward regime shifts (P37 and P38 insights), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current plateau of approximately 173-175 units per period. The lead time remain consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P35 order arriving in P39). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 757 units. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=6) to reflect the recent volatility accompanying the higher demand levels. This should allow the OR backend to maintain a high service level for the $19 profit margin while accounting for the ~175 unit/period demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40: avg demand increased to ~174 units over the last 5 periods (P35-P39), continuing the sustained upward trend.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a significant upward trend. Period 40 concluded with a demand of 176 units, confirming the recent shift identified in the previous period. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is approximately 181 units (180, 199, 171, 179, 176). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages. My strategy is to set L to the promised 4 periods and use a recent_N method for demand forecasting (mu_hat) with N=5 to capture this latest high-demand regime. This provides a forecast for the (1+L) = 5 period window that is responsive to the current trend while balancing against the risk of stockouts, which have occurred frequently in recent periods due to rapid growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41: average demand of last 5 periods (P36-P40) increased to 181 units, up from the previous ~174 unit estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2644.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a significant upward trend, with the most recent sustained regime (P36-P41) showing an average demand of approximately 174.5 units (excluding the P41 dip to 142). While P41 was lower, the overall trajectory from P33 onwards has moved from ~160 to over 180. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this high-demand state (Avg of P37-P41 is approx 173.4). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 'Period 41 conclude' confirming P37's arrival. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate given the current demand volatility and the 'in-transit' pipeline of 749 units (covering roughly 4.3 periods of demand at the 174 rate).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: Average demand of last 6 periods (P36-P41) stabilized at ~173 units, confirming the upward trend is sustained despite a slight dip in P41.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-volume regime. The average demand of the last 6 periods (P37-P42) is approximately 176.7 units (199, 171, 179, 176, 142, 193). While Period 41 was lower (142), Period 42 returned to a high 193. The leading trend suggests a stabilization or slight increase over the previous ~173 unit estimate. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current high-demand plateau for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the current volatility in this higher range. The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P38 order delivered on P42). On-hand inventory is 72, and in-transit is 678, providing a buffer as we approach the end of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~177 units: avg of P37-P42 is 176.67, confirming a high-demand plateau significantly above the initial baseline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high plateau. Over the last seven periods (P37-P43), the average demand is 175.4 units (199, 171, 179, 176, 142, 193, 166). The most recent carry-over insight from Period 43 supports a regime around ~177 units. Based on this sustained trend, I will use a recent_N window of 7 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific high-demand regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of the P39 order arriving in P43.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~175 units: avg of P37-P43 is 175.4, confirming the high-demand level observed in the final quarter of the game.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level. Evaluating the most recent 7 periods (P38-P44), the average demand is 175.4 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 44. I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime. This period (P45) occurs at the 90% mark of the total periods (45/50). With a lead time of 4 periods, an order placed now will arrive in Period 49 and be available for sale in the final period (P50). Therefore, we must maintain sufficient stock to cover demand through the end of the game. On-hand inventory is 107 and in-transit is 657, totaling 764 units. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. Sigma_hat will be set using 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-demand plateau. Analyzing the most recent 7 periods (P39-P45), the average demand is 177.0 units (179, 176, 142, 193, 166, 181, 201). This closely matches the 'Period 44' carry-over insight of ~175 units. At Period 46, we are approaching the end of the game (total 50 periods). Because lead time is 4 periods, any order placed in Period 46 will arrive in Period 50. Orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, I will maintain parameters to satisfy this 175-180 unit demand regime for the final arrival. On-hand inventory is 62 and in-transit is 659. The pipeline is sufficient to cover most remaining demand, but a small adjustment ensures we don't stock out in the final phase. I'm using N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~177 units: average demand of last 7 periods (P39-P45) is 176.9 units, confirming the high-demand state persists through the final phase of the game.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level. Over the last 7 periods (P40-P46), the average demand is 171.9 units. The most recent period (P46) saw a lower demand of 144, but the overall trend remains elevated compared to earlier plateaus. I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized high-demand regime (~175 units/period) while accounting for the recent variability. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 58, and the in-transit pipeline (ordered P43-P46) is 207+154+158+209=728 units, which aligns with covering the (L+1) period demand window at the current high rates. No signs of lost shipments are present.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3695.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 48 of a 50-period simulation. The game ends after Period 50, so orders placed now (L=4) will arrive in Period 52 (48+4), which is past the game's horizon. Since arrivals occur during the arrival resolution phase (Step 2) and demand occurs after (Step 3), only on-hand inventory and orders already arriving in periods 48, 49, and 50 can satisfy future demand. Given the current on-hand inventory is 67 and the in-transit amount is 683 (consisting of orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47), we have sufficient stock to cover the remaining periods. Specifically, the order from P44 (154 units) arrives in P48, P45 (158 units) in P49, and P46 (209 units) in P50. Total inventory available to meet demand for the final three periods is 67 + 154 + 158 + 209 = 588 units. With average demand stabilized around 177 units (Carry-over insight P46), the expected total demand for the remaining 3 periods is approximately 531 units. Therefore, placing a new order would only incur holding costs or remain in-transit. I will set the base stock parameters to reflect the current high-demand regime, but the capping mechanism in the OR backend should naturally minimize ordering as the game concludes.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. Demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend throughout the game, with recent demand (P45-P48) averaging 187.5 units. The most recent period (P48) saw 207 units of demand. While we are approaching the end of the simulation, we must ensure we can cover demand for the final periods (P49 and P50). The pipeline inventory is very high (745 units), and the OR backend's capped policy will naturally limit excessive ordering as we reach the horizon. However, to ensure high service levels for the final units sold, I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent high-demand regime. Using recent_N=5 (P44-P48) gives an average demand of 186.2 units, which is a robust estimate of the current high PLATEAU. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical conclusions.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~186 units: average demand of last 5 periods (P44-P48) is 186.2, confirming the high-demand state persists through the end of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3268.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 50, the final period of the game. My objective is to set the parameters for the final time to maximize reward. In Period 49, the demand was 193, and over the last five periods (P45-P49), the average demand has been approximately 188.6 units. The carry-over insights suggest a stabilized regime around 186 units. Based on the most recent data (P44-P49), the demand remains strong and consistently near the 190 level. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat to capture this final high-demand regime (Avg P44-P49 is 187.8). Lead time has been consistently 4 periods throughout the game history, so I will continue using the default lead time. Sigma_hat will also use a recent_N of 6 to reflect current volatility. These parameters will guide the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the remaining review and lead time accurately, maximizing the final reward.
