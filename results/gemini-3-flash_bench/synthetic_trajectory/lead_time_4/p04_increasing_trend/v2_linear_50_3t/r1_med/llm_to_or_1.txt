Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available (30, 49, 48, 65, 56), showing an upward trend or a regime starting around 50 units/period. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the mean of the 5 historical samples (~49.6) to project (1+L) demand. Lead time is set to default (4) as no actual arrivals have occurred yet to contradict the promise. Sigma is calculated from the 5 samples (std dev \u2248 12.8) to protect against volatility.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 71 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, nothing arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0 reported in the Period 1 conclude message at the start of Period 2). The demand in Period 1 was 50 units, resulting in 50 lost sales because we started with 0 inventory. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) shows an upward trend or a level shift compared to the very first point. Since we only have one actual realization (Period 1 demand = 50) in the game history which matches the 'Period_2' historical data point (49), I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting to capture the current level. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the order cycle covers L+1=5 periods. I'll set L to default (4) as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for the first two periods was 50 and 45 (average 47.5), though the provided long-term history suggests a range between 30 and 65. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 137 units in transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since no orders have reached the promised lead time yet, there is no evidence to suggest lead time drift or lost shipments. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering all available history) to capture the recent demand baseline of ~49.6 units per period. The OR backend will calculate the base stock targeting a 80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6 START). Thus, the current 'arrived=0' and 'On-hand: 0' are expected behaviors. Inventory is currently stocked entirely in-transit (203 units). Demand over the first three periods has been 50, 45, and 86 respectively. The mean demand is approx 60 units. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 1+L=5 periods of demand. Current in-transit (203) is slightly below the expected 5-period demand (300). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand volatility while keeping the lead time at default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (71 units) are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (this period). Because arrivals happen after the decision phase, the current on-hand inventory is still 0, resulting in significant lost sales from Period 1 to Period 4. The demand history shows: P1:30 (sample data suggests P1=30, but history says 50, I will prioritize history), P2:45, P3:86, P4:45. Reconciling the user-provided sample data (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) with the history (50, 45, 86, 45), there is high volatility. Mean demand from history is approximately 56.5. With L=4, the review+lead time is 5 periods. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent mean demand including the spike in P3. Total in-transit is 301, which covers roughly 5.3 periods of average demand, matching our L+1 requirement.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Looking at the history, the order placed in Period 1 arrived at the conclusion of Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods (5 - 1 = 4). Historical demand samples are [30, 49, 48, 65, 56] (from description) and [50, 45, 86, 45, 57] (from history), though there's a slight discrepancy between the provided sample set and the game history. I will prioritize the 5 most recent history values (50, 45, 86, 45, 57) which average 56.6 per period. Since L=4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 249 units (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), and we have 14 units on hand. Total inventory position = 263. Using the mean of 56.6, 5-period demand is ~283. The OR backend will calculate the order based on mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both to capture the most relevant demand volatility and mean.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived at end of P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the lead time is confirmed to be exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). Demand has been relatively stable with some variance: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 (historical) and 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50 (game history). The mean of the last 6 game periods is approximately 55.6. Since we have a lead time of 4, the inventory replenishment logic must cover L+1 = 5 periods. On-hand is 30 and in-transit is 236, totaling 266 units. With an average demand of 55.6, 5 periods of demand is ~278 units. The base stock formula will use L=4, mu_hat around 278 (5 * 55.6), and sigma_hat based on recent volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most relevant demand regime from the game history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $154.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The demand history (Periods 1-7) shows values of 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50. Excluding the outlier of 86 in Period 3, the demand is relatively stable around a mean of ~50. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on arrivals from orders placed in P1, P2, and P3. Transitioning into the decision phase for Period 8, we have 46 units on hand and 211 units in transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using the last 5 samples (P3-P7) for demand mean provides a slightly more responsive estimate (avg ~56.6) vs the full history (avg ~54.7). Sigma is set to default to capture historical volatility including the P3 spike. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now consistently observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe a steady demand pattern with an average of approximately 50 units (historical samples: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56; plus game history demand: 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50, 64). The mean demand over the last 8 game periods is 55.8 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (P1, P2, P3, and P4 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). Current on-hand inventory is 80 units, and in-transit inventory is 170 units (orders from P5, P6, P7, and P8). To cover the lead time plus the order period (L+1 = 5 periods), the target stock should be around $56 	imes 5 = 280$ units. Pipeline inventory (80 + 170 = 250) is slightly below this target. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand parameters to capture the post-start stability and 'default' for lead time since the 4-period lead time is performing as promised.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Based on the conclusion messages from Periods 5 through 9, the lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (promised lead time is 4). Demand history shows samples: 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50, 64, 31. The mean of these 9 samples is 53.1 units/period. The most recent demand (31) is a significant outlier on the low side, but without further calendar context, I'll treat it as standard variance. The current lead time L is 4, meaning we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using all available data (N=9) provides a stable estimate of \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 207) plus on-hand (68) equals 275 units, which covers approximately 5.1 periods of average demand, putting us in a healthy inventory position. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as it matches observations, and 'default' (all samples) for demand parameters to maintain stability.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in periods 5 through 10). Demand has shown a decline in the last two periods (P9: 31, P10: 28) compared to the earlier average (approx 50-60). However, the sample set is small. Given the current high inventory (93 on-hand + 165 in-transit) and the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), the priority is avoiding overstock. I am using a recent_N of 6 for demand to capture the full period since arrivals began, and setting L to 4 to match the confirmed lead time. This will help the OR backend adjust the base stock to reflect the stable lead time and the recent demand levels.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1 through 7 (all arrived after exactly 4 periods). Therefore, I will continue using L=4. Demand analysis across the available history (11 periods) shows a mean demand of approximately 51.8 units $(\mu \approx 52)$. However, recent volatility is notable; demand in Period 11 was 64, significantly higher than the preceding two periods (31 and 28). To balance the service level against holding costs ($4 profit vs $1 holding), the OR backend requires a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current Pipeline (On-hand 70 + In-transit 127 = 197) is substantial, but I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the demand mean and standard deviation from the more stable period after the initial zero-sales phase, ensuring the base stock level is reactive to the recent variance in demand.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13, the lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (observed in every arrival from Period 5 to 12). Current inventory status is 64 units on-hand and 146 units in-transit. Demand over the last 12 periods has been relatively stable, with some fluctuations. Calculating the average demand based on all 12 concluded periods (50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50, 64, 31, 28, 64, 63) yields an average of approximately 52.75 units per period. Using a lead time (L) of 4, the demand across review + lead period (L+1 = 5) is approximately 263.75. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.8, suggesting a moderate safety stock. The current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 210, which is below the expected requirement for the next 5 periods. I will set L to 4 and use 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to calculate based on the full historical sample, as there is no clear evidence of a sustained regime shift yet.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant uptick, particularly in Period 13 with a demand of 103 units, which is nearly double the earlier average. Current on-hand inventory is low (17 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 5 through 13). Because of the recent surge in demand, I will prioritize recent data to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, for mu_hat, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the shift towards higher demand (Avg of P9-P13 is approx 57.8, but P13 alone was 103). The backend will multiply this mean by (1+L). For L, I will use the 'calculate' method as the performance has been consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 13: demand spiked to 103 units, exceeding the previous average of ~50. Monitoring for sustained high demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we face a critical stockout (on-hand: 0) following a demand regime shift observed since Period 13. Demand in the last two periods (103 and 85) is significantly higher than the previous average of ~50. An order of 11 units arrived in Period 14, which was insufficient to meet the demand of 85, leading to lost sales. We are now in a high-demand regime. While the promised lead time (4) is stable according to history, the pipeline inventory (263 units) is substantial relative to recent orders, but we must ensure we cover the (L+1)=5 period horizon during this surge. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current spike (avg ~80) and set sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility observed in this new regime. This informs the OR engine to order enough to replenish our safety stock and cover the expected 400+ units needed for the lead time cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 13-14 average demand is 94 units, a ~88% increase from the Periods 1-12 average of ~50.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 16. Analyzing the demand history, a significant regime shift occurred starting at Period 13. While demand in Periods 1-12 averaged approximately 50 units (\u03c3 \u2248 16), demand from Period 13-15 has spiked to an average of 91 units (103, 85, 85). Our lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units) due to this demand surge outstripping arrivals from low-order periods (P10 and P11). We have 377 units in transit, but the upcoming arrival in Period 16 (ordered in P12) is 76 units, which is slightly less than the current demand rate of ~91. To prevent further lost sales and rebuild stock to the optimal base-stock level for this new high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the 91 units/period average. L is set to default as the confirmed lead time of 4 periods matches the promised lead time. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the current volatility in this new regime.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 17. The demand regime shift first detected in Period 13 continues to be sustained. Demand from P13-P16 (103, 85, 85, 79) averages 88 units/period, compared to the ~50 units/period seen in P1-P12. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the arrivals from orders placed during the lower-demand regime (P10-P12) were insufficient to meet this higher demand. However, larger orders placed in P13 (76), P14 (108), P15 (117), and P16 (98) are currently in-transit. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. For this period's decision, I will focus on the new demand regime (N=4) to ensure \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 are reflective of the recent spike. Setting \u03bc\u0302 based on the last 4 samples (avg 88 * (1+4) lead time) will help the OR engine replenish the exhausted stock and maintain service levels for the higher demand.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward regime shift starting at Period 13. While the average demand in Periods 1-12 was ~50, the average demand for Periods 13-17 has increased to 91.2 units. This shift, combined with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, has led to stockouts (on-hand is currently 0). We are operating in a back-to-back ordering scenario where recent demand is the best predictor of future demand. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime. Lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by consistent recent arrivals (P12 arrived in P16, P13 arrived in P17). The OR backend calculation ((1+L) * mu) will accurately target a base stock level sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon (current period + 4-period lead time).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and sustained: Period 13-17 average demand is 91.2 units, identifying a new baseline ~82% higher than the initial Periods 1-12 average.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a clear regime shift around Period 13. Analysis of the demand from Period 13 to Period 18 shows a higher mean (~92 units) compared to the initial periods. However, stockouts in Periods 14, 15, 16, and 17 mean the observed demand (103, 85, 85, 79, 104, 96) likely underestimates the true demand during those stockout periods. Using recent_N with N=6 (covering the entire new regime) captures this shift. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across historical arrivals. The 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 will calculate parameters based on the Period 13-18 behavior, ensuring the base stock level reflects the higher demand and increased volatility of the current market state, while the lead time remains at the observed 4 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20. Historical data confirms a significant demand regime shift starting around Period 13. While the initial periods (1-12) averaged ~50 units, the recent periods (13-19) show a sustained higher demand with an average of approximately 95 units (specific demands: 103, 85, 85, 79, 104, 96, 114). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages. My strategy is to use the recent_N method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this higher demand regime, choosing N=7 to cover the shift period. Setting L to 'default' aligns with the confirmed 4-period lead time. This will ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the higher volume, minimizing stockouts which have occurred recently (Periods 14-17) due to the shift.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 13. While the initial average (Periods 1-12) was approximately 50 units, the recent demand (Periods 13-20) has increased to an average of approximately 98.25 units per period. Specifically, the last 3 periods (P18-P20) show demand values of 96, 114, and 116, suggesting a continuing upward trend or a stabilized higher plateau. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0, we must ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use a recent_N of 8 (covering the high-demand regime from Period 13 to 20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume/high-volatility phase. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for roughly 100 units/period demand, mitigating the current stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and continuing: Period 13-20 average demand is 98.3 units (~96% increase from the initial baseline). Last 3 periods show demand consistently near or above 100 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 13. The average demand from Period 1 to 12 was approximately 53 units, whereas the average demand from Period 13 to 21 has increased to approximately 98 units, representing an ~85% increase. The current inventory situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 for the second consecutive period, and we have experienced stockouts in 7 of the last 8 periods (Periods 14-17, 20-21). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sustained high demand (averaging 114.7 units over the last 3 periods) and current fulfillment failure, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the start of the high-demand regime) to capture this new mean. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level. The goal is to set a high enough base stock to recover from stockouts and satisfy the elevated demand, while accounting for the ~430 units already in-transit.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 13. While the initial average (Periods 1-12) was approximately 50.8 units, the recent average from Period 13 to Period 22 has increased to approximately 99.9 units. The last three periods (P20-P22) specifically show even higher volatility and demand (116, 114, 123), averaging 117.7 units. We are currently facing stockouts (on-hand is 0) despite a lead time of 4 periods being consistently met by the supplier. To address the increased demand and current stockout situation, I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 samples (N=10), which covers the high-demand regime, yielding an average of roughly 100 units per period. I am also using N=10 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility in this new regime. The lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 now firmly established as the new baseline: Period 13-22 average is 99.9 units, nearly 100% higher than the initial Periods 1-12 average of 50.8.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 13. The pre-shift average (Periods 1-12) was 50.8 units, while the post-shift average (Periods 13-23) has risen to approximately 103.5 units. The most recent 5 periods (Periods 19-23) average 116.8 units, indicating a possible secondary creep or sustained high volatility near 115-120 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in 9 of the last 10 periods due to this increased demand. For Period 24, lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting L=4 (promised/actual), and using recent_N for mu_hat with N=11 (the length of the new regime since Period 13) to capture the higher mean. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=11) to account for the increased volatility in this high-demand state. This parameterization aims to raise the base stock level sufficiently to satisfy the new demand baseline and stop the cycle of stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 further intensified: Period 19-23 average reached 116.8 units, compared to the initial Period 13-22 average of 99.9. The SKU is currently in a persistent stockout state due to underestimating this peak.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a significantly higher regime. Starting at Period 13, demand increased from an average of ~50 to ~100. However, the last few periods show a further surge, specifically Period 24 where demand hit 174. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is 128.2 units, but the most recent observation suggests we may be entering an even higher seasonal or promotional peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a large backlog of unsatisfied demand, I need to set mu_hat based on the most recent, elevated demand data. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand volatility while smoothing the impact of the extreme Period 24 surge to avoid over-ordering if it was a one-time spike, though the trend suggests sustained high levels. L will be calculated based on historical arrivals which consistently show 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge accelerated in P24: Periodic demand reached 174, pushing the 5-period average (P20-P24) to 128.2 units, significantly higher than the previous P13-P22 average of ~100.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. First, a shift in Period 13 where demand rose from ~50 to ~100. More recently, demand has shown even greater volatility and higher peaks (e.g., 174 in P24), with the last 5 periods (P21-P25) averaging approximately 128.6 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have been experiencing frequent stockouts (ending inventory 0 in 10 of the last 12 periods), we need to set parameters that capture the most recent, higher-demand regime to ensure the base stock calculation covers the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Setting N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses on the most recent surge (averaging ~129 units per period), which is necessary to recover from the current stockout state and meet upcoming demand. Lead time remains consistent at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift intensified again: Period 21-25 average demand is 128.6 units, up from the ~100 unit baseline established in P13. Frequent stockouts continue as current pipeline inventory catches up to the new surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts: the first at Period 13 (moving from ~50 to ~100 units) and a more recent intensification starting around Period 24. Demand in Period 26 was 160 units, and Period 24 saw 174 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is 137.2 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline. The SKU remains in a state of frequent stockouts (on-hand is 0) because the pipeline inventory is still based on the previous 100-unit regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To address the current surge and clear the stockout state, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the most recent high-demand window (P22-P26), which more accurately reflects the current environment. This will increase the base stock level to better handle the 130-170 unit range and reduce lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift intensified again: Period 22-26 average demand is 137.2 units, up significantly from the 116.8 average noted in P24. The SKU remains in a frequent stockout state.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts. The first occurred around Period 13 (shifting from ~50 to ~100 units). The second intensification began around Period 24. For the most recent 5 periods (P23-P27), demand has averaged 140.8 units (117, 174, 115, 160, 141), with a noticeable increase in volatility. The system is currently in a persistent stockout state due to these surges. To stabilize, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this latest high-demand regime (approx 141 units/period). I am using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to better capture the increased volatility observed since Period 18. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals; therefore, 'calculate' is used to maintain the 4-period average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift intensified again: Period 23-27 average demand is 140.8 units, compared to the ~128 units average observed through P26. Stockouts persist as supply catches up to this new peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $396.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the chips has undergone multiple upward shifts. After stabilizes around 100 units from Period 13-22, it surged again. The demand in Period 24 was 174, Period 26 was 160, and Period 27 was 141. Period 28 saw a slight cooling to 100 units, but the overall trend is significantly higher than the previous baseline. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is 137 units. Given the seasonality of snack chips and the persistent stockouts observed, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime while weighting the most recent volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The goal is to ensure the pipeline inventory covers the (L+1) demand window, which is currently approx 5 * 137 = 685 units. With in-transit at 649 and on-hand at 4, our 'inventory position' is 653, slightly below the expected 5-period demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and sustained: Period 24-28 average demand is 137.0 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~100 units established at Period 13.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward shifts. After the initial baseline of ~51 units (P1-P12), it rose to ~100 units (P13-P23), and has further increased since P24. The average demand across the most recent 7 periods (P23-P29) is approximately 137 units. Current on-hand inventory is 28 units, with a substantial pipeline of 573 units. However, recent stockouts indicate that our previous base stock targets were too low for this new demand level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this latest high-demand regime (avg ~137), ensuring the pipeline is sufficient to cover (L+1) periods of this higher demand. Sigma_hat is also updated using the same recent window to account for increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and sustained: Period 23-29 average demand is 137.9 units, establishing a new peak significantly higher than the previous P13-P22 baseline of ~100.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regimental shifts. The first occurred around Period 13 (shifting from ~50 to ~100) and the second around Period 24 (further increasing to a mean of ~140). The most recent 7 periods (P24-P30) show an average demand of 134.7 units, despite some volatility (range 100-174). On-hand inventory is currently 62, and the pipeline is significant (533 units), representing approximately 4 periods of the current demand mean. Since lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' to use the observed history. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the most recent high-demand regime starting from P24, ensuring the OR backend targets the 135-140 unit baseline instead of the lower historical averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $530.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple regime shifts. Starting at Period 13, demand increased from ~50 to ~100. More recently, since Period 24, demand has spiked further, averaging 139.8 units over the last 8 periods (P24-P31). The most recent demand (P31) was 155. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. With on-hand inventory recovered to 90 and a significant pipeline of 499 units (orders from P28-P31), the goal is to prevent a return to stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs if this high-demand period is a peak rather than a permanent new floor. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime (approx. 140/period). The OR backend's service level logic (profit $4 vs holding $1) will target a ~80% service level, appropriate for this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: Period 24-31 average demand is 139.8 units, compared to the Period 13-22 average of ~100.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 24. For the most recent 9 periods (P24-P32), the average demand is approximately 135.4 units, with a notable peak of 174 in P24 and a recent low of 100 in P28. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the service level (0.8) suggests we should target a base stock that covers demand across the review and lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Current on-hand is 84 and in-transit is 537. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I am choosing 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the average of the most recent stabilized high-demand regime since P24, and the same for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~135 units starting Period 24 (P24-P32 average: 135.4). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $491.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 24. Since Period 24, the demand has averaged approximately 135 units (Period 24-33 mean is 134.3). The previous peaks seen around Period 24-26 (up to 174 units) have moderated, settling into a range between 130 and 155. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. With 45 units on hand and 564 units in transit (which is sufficient pipeline to cover the 5-period risk window of ~670-700 units total), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime (Periods 24-33). This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current 135-unit baseline rather than being skewed by the lower initial periods or the early-regime outliers.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 24. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P24-P34), the average demand is 127.3 units. While earlier forecasts aimed for ~135-140 units, the most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) show a slightly lower average of 132.8 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 68 and a large in-transit pipeline of 562 units, the system needs to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N=11 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend calculates mu_hat based on the average of ~127 units per period. This provides a balanced approach to satisfy demand while managing holding costs as the large pipeline starts arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 24: P24-P34 average demand is 127.3 units, significantly higher than the initial P1-P12 baseline (~51) and the intermediate P13-P23 baseline (~100).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 24. Since Period 24, the demand has averaged approximately 134 units per period (P24-P35 average = 135.2), with occasional peaks like P24 (174) and P26 (160), and more recent stability between 108 and 147. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 74, with a healthy in-transit pipeline of 508 units. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the backend targeting a high service level is appropriate. To prevent the stockouts seen between P21 and P28, I will use a 12-period window (P24-P35) to capture the current regime's mean and variance effectively, as this period represents the most recent sustained demand shift.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 24. Analyzing the last 13 periods (P24-P36), the mean demand is approximately 136.1 units. While there were significant spikes (e.g., 174 in P24, 160 in P26, 162 in P36), the recent trend indicates a sustained level around 135-140 units. The current on-hand inventory is 74, and the in-transit pipeline is healthy at 490 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific high-demand regime while filtering out the much lower demand from the first half of the game. L will remain at the promised/observed 4 periods to ensure the inventory covers the full lead time plus the current period (L+1=5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at ~136 units since Period 24 (P24-P36 average: 136.1), specifically replacing the previous peak estimates with a more precise 13-period average.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 24. Analyzing the actual demand samples from Period 24 to Period 37, the mean demand is approximately 139.6 units per period. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P34-P37) show demand of 108, 143, 162, and 171, indicating a potentially increasing trend or high volatility within this new cluster (average of 146 over these 4 periods). The current on-hand inventory is low (25 units), though there is a substantial pipeline (540 units). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), it is optimal to maintain a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 (covering the stable regime from Period 24 to 37) to capture the current mean demand of ~140 units per period. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=14 to reflect the volatility in this high-demand stage. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the lead time plus one period (L+1=5) at the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 24-37 confirmed stable at a mean of 139.6 units, significantly higher than the previous Period 13-23 baseline (~100).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 24. For the period range P24-P38 (15 samples), the average demand is 140.2 units. This is a significant increase from the original baseline (~51) and the intermediate baseline (~100). Recent history shows demand frequently exceeding 150 units (P36: 162, P37: 171, P38: 161), causing a stockout in Period 38 despite higher arrival volumes. To ensure high service levels (q = 0.8) and account for this sustained peak, I will use recent_N with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current regime (P24 onwards) while providing enough variance to handle the volatility seen in the last three periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data, so the default method is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P24-P38 average confirmed at 140.2 units, significantly higher than the previous P13-P23 baseline of ~100. Recent focus on P36-P38 shows a further push toward 160+ units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. While the average from Period 24 to Period 38 was approximately 140 units, the most recent three periods (P37-P39) have shown a pivot towards a higher level, with demand reaching 171, 161, and 200 units respectively. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the SKU is in a stockout state despite a healthy in-transit pipeline of 660 units. Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we must set parameters that prevent persistent stockouts under this new higher demand intensity. I am choosing N=5 forRecent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest surge (P35-P39 mean \u2248 167) while maintaining a high service level. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift intensified starting Period 37: Last 3 periods (P37-P39) demand averaged 177.3 units, compared to the P24-P36 average of ~136.

Daily Reward (R_t): $576.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant escalation. After a stable regime of ~136 units (P24-P36), demand spiked again starting Period 37. The last four periods (P37-P40) show a mean demand of 169.25 units (171, 161, 200, 145), indicating a move toward a new baseline likely around 170-180 units. The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) because the previous orders were based on the P24 benchmark. To recover and meet this new surge, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 samples (P37-P40) to capture this most recent acceleration. Sigma_hat is also calculated using these recent 4 periods to account for the heightened volatility observed (up to 200 units). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods as confirmed by P40 arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift intensified at Period 37: P37-P40 average demand is 169.3 units, representing an approximately 25% increase over the previous P24-P36 baseline of ~136 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $578.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple regime shifts, with the most recent baseline established around Period_37. Over the last five periods (P37-P41), demand samples are [171, 161, 200, 145, 150], resulting in a recent mean of 165.4 units per period. This represents a significant increase from the previous Period 24-36 baseline of ~136 units. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Since we are at Period 42 with only 8 periods remaining in the game (and a 4-period lead time), we must ensure the pipeline inventory is sufficient to cover this higher demand level for the remainder of the simulation. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest high-demand regime while filtering out the lower historical data. This approach allows the OR backend to set a higher base stock level to mitigate the recent stockout risks while balancing the holding cost (Profit=4, Holding=1 suggests a target service level of 80%).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 37: P37-P41 average demand is 165.4 units, a 21.6% increase over the P24-P36 average of 136.1 units. This represents the third major upward shift in demand for this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $804.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing its third significant upward demand shift. The regime that started around Period 37 has shown an average demand of 165.4 units over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), including a peak of 223 in Period 42. Comparing this to the previous baseline of ~136-140 units (P24-P36), there is a clear and sustained increase of approximately 20-25%. Despite regular arrivals, the SKU frequently stocks out because the base stock hasn't fully accounted for this new volatility and higher mean. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P37-P42) to capture the current high-demand environment (N=6). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to account for the increased variance seen in this recent peak. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by latest arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37 confirmed and sustained: P37-P42 average demand is 175.0 units, a 28.5% increase over the previous P24-P36 baseline (~136). The SKU is currently experiencing high volatility with a recent peak of 223 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward shifts, with the most recent regime clearly established at Period 37. Analyzing the data from Period 37 to Period 43, the demand samples are: 171, 161, 200, 145, 150, 223, and 177. This results in a 7-period average (N=7) of 175.3 units. Given the high profitability ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend's service level target (q) is approximately 80%, necessitating a robust inventory position. The carry-over insights confirm the lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we are in Period 44 and the game ends at Period 50, the pipeline will only deliver orders placed up to Period 46. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the volatility and mean of the current high-demand regime, ensuring the 'base stock' covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37 is sustained: P37-P43 average is 175.3 units (N=7), representing the highest sustained demand level to date.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone three distinct upward shifts. The most recent shift occurred at Period 37, where demand increased from a baseline of ~136 units to an average of 175.7 units (P37-P44). Recent volatility is high, with demand hitting 223 units in P42. The system is currently recovering from a stockout phase, with on-hand inventory at 23 and a large pipeline of 727 units. To stabilize service levels at this new higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture only the periods since the P37 shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. The most recent shift occurred at Period 37, where demand increased from a baseline of ~136 to a higher sustained level. Analyzing the demand from Period 37 to Period 45 (N=9), the average demand is 174.6 units per period. Recent volatility is high, with a peak of 223 units. In terms of lead time, the observed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 41 order at the end of Period 45). To ensure the base stock levels are responsive to this sustained high-demand regime while accounting for recent variation, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 (capturing the regime from P37 onwards) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the need for a stable average with the necessity of protecting against the current high volatility. Lead time L will remain at the promised 'default' of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37 confirmed and stable: P37-P45 average demand is 174.6 units (N=9), representing a ~28% increase over the previous P24-P36 baseline (~136).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 37, currently averaging 174.3 units (P37-P46) compared to the previous Period 24-36 baseline of ~136. Recent demand remains high and volatile (ranging from 145 to 223), leading to intermittent stockouts despite significant in-transit inventory (762 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent 4-period arrival cycles (e.g., P42 order arriving at the end of P46). To address the current demand level and volatility while managing the 4-period lead time, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period history. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 (covering P37-P46) to capture the 174.3 mean. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current regime's volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37 stabilized: P37-P46 average demand is 174.3 units, representing a ~28% increase over the previous P24-P36 baseline (~136).

Daily Reward (R_t): $884.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in the regime established around Period 37. The average demand from Period 37 to Period 47 is approximately 174 units. Recent demand has shown high volatility (e.g., P42 at 223, P47 at 222), leading to periodic stockouts. The inventory position currently shows on-hand at 4 and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 690 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given we are near the end of the simulation (P48 of 50), the goal is to maintain service levels without over-ordering for the final periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (the length of the current regime from P37-P47) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility baseline accurately. L will be set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is stable and confirmed by history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $581.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand regime that began around Period 37. The average demand from Period 37 to Period 48 is approximately 174 units, with significant volatility (highs of 223, lows of 145). The current on-hand inventory is 47, and there is a robust pipeline in-transit (712 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the system targets a high service level (80th percentile). My parameters reflect the recent high-demand regime (N=12, covering P37-P48) to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover the (L+1) window, which is 5 periods of demand at approximately 174 units per period. Using recent_N for both mean and sigma allows the OR backend to quickly adapt to the increased volume and volatility of this third major demand shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $560.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a high baseline since Period 37, with an average of approximately 174 units. Recent demand (P45-P49) reflects this, averaging 161.8 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 1 period remaining in the game (Period 50), the order placed now will arrive in Period 54 (4 periods later), which is beyond the game horizon. Therefore, the priority is to maintain inventory levels for the immediate demand resolution of Period 50. The current on-hand inventory is 68 units, which is significantly lower than the expected demand for Period 50 (~174 units). However, the system logic dictates that current orders will not arrive until Period 54. I will set the parameters to reflect the current high-demand regime using N=13 (from Period 37 to 49) to ensure the OR backend's target base stock is aligned with the most recent sustained demand shift, even though the order itself will arrive post-game.
