The initial samples suggested an even higher trajectory (P5: 544). I will estimate average demand at ~400 units/period to be safe. \nOrder Logic: I need to cover demand until the next order can arrive. If I order now (P4) with L=4, it arrives in P8 (P4+4). My P1 order (2000 units) must cover demand for P1 through P7 (Arrival of P1 order is P5, Arrival of P4 order is P8).
