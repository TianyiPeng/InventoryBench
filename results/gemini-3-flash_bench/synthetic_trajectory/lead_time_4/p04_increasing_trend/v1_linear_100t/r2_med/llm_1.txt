Historical demand over the first 5 periods (provided in history) shows a strong upward trend: 107, 252, 298, 376, 544. This suggests a rapid growth phase or a significant seasonal buildup. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My decision for Period 1 will arrive in Period 5 and be available for sale/visible in Period 6. Based on the trend, I expect demand by Period 5-6 to exceed the current max of 544. Recommending an order that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods of demand). Given the steep increase, I will forecast an average demand of ~400 units/period over the next 5 periods to ensure I capture the growing volume while acknowledging the $1.00 holding cost. I need to establish a significant pipeline immediately to avoid stockouts in the coming weeks.",

At the start of Period 2, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 2000 units in-transit. Since we already have a large order that exceeds the pipeline requirement (L+1 = 5 periods of demand) to cover the lead time gap, and we are only in Period 2, placing additional orders now would likely result in excessive holding costs once the initial 2000 units arrive.

Inventory & Pipeline: I currently have 0 on-hand and 2000 units in-transit (ordered in Period 1). With a promised lead time of 4 periods, I expect this order to arrive in the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6).

However, if the provided demand samples (showing a climb to 544 units by Period 5) are accurate indicators of the game's actual demand path, those 2000 units might only cover about 4-5 periods. Forecast Logic: I need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. P3 demand + P4 + P5 + P6 + P7. Even with the aggressive growth trend, the 2000 units in-transit satisfy current and intermediate needs.

The order placed in P1 (2000 units) is expected to arrive during P5 (this period) and will be visible at the start of P6. Therefore, current on-hand (0) will remain 0 for P5 sales, leading to continued stockouts. Pipeline Analysis: In-transit is 2500 (2000 from P1, 500 from P4).
