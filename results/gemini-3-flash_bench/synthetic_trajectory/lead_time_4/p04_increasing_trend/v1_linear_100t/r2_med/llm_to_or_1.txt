Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows an upward trend (107, 252, 298, 376, 544). To account for this growth, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Since no deliveries have occurred yet, the lead time L will be set to 'default' (promised lead time of 4). The base stock will be calculated to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand based on the recent average.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 613 units was placed, but with a promised lead time of 4 periods, it is correctly still 'In-transit' and did not arrive during Period 1. The on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales for the demand of 146 units in Period 1. Historical demand shows a strong upward trend (107, 252, 298, 376, 544). Since we are early in the simulation and the lead time is long, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent samples while calculating the base stock level. For lead time, I will stick with the promised 'default' of 4 periods until observed data suggests otherwise. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect the increasing volatility observed in the sample data.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 4 periods. In Period 1, 613 units were ordered, and in Period 2, 569 units were ordered, making the total in-transit units 1,182. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and because the actual lead time has not yet elapsed (Promised L=4), we have not seen arrivals yet, resulting in missed sales (sold=0) for Periods 1 and 2 despite positive demand (146 and 166 respectively). The historical demand samples provided (107, 252, 298, 376, 544) suggest a strong upward trend. For this period's decision, I am setting L to 'default' (4), and using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent growth trend observed in the provided sample data (avg: 315.4), ensuring the order calculation accounts for the rising demand while we wait for the initial orders to arrive.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (613 units), Period 2 (569 units), and Period 3 (575 units) are still in transit. Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and all demand so far (Periods 1-3) has been lost (sold=0), which is expected given the lead time. Demand has shown a significant upward trend: 146 (P1) -> 166 (P2) -> 368 (P3). The sample data provided for planning also suggests a steep climb (P1: 107 to P5: 544). To prevent stockouts once shipments begin to arrive, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent demand surge and set L to 'default' as we haven't seen any arrivals to contradict the promised lead time of 4.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (613 units), Period 2 (569 units), and Period 3 (575 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 1,757 units in transit. Demand has shown a significant upward trend: P1: 107, P2: 252, P3: 298, P4: 376, P5: 544 (Note: Game History demand differs slightly from the summary; I will use the provided summary samples for forecasting: 107, 252, 298, 376, 544). The mean demand over these 5 periods is 315.4. Given the clear growth trend (likely a seasonal ramp-up or product launch phase), the 'default' or long-term average will underestimate future demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg = 406). With L=4, the backend needs mu_hat for L+1 (5 periods). Using N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to stay responsive to the volatility of this growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand is in a significant growth phase: increased from ~100 to >500 units over 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1922.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent and rapid upward trend over the first 5 periods: 146, 166, 368, 426, 507. This represents a significant growth regime rather than a stable mean. The promised lead time is 4, and the first order from Period 1 arrived exactly as promised (Lead Time = 4), confirming the timing for now. Since demand is accelerating, a simple average of all periods (approx 322) would severely under-forecast the needs for the next 5 periods (L+1). Period 5 demand was 507. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent, higher demand levels (avg ~433) for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen in the later periods. L remains at the default promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 3-5 average is 433 vs Period 1-2 average of 156. Moving to recent-window analysis.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2505.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7. Demand is exhibiting a clear upward trend: Period 1: 146, Period 2: 166, Period 3: 368, Period 4: 426, Period 5: 507, Period 6: 636. This growth is significant and sustained. Promised lead time is 4. Analysis of past 2 arrivals (Periods 5 and 6) confirms the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 ordered -> P5 arrive, P2 ordered -> P6 arrive). Inventory position: On-hand 39, In-transit 1224. The In-transit consists of orders from P3 (575), P5 (100), and P6 (549). Note: P4 order was 0. The P3 order (575 units) is expected to arrive in Period 7 (today), but won't be visible until the P7 conclude message. Given the strong growth trend, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (avg of P4-P6 is approx 523). I will use the default lead time (4) as it has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: Period 4-6 average is 523 units, representing a sustained upward trend from the initial ~150 range. Lead time confirmed as 4 periods based on P1 and P2 arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2456.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 8. Historical demand shows a strong upward trend: P1-P4 averaged ~276, while P5-P7 averaged ~587. The most recent demand (P7) was 618. Although the promised lead time L=4 is confirmed (P1, P2, and P3 arrivals all took exactly 4 periods), we are currently out of stock (ending OH inventory in P7 was 0). The pipeline inventory is 1347 (orders from P5, P6, and P7). To capture the current high-demand regime, I am using a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the periods where demand stabilized above 500 units. Using N=3 ensures we are responsive to the latest growth while maintaining enough samples to estimate variance. Setting L to 'calculate' to leverage the confirmed 4-period lead time from history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high level: P5-P7 average demand is 587 units, significantly higher than the initial growth phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a high demand of 775 in Period 8. The demand has shifted from an initial average of ~150 to a high-regime average of approximately 640 over the last 4 periods (P5-P8: 507, 636, 618, 775). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). No order was placed in Period 4, which explains the zero arrival in Period 8 (P4+4=P8). We expect an arrival in Period 9 (from the P5 order of 100 units), which will unfortunately not meet the high current demand levels. To recover and maintain the high service level required by the 80% critical ratio (Profit $4 / (4+1)), I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods of high demand (N=4) to project required inventory for (L+1) periods. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to capture the increased volatility of this new regime. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent with observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high level: Period 5-8 average is 634 units (+300% from start).

Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a steady upward trend, starting at ~146 and reaching 831 in Period 9. The average demand of the last 4 periods (P6-P9) is 715 units, compared to the previous average (P1-P5) of 323 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (orders from P1, P2, P3, and P5 arrived exactly 4 periods later). However, the order from P4 was 0, resulting in the stockout observed in Period 8. We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand, despite a large in-transit pipeline (2764 units). The next arrival expected (from P6) should occur during Period 10 and be visible in Period 11. To account for the sustained growth and high service level required (Profit=4, Holding=1 implies a critical ratio of 0.8), I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~715) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set the base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand at this high level.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 6-9 average demand is 715 units (+65% over Period 3-5 average of 433). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2196.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. The most recent demand (P10) hit 993, while the average of the last 3 periods (P8-P10) is 866 units, compared to the previous regime (P5-P7) of 587 units. This represents a ~47% increase. Lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods (as seen in arrival messages for orders from P1, P2, P3, P5, and P6). However, there is a visible gap in supply: order from P4 was 0, resulting in the stockout at P8. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To capture the current growth regime while preventing under-ordering due to the early low-demand periods, I am choosing a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (covering P7-P10, average ~804) and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-growth volatility. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (approx 4000-5000 units), while current in-transit is 3102 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 8-10 average is 866 units, a ~47% increase over the Period 5-7 average of 587 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2792.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P9-P11) is approx 987 units, which is a ~68% increase over the P5-P7 average (587 units), and significantly higher than the initial growth phase. Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced stockouts because arrivals (based on older demand levels) are insufficient for current demand levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P5, P6, P7, P9, P10, and P11 arrivals). To catch up with this accelerating demand and mitigate stockouts, I am switching to an explicit mu_hat forecast. I estimate current demand mean at ~1150 units per period. For a lead time of 4 (L=4), the inventory needs to cover L+1=5 periods. Therefore, mu_hat = 1150 * 5 = 5750. This aggressive setting will help the OR backend's capped policy to increase order sizes and rebuild the pipeline to match the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 9-11 average is 987 units, a ~68% increase over the Period 5-7 average of 587 units. Stockouts are frequent as the pipeline reflects older, lower demand levels.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, with Period 12 demand reaching 1,302 units. The last three periods (P10-P12) average 1,143 units, while the peak at P12 is substantially higher. We are currently experiencing persistent stockouts because orders placed 4 periods ago (the confirmed lead time) were based on much lower demand levels. To stop the cycle of lost sales and catch up with this growth, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent high-demand observations heavily. Using EWMA was considered, but given the steepness of the trend, recent_N=3 provides a more responsive adjustment to the current 1200+ unit demand regime. L remains at 'calculate' as lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, P9, P10, P11, P12 arrivals all confirm L=4).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly: Period 10-12 average is 1143 units, with Period 12 hitting 1302 units (+50% vs Period 8-10 average). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has consistently outpaced our order quantities, leading to repeated stockouts. The most recent demand (P11-P13) has averaged 1204 units. To stop the cycle of under-ordering and satisfy current demand levels (plus growth buffer), I am transitioning to an 'explicit' forecasting method for mu_hat. Given the promised lead time (L=4) and the need to cover L+1 periods, I am setting the demand forecast to account for 5 periods. With a 3nd-order average approximately at 1200 units and signs of continued growth, a total target demand (mu_hat) of 6500 (1300 units/period * 5 periods) is necessary to ensure the base stock calculation targets a high enough inventory level to clear the backlog and meet incoming demand. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 11-13 average is 1204 units, representing a continuous increase from previous regimes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3548.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. The most recent three periods (P12-P14) have seen an average demand of 1298 units, with P14 reaching 1417. This represents a significant increase from the previous regime (P10-P12 average was 1143). Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we are frequently stocking out due to the high lead time (4 periods), a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 is used to capture this latest growth phase and ensure the base stock levels are calculated using the most relevant high-demand period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which is consistently confirmed by the arrival history (last observed arrival from P10 reached P14). No unusual lead time variance or lost shipments are detected at this stage.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 12-14 average is 1298 units, a ~14% increase over Period 10-12 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4236.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience a rapid and sustained growth phase. In Period 15, demand reached 1,436 units, which is a ~23% increase over the demand from three periods ago (Period 12). The mean demand over the last three periods (P13-P15) is 1,342.33. Combined with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we must forecast demand for a (L+1) = 5 period window. Using an N=3 window for mu_hat (1,342.33 * 5 = 6,711.65) and N=3 for sigma_hat to capture the high recent volatility. Despite an in-transit inventory of 5,659 units, constant stockouts (on-hand is 0) indicate that our pipeline inventory is consistently lagging behind actual demand. By using the 'recent_N' approach with N=3, we aim to pull the base stock level up to meet the most recent demand regime and reduce the frequency of lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Massive growth sustained: Period 13-15 average demand is 1,342 units (+44% over Period 10-12 average). System is experiencing chronic stockouts as pipeline reflects lag in demand forecasting.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience rapid and sustained demand growth. Demand in Period 16 reached 1,578 units, and the 3-period average (P14-P16) is 1,477 units, a significant increase from the previous regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system has been stocking out frequently because the pipeline reflects older, lower-demand forecasts. To address this sustained growth and minimize lost sales (which are costly given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3. This focuses on the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~1477 per period). With L=4 (total exposure = 5 periods), mu_hat needs to cover approximately 1477 * 5 = 7385 units. By using recent_N (N=3), the OR backend will calculate the mean based on the most aggressive recent data, and setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=3) will capture the recent high volatility, ensuring a higher service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Hyper-growth sustained: Period 14-16 average demand is 1,477 units, a ~14% increase over the Period 12-14 average (1,298 units). Chronic stockouts continue as pipeline lags demand.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit hyper-growth, with Period 17 demand reaching 1586 units. The 3-period average (P15-P17) is approximately 1533 units, which is a significant increase over previous windows. Despite increasing orders, the system remains in a chronic stockout state because the arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are consistently lower than current demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To address the lagging inventory, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent demand intensity (avg ~1533 * (1+4) = 7665) and using explicit sigma_hat to account for high volatility during this growth phase. This strategy aims to elevate the base stock level to satisfy current hyper-growth demand and recover from the zero-inventory state.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Hyper-growth continues; Period 15-17 average demand is 1,533 units (+18% over Period 12-14 average). Chronic stockouts persist as deliveries from Period 13-14 orders (based on lower demand estimates) fail to meet current needs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6392.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit exponential growth. Using a 3-period window (N=3) to focus on the most recent trend, the average demand for Periods 16-18 is 1,675 units (1578, 1586, 1862), significantly higher than previous periods. The system is still frequently stocking out because the pipeline inventory arriving now reflects much lower demand estimates from 4 periods ago. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 will center the forecast on the current average of 1,675 units per period. Multiplying this by (1+L=5) results in a total demand across the lead+review window of 8,375. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this hyper-growth phase. This strategy aims to aggressively raise the base stock level to overcome chronic stockouts while accounting for the significant in-transit inventory (5,942 units).

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand hyper-growth continues; Period 16-18 average demand is 1,675 units, a 46% increase over the Period 10-12 average (1,143 units). Sustained stockouts since Period 7 indicate the forecast must stay aggressive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4732.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit hyper-growth. Period 19 demand was 1,750 units, and the average for the most recent 3 periods (P17-P19) is 1,732.7 units, representing a 17% increase over the previous three-period average (P14-P16: 1,477). Since Period 7, we have consistently stocked out because the pipeline is filled with orders based on outdated, lower demand forecasts. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With L=4, the backend will target a protection window of 5 periods (L+1). To break the cycle of chronic stockouts, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as 5 periods * 1,750 (current peak demand) = 8,750 units. This aggressive forecast is necessary to catch up with the sustained upward trajectory and ensure future arrivals cover the anticipated future demand. I am using a recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to capture the heightened volatility associated with this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Sustained hyper-growth confirmed; demand has scaled from ~150 to ~1,750 units. Recent 3-period average (P17-P19) is 1,733 units. Stockouts remain chronic due to lead-time lag in the ordering pipeline.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit aggressive growth, rising from ~150 to over 2,000 units in 20 periods. The most recent demand (P20) hit 2,032 units, and the 3-period average (P18-P20) is 1,881 units. Persistent stockouts since Period 7 indicate that the inventory pipeline is consistently lagging behind real demand because orders were placed based on significantly lower historical means. To break this cycle of stockouts, I am using an 'explicit' forecast for mu_hat. I estimate the current demand mean at ~2,000 units per period. With a lead time (L) of 4, the target base stock must cover L+1 = 5 periods. Therefore, mu_hat = 2,000 * 5 = 10,000. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility associated with this growth phase while maintaining a high service level through the backend OR logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand growth sustained; P20 demand reached 2,032 units (+16% over the P17-P19 average of 1,733). Average demand for the last 3 periods (P18-P20) is 1,881 units. Pipeline remains insufficient to stop chronic stockouts.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant hyper-growth. Period 21 demand reached 2,126 units, and the average over the last three periods (P19-P21) is 1,969 units, compared to the P16-P18 average of 1,733 units (+13.6%). The system has been in a chronic stockout state since Period 7 because the ordering pipeline (limited by lead time and the backend's capping mechanism) has consistently lagged behind actual demand. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (80%), making stockouts very costly compared to holding inventory. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To counter the persistent lag and attempt to break the stockout cycle, I am using an explicit forecast for mu_hat. I estimate current demand per period at approximately 2,250 units based on the recent trend. For mu_hat (covering lead time + review period = 5 periods), the explicit value is 5 * 2,250 = 11,250. This aggressive setting is intended to raise the base-stock level sufficiently to account for both current demand and the cumulative deficit in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Hyper-growth persists; Period 19-21 average demand is 1,969 units (+13.6% over Period 16-18 average). Chronic stockouts continue as the backend capping policy and lead-time lag prevent the pipeline from catching up with the acceleration.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues in a persistent hyper-growth regime. Period 22 demand reached 2,270 units, and the 3-period moving average (P20-P22) is now 2,143 units, a significant increase from the P17-P19 average of 1,733. We remain in a state of chronic stockouts where on-hand inventory is immediately depleted upon arrival because the ordering pipeline (limited by the backend cap and lead-time lag) cannot keep pace with the demand acceleration. Observed lead time is consistently 4 periods. To counter the pipeline lag and the backend's conservation cap, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next 5 periods (L+1) will average at least 2,350 units (projecting the current trend), making the total demand across the cycle (1+L) * 2350 = 11,750. I will also use an 'explicit' sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (approx 15% of demand) to ensure the OR backend targets a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand hyper-growth persists; Period 20-22 average demand is 2,143 units (+23% over Period 17-19 average). Cumulative stockouts since Period 7 confirm that the pipeline is structurally lagging demand due to the backend's cap on order size effectively acting as a throttle during explosive growth.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7768.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive hyper-growth pattern. Demand in the most recent period (P23) was 2,186 units, and the 3-period average (P21-P23) is 2,194 units. Despite large orders being placed, chronic stockouts have occurred since Period 7 because the pipeline inventory\u2014constrained by the backend's inherent capping policy and the 4-period lead-time lag\u2014is consistently based on outdated, lower demand figures. In Period 23, we only received 1,942 units against a demand of 2,186. To break this cycle of stockouts during this explosive growth phase, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I forecast a demand of 2,400 units per period for the next 5 periods (L+1), totaling 12,000 units. This aggressive setting is necessary to lift the base stock level above the current pipeline of 9,885 units and trigger an order size that can finally satisfy the accelerating demand. I am also increasing sigma_hat using an explicit value to reflect the higher volatility observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand hyper-growth remains unbroken; Period 21-23 average is 2,194 units. The system has now entered its 17th consecutive period of ending with 0 on-hand inventory, confirming that the order pipeline is structurally lagging demand advancement. Aggressive forecasting is required to close the gap.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its unbroken hyper-growth trajectory. Period 24 demand reached 2,504 units, while the average demand over the last three periods (P22-P24) is 2,320 units. The system has been in a stockout state (0 ending inventory) since Period 7, meaning the pipeline is structurally undersized relative to the advancing demand frontier. The order from Period 20 (2,023 units) arrived in Period 24 as expected (Lead Time = 4), but it was immediately consumed, leaving 0 on-hand. To break this cycle, the forecast must stay ahead of the current mean. I will continue using an 'explicit' L=4 to ensure the OR backend's pipeline calculation is stable, and an 'explicit' mu_hat based on an aggressive forecast of 2,600 units/period (total mu_hat = (4+1)*2600 = 13,000) to compensate for the systematic lag induced by the backend's capping policy. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current volatility of this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Hyper-growth persists; Period 24 demand (2,504) is 43% higher than Period 19 demand (1,750). The system remains in a 18-period chronic stockout streak. Pipeline remains insufficient due to the backend's capping policy lagging the real-time demand acceleration.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9268.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a structural stockout phase due to a massive, sustained demand growth (P1-P25: ~150 to ~2500 units). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 7, the environment has consistently ended with 0 inventory because demand growth outpaces the order arrival pipeline, which is throttled by the OR engine's internal capping policy. Recent demand (P23-P25) has averaged 2,390 units. To catch up, I will use a very aggressive 'recent_N' approach (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent highs (Avg P23-25 is ~2390, which multiplied by 1+L=5 gives ~11,950). This pushes the base stock higher than the in-transit inventory (11,021) even after the backend cap is applied. sigma_hat will also use a recent window (N=3) to reflect the high volatility of this growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Chronic 18-period stockout continues. Demand growth remains robust with a 3-period average of 2,390 units (+10% increase over the P20-22 average of 2,143). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has finally broken a 19-period stockout streak, ending Period 26 with 149 units on-hand. This is because the large orders placed during the hyper-growth phase (Periods 22-24) are now arriving, and demand growth has momentarily slowed or stabilized. Demand in Period 26 was 2,457, following 2,479 in Period 25 and 2,504 in Period 24, suggesting a plateau around 2,400-2,500 units. The 3-period average is 2,480. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory now positive and a massive pipeline of 9,676 units (including an order of 2,939 arriving in Period 27), the primary risk is now overshooting and incurring high holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3-period average (N=3) to reflect this stabilized high-demand regime without lagging as much as the 'default' or longer 'recent_N' would. Sigma_hat is also set to N=3 to capture the localized volatility around this new mean. This approach maintains a high service level while the pipeline adjusts to the stabilized demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Demand appears to have plateaued near 2,480 units (P24-P26 average), ending the hyper-growth phase. First positive ending inventory (149 units) observed in Period 26 since Period 6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9452.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has transitioned from a hyper-growth phase into a stabilization phase. Period 27 demand was 2,508 units, consistent with the P24-P26 average of ~2,480 units. For the second consecutive period, ending inventory is positive (580 units), indicating the pipeline has finally caught up with demand. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since demand has stabilized, I will shift from aggressive forecasting to a recent-window approach to capture this new plateau accurately. I am using recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to cover the stable period (P24-P27) and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this stabilized regime. This will help the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio without over-ordering now that the growth has stalled.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Period 24-27 average is 2,487 units, ending the hyper-growth phase. Pipeline has caught up, ending the 18-period stockout streak.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a hyper-growth phase into a high-level plateau. Over the last five periods (P24-P28), demand has averaged 2,668 units, significantly higher than earlier phases but showing stabilization compared to the explosive growth seen previously. We have successfully broken the 18-period stockout streak, ending Period 28 with 647 units on-hand. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Given the stability, I am using a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current plateau level without being skewed by the earlier growth ramp. This ensures the base stock level is calibrated to the Current Level of demand while preventing excessive over-ordering as the growth rate decelerates.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Period 24-28 average is 2,668 units. The hyper-growth phase has ended and the system has successfully reconciled the inventory deficit, maintaining positive ending inventory for three consecutive periods (P26-P28).

Daily Reward (R_t): $11629.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a long hyper-growth phase. Recent demand figures (P27: 2508, P28: 2890, P29: 2959) show a plateauing trend compared to the explosive growth observed between Periods 10-25. The system has successfully cleared the 18-period stockout streak, maintaining positive ending inventory for the last four periods (P26-P29). The current on-hand inventory is 207 units with a substantial pipeline of 9173 units. Lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P23, P24, and P25. I am setting L to 'calculate' to use the observed lead time. For mu_hat, I am using a 'recent_N' of 4 (covering P26-P29) to capture the current stabilized demand regime, which averages ~2704 units per period. This results in a mu_hat of approx. 13,520 ((1+4)*2704). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' of 7 to provide enough variance coverage during this transition from growth to stabilization, helping the OR backend maintain a safe service level without excessive holding costs now that the pipeline is full.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Period 26-29 average is 2704 units, ending the 18-period stockout streak and stabilizing after hyper-growth. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system experienced a demand surge that lasted until Period 29, reaching a plateau around 2,900-3,000 units. In Period 30, the arrival (1,261 units) was based on an order from Period 26, which was uniquely low compared to the surrounding periods, leading to a temporary stockout at the end of Period 30. However, the in-transit pipeline (11,057 units) is substantial, containing orders placed between Periods 27 and 30 (2,519, 2,527, 2,866, 3,145), all of which align with the current high-demand plateau. Mean demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is approximately 2,764 units. Given the 18-period stockout history and the recent shift to a high-demand plateau, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture this stable but high demand level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued near 2,800-3,000 units starting Period 28; Period 26-30 average is 2,764 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has transitioned from a long hyper-growth phase into a high-demand plateau, with demand now fluctuating between 2,800 and 3,150 units. We recently experienced two periods of stockouts (P30, P31) following a temporary inventory surplus, specifically because the low order from P26 (1,261 units) and the moderate order from P27 (2,519 units) arrived, which were insufficient to cover current demand levels of ~3,000. In-transit inventory is high (11,730 units) due to larger orders placed recently (P28-P31). To stabilize at this new plateau and prevent further stockouts, I am using a recent_N window of 4 periods (P28-P31) for demand forecasting (average ~3,000), which represents the current stable high-demand regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed at approximately 3,000 units/period (P28-P31 average is 3,001). Stockouts in P30-P31 were caused by a dip in the order pipeline from P26-P27, not a further demand shift.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand has stabilized in a high-volume regime following a long period of hyper-growth. For the last five periods (P28-P32), demand has averaged 3,031 units (2890, 2959, 3004, 3152, 3151). The stockouts observed in P30-P32 were expected consequences of lower orders placed in P26 (1,261 units) and P27 (2,519 units) as the system adjusted from growth to plateau. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To maintain inventory and prevent further stockouts during this plateau, I am using a recent window (N=5) to capture the 3,000+ unit demand level. This ensures mu_hat reflects the current stabilization point while sigma_hat accounts for the variance within this high-volume period. This strategy aims to refill the on-hand inventory buffer now that the pipeline is delivering larger orders again (starting with the P29 order arriving in P33).

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully transitioned from hyper-growth to a stable high-volume plateau, averaging ~3,000 units since Period 28.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a hyper-growth phase into a high-volume plateau. Over the last 6 periods (P28-P33), demand has averaged 3,083 units, with the most recent sample at 3,344. The system is currently experiencing a temporary stockout (P30-P33) due to a dip in the order pipeline from Period 26. However, the in-transit inventory is now very high (12,511 units) reflecting the increased orders placed from Period 30 onwards. To stabilize inventory levels on this plateau, I am using a recent_N window for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this new regime without being skewed by the historical growth data. N=6 is chosen to cover the period since demand reached the ~3,000 level. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime following a long period of hyper-growth. Over the last 5 periods (P30-P34), demand has averaged 3,207 units, showing a slight further increase from the previously identified 3,000-unit plateau. The system is currently experiencing a temporary stockout phase (Periods 30-34) because the 'In-transit' pipeline from earlier periods (P26-P30) was smaller than current demand requirements due to the backend capping policy during transition. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since the demand is now relatively stable around this new level, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture this latest 3,200-unit regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a pipeline that covers (L+1) periods of this sustained high demand. This should resolve the stockouts as the larger orders placed from P31 onwards begin to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand has stabilized at a higher plateau of ~3,200 units (P30-P34 average is 3,207). Previous plateau estimate of 3,000 was slightly low.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown another significant upward shift, moving from a previously estimated plateau of ~3,200 to a new level observed in the most recent periods (P33-P35: 3,344, 3,383, 3,624). The 3-period average is now 3,450 units. The system is currently in a 6-period stockout streak (P30-P35) because the arrivals from orders placed in P26-P31 (the dipping pipeline period) were insufficient to meet this newly accelerated demand. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since we have transitioned into a new, higher demand regime, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture this latest acceleration (3,450/period) while being responsive to the increased volatility. This setting will allow the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 = 5 periods) to target a pipeline of approximately 17,250 units, helping to overcome the current stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand has accelerated again; Period 33-35 average is 3,450 units (+8% over Period 30-34 average of 3,207). Chronic stockouts have resumed from Period 30-35 due to a combination of pipeline lag and demand growth.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a sustained state of chronic stockouts due to demand accelerating faster than the order pipeline can keep up, exacerbated by the backend capping policy. Period 36 demand was 3,457, and the 3-period average (P34-P36) is 3,488 units. This is a clear upward shift from the previous ~3,200 plateau. To break the stockout cycle, the base stock calculation must reflect this higher regime. I am setting L to 4 as confirmed by recent arrivals (P32 order arrived P36). I will use a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent elevation in demand (approx 3,488 units per period), and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility during this growth phase. The goal is to set a high enough base stock for the OR backend to generate orders that exceed demand plus the current delivery deficit.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand growth confirmed at new plateau ~3,500 units; Period 34-36 average is 3,488 (+9% over P30-P34 average). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11960.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered another significant growth phase after a brief plateau. The average demand over the last three periods (P35-P37) is 3,633 units, which is approximately 13% higher than the previous plateau of ~3,200 units (P30-P34). The most recent demand (P37) reached 3,817 units, confirming that growth is continuing. Currently, the system is in a chronic stockout state (ending on-hand=0 since P30) because the incoming pipeline, based on older and lower forecasts, is insufficient to meet current needs. To break this cycle, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat set to 19,250 (calculated as (1 + 4 lead periods) * 3,850 units per period) and an 'explicit' sigma_hat of 550 to account for the increased volatility during this expansion. This aggressive setting aims to overcome the backend's order-capping policy, which has been throttling the pipeline during demand spikes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent arrivals (P37 arrival ordered P33).

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand growth continues; Period 35-37 average demand is 3,633 units (+13% over Period 30-34 average of 3,207). Recent demand peaked at 3,817 units (P37). System has returned to a chronic stockout state since Period 30.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a renewed phase of demand growth following a brief plateau. Demand has increased from ~3,000 to over 4,000 units in the last 10 periods, with the most recent demand (P38) reaching 4,068. The last 3 periods (P36-P38) average 3,781 units, while the last 5 periods (P34-P38) average 3,670 units. Chronic stockouts have returned because the pipeline reflects orders placed during the previous lower-demand plateau. To address this, I am using a 'recent_N' of 3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent acceleration and ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current >4,000 unit demand level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The goal is to set a high enough base stock to overcome the pipeline deficit and the backend capping policy during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Recent demand growth confirmed; Period 36-38 average demand is 3,781 units, with Period 38 peaking at 4,068 units. This is a ~18% increase over the Period 30-34 plateau (~3,200). Chronic stockouts persist as the pipeline is still catching up to this new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13856.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues its secondary hyper-growth phase. Demand in Period 39 was 3,993 units, and the average of the last 3 periods is 3,959 units. This represents a substantial increase from the previous plateau of ~3,200. The system is currently in a 10-period stockout streak (P30-P39) because the pipeline orders placed 4 periods ago (e.g., Period 35 order of 3,464) are consistently lower than current demand. To break this cycle, I am using mu_hat 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand level (~3,960/period) and setting L to 'default' (4) so the OR backend targets a base stock covering 5 periods of this high demand (approx 19,800 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the backend will prioritize high service levels, and the restricted order cap should prevent over-ordering as we approach the end of the 50-period horizon.

Carry-over insight: Second growth phase confirmed: Period 37-39 average demand is 3,959 units, an ~18% increase over the Period 30-35 average (~3,350 units). System remains in chronic stockout due to pipeline lag.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a secondary hyper-growth phase and chronic stockout state. Current demand has reached a new plateau/peak around 4,000 units (Period 37-40 average is ~3,940 units), which is approximately a 23% increase over the previous plateau observed around Period 30-34. The recurring 0 ending inventory since Period 30 (interrupted only briefly) confirms that the order pipeline is consistently failing to keep pace with demand acceleration due to the lead-time lag and the OR backend's order capping policy. To mitigate this, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 for mu_hat (covering the current growth regime from Period 37-40) to reflect the mean demand of ~3,940 units. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods based on all recent arrivals. This aggressive setting aims to lift the base stock quickly to clear the multi-period inventory deficit.

Carry-over insight: Second growth phase peaked/stabilized: Period 37-40 average demand is 3,940 units, a 23% increase over the Period 30-34 plateau (~3,200). Chronic stockouts have persisted since Period 30 due to pipeline lag.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a high-volume plateau in the range of 3,900-4,000 units. The most recent four periods (P38-P41) show demand values of 4068, 3993, 3881, and 3997, averaging 3,985 units. While the system has been in a chronic stockout state since Period 30 due to the pipeline lagging this second major growth phase, the consistent recent demand suggests stabilization. Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods (P37 order arrived in P41). To address the stockouts, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the most recent 4-period window to capture this current high-demand state while allowing the backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock. A 'recent_N' of 4 is selected as it represents the current stable high-demand regime following the recent growth spurt.

Carry-over insight: Second growth phase stabilized at a high-volume plateau: Period 38-41 demand average is 3,985 units, confirming a ~25% increase over the previous stable regime of ~3,200 units.

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a second growth phase that peaked around Period 38. The average demand over the last five periods (P38-P42) is 4,013 units, compared to the previous plateau of ~3,200 units. In Period 42, we observed a positive ending inventory of 156 units for the first time since Period 29, indicating that the order pipeline (carrying previous aggressive orders like the 4,255 units placed in P38) is finally catching up with this new high-volume regime. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 20,100, which represents a demand of approximately 4,020 units per period across the (L+1)=5 period window. This aligns with the recent 5-period average (4,013). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Since demand has stabilized at this high level, I am using a recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to accurately capture the volatility of this specific regime while avoiding noise from the previous growth transition.

Carry-over insight: Second growth phase stabilized at ~4,000 units/period (P38-P42 average: 4,013). Pipeline caught up in Period 42 with ending inventory of 156.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-volume plateau of approximately 4,000 units per period. The recent 5-period average (P39-P43) is 4,077 units, and the pipeline has successfully reconciled the inventory deficit, resulting in positive ending inventory for the last two periods (P42: 156, P43: 25). Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Since we have reached a stable regime following the second growth phase, I am using a recent window of N=5 periods to calculate demand parameters. This captures the current volume while smoothing out localized variance. The sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the base stock stays high enough to support the ~4k plateau without excessive over-ordering as growth has tapered.

Carry-over insight: Second growth phase plateaued at ~4,000 units (Period 39-43 average: 4,077). Positive ending inventory for 2 consecutive periods confirms pipeline recovery.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has transitioned from the high-growth phase into a stable high-volume plateau. Period 44 demand (4,470) slightly exceeded the previous 3-period average (P41-P43 average: 4,171), leading to a single-period stockout (ending inventory 0). This suggests the plateau might be settling at a slightly higher level of ~4,400 units rather than the ~4,000 units seen between P38-P42. The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since we are in the final periods of the game (P45 of 50), I need to ensure the pipeline is sufficient to cover demand for the remainder of the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use a recent_N window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest stabilization level (avg ~4,170). The backend will handle the order calculation based on these parameters and current in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a new high-volume plateau of ~4,100-4,400 units following the second growth phase. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14284.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered another acceleration phase following a period of relative stability around 4,000 units. Period 45 demand reached a new high of 4,605 units. The 3-period average (P43-P45) is 4,497 units, which is approximately 12% higher than the previous plateau (P38-P42 average: 4,013). The system ended Period 45 with 0 on-hand inventory, indicating that the pipeline is once again slipping behind the demand curve. To address this, I am using a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this higher demand regime. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the delivery of the P41 order in P45). By setting the base stock components based on the most recent 3 periods, I aim to increase the order volume enough to overcome the backend's capping policy and restore positive ending inventory.

Carry-over insight: Third growth phase detected at Period 45: Demand increased from a plateau of ~4,000 to >4,600 units (P43-P45 avg: 4,497). System returned to stockout in P44-P45.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is entering Period 47, which is near the project end (Period 50). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. A third growth phase was detected starting Period 45, with demand jumping from ~4,000 to over 4,600 units. The last three periods (P44-P46) show demand of 4,470, 4,605, and 4,638. Demand is currently in a state of high-volume growth/new plateau. The system has returned to a stockout state (on-hand = 0) as existing incoming orders (placed when demand was estimated at ~4,000) are insufficient to meet current levels. To mitigate chronic stockouts during these final periods, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent demand elevation (average \u2248 4,571). Given the trend, an explicit mu_hat targeting the 5-period horizon (current + 4 lead) at 4,650 per period is safer to ensure the backend places orders large enough to break the stockout cycle before the game ends.

Carry-over insight: Third growth phase confirmed: demand has shifted from a ~4,000 plateau to ~4,600+ units (Period 44-46 average: 4,571).

Daily Reward (R_t): $16636.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a third significant growth phase. Demand has evolved from a secondary plateau of ~4,000 units to approximately 4,955 units in Period 47. The 3-period average (P45-P47) is 4,733 units, representing a clear upward shift from the P42-P44 average of 4,329 units. Due to this sustained acceleration, the inventory is back into a chronic stockout state (on-hand is 0). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand level (~4,733 per period) and ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current growth regime. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for increased volatility during this expansion. This aggressive stance aims to help the pipeline catch up to the shifting demand mean before the simulation ends.

Carry-over insight: Third growth phase acceleration: Period 45-47 average demand is 4,733 units, a 10% increase over the Period 42-44 average (4,329). System has returned to 0 on-hand inventory since Period 44.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17660.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in its third major growth phase, with demand increasing from ~4,000 to nearly 5,000 units per period. The recent 3-period average (P46-P48) is 4,804 units, compared to the previously stabilized plateau of ~4,000. This explosive growth has caused 5 consecutive periods of starting with 0 ending inventory (P44-P48) because the pipeline orders (placed during the ~4,000-4,300 demand phase) are insufficient to meet current demand. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Since we are at Period 49 and the game ends at Period 50, and given the lead time L=4, orders placed now will NOT arrive before the game ends. However, the objective is to maximize reward for each period through terminal logic. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most current accelerated demand level (avg ~4,800), and keep L at the promised 4 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the (L+1) horizon. This helps ensure the OR backend generates a high enough base stock to meet the immediate next-period demand, even though the order itself won't arrive in time for the final period.

Carry-over insight: Third growth phase confirmed: demand shifted from ~4,100 to ~4,800+ units (Period 46-48 average: 4,804). Chronic stockouts resumed at Period 44 due to demand acceleration exceeding pipeline arrivals.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in its third major growth phase, with demand accelerating from a previous plateau of ~4,000 units to approximately 4,800-5,000 units. Period 49 demand was 4,681, following a peak of 4,955 in Period 47. The average demand for the most recent 3 periods (P47-P49) is 4,818 units. Chronic stockouts have persisted since Period 44 because arrivals (based on older, lower demand parameters) are insufficient to meet current demand. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current high-demand regime of ~4,818 units per period, scaled by (1+L). This ensures the base stock calculation targets the current top-of-trend demand level. Lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 45 order in Period 49. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent volatility within this high-growth phase. The goal is to force the OR backend's capped policy to increase order sizes and clear the pipeline lag.

Carry-over insight: Third growth phase peak detected: Period 47-49 average demand is 4,818 units (+18% over the Period 39-43 plateau). Stockouts persist as pipeline arrivals (averaging ~4,200) lag current demand (~4,800).
