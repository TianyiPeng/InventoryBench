Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a strong upward trend: 107, 252, 298, 376, 544. This suggests a growth regime or a seasonal ramp-up. The mean of all historical samples is 315.4, but the most recent sample is 544. Following the instruction to use recent_N (min 3, max 20), I will use N=3 to capture the most recent growth trend for the demand forecast. For the lead time, the promised lead time is 4 periods; since no arrivals have been observed yet, I will use the 'default' method. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the higher volatility seen in the recent periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 613 units, which is currently in-transit. The demand in Period 1 was 134 units, but since our starting inventory was 0 and no stock arrived (lead time is 4 periods), we had 0 sales and ended with 0 inventory. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Historical demand data shows a significant upward trend: P1: 107 (pre-game), P1: 134 (actual user period), and the upcoming sequence provided in history (P2: 252, P3: 298, P4: 376, P5: 544). The demand appears to be scaling rapidly. To prevent stockouts when the first order arrives, I need to account for this growth. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this rising trend from the samples (107, 134, 252, etc.) and 'calculate' for L. Since the base_stock formula is (1+L) * mean, and L=4, it covers 5 periods of demand. Given the sharp growth, I will stay slightly aggressive to ensure the pipeline is filled.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order placed in Period 1 (with a promised lead time of 4) is not expected to arrive until Period 5. Consequently, we have had 0 sales and all demand (134 in P1, 225 in P2) has been lost. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1304 correctly accounts for the orders from P1 (613) and P2 (691). Demand is showing a significant upward trend: 107 (historical), 134 (P1), 225 (P2). Given the growth, I will use recent samples to catch the rising mean. I'll stick to the promised Lead Time of 4 for now as there's no evidence yet to suggest it's different.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. No inventory has arrived yet because the promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Demand is showing a clear upward trend (134, 225, 338, 376, 544 from provided data; note user history shows 134, 225, 338). Historical samples provided in the prompt (107, 252, 298, 376, 544) confirm this strong growth likely due to a seasonal or market adoption phase. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is accelerating, I must set parameters to account for the (L+1) horizon. With L=4, we are looking at a 5-period window. I will use recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture the most recent growth trend without being overly influenced by the lower initial periods. I'll use N=3 to capture the most recent high-growth phase.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (total 1911 units in transit). According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (613 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. This means it will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message and usable for demand starting Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and all demand so far has been lost. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend (107, 252, 298, 376, 544). To account for this growth, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent acceleration and set L to default as there is no evidence yet that the promised 4-period lead time has been violated (we expect the first arrival at the end of this period).

Carry-over insight: Demand for chips(Regular) is exhibiting a strong upward trend, increasing from ~100 to over 500 units within 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1782.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4. Demand is trending upward significantly: 134, 225, 338, 316, 479 (average ~298 over 5 periods, but the last two periods average ~400). Current on-hand is low (134) relative to recent demand. Following the upward trend, I expect Period 6 demand to meet or exceed 500 units. To capture this growth, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to weigh the recent growth more heavily, ensuring the base stock level (target inventory for the next L+1 = 5 periods) reflects the current regime. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the increased volatility associated with the demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: significant trend from 134 to 479 over 5 periods. Lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2255.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand is showing a persistent and sharp upward trend: P1 (134), P2 (225), P3 (338), P4 (316), P5 (479), P6 (616). The last three periods show a clear acceleration. Mean demand over the last 3 periods is ~470 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5 and P6) confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. My target is to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent mean of 470 units, the base stock (mu_hat) should be around 2350. Currently, on-hand (209) + in-transit (1158) = 1367, which is significantly below the target covering the lead time plus current demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-growth regime while ignoring the lower initial values. I keep L at 'default' since the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Periods 4-6 average ~470 units per period compared to earlier average of ~230 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2619.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues a sharp upward trajectory, with the last three periods averaging 594 units (479, 616, 687). The most recent demand (687) is significantly higher than the initial periods. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrivals from Periods 1, 2, and 3. My inventory position (on-hand 129 + in-transit 1269 = 1398) must cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). An average demand of ~700 over 5 periods implies a base stock requirement of ~3500. Currently, the pipeline is under-provisioned for this growth. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the latest demand regime and set L to 'calculate' as the lead time of 4 is stable but needs monitoring.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Periods 5-7 average 594 units per period (up from Periods 4-6 average of 470). Sustained upward trend confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $516.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a clear and sustained upward trend, with the last four periods recording demand of 479, 616, 687, and 800 respectively (mean ~645). However, we are currently facing a stockout because no order arrived in Period 8. The promised lead time is 4. Orders from Period 1 arrived in P5 (LT=4), Period 2 in P6 (LT=4), and Period 3 in P7 (LT=4). Period 4 had an order of 0, explaining the 0 arrivals in Period 8. In-transit inventory is high (2037), comprised of orders from P6 (551), P7 (718), and P8 (768). The P6 order is expected to arrive in Period 10. To capture the current trajectory, I will use recent_N=4 for demand forecasting (mean ~646). Since the backend calculates \u03bc\u0302 as (1+L) * mean_demand, and L=4 is confirmed, this effectively targets a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (~3230 units), which aligns with the total need to recover from the current stockout and cover the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: last 4 periods average 645 units (P5-P8), up from Period 1-4 average of 253. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues a massive upward trajectory, with the latest recorded demand reaching 943 units in Period 9. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P7-P9) is 810 units, compared to the overall average of ~500. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on early arrivals, meaning we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Although Period 8 and 9 saw 0 arrivals, this is consistent with the ordering gap in Periods 4 and 5 (where 0 units were ordered). Arrival should resume in Period 10 (from Period 6's order). Given the severe stockouts and the steep growth curve, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the expected continued growth (forecasting ~1000 units/period) and a higher sigma_hat to protect against the increasing volatility and the risk of further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 7-9 average 810 units, representing a >200% increase over the first 4 periods. Growth trend is linear to exponential, necessitating forward-looking explicit parameters over historical averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2204.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to show a strong, nearly linear upward trend, with the last three periods averaging 921 units (P8: 800, P9: 943, P10: 1021). The current forecast for the upcoming cycle (Lead time 4 + Review 1 = 5 periods) must account for this continued growth. Based on the current trajectory, I expect demand to reach ~1100-1200 units per period shortly. Therefore, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 5500 (1100 avg over 5 periods) to prevent chronic stockouts, as current on-hand is 0 and we have recently suffered stockouts in periods 8, 9, and 10. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P6 order arrived in P10). Note that P4 and P5 had 0 units ordered, causing the arrival gaps in P8 and P9. The massive order of 1442 in P10 demonstrates the OR backend is already reacting, but explicit parameters will ensure the target base stock is high enough for the projected demand peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: last 3 periods (P8-10) average 921 units, reaching 1021 in P10. Projected demand for P11-15 is ~1100+ units/period.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb sharply, reaching 1194 in Period 11. Over the last three periods (P9-P11), demand has averaged 1052.7 units. The 4-period lead time is stable (P6 and P7 orders arrived in P10 and P11 respectively as expected). However, because demand is growing dynamically, historical averages used by 'recent_N' or 'default' will lag behind the true demand during the upcoming (L+1) window (Periods 12-16). I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for this growth trend. If demand continues to grow at its current pace (+100-150 units per period), the average demand over the next 5 periods will likely be around 1400 units per period. Therefore, mu_hat = (1+L) * 1400 = 5 * 1400 = 7000. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to a higher value to protect against the volatility observed during this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 9-11 average is 1053 units (+14% vs P8-10). Forecasted average demand for the next 5 periods (P12-16) is ~1400 units/period based on the current linear trend.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sharp linear upward trend, with the last 4 periods averaging 1074 units (P9-12). In Period 12, demand was 1137. Projecting this trend forward for the next planning horizon (L+1 = 5 periods), I expect the average demand to reach approximately 1350-1400 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with significant units in-transit (5456). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P8 order arrived in P12). To account for the rapid growth and ensure the base stock levels are high enough to cover the lead time + current period (5 periods total), I am setting mu_hat to 6800 (1360 * 5) and sigma_hat to 600 to provide a buffer against the high variance observed during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend remains strong: last 4 periods (P9-12) average 1074 units (+66% vs P5-8). Projected demand for P13-17 is ~1350 units/period.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong linear upward trend. In Period 13, demand reached 1,381 units, significantly higher than the previous period's 1,137. The average demand over the last four periods (P10-P13) is approximately 1,183 units and growing. To prevent stockouts and accommodate the (L+1) period horizon (current period + 4 periods lead time), we must forecast forward. Given the trend (approx. +100 units per period recently), the projected average demand for Periods 14-18 is approximately 1,600 units per period. Historically, the lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 0, and despite a large pipeline (6,191 units), demand is currently outpacing the arrivals of orders placed when demand was much lower. I will use 'explicit' values to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the projected growth rather than relying on historical averages that lag behind the current trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend remains aggressive: Period 10-13 average is 1183 units (+10% vs P9-12). Projected average demand for the next 5 periods (P14-18) is ~1600 units/period based on current momentum.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5188.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, with the last 5 periods (P10-P14) averaging 1211 units, significantly higher than the initial periods. Although Period 14 showed a slight dip to 1326 from Period 13's 1381, the overall trajectory remains aggressive. I am projecting an average demand of approximately 1600 units per period for the upcoming lead time window (Periods 15-19). With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, leading to a mu_hat of 8000 (1600 * 5). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 14 (Period 10 order arrived). Sigma_hat is set to roughly 15% of the projected demand to account for growth volatility. Current On-hand is 116 units and In-transit is substantial (6917), but given the 4-period lead time and growing demand, aggressive ordering via high explicit mu_hat is necessary to avoid stockouts as demand scales toward and beyond 1600 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime sustained: Mean demand for P10-P14 is 1211 units (+13% vs P9-13). Linear growth trend suggests projected demand for P15-P19 will average ~1600 units/period.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. Historical demand over the last five periods (P11-P15) was 1194, 1137, 1381, 1326, and 1672, averaging ~1342 units. Given the growth rate, I expect demand for the planning horizon (L+1 = 5 periods) to average approximately 1650 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 6957 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, shipments from P12 (1768), P13 (1802), P14 (1968), and P15 (1419) are expected. Setting mu_hat to 8250 (1650 * 5) and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high volatility (std dev of the last 5 periods is ~200, so sqrt(5) * 200 \u2248 450) will help maintain appropriate stock levels during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains strong: Mean demand for P11-P15 is 1342 units (+11% vs P10-P14). Projected demand for P16-P20 is expected to average ~1650 units/period based on current momentum.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5942.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a strong upward trend. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 1411.6 units, while the most recent Period 16 was 1542. The demand is currently averaging ~1550 units and trending towards 1700+. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the review period + lead time (1+L=5), we must account for demand over the next 5 periods. Using the current average of ~1550 units per period and projecting for growth, a forecast of 1650 units per period is appropriate. This results in a mu_hat (1+L * mean) of 8250. Sigma_hat is set based on the volatility observed in recent periods (~135 per period), scaled by sqrt(5).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained: mean demand for P12-P16 is 1412 units (+5.2% vs P11-15). Projected demand for P17-P21 is expected to average ~1650 units/period based on the current linear trajectory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6407.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward trend. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 1,521 units, which is an increase from the P12-P16 average of 1,412 units. Given this consistent linear growth, I am projecting the average demand for the next lead time cycle (P18-P22) to be approximately 1,750 units per period. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods across all arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P10-P17). To ensure the OR backend covers the full (L+1) period demand window (5 periods total), I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 8,750 (5 * 1750). The sigma_hat is set explicitly to 350 to provide a safety buffer against the increasing volatility observed as demand levels rise. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Mean demand for P13-P17 is 1,521 units (+7.7% vs P12-P16). Projected average demand for the next 5 periods (P18-P22) is ~1,750 units/period based on current momentum.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6656.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a significant upward linear trend. The most recent demand was 1,793 units (P18). Over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), mean demand was 1,604 units, compared to 1,342 in P11-P15, reflecting a ~20% increase. To avoid stockouts during the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods), an explicit forecast is necessary. Given the trend (approx. +75 to +100 units per period), I project the mean demand for the window P19-P23 to average 1,900 units per period. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 1,900 * 5 = 9,500. Lead time (L) is stable at 4 periods. Sigma_hat is set explicitly at 450 (approx. sqrt(5) * 200) to account for increasing volatility alongside growing volume and the risk of trend acceleration.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained and aggressive: Mean demand for P14-P18 is 1,604 units (+19.5% vs P11-15). The upward linear trajectory suggests average demand for the next 5 periods (P19-P23) will reach approximately 1,900 units/period.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward linear trend. Historical sales and demand for the last 5 periods (P15-P19) show a mean of 1,736 units, rising from 1,672 in P15 to 1,986 in P19. Extrapolating this growth, I expect the average demand for the next lead time cycle (P20-P24) to be approximately 2,050 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we are heavily reliant on the pipeline (7,328 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 10,250 (5 periods * 2,050 units/period) to account for the L+1 demand window needed to cover the arrival cycle. Sigma_hat is set to 800 to handle the increasing volatility observed as demand levels escalate.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and sustained: mean demand for P15-P19 is 1,736 units (+8.2% vs P14-P18). Linear trend analysis suggests average demand for the upcoming coverage period (P20-P24) will reach approximately 2,050 units/period.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained linear upward trend. Over the last five periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged approximately 1,777 units, while the most recent period (P19) saw demand peak at 1,986 units before a slight dip in P20. Given the consistent growth trajectory observed since P1, I am forecasting average demand for the next 5 periods (P21-P25) to be approximately 2,200 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 8,295 units. Lead time is reliably 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrival messages (P12-P20). To ensure the OR backend covers the projected demand for the (L+1) window, I am setting L to 4 and mu_hat to 11,000 (2,200 units * 5 periods). A sigma_hat of 500 is used to account for the volatility observed in the growth trend and prevent stockouts during this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustains: Period 16-20 average is 1,777 units (+10% vs P11-15). Linear trend suggests average demand for P21-P25 (current coverage window) will reach 2,200 units/period.

The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong, sustained upward linear trajectory. Period 21 demand was 1995 units, and the average for the most recent five periods (P17-P21) is 1867. Based on the consistent growth rate observed over the last 15 periods, the forecasted demand for the upcoming coverage window (Periods 22 to 26) is approximately 2,200 units per period. Using a fixed lead time (L) of 4 periods (consistent with historical performance), the total expected demand across the review and lead period (L+1 = 5 periods) is estimated at 11,000 units (5 * 2200). mu_hat is set to 11,000 using the 'explicit' method to override the lagging effect of historical averages. sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility associated with this high-growth regime. This strategy aims to build sufficient inventory to minimize stockouts in a rapidly expanding market while the OR backend manages the safety stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained: Period 17-21 average is 1867 units (+16% vs P12-16). Linear trend analysis suggests average demand for the upcoming coverage window (P22-P26) will reach approximately 2,200 units/period.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive linear upward trend. The most recent demand was 2,218 in Period 22. Looking at the last 5 periods (P18-P22), demand has averaged 1,973 units, compared to an average of 1,777 in the preceding 5-period block (P13-P17). This indicates an approximate growth of 200 units every 5 periods. For the current coverage window (L+1 = 5 periods, from P23 to P27), I forecast demand to average approximately 2,350 units per period. This results in a mu_hat (total demand across coverage) of 11,750 (2,350 * 5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P14 through P18. On-hand is currently 0, necessitating a high order to capture the growth and prevent stockouts. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to account for this strong trend, as 'recent_N' would be too backward-looking given the growth rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 18-22 average is 1,973 units (+11% vs P13-17). Linear trend analysis suggests average demand for the upcoming coverage window (P23-P27) will reach approximately 2,350 units/period. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive linear upward trend. Period 23 saw demand reach 2,449 units, continuing the acceleration from previous periods. Based on the linear growth observable over the last 10 periods (averaging a ~10% increase every few periods), the expected demand for the upcoming coverage window (Period 24 through Period 28, given L=4) is forecasted to average approximately 2,500 units per period. Using 'explicit' parameters is necessary because historical averages (even recent ones) lag behind this consistent growth trend. I am setting mu_hat to 12,500 ((1+4) * 2,500) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the lead time plus the current period. Sigma_hat is set to 750 (approx 30% of mean demand) to account for increasing volatility at these higher demand volumes, and L is maintained at the stable observed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand growth remains aggressive and sustained; Period 19-23 average is 2,105 units (+12.7% vs P14-18). Linear trend trajectory suggests average demand for the next 5-period window (P24-P28) will reach approximately 2,500 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward linear trend. In Period 24, demand reached 2,460 units. Analyzing the most recent window (Periods 20\u201324), the average demand is 2,200 units, while the average of the window before that (Periods 15\u201319) was 1,736 units, showing sustained momentum. To ensure product availability over the lead time (L=4) plus the current review period, we need to cover demand for a 5-period window (P25-P29). Based on the current trajectory, I project average demand for this window to reach approximately 2,750 units per period. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 2750 = 13750. Volatility remains relatively stable but scales with the mean; I will use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the current variance around the trend. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P17 through P20 in periods P21 through P24.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and sustained; Period 20-24 average is 2,200 units (+27% vs P15-19). Linear trend trajectory suggests average demand for the next 5-period window (P25-P29) will reach approximately 2,750 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward linear trend. The most recent 5-period average (P21-P25) is approximately 2,286 units, up from the previous window's average (P11-P15: 1,342; P16-P20: 1,819). This represents a growth rate of roughly 120-150 units per period. Projecting this trend forward for the next coverage window (Period 26 to 30), the average demand is expected to be approximately 2,800 units per period. To ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover the 5-period window (L+1 = 5), I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to 14,000 (5 * 2,800). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by the arrival of the P21 order in P25. Given the high criticality of maintaining supply during this aggressive growth, I am maintaining a volatility estimate (sigma_hat) of 1,000 using the explicit method to ensure the safety stock buffers against demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and sustained: Period 21-25 average is 2,286 units (+25% vs P16-20). Linear trend trajectory suggests average demand for the next 5-period coverage window (P26-P30) will reach approximately 2,800 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong and sustained upward linear trend. Over the last five periods (P22-P26), demand has averaged 2,372 units, which is a significant increase from the previous average. The most recent demand at P26 was 2,427 units. Following the established trajectory, demand is projected to reach approximately 2,800 units per period over the next coverage window (P27-P31). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival of the P22 order in P26. Cumulative in-transit inventory is 12,386 units, but with a 5-period coverage (L+1) and a target of roughly 2,800 units per period, the desired base stock is approximately 14,000 units. To maintain the service level while accounting for the growth, I am setting mu_hat to 14,000 (2,800 * 5) and maintaining a volatility estimate (sigma_hat) of 1,200 to account for demand variance during this high-growth phase.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward linear trend. In Period 27, demand reached 2,565 units. The last five periods (P23-P27) average 2442 units, reflecting a clear increase from the previous interval. Following the established trajectory, demand for the upcoming coverage window (P28-P32) is projected to average approximately 2,900 units per period. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, which I will continue to account for as L=4. To ensure the backend's base-stock calculation (which covers L+1 periods) is sufficient for this growth, I am using explicit values. I have set mu_hat to 14,500 (5 * 2,900) to account for the forecast over the lead time plus current period. Volatility has also scaled with the mean; I've set sigma_hat at 450 to provide a necessary safety buffer against potential demand spikes while minimizing excessive holding costs given the current tight inventory (on-hand 49).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and sustained: Period 23-27 average is 2,442 units (+11% vs P18-22). Linear trend trajectory suggests average demand for the next 5-period coverage window (P28-P32) will reach approximately 2,900 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward linear trend. The most recent demand (Period 28) reached 2733 units, following a clear pattern of growth. The 5-period moving average (P23-P27) is approximately 2,442, but current individual observations are already higher. Based on the linear trajectory observed over the last 10 periods, demand for the upcoming coverage window (Periods 29-33) is projected to average approximately 3,000 units per period. The lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high growth rate, relying on historical averages (even recent ones) would under-calculate the base stock required to meet future demand. Therefore, I am using explicit parameters to set mu_hat at 15,000 (3,000 units * (1 + L=4)) and sigma_hat at 1,000 to account for volatility during this growth phase while balancing high service levels against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and sustained: the mean demand for P23-P27 is 2,442 units (+11% vs P18-P22). Linear trend trajectory suggests average demand for the next 5-period coverage window (P29-P33) will reach approximately 3,000 units/period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward linear trend. Over the last five periods (P25-P29), demand has averaged approximately 2,590 units. Projecting this growth forward into the current coverage window (L+1 = 5 periods, covering P30-P34), I anticipate the average demand will reach approximately 3,000 to 3,100 units per period. The lead time remains highly consistent at exactly 4 periods based on the conclusion of every order since Period 5. To account for the risk of under-ordering during this aggressive growth phase and to maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 15,300 (which is 3,060 units * 5 periods). I will use a sigma_hat that reflects the increasing volatility observed as the volume scales, calculated as approximately 15% of the forecasted mean demand over the window.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and sustained: the mean demand for P25-P29 is 2,590 units. Linear trend trajectory suggests the average demand for the next 5-period coverage window (P30-P34) will reach approximately 3,050-3,100 units/period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10157.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward trend, with the last 5 periods (P26-P30) averaging 2,701 units, a slight increase from the previous 5-period average. While the most recent demand in Period 30 (2,866) suggests a stabilization or slight deceleration in growth compared to previous massive jumps, the system still needs to account for the lead time of 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 1,307, with a significant pipeline of 13,063 units. Given the lead time L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Based on the trajectory, I project demand to reach an average of 3,100 units per period over the next window. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 15,500 (3,100 * 5). Sigma_hat is set to 750 to account for the increasing volatility observed as the mean demand scales up. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Average demand for P26-P30 is 2,701 units. Growth is continuing but showing signs of moderating compared to the rapid acceleration seen in earlier periods. Projected demand for the P31-P35 coverage window is ~3,100 units/period.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. Historical samples demonstrate a move from ~134 in Period 1 to 3,137 in Period 31. The recent 5-period average (P27-P31) is approximately 2,844 units. Using a linear growth projection, demand for the upcoming coverage window (P32-P36, spanning L+1 periods) is estimated to average roughly 3,400 units per period. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P27 order arrived in P31). To capture the continued momentum and avoid stockouts as demand scales toward the end of the simulation, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 17,000 (3,400 * 5). Sigma_hat is set to 750 to account for increasing volatility as the mean rises. This aggressive posture ensures the OR backend targets a high base-stock level to match the growing demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand growth remains aggressive and sustained; Period 27-31 average is 2,844 units (+17% vs P22-26). Linear trend trajectory suggests average demand for the next 5-period window (P32-P36) will reach approximately 3,400 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P28-P32) has averaged 2,910 units, while the most recent 3 periods (P30-P32) averaged approximately 2,966 units. Given the persistent growth and the current date (Period 33), I am projecting that the average demand for the upcoming coverage window (Periods 33-37) will reach approximately 3,450 units per period. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (order from P28 arrived in P32). With an on-hand inventory of 331 and a large in-transit pipeline of 13,719 (covering orders from periods 29-32), the system needs to maintain a high base stock to avoid stockouts. I will use 'explicit' method for mu_hat to capture this forward-looking growth (5 * 3450 = 17250) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture recent volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand growth sustains a linear trajectory; average demand for P28-P32 is 2,910 units. Forecasted average for the P33-P37 window is ~3,450 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear growth pattern. The most recent demand (Period 33) reached 3,332 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is 3,029 units, compared to the previously observed averages (P28-P32 was 2,910). Based on the trajectory, demand for the upcoming coverage window (P34-P38) is projected to average approximately 3,500 units per period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, meaning we need to cover (1+L) = 5 periods of demand. Using an explicit mu_hat of 17,500 (5 * 3,500) accounts for this growth. Sigma_hat is set to 500 to accommodate increasing volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to use the consistent 4-period historical average.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand growth continues on a linear trajectory; average demand for P29-P33 is 3,029 units (+4% vs P28-P32). Forecasted average for the P34-P38 window is ~3,500 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear upward trajectory. Over the last 5 periods (P30-P34), the average demand was approximately 3,089 units, compared to 2,701 in the preceding 5 periods. The most recent demand (P33 and P34) averaged 3,272 units. Projecting this growth trend into the next coverage window (P35-P39, total 5 periods), I expect the average demand to reach approximately 3,600 units per period. The lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to 18,000 (3,600 * 5) and maintaining a slightly higher sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in the growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand growth remains on a linear path; average demand for P30-P34 is 3,089 units (+14% vs P26-P30). Forecasted average for the P35-P39 window is ~3,600 units/period. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13897.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear upward trend. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is approximately 3,214 units, showing a steady increase from previous windows. Based on the consistent trajectory, I project demand for the upcoming lead time + review period (P36-P40) to average approximately 3,650 units per period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 31 order in Period 35. To account for the risk of stockouts during this high-growth phase and to ensure the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 periods) is sufficient, I am setting mu_hat to 18,250 (3,650 units * 5 periods). I'm setting sigma_hat using an explicit value of 750 to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the observed volatility in the growth rate, ensuring a high service level while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand growth remains on a linear path; average demand for P31-P35 is 3,214 units. Forecasted average for the P36-P40 window is ~3,650 units/period. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14725.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear growth trend. In Period 36, demand reached 3,748 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is approximately 3,336 units. Following the established trajectory, demand for the upcoming coverage window (Periods 37-41) is projected to average approximately 3,850 units per period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, meaning the order must cover a 5-period window (L+1). To ensure the OR backend captures this forward-looking growth which isn't yet fully reflected in simple historical averages, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 5 periods * 3,850 units/period = 19,250. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 10% of mu_hat to handle volatility. On-hand inventory is 267 and in-transit is 14,867, totaling 15,134 units of pipeline inventory, which is currently below the required base stock for the 5-period window.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand growth remains on a linear path; average demand for P32-P36 is 3,336 units. Forecasted average for the P37-P41 window is ~3,850 units/period. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14473.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear upward trajectory. Evaluating the most recent 5-period window (P33-P37), the average demand is 3,485 units, which is a 7.7% increase over the preceding P28-P32 average of 3,235 units. The actual lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Since the decision made in Period 38 must cover demand through the end of Period 42 (L+1 periods), and the growth shows no signs of plateauing, I am projecting the average demand for the next coverage window (P38-P42) to be approximately 4,100 units per period. This projection accounts for the current momentum where demand has increased by roughly 100-150 units per period over the last several cycles. Using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat (4,100 * 5 = 20,500) allows the OR engine to order sufficiently to meet this anticipated growth, which historical averages would underestimate. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current volatility while ignoring the much lower variance of early periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand growth continues on a linear path; average demand for P33-P37 is 3,485 units (+8% vs P28-P32). Forecasted average for the P38-P42 window is ~4,100 units/period. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear upward trajectory. Over the last 5 periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 3,493 units, with the most recent sample at 3,371. The previous forecast (P38) correctly anticipated a mean around 4,100 for the coverage window (L+1); however, the ongoing trend suggests that for the upcoming decision (covering demand through Period 43), the average demand per period will likely reach ~4,200 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 456 units and 17,085 units in-transit (reflecting the larger orders placed recently to keep up with growth), the OR backend needs to maintain this higher base stock to prevent stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost. Setting mu_hat to 21,000 (computed as 5 periods * 4,200 units/period) and sigma_hat explicitly to 500 (recognizing the increased absolute volatility that comes with higher volume) will ensure the base stock levels remain appropriate for the current growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand growth remains on a linear path; average demand for P34-P38 is 3,493 units. Forecasted average for the P39-P43 window is ~4,200 units/period. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear upward trajectory. Analyzing the most recent 5 periods (P35-P39), the average demand is approximately 3,609 units, compared to the P30-P34 average of 3,089 units, representing a 17% increase. Projecting this trend forward into the next coverage window (L+1 = 5 periods), I expect the average demand for P40-P44 to reach approximately 4,300 units per period. Using 'explicit' the mu_hat is set to 21,500 (4,300 * 5). Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current volatility while accommodating the trend. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages (P35 order arrived at P39).

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand growth remains on a linear path; average demand for P35-P39 is 3,609 units (+17% vs P30-P34). Forecasted average for the P40-P44 window is ~4,300 units/period. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear upward trajectory. Evaluating the most recent 5 periods (P36-P40), the average demand is approximately 3,732 units per period. Projecting this trend forward into the next coverage window (L+1 = 5 periods, from P41 to P45), I expect demand to average approximately 4,400 units per period. Accordingly, mu_hat is set to 22,000 (4,400 * 5). Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 1,500 to account for the increased volatility and the risk associated with underestimating demand during this aggressive growth phase. Lead time remains consistently stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages (P36 order arrived in P40).

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand growth remains on a linear path; average demand for P36-P40 is 3,732 units. Projected average demand for the P41-P45 window is ~4,400 units/period. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear growth pattern. In Period 41, demand reached 4,110 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 3,804 units, while the previous 5-period average (P32-P36) was 3,336 units, indicating approximately 14% growth. Projecting this linear trend forward into the next coverage window (P42-P46), the expected average demand is approximately 4,500 units per period. I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set the (1+L) base demand at 22,500 (4,500 * 5 periods). Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current level of volatility during this high-growth phase. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrival data (P37 order arrived in P41).

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand growth sustains a linear trajectory; average demand for P37-P41 is 3,804 units (+14% vs P32-P36). Forecasted average for the P42-P46 window is ~4,500 units/period. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear growth trend. In Period 42, demand reached 4,421 units, and the average demand over the last five periods (P38-P42) is 3,960 units. Based on the consistent upward trajectory (approximate 150-200 unit increase per period), I project the average demand for the next 5-period window (P43-P47) to be approximately 4,800 units per period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 38 order in Period 42. Using 'explicit' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR engine to account for this forecast rather than relying on historical averages which lag significantly during growth regimes. I set mu_hat to 24,000 (4,800 units/period * (L+1)) and sigma_hat to 670 to reflect observed variance during this high-demand stage.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand growth remains on a linear path; average demand for P38-P42 is 3,960 units. Projected average demand for the P43-P47 window is ~4,800 units/period. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear upward trend. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P39-P43) is 4,103 units, which is a 4% increase over the P38-P42 average (3,960). Projecting this growth onto the next 5-period coverage window (P44-P48), I anticipate average demand will reach approximately 4,950 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods from historical arrivals (e.g., P39 order arrived in P43). Given the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend targets an 80% service level. Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*4950 = 24750 units ensures the pipeline covers the expected demand growth through the arrival of this order in Period 48. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 500 to account for recent demand volatility and maintain service levels during the aggressive growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand growth remains on a linear path; average demand for P39-P43 is 4,103 units. Projected average demand for the P44-P48 window is ~4,950 units/period. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear upward trend. In Period 44, the on-hand inventory is 762 units with a large pipeline of 20,541 units. The mean demand for the last five periods (P40-P44) is approximately 4,214 units, showing a steady increase from the P35-P39 average of 3,609 (+16.7%). Based on this trajectory, I anticipate the average demand for the next lead-time window (P45-P49) to be approximately 5,000 units per period. Using L=4, the coverage period (L+1) is 5 periods, requiring a mu_hat of 25,000 (5 * 5,000). I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat to capture this growth which historical averages (recent_N or default) would lag behind. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent volatility around this trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Demand growth remains on a linear path; average demand for P40-P44 is 4,214 units. Projected average demand for the P45-P49 window is ~5,000 units/period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15769.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a consistent upward linear trend. The most recent demand (Period 45) was 4,407 units, and the average of the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is approximately 4,274 units. Projecting this growth forward, the expected demand for the upcoming coverage window (Periods 46-50) is estimated to average approximately 5,200 units per period. Since the lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. This gives a mu_hat of 5 * 5200 = 26000. For volatility, we observe fluctuations around the trend; a sigma_hat of 1200 (calculated as roughly sqrt(5) * 530) accounts for this variance to maintain service levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (e.g., Period 45 confirms P41 order arrived in 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Demand growth remains on a linear path; average demand for P41-P45 is 4,274 units. Linear trajectory suggests average demand for the next 5-period window (P46-P50) will reach approximately 5,200 units/period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong, sustained linear upward trajectory. Evaluating the most recent demand samples (P42-P46), the average demand is 4,345 units, showing a consistent increase from previous windows. Based on this linear trend, I anticipate the average demand for the next coverage window (P47-P51) to reach approximately 5,300 units/period. The lead time has been consistently verified at 4 periods across the entire game history. I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for the forecasted (1+L) coverage (5 periods * 5,300 units/period = 26,500 units). Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility during this growth phase while filtering out older, lower-demand noise. This strategy balances the need to meet accelerating demand while managing inventory as we approach the end of the simulation (P50).

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Demand growth remains on a linear path; average demand for P42-P46 is 4,345 units (+2% vs P41-P45). Forecasted average for the P47-P51 window is ~5,300 units/period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15681.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong and relatively linear upward trend. Over the last five periods (P43-P47), demand has averaged 4,435 units, showing a steady climb from the mid-4200s. Given the consistent historical trajectory, I am projecting the average demand for the next 5-period coverage window (P48-P52) to be approximately 5,400 units per period. This accounting for both the current level and the expected growth during the lead time. Lead time remains highly reliable at exactly 4 periods based on order history tracking (P43 order arrived in P47). The chosen mu_hat of 27,000 [(1+L) * 5,400] and an explicit sigma_hat of 1,200 provide the OR engine with the necessary parameters to maintain a high service level amidst the growth while managing holding costs given the SKU's high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Demand growth remains on a linear path; average demand for P43-P47 is 4,435 units. Linear trajectory suggests average demand for the next 5-period window (P48-P52) will reach approximately 5,400 units/period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16148.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 is the penultimate decision period (L=4). Demand for chips(Regular) continues its strong linear growth. The average demand for P43-P47 was approximately 4,435 units, and P48 demand reached 4,822 units, confirming the trend. Based on the linear trajectory analysis from previous periods, the average demand for the next 5-period coverage window (P49-P53) is projected to be approximately 5,500 units per period. The lead time has remained consistently stable at 4 periods throughout the game history. With on-hand inventory at 3,140 and a substantial pipeline, I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * 5,500 = 27,500 to maintain the aggressive growth posture and capture remaining profit before the game ends at Period 50. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 10% of mu_hat to provide a safety buffer against high volatility observed during earlier growth phases.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand linear growth remains robust; Period 44-48 average is 4,498 units. Growth trend suggests average demand for the final window (P49-P53) will reach 5,500 units/period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18071.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear growth pattern. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P45-P49) is 4,642 units, a significant increase from the P40-P44 average of 4,215 units (~10% increase). Based on this trend, I anticipate average demand for the next coverage window (P50-P54) to reach approximately 5,600 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, meaning we must cover 5 periods of demand (current + 4 lead time periods). I am using explicit mu_hat = 28,000 (5,600 units * 5 periods) and increasing sigma_hat to 1,500 to account for higher volatility associated with the scaling volume and trend uncertainty. This ensures visibility and ordering for the backend OR engine to maintain a high service level while balancing holding costs against the current growth trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Demand linear growth remains robust; Period 45-49 average is 4,642 units (+10% vs P40-44). Growth trend suggests average demand for the next 5-period window (P50-P54) will reach ~5,600 units/period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.
