Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a clear upward trend from 107 in Period 1 to 544 in Period 5 (mean: 315.4, std: 161.8). The promised lead time is 4. Since the demand is rapidly increasing, the all-time mean (315.4) would significantly underestimate the current demand level (last sample was 544). To adapt to this growth, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 3, 4, 5). Given the volatility, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect current variance. For lead time, I will use the 'default' promised lead time of 4 until actual arrival data is observed.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 613 units which are now in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we do not expect this order to arrive until the resolution phase of Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have missed demand in Period 1 (134 units). Demand shows a significant upward trend (P1: 107 vs P2: 252 in historical data; however, the game history shows P1 actual was 134). Given the limited history and the 4-period lead time, I will use a 3-period window (N=3) for demand to capture the recent growth while smoothing noise. The 'mu_hat' needs to cover (1+L) = 5 periods of demand. I'm using recent_N for both mu and sigma to remain sensitive to the increasing demand trend observed in the provided samples (107, 252, 298, 376, 544).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (613 units) and Period 2 (691 units) are in-transit and not yet expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Consequently, on-hand inventory is 0 and sales have not yet occurred despite demand. Historical demand shows a strong upward trend (P1: 134, P2: 225, P3: 298, P4: 376, P5: 544). Given the limited history (5 samples provided in prompt, 2 observed in-game), demand is clearly accelerating. I will use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent growth trend. For lead time, I will stick to 'default' as no arrivals have occurred to suggest a deviation from the promised L=4.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4). Demand has consistently increased from 107 (pre-game sample) to 134, 225, and 338 in Periods 1-3. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory because arrivals haven't started yet, and there are 1960 units in-transit (613+691+656). The demand is showing a clear upward trend. Using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) accounts for this recent growth while remaining conservative. L is kept at 'default' as no arrivals have occurred to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand is trending upward significantly: P1(134), P2(225), P3(338). Average demand over last 3 periods is ~232.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, we expect it to arrive during Period 5 (L=4) and become visible in the Period 6 start observation. Demand has shown a clear upward trend from P1 to P3 (134 to 338), followed by a slight stabilization in P4 (316). The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 293 units. Given the in-transit inventory of 1960 units (from orders in P1, P2, P3), we must ensure the OR backend properly calculates the base stock to cover the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher demand regime observed since Period 2, and keep L at default as we haven't seen any arrivals to contradict the promised lead time yet.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~300 units/period (P3: 338, P4: 316, P5: 544 is a significant jump suggesting further acceleration).

Daily Reward (R_t): $8967.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 134, 225, 338, 316, and 479 (the user history differs slightly from the prompt summary, so I am using the Game History values). The average demand over the last 3 periods (P3-P5) is approximately 377 units/period, showing a clear upward trend compared to the initial periods. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since L=4, the base stock must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With demand accelerating, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime peaking at 479. This results in a mu_hat of approximately (1+4) * 377 = 1885. Currently, we have 134 on-hand and 1347 in-transit (orders from P2 and P3). The OR backend will order to reach the base stock target, minus the 1481 already in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Avg demand increased from ~180 (P1-P2) to ~377 (P3-P5), a 100%+ increase. Lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11495.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe a sustained upward trend in demand. The demand for Period 6 was 616 units, following 479 in Period 5 and 316 in Period 4. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P4-P6) is approximately 470 units, compared to the earlier average of ~232. Lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods (P5 saw P1 arrival, P6 saw P2 arrival). With L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given current on-hand (209) and in-transit (1180), our pipeline inventory is 1389. To aggressively capture the growth while mitigating stockout risk, I am selecting recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-growth regime. This will base calculations on the most recent demand surge (316, 479, 616).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at P5: Moving average (N=3) jumped from ~293 at P4 to ~470 at P6 (+60% shift). Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12875.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a strong and sustained upward trajectory. The last three periods (P5-P7) recorded demands of 479, 616, and 687 respectively, with an average of 594. This is a significant jump from the previous regime. Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods based on the three arrivals observed so far (P5, P6, and P7 all arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering). With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (1+L). Based on the most recent 3-period average of ~594 units, the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (mu_hat) should be approximately 2970. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 will allow the OR engine to capture this latest growth phase. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: P5-P7 average demand is 594 (+155% vs P1-P2 avg of 179.5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a massive and sustained upward trend: P5(479), P6(616), P7(687), and P8(800). This indicates a clear demand regime shift. The N=3 average for P6-P8 is approximately 701 units per period, which is a significant increase from the initial periods. We are currently facing a stockout (on-hand = 0) because demand is outpacing previous base stock calculations and because the order from Period 4 was 0 units. In-transit inventory stands at 2010 units (from P6, P7, P8 orders). The lead time is confirmed sustained at 4 periods. Given the sharp acceleration, using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 captures the current 700+ units/period momentum. For sigma_hat, N=3 captures the recent high volatility. L remains at the promised 4 periods as observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated into a high-volume regime: P6-P8 avg is 701 units/period (+290% vs early P1-P2 avg).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a strong, sustained upward trend, moving from an early average of ~180 to a recent 3-period average (P7-P9) of 810 units, representing a significant regime shift. In Period 9, demand reached 943 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7. However, the order from Period 4 was 0 units, and there were no orders placed in Period 5, which explains the stockouts observed in Periods 8 and 9. Deliveries are expected to resume in Period 10 (from the P6 order). To address the high demand regime and stockout situation, I am setting L to 4 (promised/confirmed). I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand level (avg ~810 per period) rather than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility in this high-growth phase. This will increase the base stock level significantly to cover 5 periods (L+1) of high demand and recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated into a high-volume regime: P7-P9 avg is 810 units/period (+350% vs early P1-P2 avg). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a strong and consistent upward trend. Recent demand observations for Periods 8, 9, and 10 are 800, 943, and 1021 respectively, yielding a 3-period average of 921 units. The delivery lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P6 order arrived at P10). Despite several orders in-transit (3362 units), the current on-hand inventory is 0, indicating a stockout during Period 10 due to demand (1021) exceeding the arrival (524). To capture the current high-growth regime and minimize future lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method. My forecast for the review+lead period (L+1 = 5 periods) is based on the most recent demand level of ~1021, totaling 5105. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the high volatility observed in the latest demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 8-10 average is 921 units/period (+410% vs P1-P2 avg). High stockout risk persists as demand growth outpaces historical averages.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly. The most recent demand (P11) was 1194, and the average of the last three periods (P9-P11) is approximately 1052.7, representing a significant jump from preceding periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from P6 and P7 arriving exactly 4 periods later in P10 and P11 respectively. We are currently facing stockouts due to demand outstripping the supply triggered by earlier, lower forecasts. To mitigate this, I am setting L to 4 using the 'calculate' method (leveraging the stable observed lead time). For mu_hat, I am moving to an 'explicit' value to proactively capture the growth trend: 1052.7 (recent avg) * (1 + 4) = 5263.5. For sigma_hat, I am also using an 'explicit' value based on the standard deviation of recent high-growth periods (P9-P11, ~125.7) scaled across the lead time: 125.7 * sqrt(5) \u2248 281. This aggressive setting aims to raise the base stock level significantly to cover the current demand trajectory and recover from the on-hand inventory deficit of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 9-11 average is 1053 units/period (+480% vs P1-P2 avg). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P6/P10 and P7/P11 pairs confirm).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trajectory. The actual demand values for the last three periods (P10: 1021, P11: 1194, P12: 1137) average 1117 units/period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrivals in P10 (from P6), P11 (from P7), and P12 (from P8). Consequently, the inventory (L+1) horizon should cover 5 periods of demand. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in 5 out of the last 6 periods because recent demand has consistently outpaced the supply ordered during lower-demand regimes. To capture this growth and minimize future stockouts, mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the high-volume regime (~1117 per period). sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the volatility of this high-volume stage.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 10-12 average demand is 1117 units/period (+520% vs P1-P2 avg). Persistent stockouts due to demand outstripping historical order levels; lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16226.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sharp upward trend, with the most recent sample at Period 13 reaching 1,381 units. The rolling average for the last three periods (P11-P13) is approximately 1,237 units, while the peak demand recorded is 1,381. There are persistent stockouts because orders placed four periods ago (based on the stable 4-period lead time) are consistently lower than the current demand levels at time of arrival. To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime, which approximates current demand levels more accurately than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels. L remains 'default' (4 periods) as arrivals (P6 order at P10, P7 at P11, P8 at P12, P9 at P13) consistently confirm a 4-period lead time. This strategy aims to raise the base stock level to cover the projected 1,237 units/period across the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 11-13 average demand is 1,237 units/period (+590% vs P1-P2 avg). High stockout risk persists as demand trend remains steeply positive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19418.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a potent upward trend. Period 12 demand was 1137, Period 13 was 1381, and Period 14 was 1326. The average of the last three periods (N=3) is 1281.33 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14). Since on-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to persistent stockouts (demand consistently exceeding arrivals), and the trend is still positive, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture this high-volume regime. This will result in an expected demand over the lead time and review period (L+1 = 5) of approximately 6407. Based on the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1), the target service level is very high (~95%), necessitating aggressive ordering via the base stock policy to minimize lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 12-14 average demand is 1281 units/period (+610% vs P1-P2 avg). High stockout risk persists as demand outpaces incoming stock from older, smaller orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22914.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. Historical demand over the last three periods (P13-P15) was 1381, 1326, and 1672, averaging 1460 units. This is significantly higher than previous periods (P10-P12 avg was 1117). We are currently experiencing persistent stockouts because the orders arriving now were placed 4 periods ago when the demand forecast was lower. Specifically, we just received the P11 order (1206 units) against P15 demand (1672 units). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P11 order arrived in P15 conclusion). To stabilize the inventory position and meet the accelerating demand, I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent growth surge. Since the current demand (1672) is much higher than the 3-period average, 'recent_N' will result in a mu_hat of approximately 5 * 1460 = 7300. This should trigger an order large enough to cover the pipeline gap and eventually restore on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly at Period 15: demand reached 1672 units (+27% vs previous period), confirming the steep upward trend. P13-P15 average demand is 1460 units/period (+810% vs P1-P2 avg).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear-to-exponential growth trend. Recent demand observations are: P13(1381), P14(1326), P15(1672), and P16(1542). The average of the last 4 periods is 1480.25 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated (P12 order arrived in P16, lead time 4). Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are in a high-demand regime, a standard historical mean will significantly underestimate the stock needed for the next 5 periods (L+1). To account for the continuing growth and to prevent further stockouts (which have occurred the last 9 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Estimating a forward-looking mean of ~1650 units/period for the L+1 window, mu_hat is set to 8250 (1650 * 5). Sigma_hat is set to an explicit value of 450 to accommodate the increased volatility seen during this growth phase. L is kept at 'default' since the 4-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained at high volume: P13-P16 average demand is ~1480 units/period (+725% vs P1-P2 avg). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23997.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to scale aggressively, exhibiting a strong upward trend. The most recent demand (Period 17) was 1687 units, and the average of the last three periods (P15-P17) is approximately 1634 units. Current demand is consistently outstripping supply because the orders arriving now were placed 4 periods ago when demand was lower. Specifically, the order arriving in Period 18 was placed in Period 14 (1448 units), while demand is already over 1600. To prevent persistent stockouts, I will use an explicit forecast for demand (mu_hat) that accounts for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods). Projecting a slight continued increase from the current levels, I estimate a mean demand of 1750 units/period. Therefore, mu_hat = 1750 * (4 + 1) = 8750. I will maintain a lead time (L) of 4, as confirmed by consistent history (P13 order arrived P17). Sigma_hat is set explicitly to account for the high volatility seen during this growth phase, using a standard deviation estimate of approximately 200 units per period adjusted for the horizon (sqrt(5) * 200 \u2248 447).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth continues to accelerate: P15-P17 average demand is 1634 units/period, a significant increase from previous regimes (P13-P15 avg was 1460). Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27512.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. Recent demand observations are: P16 (1542), P17 (1687), and P18 (1793). The average demand over the last three periods (N=3) is 1674 units per period, which represents a significant increase from the previous regime. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (validated by the arrival of the P14 order in P18). Currently, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 7347 units in-transit. Because demand is accelerating faster than the lead-time arrivals can compensate, we must set parameters that reflect the current high-demand regime to ensure the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 periods) is sufficient. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent growth while acknowledging the trend. This will set mu_hat based on an average of 1674 units/period, projecting demand for 5 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 16-18 average demand is 1674 units/period (+830% vs P1-P2 avg). Upward trend is consistent and steep; stockouts remain frequent as incoming orders from earlier periods are insufficient to meet current demand.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive linear upward trend, with Period 19 reaching 1,986 units (a 10% increase over Period 18). The last 3 periods (P17-P19) average 1,822 units/period, while the last 5 periods (P15-P19) average 1,736 units/period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (P15-P19). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 7,314 units. Given the steep growth and constant stockouts (sold < demand in every period since P8), I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to project demand across the (L+1) horizon (5 periods). Projecting Period 20 demand at ~2,100, the average demand over the next 5 periods is estimated at 2,300, leading to a mu_hat of 11,500 (2,300 * 5). I am increasing sigma_hat to account for the increasing absolute variance accompanying the growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 19: demand reached 1,986 units. The P17-P19 average is 1,822 units/period (+25% vs P13-P15 avg). Continuous stockouts signal that orders are still lagging behind the trend line. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward trend, with Period 20 demand reaching 1,875 units despite limited stock. The average demand over the last three periods (P18-P20) is 1,885 units, but the single-period peak at P19 was 1,986 units, suggesting the trend has not yet plateaued. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by the P16 order arriving in P20). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we are experiencing persistent stockouts because incoming orders (size ~1,200-1,500) are being dwarfed by current demand levels (~1,900). To capture the growth and account for the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I estimate current demand is ~2,000 units/period. Over 5 periods, this equals 10,000 units. Sigma_hat is set to 1,000 to provide a buffer for the high growth volatility. Setting L to 4 (promised) ensures the pipeline inventory is correctly calculated against a 5-period risk horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained at high volume: P18-P20 average demand is 1,885 units/period (+950% vs P1-P2 avg). Strong upward momentum continues; lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37658.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. Most recently, Period 21 reached a demand of 1,995 units, and the Period 19-21 average is approximately 1,952 units/period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and recent incoming shipments are still being fully consumed (and often stock out), the stock-up level must anticipate continued growth over the next 5 periods (L+1). I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime, and explicit sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility inherent in this growth phase. The OR backend will use these values to determine the base stock needed to meet current and future demand while factoring in the in-transit pipeline of 9,044 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 19-21 average demand reached 1,952 units/period (+980% vs P1-P2 avg). Upward momentum remains robust; lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a potent upward trend. Period 22 demand reached 2,218 units, the highest recorded to date. The rolling average for the last 3 periods (P20-P22) is approximately 2,029 units, compared to the P17-P19 average of 1,822 units, representing an 11% growth in just three periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system is in a state of chronic stockout because realized demand consistently exceeds the units arriving from orders placed four periods prior (e.g., P18 order of 2,079 arrived for P22 demand of 2,218). Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on the P18-P22 arrival confirmation. To stop the cycle of stockouts and maximize profit, I must aggressively project the base stock. I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat to capture the most current high-demand regime, but I will transition to an 'explicit' value to manually account for the steep growth trend and the need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. With demand accelerating toward 2,300+ units, a target base stock reflecting ~2,250 units/period is necessary. 2,250 * 5 = 11,250. Given the backend logic (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat), I will set mu_hat to 11,250 and sigma_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for the high variance observed during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains robust: Period 20-22 average demand is 2,029 units/period (+1000% vs P1-P2). The trend is increasing by ~100 units/period every 2-3 periods. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has consistently outpaced order volumes, leading to chronic stockouts. In Period 23, demand reached 2,449 units, while-on hand inventory was only 1,487 units. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P21-P23) is approximately 2,221 units, and the trend shows a sustained increase of roughly 100-200 units per period. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the P19 order in P23). To capture the current growth and mitigate persistent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to reflect the projected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). Given the current average of ~2,221 and the accelerating trend, a forward-looking forecast of 2,450 units per period is used (2,450 * 5 = 12,250). I am also using an explicit sigma_hat of 600 (approx. 270 per period * sqrt(5)) to account for the increasing volatility observed during this high-growth phase. Lead time (L) is set to 4 based on consistent history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 23: demand reached 2,449 units (+23% vs Period 21). Period 21-23 average is 2,221 units/period. Upward trend remains extremely steep; chronic stockouts persist as demand growth continues to exceed the rate of increase in incoming supply.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46458.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has led to persistent stockouts as demand consistently outstrips the volume of orders placed 4 periods ago. The most recent demand (Period 24) reached 2,460 units. Analyzing the last three periods (P22-P24), the average demand is 2,376 units. However, looking at the trajectory from P21 (1,995) to P24 (2,460), demand is increasing by roughly 10-15% every few periods. To prevent further stockouts, I need to set mu_hat based on an explicit forecast that anticipates further growth over the (L+1) horizon (5 periods). Given the average growth, I am forecasting an average demand of 2,600 units per period for the next cycle. Lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (P20 order arrived P24). I will use explicit values for mu_hat (5 * 2,600 = 13,000) and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend maintenance a high base stock level to capture this rapid growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains steep: P22-P24 average demand is 2,376 units/period. The trend indicates a growth of approximately 100-150 units/period every 2 periods. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43162.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, though potentially stabilizing at a new high-volume regime. Period 25 demand was 2,309, with a 3-period average (P23-P25) of 2,406. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 21 order in Period 25. On-hand inventory has finally moved above zero (709 units) as larger orders placed in Period 20 and 21 have begun arriving, but current demand still threatens to deplete this without aggressive stock replenishment. Given the clear and sustained trend, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current demand volume (~2,400 per period) and its associated volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation, which covers (L+1) periods, is grounded in the contemporary demand level rather than historical averages that underrepresent current needs.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains high: P23-P25 average demand is 2,406 units/period. On-hand inventory is finally positive (709) as high-volume orders (P20-P21) arrived. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from an aggressive growth phase into a high-volume steady state, averaging approximately 2,399 units over the last three periods (P24-P26: 2460, 2309, 2427). The lead time remains highly consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 24, 25, and 26. In-transit inventory is high (10,174 units), reflecting large orders placed during the peak growth phase (P23-P25). Period 26 ended with a stockout (ending on-hand 0) because the incoming shipment (1,457 units from P22) was insufficient to cover the demand of 2,427 units. However, larger shipments reflecting the current demand regime are expected to arrive starting Period 27 (ordered P23-P25). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized high-volume regime while acknowledging recent volatility, and set L based on the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has stabilized at a high volume: Period 22-26 average is 2,373 units/period. The steep upward trend observed previously has flattened into a high-plateau regime (~2,350-2,450 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $48608.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a high volume. Over the last five periods (P23-P27), demand has leveled off with an average of approximately 2,442 units per period (2,449, 2,460, 2,309, 2,427, 2,565), showing a departure from the previously steep upward trend. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P23 order arriving in P27). Inventory management has improved, with on-hand stock finally becoming positive in recent periods as the larger orders placed during the high-growth phase (P20-P21, P23) arrived. To maintain this stability and avoid back to back stockouts while minimizing holding costs, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this plateaued mean of ~2,442. This sets the base stock level to cover (1+L) periods, which is (1+4)=5 periods of demand (~12,210 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), the backend will naturally target a high service level (approx 95%).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high plateau: Period 23-27 average is 2,442 units/period, ending the steep upward trend seen in previous weeks.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a period of high-growth acceleration to a sustained high-volume plateau phase. Over the last 5 periods (P24-P28), demand has averaged approximately 2,499 units, with the most recent observation reaching 2,733. While the trend was previously steep, it is now stabilizing between 2,400 and 2,750 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods via the arrival of orders from P20-P24 in P24-P28. Inventory management has improved as higher-volume orders placed during the growth phase are now arriving, though we remain close to stockout levels (ending on-hand 286). I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-plateau regime while filtering out the noise from the earlier exponential growth phase. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate given the high stability of the 4-period lead time observed in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has stabilized at a high-volume plateau: Period 24-28 average is 2,499 units/period. The steep upward trend has slowed, moving into a stable high-demand phase (~2,400-2,750 units).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-volume plateau following a long period of aggressive growth. The last three periods show demand values of 2427, 2565, 2733, and 2915, with a 5-period average (P25-P29) of approximately 2590 units per period. The lead time has remained exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods across nearly all concluded shipments. Current on-hand inventory is 707, and the in-transit pipeline is substantial. To maintain service levels while avoiding excessive holding costs on this high-volume/high-value item, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this current stable plateau. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. Lead time (L) remains at the established value of 4 via the calculate method.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: P25-P29 average is 2590 units/period, showing a slowdown in the previous steep growth trend. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume plateau. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is approximately 2,701 units. While previous periods showed a very steep upward trend, the growth has decelerated significantly, fluctuating between ~2,400 and ~2,900 units. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, verified by dozens of successful arrivals (most recently P30 seeing the P26 order). On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the arrival in P30 (1,254 from P26) was much smaller than the current demand (2,866), reflecting a dip in the ordering volume from four periods ago. To ensure we cover demand during the review and lead time (L+1 = 5 periods), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), as this captures the current stabilized high-demand regime better than the long-term average. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the high unit profit ($19.0) versus low holding cost ($1.0), aiming for a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high-volume plateau: P26-P30 average is 2,701 units/period. The steep growth phase (P10-P25) has ended.

Daily Reward (R_t): $39463.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a steep growth phase into a high-volume regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is approximately 2,843 units per period. While the growth rate has slowed compared to the hyper-growth seen earlier (P10-P25), the demand is still trending slightly upwards, as evidenced by the Period 31 demand reaching 3,137 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P27/P31 pair). Current on-hand inventory is 0, indicating that while larger orders are arriving, they are still being immediately consumed by current demand levels. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this most recent stabilized high-demand regime (avg ~2,843/period), which provides a more responsive forecast than the long-term average while still smoothing volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current regime's variance. L is set to 'calculate' to continue utilizing the consistently observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high-volume plateau: P27-P31 average is 2,843 units/period. The steep upward trend has moderated, but demand remains high with occasional peaks above 3,000 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has transitioned from a sharp growth phase to a high-volume steady state, but with recent demand peaks exceeding 3,000 units (Period 31: 3,137). Period 32 demand was 2,897. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P28-P32) is approximately 2,910 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, largely because incoming shipments from the previous 'plateau' detection phase (orders from P28 back) are slightly lower than current demand peaks. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we are in a stabilized high-demand regime, I am using a recent window (N=5) to capture the current mean (~2,910) and volatility. Setting L to 4 reflects the proven actual lead time. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high-volume plateau while preventing over-ordering if growth has truly stalled.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52478.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a period of steep growth into a high-volume plateau regime. Over the most recent 5 periods (P29-P33), demand has averaged 3,029 units, with the most recent sample at 3,332 units. This indicates that while the radical growth phase has moderated, the volume is still slightly ticking upward. The lead time remains consistent at exactly 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this new plateau level without being skewed by the earlier lower-demand growth phase. sigma_hat is also set using N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This approach helps the OR backend maintain a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while avoiding excessive holding costs from over-projecting the previous growth trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has plateaued at approximately 3,000 units/period (P29-P33 average: 3,029). The steep growth phase (P10-P25) has concluded, replaced by a high-volume steady state with moderate volatility.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume plateau phase. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 3,089 units, compared to the P29-P33 average of 3,029 units, confirming a shift from steep growth to a steady-state high-demand regime. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand (3,213) exceeded the arrival from P30 (2,987). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the inventory is currently 0 and in-transit stock is 12,695, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to reflect the contemporary plateau mean and variance. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the current stability, minimizing both stockouts and excessive holding costs as we move toward the final periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed around 3,100 units/period: P30-P34 average is 3,089 units (+0.5% growth vs P29-P33), indicating stability after the long growth phase.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime following a long growth phase. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 3,214 units, with the most recent sample at 3,490. This indicates a minor but consistent upward drift within the stabilized plateau. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P31 in P35. Since the on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we are facing a series of minor stockouts (sales are limited by arrivals), it is critical to set parameters that fully capture the current demand level plus a buffer for the observed volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the high-plateau mean (~3,214 per period) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for recent variance. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at ~3,200 units/period starting around Period 31 (P31-P35 avg: 3,214). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a steep growth phase into a high-volume regime. The most recent demand at Period 36 was 3,748, following 3,490 at Period 35, indicating that while the growth has moderated compared to early periods, there is still an upward lean or significant volatility at this high level (~3,200-3,700). Average demand over the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is approximately 3,336 units. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36. Although there have been frequent stockouts because demand often exceeds the specific volume of the arriving older orders, on-hand inventory is zero, and we must rely on the pipeline. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-plateau demand and its current volatility, and use 'calculate' for lead time since it has been highly consistent at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high-volume level, averaging ~3,336 units over P32-P36. Occasional peaks above 3,500 units (P36: 3,748) suggest continued volatility in this new steady state.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime, averaging approximately 3,480 units over the last 5 periods (P33-P37). While the growth has slowed compared to the explosive early-game trend, there is still a slight upward drift and significant volatility (peaks up to 3,748). Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand (3,643) exceeding the arriving order from Period 33 (3,104). To prevent further stockouts, mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P33-P37) to capture this most recent steady-state average of ~3,485 units per period. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods across all confirmed arrivals. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility of this high-demand plateau. Since the backend uses (1+L) * mean, setting N=5 will projected expected demand over the lead time + current period based on the most relevant recent data.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at ~3,480 units/period (P33-P37 average). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 39 continues to show signs of stabilizing at a high plateau, though it reached a new peak average of approximately 3,480 units over the last 5 periods (P34-P38). The current on-hand inventory is 0, indicating that incoming shipments from 4 periods ago are still being fully consumed immediately upon arrival. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P34 order arrived P38). To account for the recent stabilization at this higher level while managing the risk of further small increases, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most relevant demand volume (average ~3,489). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility in this plateau phase. L is set to 'default' as the lead time of 4 is stable and matches the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at a higher volume of ~3,500 units/period (P34-P38 average: 3,489). Earlier growth phase has transitioned into a high-demand steady state with moderate volatility.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a high-volume plateau of approximately 3,500 units per period. Evaluating the recently concluded periods (P35-P39), the demand values were 3490, 3748, 3643, 3371, and 3792, yielding a 5-period average of ~3,609. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods by recent arrivals (e.g., P35 order arriving at P39). Despite high-volume orders, we remain in a cycle of stockouts because current arrivals (ordered 4 periods ago) are consistently slightly below current demand levels. To break the stockout cycle and achieve a positive inventory position, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the current 3,600+ demand regime, and use the default lead time (L=4) which is consistent with historical observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at ~3,600 units/period (P35-P39 average: 3,609). Stockouts persist as incoming supply from earlier orders lags slightly behind the current plateau volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68001.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a steady growth phase to an even higher-volume regime. The most recent demand at Period 40 reached 4,106 units, following a sequence of 3,748, 3,643, 3,371, and 3,792. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is ~3,732 units/period, which is approximately 20% higher than the 3,100 unit plateau observed around Period 35. I will update the demand forecast (mu_hat) using a recent_N method with N=5 to capture this latest step-up in volume. The lead time (L) remains consistently stable at 4 periods, which is confirmed by every successful delivery in the history. Despite heavy in-transit volumes, the system is currently stock-out because incoming orders were based on lower historical demand. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (reflecting the 3,700+ per period regime), I enable the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for both the current high volume and the observed volatility (sigma) to minimize future stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 40: Avg demand increased to ~3,732 units/period (P36-P40), a ~20% increase from the previous plateau of ~3,100 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new accelerated growth phase characterized by a regime shift observed since Period 40. The average demand across the most recent three periods (P39-P41) is approximately 4,003 units, which is significantly higher than previous plateaus. Historical evidence confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (P37 order arrived in P41). Since we are currently experiencing stockouts (Ending On-hand: 0) and demand is outstripping incoming supply from earlier, smaller orders, I am updating the demand forecast parameters to reflect this recent high-volume regime. Using N=3 for mu_hat specifically targets this latest spike (avg ~4000) to ensure the OR backend generates base stock levels sufficient to cover the (L+1) horizon of 5 periods (~20,000 units total), helping to mitigate the chronic stockout pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 41: 3-period moving average reached 4,003 units, representing a ~10-15% increase over the P35-P39 plateau (~3,600 units).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new accelerated growth phase starting around Period 40. The 3-period moving average has risen significantly, reaching 4,212 units (P40-P42). Recent demand figures (P40: 4106, P41: 4110, P42: 4421) confirm a shift from the previous ~3,600 plateau. Lead time is consistently stable at 4 periods, verified by sequential arrivals matching orders from 4 periods prior. To account for this recent sharp increase and prevent persistent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture the current velocity of ~4212 units/period. Over (L+1)=5 periods, this leads to a mu_hat of approximately 21,060. Sigma_hat is also adjusted using N=3 to reflect the increased volatility in this higher-demand regime. This approach aligns the base stock level with the current trend while acknowledging the 4-period lead time delay in arriving stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 42: Demand has accelerated past the 3,600 plateau, with a 3-period average (P40-P42) of 4,212 units (+17%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered another significant growth phase. The average demand over the last three periods (P41-P43) is 4,192 units, which is a substantial increase from the previous plateau of ~3,600. Specifically, Period 42 saw a peak of 4,421 units. To prevent stockouts, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this new regime using a recent_N of 4 (covering the recent lift from Period 40 onwards). This results in a higher demand base for the (L+1) period horizon. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as verified by the arrival of the Period 39 order in Period 43. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to capture the increased volatility associated with this higher demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated into a new high-volume regime starting Period 40: P41-P43 average demand is 4,192 units (+16% vs P35-P39 avg of 3,609). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-volume regime starting around Period 40. The 3-period moving average (P42-P44) is approximately 4,285 units, confirming a significant shift from the previous ~3,600 plateau. Lead time remains exceptionally stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by every concluded order arrival (e.g., P40 order arrived in P44). The system is currently in a state of chronic stockout because incoming orders (sized for previous demand levels) are insufficient to meet the current actual demand. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the current high-demand regime (Avg P40-P44 \u2248 4,214). mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 5 * 4214 = 21070. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods to capture the increased volatility in this new regime. L is maintained at the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime confirmed: P40-P44 average demand reached 4,214 units/period, a ~17% increase over the previous P35-P39 plateau (~3,600 units).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a new high-volume regime since Period 40. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is approximately 4,274 units, which is significantly higher than the previous plateau of ~3,600 units. Although the game is nearing its end (Period 46 of 50), the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining, orders placed now will arrive in Period 50. Inventory is currently 0, and we are experiencing consistent stockouts because incoming orders from previous periods (P41, P42, etc.) are slightly lower than current demand levels. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this most recent plateau of ~4,274 per period, adjusted for the lead time (1+L=5). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent volatility within this high-demand phase. This high base stock setting aims to maximize revenue for the final periods while acknowledging that we can only impact the very last arrival window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~4,275 units/period (P41-P45 average: 4,274). This represents a consistent high-volume level after the growth observed at P40.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime following a growth acceleration that began around Period 40. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is approximately 4,345 units. Although Period 46 showed a slight drop to 4,466 compared to previous peaks, the overall trend remains elevated. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (confirmed by the arrival of P42's order in P46). With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), and a lead time of 4, orders placed today will arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends). My strategy now focuses on utilizing the substantial in-transit pipeline (17,517 units) to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current plateau and use default for L and sigma_hat to maintain standard buffer calculations, as current on-hand and pipeline levels are sufficient for the remaining horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84794.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a high plateau of approximately 4,400 units per period (P42-P47 average: 4,395). Over the last three periods (P45-P47), demand was 4,407, 4,466, and 4,468, suggesting high stability with low variance. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P43 order arrived in P47). With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50), and on-hand inventory plus a massive pipeline (19,633 units) already covering over 4 periods of demand at the current rate (totaling ~19,731 units), no additional orders are necessary. The OR backend's capped policy should ideally result in a zero order given the high pipeline (which is roughly 4.4x the required base stock for the remaining horizon). To reflect the current stable high-demand regime, I set N=7 for recent demand and sigma calculation to capture the start of the current plateau at Period 41. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it has been perfectly stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed at ~4,450 units/period (P45-P47 average: 4,447). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 48 reaching 4,822 units, surpassing the previous plateau of ~4,450. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we have reached Period 49 and the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now must account for the high demand in the final periods, even though a 4rd-period lead time means this order arrives after the game ends. However, the OR backend requires parameters to calculate the base stock for the current period's logic. I will use the last 5 periods (P44-P48) to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~4,420). This ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate to prevent stockouts from the inventory already in transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at P48: reached 4,822 units. P44-P48 average demand is 4,418 units/period, indicating a shift from the ~4,200 level.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered another significant growth phase. Period 49 demand reached 5,048, and the 3-period moving average (P47-P49) is ~4,779 compared to the previous plateau of ~4,450. Frequent stockouts reflect an environment where incoming supply from orders placed 4 periods ago (based on lower demand profiles) is consistently insufficient. Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods (P45 order arrived P49). I am adopting 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest acceleration and high volatility immediately, ensuring the OR engine calculates a base stock that accounts for (1+L) periods of demand, currently trending near 5,000 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at P48: Period 47-49 average demand is 4,779 units/period (+7% jump from the P45-P47 plateau and +25% from the P40 level).
