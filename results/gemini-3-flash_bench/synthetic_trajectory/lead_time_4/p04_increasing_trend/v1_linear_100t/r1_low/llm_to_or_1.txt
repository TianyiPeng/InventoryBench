Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no historical arrival data yet to verify the actual lead time, I will use the 'default' method for L. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend from Period 1 (107) to Period 5 (544). To capture this growth and ensure we are not under-ordering due to stale historical averages, I will use an 'explicit' value for mu_hat. The average demand across these 5 periods is 315.4 units. I forecast the immediate next period demand to be around 550. For the review period (1) plus lead time (4), total demand is (1+4) * 550 = 2750. For volatility (sigma_hat), I'll use the 'default' method, which calculates the standard deviation across all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L), providing a reasonable starting point for safety stock until more data is available.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, an order of 815 units was placed, which is now 'In-transit'. Due to the lead time, no stock arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0), and demand was 134, leading to lost sales as the starting inventory was 0. Demand history shows a clear upward trend (P1: 107, P2: 252, P3: 298, P4: 376, P5: 544 from the provided samples). Specifically, the demand observed in the 'conclude' message for Period 1 was 134 (internal game history), which is higher than the historical Period 1 sample of 107. Since demand is scaling rapidly, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=1 (the most recent concluded period) to capture this growth. I will set L to 'default' as we haven't reached the first delivery window (P5/P6) to evaluate actual lead time performance.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time is 4 periods. The order of 815 units placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (L=4 means N+L = 1+4=5), and will be visible in the Period 6 decision phase. Consequently, we have had zero on-hand inventory for Periods 1 and 2, resulting in lost sales as demand (134 in P1, 225 in P2) could not be met. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: P1=107, P2=252, P3=298, P4=376, P5=544 (based on provided samples) and the game history shows P1=134 and P2=225. Given the product 'chips' and the sharp increasing trend, I will use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the growth while respecting the 4-period lead time. No shipments are lost yet; they are simply within the promised 4-period window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The initial demand history suggested a rising trend (107, 252, 298, 376, 544). Actual observed demand in the game history for Periods 1-3 (134, 225, 338) confirms a significant upward trajectory. Inventory is currently critical: On-hand is 0, and we have experienced 0 sales due to lack of stock. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (815 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (L=4), meaning it will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message and available for use in Period 6. Currently, 1471 units (815 + 656) are in-transit. Given the steep demand growth, the primary objective is to build sufficient inventory to stop the lost sales. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the accelerating growth trend observed in the first three periods, and 'default' for lead time and volatility as there is no evidence yet to deviate from the promised lead time or total history dispersion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (815 units) was placed in Period 1. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period N with L=4 arrives during Period N+4 and becomes visible in the Period N+4 conclude message (read at Period N+5). Therefore, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 5) and will be reflected in next period's observation. We have experienced 0 sales for 4 periods due to 0 starting inventory, resulting in significant lost demand. Historical demand samples (107, 252, 298, 376, 544) show a clear upward trend. The mean of the last 3 samples (298, 376, 544) is 406. With L=4, the coverage period is (L+1)=5. Using the trended average of 406, mu_hat = 406 * 5 = 2030. Given the high volatility in the startup phase, I will use an explicit sigma_hat estimate to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the increasing demand variance.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order from Period 1 (815 units) arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a strong upward trend: 134, 225, 338, 316, 479 (Average last 3: ~378; Average last 2: ~398). Current on-hand is 336, with 1215 in transit (orders from P3 and P5). Since demand is clearly increasing, I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand forecasting to capture the growth without over-reacting to the single highest point (P5). Setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the demand for chips(Regular) has shown a strong and steady upward trend: P1: 134, P2: 225, P3: 338, P4: 316, P5: 479, P6: 616. The average demand over the last 3 periods is approximately 470 units per period. The promised lead time is 4, and the P1 order arrived exactly at P5 (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. However, we are currently out of stock (ending on-hand=0 at P6) and have 1553 units in transit (orders from P3, P5, and P6). With demand increasing rapidly, using only historical averages will underestimate needs. I am choosing N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent growth while maintaining the default lead time (L=4). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the increased volatility associated with the higher demand levels. This will set a base stock that better covers the (L+1) period demand horizon (5 periods x ~470 = 2350).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Strong upward trend observed from P1 (134) to P6 (616); lead time confirmed at 4 periods based on P1 arrival in P5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $656.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a strong upward trend, increasing from 134 in P1 to 687 in P7. On-hand inventory is currently 0, despite a P3 order arriving in P7, because demand (687) exceeded the arrival (656). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5; P3 arrived P7). Total in-transit is 1,615 units (orders from P5, P6, and P7). The next expected arrival is P5's order in P9. Given the growth trend (CAGR ~30% per period), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 4-7, avg ~524) while accounting for the laggard effect of the promised lead time L=4. Since (1+L) = 5, the OR backend will calculate mu_hat as 5 * avg(P4-P7), which is approximately 2620, ensuring sufficient base stock to cover demand across the lead time and the current period.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Avg demand increased from 232 (P1-P3) to 524 (P4-P7), showing a +125% regime shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a strong and consistent upward trend. Recent demand has surged from 134 in Period 1 to 800 in Period 8. The most recent three periods (P6-P8) average 701 units, while the five periods since the initial growth phase (P4-P8) average approximately 580. Choosing N=5 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) accounts for this shift while providing some stabilization against the most recent spike to 800. The lead time (L) is confirmed at 4 periods (based on arrivals in P5 and P7), so L is set to 'default'. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the increased volatility associated with the higher demand regime. We are currently facing stockouts due to the rapid demand growth outpacing initial orders, so a responsive 'recent_N' approach is necessary to raise the base stock level and pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Avg demand increased further, reaching 800 units in P8. P6-P8 average is 701 (+34% vs previous 4-period avg). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on P3 order arriving in P7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $559.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, moving from an average of ~524 (P4-P7) to a recent 3-period average of 786 (P7-P9), with P9 reaching a new high of 943. While promised lead time is 4, arrivals from P1, P3, and P5 have consistently confirmed an actual lead time of 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after P9 demand exceeded supply. In-transit inventory is 2,339 units (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). To account for the continuing growth and minimize stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand forecasting to capture the latest surge (P6-P9 mean: 761.5) and set mu_hat/sigma_hat accordingly. The backend will calculate base stock using (1+L) demand (5 periods), approximately covering ~3800 units total cycle stock. With 2339 in transit and high demand, the OR backend needs to maintain a high base stock to recover from current stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P7-P9) is 810 units, representing an addition +15% increase from the previous P6-P8 average of 701.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is experiencing a strong, sustained upward demand trend. The most recent demand (P10) hit 1,021 units, with a 3-period average (P8-P10) of 921 units, representing a significant increase over earlier averages. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by P6's order arriving in P10). Since the promised lead time (4) matches the observed lead time, I will use 'default' for L. For \u03bc\u0302, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand regime of ~921 units/period, which across L+1=5 periods estimates demand at ~4,605 units. This aggressive setting is necessary to catch up with persistent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 for the last five periods) and to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to cover the lead time pipeline in a high-growth scenario.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P8-P10) reached 921 units (+14% vs P7-P9 avg of 810). Observed lead time remains 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $718.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. The average demand over the last three periods (P9-P11) is 1052.6 units, which is a 14% increase over the previous three-period average (P8-P10) of 921 units. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on systematic arrivals from Period 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and because we are in a high-growth phase where demand consistently exceeds arrivals, we are experiencing stockouts. To account for this growth and Ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation (which targets a 50% service level given equal profit and holding cost) covers the lead time + 1 period (5 periods total), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent local mean. I am using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the volatility of the growth regime while maintaining enough samples for a stable standard deviation calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P9-P11) reached 1053 units (+14% vs P8-P10 avg of 921). Observed lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. The most recent demand samples are P10: 1021, P11: 1194, and P12: 1137. The average of the last three periods is approximately 1117 units. To capture this growth more effectively than a simple mean of all history, I am using recent_N (N=3) for demand estimation. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the conclusion of orders from P1, P3, P5, P6, P7, and P8. Thus, I will continue using the promised/calculated lead time of 4. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to demand consistently outstripping supply arrivals (stockouts in P10, P11, and P12). The pipeline (In-transit) is 4002, which includes orders from P9 (489), P10 (997), P11 (1106), and P12 (1410). The OR backend parameter mu_hat should reflect the expected demand over (L+1)=5 periods. Setting mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) allows the model to adapt to the 1100+ unit demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to focus on the volatility of this high-demand stage.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P10-P12) reached 1117 units (+6% vs P9-P11 avg of 1053). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P11-P13) is 1237 units, which is an 11% increase over the previous P10-P12 average of 1117. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for 8 consecutive periods) because the backend's capped policy and pipeline inventory calculations haven't fully absorbed this rapid growth in a context where lead time is 4 periods. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P11, P12, and P13). To ensure the OR backend captures the most recent demand level and trend, I will use a short-window recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set mu_hat based on the average of ~1237 units per period, projected over the 5-period horizon (L+1). L will be set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is stable and confirmed by history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P11-P13) reached 1237 units (+11% vs P10-P12 avg of 1117). Stockouts continue as demand outpaces pipeline arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $997.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. The most recent demand was 1,326 in Period 14, with a 3-period average (P12-P14) of 1,281 units, representing a 3.5% increase over the P11-P13 average (1,237). The current pipeline inventory is 5,190 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at current rates. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with the observed arrival in Period 14 (ordered P10). Despite regular arrivals, we remain at zero ending inventory due to the rapid demand growth outpacing older, smaller orders. To address this, I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent, highest-demand regime (P12-P14) and provide sufficient protection for the upcoming Lead time + Review period (L+1 = 5 periods). L is maintained at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P12-P14) reached 1281 units (+3.5% vs P11-P13 avg of 1237). Lead time continues stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1106.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. The most recent demand (P15) spiked to 1672 units, and the 3-period average (P13-P15) is 1460 units, which is a 14% increase over the previous calculation (P12-P14 avg of 1281). Despite the pipeline inventory of 5301 units, constant stockouts (on-hand 0 at start of P16) indicate that previous forecasts were too conservative. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P11 order arrived in P15). Given the clear and consistent growth regime, I will use a 3-period window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand state and volatility. L will be set to 'calculate' as it has consistently matched the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P13-P15) reached 1460 units (+14% vs P12-P14 avg). Inventory remains insufficient to meet demand despite increasing order sizes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1410.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a clear upward demand trend. The demand in Period 16 was 1542 units, and the 3-period average (P14-P16) is 1513 units. Despite increasing order sizes, the system remains in a chronic stockout state because current arrivals (ordered 4 periods ago) are significantly lower than current demand levels. The promised and actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, directing the base stock towards the mean. To address the rapid growth and the backlog of unmet demand, I will use an explicit forecast. Forecast Calculation: Based on the trend, I project mean demand to reach ~1650 for P17-P21. For a lead time (L) of 4, the mu_hat (demand over L+1 periods) is 5 * 1650 = 8250 units. Setting an explicit sigma_hat of 500 (~6% CV) to provide a buffer for volatility while managing holding cost risks.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P14-P16) reached 1513 units (+3.6% vs P13-P15 avg of 1460). Stockouts persist as lead-time delayed arrivals remain below current demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1263.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trend, which has been consistent since Period 1. The demand in Period 17 reached 1,687 units. Calculating the 3-period average (P15-P17) gives 1,633.6 units, compared to the P14-P16 average of 1,513, indicating a continued growth of approximately 8%. Lead time remains exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 13 order in Period 17. The system is currently in a state of chronic stockout because the pipeline inventory arriving now was ordered when demand was significantly lower. To capture this growth and minimize lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to prioritize the most current volume, while using an 'explicit' sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility associated with this rapid growth phase. Setting L to 4 as established by historical consistency.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P15-P17) reached 1634 units (+8% vs P14-P16 avg of 1513). Stockouts continue as arrivals from previous lower-demand periods are insufficient.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1411.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward linear trend. The most recent demand at Period 18 was 1793 units, with a 3-period trailing average (P16-P18) of 1674 units, which is approximately +32% higher than the P12-P14 average. Stockouts remain systemic because current arrivals (from orders placed 4 periods ago) are consistently 200-400 units below current demand. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P14 order arrived in P18). To break the stockout cycle and account for the (L+1=5) period risk window in a growing market, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating projected demand: Period 19 forecast ~1880, Period 23 forecast ~2200. The sum of demand for Periods 19 through 23 is approximately 10,200 units. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility associated with this rapid growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P16-P18) reached 1674 units (+10% vs P15-P17 average of 1513). Structural stockouts persist as trailing arrivals remain below the accelerating demand curve.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1217.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as evidenced by P15's order arriving in P19). Current demand in Period 19 reached 1,986 units, and the 3-period average (P17-P19) is approximately 1,822 units, representing a significant increase over previous windows. Because the product is in a structural stockout phase (on-hand is 0, sales are limited by arrivals), the recorded demand figures are likely close to true demand as they are reported independently of sales. To break the cycle of stockouts, mu_hat must account for the projected demand over the (L+1) horizon (5 periods) while accounting for this growth. The average of the last 3 periods (1822) serves as the most relevant base for the current regime. Setting L to 4 (promised/confirmed) and using the most recent 3-period window for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the base stock reflects the current high-demand environment and the volatility associated with it.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P17-P19) reached 1822 units (+8.8% vs P16-P18 average). Structural stockouts persist as trailing arrivals from lower-demand periods (P15) remain significantly below current demand requirements.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. The most recent demand (P20) was 1875 units, and the 3-period average (P18-P20) is 1885 units. Compared to the previous 3-period average (P17-P19) of 1822 units, the growth is approximately 3.5%. The system is in a structural stockout state because incoming shipments (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are significantly lower than current demand levels. To address this, I am projecting next period's demand to be approximately 1950 units. With a stable lead time (L) of 4 periods, we need to cover demand across the next 5 periods (L+1). My mu_hat calculation (explicit) is 5 * 2000 = 10000 units to account for the ongoing trend and ensure the base stock levels are high enough to trigger maximum orders (cap) and eventually close the inventory gap. sigma_hat is set explicitly to 300 to reflect the increasing variability accompanying the high demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P18-P20) reached 1885 units (+3.5% vs P17-P19 avg). Structural stockouts persist as arrivals from P16 are still below current demand. Actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

This represents a 3.5% increase over the previous 3-period average (P18-P20) and confirms that we are still in an growth phase. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (most recently P17 order arriving in P21). To account for the continuous growth and the structural stockouts observed in history (where arrivals based on previous lower demand levels fail to meet current demand), I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3. This focuses the forecast on the most recent, highest demand levels to ensure the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 = 5 periods) is sufficiently aggressive to catch up to the trend and finally build a small safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P19-P21) reached 1952 units (+3.5% vs P18-P20 avg). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. Most recent demand (P22) was 2218, and the 3-period average (P20-P22) is approximately 2029 units, representing a consistent ~4-5% period-over-period growth. Structural stockouts have persisted for over 15 periods because the trailing arrivals (from orders placed 4 periods ago) are consistently lower than current demand levels. To stop the cycle of stockouts, mu_hat must be set to cover the projected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). Given current demand at 2218, I forecast the average demand over the lead time to be slightly higher (approx 2350) to account for the sustained growth trend. Thus, mu_hat for the P+L window (5 periods) is set to 11750. Sigma_hat is kept high via N=10 to account for the volatility seen during this aggressive growth phase. Lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P20-P22) reached 2029 units (+4% vs P19-P21 avg). Structural stockouts persist as arrivals from P18 (1757) are significantly below current demand of 2218. Lead time remains fixed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2335.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for chips(Regular) continues its sustained linear growth trend. The 3-period average (P21-P23) has reached 2221 units, up from the previous 3-period average of 2029 (a ~9.5% increase). We are in a state of 'structural stockout' because the arrivals (e.g., P19 order of 2335 arriving in P23) are lagging behind the current demand (2449 in P23). To maximize reward, we must set mu_hat to reflect the projected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). Given current growth, the forecast for the next several periods will exceed the current mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent, highest demand levels (avg ~2221) but specify 'explicit' for mu_hat to account for the clear upward momentum. Since lead time is stable at 4, L+1 = 5. I will set mu_hat to 12500 (approx 2500 per period x 5) to ensure the base stock is aggressive enough to end the cycle of stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P21-P23) reached 2221 units (+9.5% vs P20-P22 average). Structural stockouts continue as specific order arrivals from P19 (2335) were insufficient to meet P23 demand (2449). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a aggressive linear growth trend. Demand in Period 24 reached 2,460 units, and the 3-period average (P22-P24) is now 2,375 units, a 7% increase over the previous evaluation window. Despite increasing order sizes, the system remains in a structural stockout state because arrivals (currently from Period 20, which had an order of only 1,234 units) are lagging significantly behind current demand levels. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. To break the cycle of stockouts and account for the sustained growth, I am increasing the demand forecast (mu_hat) significantly using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Projecting a forward-looking mean of ~2,600 units/period to account for the ongoing trend, the base stock should be approximately 13,000. mu_hat is set to 12,800 to aggressively capture this requirement and offset the 'cap' logic of the OR backend, which otherwise restricts order sizes based on historical averages that no longer reflect the current regime. sigma_hat is also set explicitly to reflect the higher volatility seen in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P22-P24) reached 2,375 units (+7% vs P21-P23 avg). Structural stockouts remain severe as arrivals from P20 (1,234) were less than 50% of P24 demand (2,460). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. Historical demand for the last few periods has hovered between 2300 and 2460 units. Specifically, the average demand of the last 3 periods (P23-P25) is approximately 2406. Given the persistent stockouts and technical 'Lost Sales' (as shown by ending inventory frequently hitting zero despite large orders), the actual underlying demand is likely higher than the recorded sales. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since the current backend calculation for 'mu_hat' represents demand over (L+1) periods (in this case, 5 periods), and the trend is still aggressive, I will use an 'explicit' value to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to cover the growth and finally rebuild safety stock. I estimate the upcoming average demand per period at 2650 units (accounting for the continued trend observed in the history). Therefore, mu_hat = (4+1) * 2650 = 13250. To account for the high volatility and potential for even steeper shifts, I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 1200.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P23-P25) reached ~2406 units. Structural stockouts continue as pipeline arrivals fail to meet the accelerating demand curve. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. Most recent demand (P24: 2460, P25: 2309, P26: 2427) averages 2398. However, the 3-period average from P19-P21 was approx 2066, and from P22-P24 was 2406. The trend suggests demand is now stabilizing near 2450-2500 units per period. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P22 order arrived in P26). Current 'In-transit' is 11,188 units, covering orders from P23, P24, P25, and P26. We are currently in a persistent stockout state because arrivals (based on orders placed 4 periods ago) were smaller than current demand. To break this cycle and account for the (L+1) = 5 period requirement of the base-stock policy, I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the current demand level plus a buffer for the continued trend. Forecasting demand to be ~2500 per period, mu_hat (5-period demand) = 12,500. Sigma remains high due to the rapid growth phase, so I'll use recent_N to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth appears to be reaching a plateau near 2400-2500 units (P23-P26 average: 2411). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) appears to have reached a plateau phase after a sustained period of rapid growth. The 4-period average demand (P24-P27) is approximately 2,440 units, compared to a slightly lower 2,411 calculated in the previous period. For the decision in Period 28, we observe that on-hand inventory finally shows a surplus (251 units) after severe structural stockouts, thanks to the arrival of a large order from P23 (2,816 units). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Given the current plateau, using a 4-period recent window for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to capture the stabilized mean of ~2,440 and the observed variance during this period. The backend OR logic will use these parameters to determine the order size required to maintain the base stock level (approximately coverage for L+1 = 5 periods) while accounting for the significant in-transit pipeline (9,684 units), which includes recent large orders intended to bridge the stockout gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth plateau confirmed: 4-period average (P24-P27) is 2440 units, showing stabilization compared to previous rapid acceleration. Stockouts have ceased as of P27 due to arrival of larger orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2337.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a long period of rapid growth. The 5-period average (P24-P28) is approximately 2498 units, and the most recent demand (P28) was 2733, suggesting the plateau might be slightly higher than previously estimated. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P24 order arrived in P28). With On-hand inventory at 396 and 9073 units in-transit, the pipeline is finally catching up to the demand levels. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current plateau characteristics (mean ~2500, with some volatility) while maintaining the observed lead time of 4. Since the OR backend uses L to calculate review+lead time demand (1+L), and the total pipeline + on-hand is high, this will result in smaller orders or no orders until the inventory levels normalize against the stabilized demand curve.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed around 2500-2700 units; P24-P28 average is 2498. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a high-growth phase to a high-volume plateau, though demand continues to drift upwards slightly. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is approximately 2,590 units, with a more recent 3-period average (P27-P29) of 2,738 units. The most recent demand point (P29) is 2,915. Given this upward drift at the plateau, I am selecting a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current level while smoothing volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With profit equal to holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand over the protection lead time (L+1). I will use a recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat as well to reflect the variance of the current plateau rather than the whole history which includes a significant trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth has plateaued at a high volume: P27-P29 average is 2,738 units (+10% from the P24-P27 average of 2,440). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a plateau after a long period of rapid growth. The 4-period average (P27-P30) is 2770 units, with the most recent sample at 2866. Since the product is 'Regular' chips and no specific seasonal event or calendar date is provided to suggest further spikes, I am projecting demand to remain around this peak level. Observed lead time is consistently 4 periods. The goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this current high-volume state without being unduly biased by the earlier growth phase. This will help the backend maintain a service level appropriate for the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (critical ratio 0.5), ideally keeping inventory lean but sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: 4-period average (P27-P30) is 2,770 units, showing a shift from the previous growth trend to a high-volume steady state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1421.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend shows a significant increase, with Period 31 demand reaching 3,137 units. The 3-period average (P29-P31) is 2,973 units, and the 5-period average (P27-P31) is 2,843 units. Although previous insights suggested a plateau near 2,770 units, the last few periods show a continuing upward trajectory rather than a flat plateau. Consequently, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this higher demand level using a recent_N period of 5 to capture the shift from the 2,700 range to the 2,900-3,100 range. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P27 order arrived in P31). Inventory is currently at 0 due to the P31 demand spike exceeding the small arrival of 1,312 units (from the Period 27 order). The pipeline is robust (11,044 units), but the OR backend needs updated parameters to ensure future base-stock levels cover the current demand rate and prevent further stockouts as arrival sizes catch up.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth resumed: 3-period average (P29-P31) is 2,973 units, surpassing the previously suspected plateau of 2,770. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to grow, with the 3-period average (P30-P32) reaching 2,966 units, confirming that the previous plateau near 2,770 has been exceeded. The most recent demand (P31: 3,137, P32: 2,897) suggests a new, higher volatile regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts because recent arrivals (P27 order: 1,312, P28 order: 2,267) were based on outdated lower demand forecasts. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. To regain a high service level, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the most recent demand spike (approx 2,966 units/period). I will also use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this higher demand bracket, ensuring the OR backend targets a robust base stock that covers (L+1) periods of this elevated demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P30-P32) reached 2,966 units (+7% vs P27-P30 avg of 2,770). Back-to-back stockouts in P31-P32 confirm that pipeline arrivals are trailing current demand requirements.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 33 reaching a new peak of 3,332 units. The 3-period average (P31-P33) is 3,122, up from the previous 3-period average of 2,966 (+5.3%). Structural stockouts persist (P31-P33) because the pipeline arrivals (ordered during the perceived plateau phase) are insufficient for this renewed growth. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P29 order arrived in P33). I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent growth surge while remaining responsive. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent and clearly observed. The OR backend needs to recognize this higher demand level for the (L+1)=5 period horizon to break the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth resumed: 3-period average (P31-P33) reached 3,122 units, a 5% increase over the previous regime (P29-P31). Recurring stockouts from P31-P33 confirm that arrivals are lagging current demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2987.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward trend. The 3-period average for Periods 32-34 is 3,147 units, whereas the previous stabilized range was closer to 2,750-2,800. We have experienced four consecutive periods of stockouts (P31-P34) because the arrivals (from historical orders placed during lower demand regimes) are insufficient to meet current demand. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P30 order arrived in P34). To address the structural stockouts and the accelerating demand, I am using an explicit forecast for mu_hat. I anticipate demand will reach approximately 3,400 units per period during the next lead time cycle (L+1 = 5 periods). Therefore, mu_hat = 3,400 * 5 = 17,000. I am also increasing sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high volatility seen during this growth phase, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to recover from the current zero on-hand position.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P32-P34) reached 3,147 units, a 6% increase over the P30-P32 average. Sequential stockouts since P31 confirm that the pipeline is trailing the demand curve.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to grow, with the 3-period average (P33-P35) reaching 3,345 units, a 6% increase from the P31-P33 average. We have faced sequential stockouts since Period 31 because historical arrivals (based on lower past demand) are insufficient to meet current demand. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0, we must set \u03bc\u0302 to reflect this current elevated demand level across the lead time + review period (1+L = 5 periods). Using recent_N with N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 captures the most recent growth trend (avg \u2248 3,345 * 5 = 16,725), ensuring our base stock target rises to meet the accelerating demand curve and mitigate ongoing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P33-P35) reached 3,345 units (+6% vs P31-P33 avg). Structural stockouts since P31 confirm that the pipeline is trailing the demand curve. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3172.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. The 3-period average demand (P34-P36) has reached 3,484 units, which is approximately a 11% increase over the P31-P33 average. We have observed consistent stockouts from P31 through P36 because lead-time delayed arrivals (L=4) are based on historical lower-demand periods and cannot keep pace with the current acceleration. To minimize lost sales and account for this growth, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime, and sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect the increased volatility during this expansion phase. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P32 order arriving in P36.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P34-P36) reached 3,484 units, a 4% increase over the P33-P35 average. Persistent stockouts since P31 confirm the pipeline is trailing the demand curve. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2885.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. The 3-period average (P35-P37) has reached 3,627 units, representing a 4% increase over the previous period's 3-period average. Structural stockouts have persisted since Period 31 because pipeline arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago when demand was lower) cannot keep pace with the current demand level. In Period 37, demand was 3,643 units, while the arrival from Period 33 was only 2,885 units. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Given the persistent growth, I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the most recent, higher demand observations. Setting \u03bc\u0302 to a recent average helps the OR backend aggressively increase the base stock to catch up to the growth curve and mitigate ongoing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P35-P37) reached 3,627 units (+4% vs P34-P36 avg). Persistent stockouts since P31 confirm the pipeline is trailing the demand curve. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3261.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has consistently outpaced pipeline arrivals for the past several periods. Period 38 saw a minor dip to 3,371 units, but the 3-period average (P36-P38) remains high at 3,587 units, continuing the pattern of growth observed since P31. This sustained demand growth has led to frequent stockouts (P31-P37) as arrivals from previous periods (ordered during lower-demand phases) are insufficient to meet current requirements. The observed lead time is stable at 4 periods (P34 order arrived in P38). To account for the continuing growth and to buffer against volatility that has led to stockouts, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~3,587 units). I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the volatility of this high-volume period, ensuring the OR backend provides an adequate safety stock to stop the cycle of structural stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained at high volume: 3-period average (P36-P38) is 3,587 units, representing a 4% increase over the P33-P35 average. Stockouts have been frequent due to the pipeline lagging the growth curve, although a small surplus (110 units) remained in P38.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a significant upward trend, with the most recent observed demand in P39 reaching 3,792 units. The 3-period average (P37-P39) stands at 3,602 units, compared to the previous 3-period average (P34-P36) of 3,484, indicating a sustained growth rate of approximately 3.4%. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P35 order in P39. Due to the high growth nature of the demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most current demand level (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), while keeping Lead Time (L) at 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period history. Setting parameters based on the most recent high-demand regime is necessary to mitigate persistent stockouts and ensure the base stock levels calculated by the OR backend are sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained at high volume: 3-period average (P37-P39) is 3,602 units, marking a continued upward shift from previous levels. Lead time confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3505.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, with Period 40 recording a peak demand of 4,106 units. The 3-period average (P38-P40) is 3,756 units, which is approximately a 4% increase over the previous 3-period window. Structural stockouts persist (On-hand: 0) because arrivals from Period 36 (3,345 units) were significantly lower than the current demand. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To address the accelerating demand and the resulting structural deficit, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent growth step, while ensuring L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 4-period arrival history. mu_hat is calculated as (1+4) * 3,756 = 18,780. sigma_hat is set to 400 using 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased volatility at these high volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained at very high volume: 3-period average (P38-P40) reached 3,756 units (+4% vs P37-P39 avg). Recurring stockouts continue as pipeline arrivals trail demand growth. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3866.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. The 3-period average demand (P39-P41) has reached 4,003 units, which is a significant increase from the P38-P40 average of 3,756. We have observed structural stockouts in P40 and P41 because arrivals from P36 and P37 (3,345 and 3,866 units respectively) were insufficient to meet the contemporary demand level of ~4,100. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the P37 order arriving in P41. To address the persistent stockouts and the accelerating demand growth, I will use an explicit forecast (mu_hat) for the (L+1) period coverage. Forecasting the next 5 periods based on the current trend suggests a mean requirement of 4,200 units per period. I am setting mu_hat to 21,000 (5 * 4,200). For sigma_hat, I will use the recent volatility (N=5) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the high variance during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P39-P41) reached 4,003 units (+6.5% vs P38-P40 avg). Structural stockouts continue as arrivals from previous periods remain below current demand requirements. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. The 3-period average demand (P40-P42) has reached 4,212 units, a 5% increase over the P39-P41 average (4,003). Structural stockouts persist (P40-P42) because arrivals from orders placed four periods ago (P36-P38) are significantly lower than current demand levels. For Period 43, the arrival from Period 39 (3,173 units) will be insufficient to meet the projected demand of ~4,400+ units. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to reflect a forward-looking forecast of 4,500 units per period over the 1+L (5) period horizon, totaling 22,500 units. Sigma_hat is set to 800 to account for increasing volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P40-P42) reached 4,212 units (+5% vs P39-P41 avg). Persistent stockouts continue as arrivals (from P38-P40 orders) remain ~20% below current demand requirements.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. The most recent 3-period average (P41-P43) reached 4,192 units, a 4.7% increase from the previous P40-P42 average of 4,003. We are currently experiencing structural stockouts because arrivals from P38-P39 orders are significantly lower than current demand levels. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages (e.g., P39 order arriving in P43). To address the growth and the persistent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the most current demand regime (approx 4,212 units per period) and projecting it across the (L+1) horizon. sigma_hat is set to the default to account for the increasing variance observed during this growth phase. The OR backend's base-stock calculation will use these to increase the pipeline inventory to match the shifted demand curve.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P41-P43) reached 4192 units (+4.7% vs P40-P42 avg). Structural stockouts persist as trailing arrivals remain ~25% below current demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3865.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to grow or sustain at very high levels. The most recent 3-period average (P42-P44) is approximately 4,285 units, which is a significant increase from the 3,756 average observed around P41. Structural stockouts persist because arrivals (fixed by the 4-period lead time) originate from periods when the base stock settings were calculated against lower demand volumes. To break this cycle and cover the (L+1) period window (5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the most current demand intensity (avg ~4,285), which the backend will scale by (1+L). I will use the last 5 periods for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to reflect the most recent peaks is necessary to ensure the 'pipeline inventory' calculation in the OR engine results in a large enough order to finally meet current demand levels when they arrive in P49.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained at high volume: 3-period average (P42-P44) reached ~4285 units, a 2% increase from the P41-P43 average. Structural stockouts continue as trailing arrivals from P40 remain roughly 12% below current demand.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained upward trend. The 3-period average demand (P43-P45) is approximately 4,280 units, highlighting a continued growth regime from the previous 4,000-unit levels. Structural stockouts persist (P40-P45) because arriving orders, which were placed 4 periods ago when demand was lower, are insufficient to satisfy current consumption levels. Specifically, the P45 arrival of 4,194 units (from the Period 41 order) was nearly consumed immediately, resulting in an ending inventory of 0. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent demand acceleration (avg ~4,280/period). With L=4 (stable), mu_hat effectively targets (1+4) * 4,280 = 21,400 units for the review plus lead-time window. This aggressive stance aims to close the inventory gap and end the stockout cycle. Sigma_hat is calculated using N=10 to provide a robust volatility buffer against the recent growth variability. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P43-P45) reached 4,280 units (+7% vs P39-P41 avg). Structural stockouts persist as trailing arrivals from P41 remain below current demand requirements.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4212.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained upward trend. The 3-period average from P44 to P46 is approximately 4,420 units, reflecting a continued increase from the previous regime. Structural stockouts have been frequent because arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods prior) have consistently lagged behind the accelerating demand curve. For Period 47, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover a forecast that anticipates further slight growth (approx. 4,500 units/period) across the review and lead time (L+1 = 5 periods), resulting in a base stock target that accounts for 22,500 units. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture the increased volatility associated with this high-volume stage. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), the pipeline inventory (16,682) plus the current on-hand (254) is currently below the 5-period demand forecast, so the OR backend should generate an order to cover the gap while the cap will prevent excessive end-of-game overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P44-P46) reached 4,420 units (+3% vs P43-P45 avg). Structural stockouts narrowed in P46 due to the arrival of the P42 order (4720 units), but the pipeline remains tight relative to the growth trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3593.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to grow at a high volume, with the most recent 3-period average (P45-P47) reaching 4,447 units. The previous upward trend remains intact, and structural stockouts have only recently been mitigated by larger arrivals from orders placed in P42 and P43. Specifically, the P47 arrival of 5,089 units (ordered P43) allowed for a positive ending inventory of 875 units, but current pipeline inventory must support the next 5 periods (L+1). I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods to capture the current high-demand state (~4447 units/period * 5 = 22235), and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect recent volatility. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across the entire history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained at high volume: 3-period average (P45-P47) reached 4,447 units, maintaining the upward trajectory. Inventory levels finally turned positive in P47 due to the arrival of larger historical orders, but the pipeline remains essential to meet the ~4.5k per period demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3969.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has transition from ~4200 units (P41-P43) to ~4585 units (P46-P48). In the last period (P48), demand reached 4822 units, leading to another stockout as the arrival from P44 (3094 units) was insufficient. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the persistent growth, I am increasing mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent demand spike (4466, 4468, 4822). This helps the OR backend adjust the base stock to account for both the current high volume and the ongoing growth during the lead time and review period. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level. The goal is to aggressive build pipeline inventory to mitigate the frequent stockouts observed since Period 31.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P46-P48) reached 4585 units, a 4% increase over the P44-P46 average. Structural stockouts returned in P48 as trailing arrivals from P44 failed to meet the continuing upward surge in demand.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. The 3-period average from Period 47 to 49 is approximately 4,779 units, which represents a nearly 7% increase over the previous 3-period average (P44-P46) of 4,420 units. Structural stockouts persist (P48, P49) because past orders arriving now were based on lower historical demand levels. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P45's order arriving in P49). To combat the persistent stockouts and account for the rapid growth, I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most aggressive growth phase (P47-P49), setting L to 4, and adjusting sigma_hat to better reflect the volatility observed during this high-volume period. This higher base stock should help bridge the gap between current demand and trailing arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained at high volume: 3-period average (P47-P49) reached 4,779 units, a 7% increase over the P44-P46 average. Structural stockouts persist as trailing arrivals remain below the accelerating demand curve.
