Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a strong upward trend/regime shift: Period_1 (107) to Period_5 (544). Since we are at the beginning of the live sim but have 5 periods of history, I need to account for this growth. The promised lead time is 4. Given the sharp increase, using the mean of all 5 periods (mean=315.4) would severely under-forecast the current demand (Period_5 was 544). I will use a conservative forecast for mu_hat by looking at the most recent growth. Since it's chips and moving from 300s to 500s, I will set mu_hat based on the recent high demand to ensure we don't stock out during the 4+1 period window. Period 5 demand was 544. A (1+L) forecast where L=4 means 5 * demand. 5 * 544 = 2720. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the higher volume levels (298, 376, 544) rather than the earlier low numbers.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, an order of 613 units was placed, which is currently in-transit and expected around Period 5. Demand in Period 1 was 146, while historical samples show a clear upward trend (107, 252, 298, 376, 544). Given high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. Since we only have one period of actual game demand (146) which is lower than the recent historical samples, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat based on the last 3 historical samples to capture the recent growth trend without over-indexing on the single low Period 1 observation. Lead time L is set to default (4) as we have seen no arrivals yet to suggest a change.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively steady (146 in P1, 166 in P2), but the historical samples provided (107, 252, 298, 376, 544) suggest an upward trend or higher average than seen in the first two periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the shipments from P1 and P2 have not yet arrived. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the order from P1 is expected to arrive in Period 5 (L=4 sequence: P1 decision -> P5 arrival). Consequently, we have had 0 sales in P1 and P2 despite demand. Total in-transit is 1297 (613+684). Since we have not yet observed any 'conclude' messages for arrivals, there is no evidence to override the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat, the historical samples show a clear increasing trend (107 up to 544). To capture this growth and avoid under-ordering during this ramp-up, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) to reflect the recent high-demand samples in the forecast.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Our current status shows On-hand = 0 and In-transit = 1872 (sum of orders from P1-P3: 613+684+575 = 1872). Since there is a significant shortage (total lost sales already amounting to demand in P1-P3), we need to ensure our base stock covers the demand for the next (L+1) periods. Demand has shown a sharp upward trend: 146, 166, 368 (P1-P3) and historical data shows P4: 376, P5: 544. The average demand across these 5 samples is approximately 315. Given the clear growth phase, I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand to capture the recent spike (averaging ~362) and apply the default lead time. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen in the last three data points.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Looking at the history, the order placed in Period 1 (613 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution Phase) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory for the first 4 periods, resulting in missed sales. Demand is clearly trending upwards: Period 1 (107/146) to Period 5 (544). Note: There is a discrepancy between the 'Historical Demand Data' (107, 252, 298, 376, 544) and the 'Game History' demand (146, 166, 368, 426). I will prioritize the 'Historical Demand Data' for trend analysis as it includes the most recent Period 5 value of 544. Because demand is increasing rapidly, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the higher growth and maintain a buffer. I will keep L at default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promised time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9527.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was: 146, 166, 368, 426, 507. There is a clear and sustained upward trend (growth regime). The mean demand over these 5 periods is 322.6, but the most recent 3 periods average 433.7. Given the strong growth, using a smaller window (N=3) for mu_hat better captures the current demand level. The promised lead time is 4. The Period 1 order (613 units) arrived in Period 5 (L=4), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. On-hand inventory is 106, with 1489 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P5). Since demand is rising rapidly, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the trend while maintaining some stability in the variance estimate.

Carry-over insight: Demand is in a significant growth phase: Period 1-2 avg ~156 vs Period 3-5 avg ~434 (+178%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $11930.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. Demand is showing an aggressive upward trend: P1-2 avg was 156, while the last three periods (P4-P6) averaged 523, with P6 reaching 636. This indicates a sustained growth regime. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the arrival of orders from P1 and P2 in periods P5 and P6 respectively. Current on-hand inventory is 154, and in-transit is 1478. Given the lead time L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~523 * 5 = 2615) and N=3 for volatility (sigma_hat) to reflect recent variance. The lead time method remains 'default' as the promised time of 4 is currently accurate.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: P4-P6 average demand is 523, a 235% increase from P1-P2 levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11631.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' is experiencing a robust and sustained growth trend. Initial demand in Periods 1-2 was ~156 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P5-P7) show an average demand of 587 units, representing a significant upward shift. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed through arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3. Currently, there is an inventory of 111 units on-hand and 1601 units in-transit. To ensure we capture this growth while maintaining the target service level, I am using the 'recent_N' method for demand with N=3 to focus on the high-demand regime, and 'calculate' for lead time since the observations match the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime: Periods 5-7 average demand is 587, maintaining a significantly higher level than the initial baseline (~156).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2109.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent and significant upward trend since Period 1. Recent demand (Periods 6-8) is averaging 676 units, well above the historical average. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, while 2303 units are in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). However, no arrival occurred in Period 8; since nothing was ordered in Period 4, this is expected behavior. The next shipment (from P5) is expected in Period 9 resolution. To capture the recent sustained high demand while allowing for volatility, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=4 covers the regime change clearly seen from Period 5 onwards. The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock using the promised lead time of 4 (covering demand for L+1 = 5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 6-8 average demand is 676, a 15% increase over the previous high-demand regime (P5-P7 avg 587).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime. Analyzing the last four periods (P6-P9), the average demand is approximately 715 units per period (636, 618, 775, 831). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the conclude messages for orders from P1, P2, P3, and P5 (P4 had 0 units ordered). Currently, we are facing stockouts, with 0 on-hand inventory and 2888 units in-transit. The order from P6 (673 units) is expected to arrive during P10. To address the current high demand and inventory deficit, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this higher mean (~715 * 5 = 3575). L is kept at the default (4). Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=4 period regime to account for the increased volatility seen in the high-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime stabilization: P6-P9 average demand is 715 units, representing the established baseline for the current growth phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12787.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent and significant upward trend. Period 10 recorded the highest demand yet at 993 units, following a trend of 775, 831, and 993 in the most recent periods. The average demand over the last three periods (P8-P10) is 866.33, compared to the P6-P9 average of 715, showing a continued acceleration of ~21%. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to this surge outstripping previous supply. Regarding lead times, the history confirms a steady lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P5 arrived P9, P6 arrived P10). Note that P4 had an order of 0, explaining why there was no arrival in P8. This confirms the lead time is stable at 4. To account for the continuing growth and to prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the current high-demand regime, which will result in a forecast of (1+4) * 866.33 = 4331.65. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility associated with the higher scale of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further: P8-P10 average demand increased to 866 units (+21% vs P6-P9 average). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13262.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly. The last four periods (P8-P11) saw demands of 775, 831, 993, and 1136, averaging 934 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a significant stockout in P11 (1136 demand vs 698 supply). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, meaning we must cover 5 periods of demand (Period 12 plus the 4-period lead time). Using recent_N with N=4 captures this current high-growth regime (avg 934). The mu_hat calculation (1+L)*mean will yield approximately 5 * 934 = 4670, which is necessary to replenish the pipeline and satisfy the upward-trending demand. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility seen in the latest growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: P8-P11 average demand is 934 units, a 30% increase from the P6-P9 average of 715 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. Period 12's demand reached 1,302 units, marking a significant increase over the previous three-period average (P9-P11 avg ~987). The current stockout (on-hand: 0) and the lead time of 4 periods (L+1=5) necessitate a significant increase in the target inventory levels. The observed lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirming P8's order arrived in P12). To account for the accelerating demand and ensure we capture this growth trend, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (covering the recent high-growth phase P9-P12). This will better reflect the current demand magnitude (P9-P12 avg ~1,065) compared to the long-term average, helping the OR engine set a base stock that reduces future stockouts during this expansion cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 9-12 average demand is 1,065 units (+49% vs Period 6-9 average of 715).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience rapid demand growth. Comparing recent performance, the average demand over the last 4 periods (P10-P13) is approximately 1151 units, which is a significant increase over the previous average of 934 units observed in Period 12. Although on-hand inventory is currently exhausted, the 'In-transit' pipeline is robust at 4540 units. Observed lead times have remained stable at exactly 4 periods. Given the sustained growth trajectory, I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime properly and ensure the OR backend's target inventory levels keep pace with the increasing demand. For sigma_hat, I will use N=4 to reflect recent volatility accurately. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 10-13 average demand is 1,151 units (+23% vs Period 8-11 average of 934). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16853.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend. Period 14 recorded a demand of 1,417 units, the highest to date. The average demand across the last 3 periods (P12-P14) is 1,298 units, and across the last 4 periods (P11-P14) is 1,257 units. I will use N=4 for mu_hat forecasting to capture this recent acceleration while maintaining some stability against single-period spikes. Lead time (L) has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13, and P14), so I will maintain L=default. Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to account for the increasing absolute variance associated with the higher demand volume. The current inventory position (On-hand: 0, In-transit: 5,014) is still trailing the demand growth, leading to recurring stockouts; targeting a base stock reflecting the 1,250+ unit demand regime is necessary to recover service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 11-14 average demand is 1,257 units (+18% vs Period 9-12 average of 1,065).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has accelerated significantly over the last several periods. The current average demand (Periods 13-15) is 1,342, compared to the Period 11-14 average of 1,257 documented previously. The system is currently stock-out constrained, as seen by 'sold' units being capped by 'arrived' units, leading to zero ending on-hand inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (L=4), meaning a protective stock must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. To capture the recent acceleration and mitigate stockouts, I am using N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the most recent high-growth phase while providing enough variance context to maintain a high service level, which is optimal given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains strong: Period 13-15 average demand is 1,342 units (+16% vs Period 10-13 average of 1,151). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P13-P16) is 1,401.5 units, compared to the P9-P12 average of 1,101 units, marking a 27% increase. Sold units are consistently hitting the ceiling of on-hand inventory (e.g., in P16, sold was 1,203 out of 1,578 demand), indicating we are under-ordered for this growth phase. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P16 conclusion showing the P12 order arriving exactly 4 periods later). I will use the recent_N method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent (and highest) demand phase while maintaining responsiveness to the acceleration. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the observed lead time of 4 matches the promised lead time and remains stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Period 13-16 average demand is 1,402 units (+27% vs Period 9-12 average of 1,101). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 17 reaching 1,586 units. The average demand over the last four periods (P14-P17) is approximately 1,504 units, which is a significant increase from the previous regime defined in the carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 13 order in Period 17. Because on-hand inventory is zero and demand is still growing, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most current high-demand level (approx 1,504 units per period). Multiplied by (1+L) = 5, this results in a targeted base stock that accounts for the pipeline. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 14-17 average demand is 1,504 units (+12% vs Period 13-15 average of 1,342). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25859.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate aggressively. The most recent demand (Period 18) spiked to 1,862 units, significantly higher than the average of the last few periods. Specifically, the average demand of the last 4 periods (P15-P18) is approximately 1,615 units, whereas the previous 4-period window (P11-P14) was 1,257 units\u2014a 28% increase. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 14 order in Period 18). My current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand is consistently outstripping the arrivals of older, smaller orders. To capture this sustained growth phase and prevent massive stockouts, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to focus only on the most recent high-growth regime. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that reflects the current 1,600+ unit demand level across the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further: Period 15-18 average demand is 1,615 units (+28% vs Period 11-14 average of 1,257). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27892.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive linear growth trend. In Period 19, demand was 1,750 units. Over the last three periods (17-19), average demand has risen to 1,733 units from a Period 14-16 average of 1,477 units (+17%). Lead time remains remarkably stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P15 order arriving in P19). We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) because our historical order quantities were based on lower previous demand levels. To capture the growth and ensure the base-stock level (which covers L+1 periods) is sufficient, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the most recent high-growth phase. Since current demand is clearly trending upward, the average of the last 3 periods (approx. 1,733) is the most relevant baseline for the next 5 periods of exposure (L=4, so L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 17-19 average demand is 1,733 units (+17% vs Period 14-16 average of 1,477). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive growth trend, reaching a new peak of 2,032 units in Period 20. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P17-P20) is 1,807.5 units, which is a 12% increase over the P15-P18 average of 1,615 units. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand consistently outstripping supply arrivals from earlier, lower-volume order periods. To capture the current growth and mitigate stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the latest high-demand regime (avg 1,807.5 per period). Given the lead time L=4, the backend will calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of this updated demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to capture the high volatility associated with this growth phase. This setup aims to bridge the gap between historical averages and the current accelerated demand trajectory while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 17-20 average demand is 1,807.5 units (+12% vs Period 15-18 average of 1,615). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend. Period 21 demand reached 2,126 units, and the average demand over the last four periods (P18-P21) is 1,942 units, a significant increase from the previous four-period average (P15-P18: 1,659 units). Despite consistent ordering, we are currently experiencing a stockout situation with an ending on-hand inventory of 0 in Period 21. This is because the arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are consistently lower than the current demand. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Since the inventory is 0 and we have a large in-transit pipeline (7,640 units), we need to set the parameters to reflect the current high-growth regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent demand acceleration (avg 1,942) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to account for the increasing volatility associated with higher volume. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 18-21 average demand is 1,942 units (+17% vs Period 15-18 average of 1,659). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive linear growth pattern. For Period 23, we observe that the last four periods of demand (P19-P22) are 1750, 2032, 2126, and 2270, representing a clear upward trend with an average of 2044.5. This is significantly higher than earlier averages. To ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this growth and avoids stockouts (on-hand is currently 0), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this most recent surge. I will also use 'recent_N' with N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with higher demand levels. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent 'Period X conclude' messages (e.g., P18 order arrived in P22), so I will use 'calculate' to continue using this stable average. The combination of these parameters will result in a base stock that covers the next (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current accelerated rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 19-22 average demand is 2,044.5 units (+13% vs Period 17-20 average of 1,807.5). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a consistent upward trend. Demand in Period 23 was 2,186 units, and the average over the last 4 periods (P20-P23) is 2,153.5 units. This represents a sustained increase compared to previous blocks. Looking at the growth rate, the current regime (P21-P23) shows a mean of 2,194. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 19 order in Period 23. To prevent stockouts, which have been occurring consistently since Period 8 due to inventory arriving being less than current demand, I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand intensities (mean ~2,194). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect current volatility. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 21-23 average demand is 2,194 units, a 7% increase vs Period 19-22 average (2,044.5). Performance is constrained by supply arrivals lagging current demand levels.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive growth pattern. In Period 24, demand reached 2,504, raising the Period 21-24 average to 2,271, compared to the Period 19-22 average of 2,044 (+11%). The stockouts persist because recent arrivals (ordered 4 periods ago) are based on historical demand levels that are significantly lower than current demand. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate as confirmed by the arrival in Period 24 (ordered in Period 20). To capture the current growth and mitigate persistent stockouts, I am applying an EWMA with a high gamma (0.8) to mu_hat. This will heavily weight the most recent demand spikes (2,504 in P24), effectively forecasting a base stock that covers the anticipated demand over the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the high volatility observed during this acceleration phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 21-24 average demand is 2,271 units (+11% vs Period 19-22 average of 2,044). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a sustained aggressive growth phase. Period 25 demand was 2,479, and the average over the last 4 periods (P22-P25) is approx 2,360, compared to approx 2,044 for the previous four (P19-P22). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and sales are being capped by the arrival quantity from 4 periods ago. To prevent stockouts during this growth, I must set mu_hat to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5) using a value that reflects the most recent demand levels. I am using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while allowing for the upward trend in volatility. L is set to 4 based on consistent historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 22-25 average demand is 2,360 units (+15.5% vs Period 19-22 average of 2,044). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42180.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has consistently outpaced supply arrivals, resulting in chronic stockouts (on-hand inventory frequently hits 0). In Period 26, demand was 2,457, while the average demand over the last four periods (P23-P26) is approximately 2,406 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since the current demand is significantly higher than the units arriving (which were ordered 4 periods ago when demand was lower), I must use an explicit forecast to capture the growth and ensure the base stock is high enough to account for both the 4-period lead time and the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). A conservative estimate for the next 5 periods' demand, assuming a continued growth rate of ~5% per period from the current 2,457 level, suggests a mean demand (mu_hat) of approximately 13,000 units. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to account for the increasing volatility observed alongside the volume growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 23-26 average demand is 2,406.5 units, representing a 6% increase over the Period 21-24 average (2,271). Stockouts continue as deliveries from lower-demand periods (P22) arrive.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. The average demand over the last four periods (P24-P27) is 2,487 units, which is approximately 10% higher than the previous four-period average (P20-P23) of 2,271.5 units. We are consistently stocking out because the arrivals (currently 2,406 units from P23) are lower than the actual demand (2,508 units). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Because the demand is steadily climbing and we are chasing the trend with a 4-period delay, the 'default' and 'recent_N' calculations\u2014which are backward-looking\u2014will likely underestimate the inventory needed for the upcoming lead time + review period. To prevent further lost sales and account for the ~5-10% period-over-period growth, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I estimate the average demand over the next 5 periods at approximately 2,850 units per period (projecting the recent trend), resulting in a mu_hat of 14,250. I am increasing sigma_hat to 650 to reflect the higher volatility observed in this high-growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 24-27 average demand is 2,487 units (+9.5% vs Period 20-23 average of 2,272). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend, with the Period 28 demand reaching 2,890 units. The average demand over the last four periods (P25-P28) is 2,583.5, which is a significant increase over the previous 4-period window. Inventory remains constrained as arrivals (currently 2,313 units from Period 24) are consistently lower than actual demand, resulting in total stockouts and lost sales. To address this, I am using an explicit forecast for mu_hat. Taking the recent average of ~2,584 and applying a growth factor to account for the clear per-period acceleration (averaging ~100 units/period lately), I estimate the demand for the next 5 periods (Review + Lead Time) to average approximately 2,900 units. Therefore, mu_hat = (1+L) * 2,900 = 5 * 2,900 = 14,500. Sigma_hat is set to 1,000 to provide a sufficient buffer against the high volatility observed during this growth phase. The lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 25-28 average demand is 2,583.5 units (+14% vs Period 21-24 average of 2,271). Chronic stockouts persist as trailing supply arrivals cannot meet accelerating real-time demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31274.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience strong demand growth, with Period 29 demand reaching a new peak of 2,959 units. The 4-period moving average (P26-P29) is approximately 2,704 units, which is a significant increase over previous windows. Despite consistent growth, the system has been chronically under-ordering relative to realized demand because shipments arriving during Period 29 were based on orders from Period 25 (1,646 units), leading to stockouts. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the most recent demand acceleration (averaging ~2,704 per period). Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, covering the review + lead time (1+L = 5 periods) requires a base stock logic reflected in mu_hat. I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to account for the increased volatility seen in this high-growth regime. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by every arrival since Period 5.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained at high levels: Period 26-29 average demand is 2,703.5 units, a 19% increase over the Period 21-24 average (2,271). Chronic stockouts persist due to lead-time lag; the system requires aggressive inventory targets to catch up to real-time demand.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive linear growth pattern. In Period 30, demand reached 3,004 units. The average demand over the last four periods (P27-P30) is 2,840 units, which is a 25% increase over the P21-P24 average of 2,271. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the most recent demand level to ensure 'base_stock' accounts for the expected (L+1) periods of demand. Given the consistent stockouts because arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are significantly lower than current demand, I am using an explicit mu_hat forecast. I estimate current demand to be ~3,000 and apply a growth factor for the lead time duration to ensure the order covers the inventory gap. Since the OR engine uses (1+L) * mean, and L=4, I provide an explicit value of 15,300 (which represents an average of 3,060 demand per period over 5 periods). sigma_hat is set relatively high using the recent 10 periods to account for the increasing variance accompanying the scale growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained at very high levels: Period 27-30 average demand is 2,840 units, a 25% increase over the Period 21-24 average (2,271). Stockouts are persistent as the pipeline inventory consists of orders placed when demand was 20-30% lower.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 31 demand reaching 3,152 units. The 4-period moving average (P28-P31) is approximately 3,001 units, reflecting a clear and sustained upward trend. Despite larger arrivals, we are still finishing periods with zero on-hand inventory (Sold = Arrived), indicating that current pipeline inventory is still trailing actual demand. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent demand levels (~3,001 units/period). This results in a forecast of (1+L)*3001 = 15,005 for the lead-time plus review period. I am also increasing sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this growth phase. The lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 28-31 average demand is 3,001 units (+11% vs Period 26-29 average of 2,703). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $59691.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 32 reaching 3,151 units and the average over the last four periods (P29-P32) being 3,066.5. This represents a significant increase from earlier periods. Despite a slight inventory recovery in Period 32 (ending on-hand: 178), the system has been in a chronic stockout state because arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) have lagged behind current demand levels. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations. To address the accelerating demand and the pipeline lag, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat value that forecasts a continued demand level of approximately 3,250 units per period. Over the review plus lead-time horizon (1+L = 5 periods), this results in a mu_hat of 16,250. This aggressive target is necessary to raise the base stock level sufficiently to overcome the supply-demand gap. I am setting sigma_hat to 1,000 to provide a buffer for the high demand volatility observed during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 29-32 average demand is 3,066.5 units, a 13% increase over the Period 26-29 average (2,703.5). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained growth trend. In the most recent four periods (P30-P33), demand has averaged 3,163 units, representing a 10% increase over the P27-P30 average of 2,864. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. While total In-transit inventory (12,436) appears high, it is comprised of orders placed over the last 4 periods (P30: 1841, P31: 3579, P32: 3030, P33: 3986). To avoid the chronic stockouts seen in earlier periods due to the 4-period delivery lag, I must set the base stock level (mu_hat) to cover mean demand across the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Using 'recent_N' with N=4 captures the latest acceleration (avg 3,163), which results in a mu_hat calculation of approximately 15,815 units. This target ensures that pipeline inventory matches current demand rates, preventing further lost sales as we enter the final third of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 30-33 average demand is 3,163 units, a 10% increase vs Period 27-30 average (2,864). Observed lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43909.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has historically caused persistent stockouts as the pipeline of 4-period lead-time orders lagged behind accelerating actual demand. However, recent periods show the 'In-transit' inventory finally catching up to the current demand magnitude. The P30-P33 average demand is 3,163 units. Period 34 demand was 3,383, confirming the growth persists. To prevent falling back into a stockout cycle, I will use an explicit forecast that accounts for the historical growth rate (~5-10% per phase). I estimate the forward-looking mean at 3,500 units per period. Over the (L+1) horizon of 5 periods, this equates to a mu_hat of 17,500. I am increasing sigma_hat to 800 (explicitly calculated as ~20% of demand spread across L+1) to provide a robust safety buffer against the high volatility observed in this growth phase. The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained at high levels: Period 31-34 average demand is 3,257.5 units, a 15% increase vs Period 28-31 average (2,840). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has consistently outpaced supply due to the 4-period lead time lag. Period 35 demand reached 3,624 units, and the average demand over the last four periods (P32-P35) is 3,375.5 units, reflecting a persistent growth phase. Historically, orders placed 4 periods ago were consistently lower than current demand, leading to the chronic stockouts observed. To combat this, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent demand levels (approx 3,376 per period), which results in a base stock targeted at (1+4) * 3376 = 16,880 units. This is intended to bridge the gap between the incoming pipeline (orders from P32-P35) and the accelerating customer appetite. I will use 'calculate' for lead time as the 4-period duration has remained stable across all concluded observations. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the increased volatility associated with this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained and high: Period 32-35 average demand is 3,375.5 units, a 19% increase over the Period 27-30 average (2,840). Supply remains the primary bottleneck as arrivals continue to reflect order volumes from 4 periods prior.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has consistently outpaced supply due to the 4-period lead time. Period 36 demand was 3,457, and the recent 4-period average (P33-P36) is 3,452. Given the persistent stockouts (ending on-hand zero in P34, P35, and P36), it is evident that our base stock needs to be aggressively adjusted upward to account for the ongoing growth and to build a safety buffer. Using a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat would lead to a value based on ~3,452/period, but since demand is trending upwards, I will use an explicit lead time L of 4 and an explicit mu_hat to project demand over the (L+1) horizon. I estimate the average demand over the next 5 periods will be approximately 3,800 units per period (projecting ~10% growth over the current 4-period average), leading to a mu_hat of 19,000 (3,800 * 5). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the high volatility associated with this growth phase. This aggressive posture aims to overcome the chronic stockouts caused by orders lagging demand realization.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 33-36 average demand is 3,452 units (+21% vs Period 27-30 average of 2,854). Persistent stockouts continue as arrivals reflect lower historical order volumes. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. Period 37 demand reached 3,817 units, and the 4-period moving average (P34-P37) is now approximately 3,570 units. My strategy remains focused on matching this accelerating demand by using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most current growth regime. Although Period 37 ended with a small inventory cushion (169 units), the system has been chronically under-supplied due to the 4-period lead time lag (arrivals reflect lower historical orders). In-transit inventory is high (14,727), but much of this reflects the recent aggressive ordering needed to catch up. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all recent concluded cycles. Maintaining a high service level is optimal given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1). Setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) ensures the base stock reflects the current ~3,500+ unit demand level, and sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 4 periods to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 34-37 average demand is 3,570 units (+41% vs Period 27-30 average of 2,525). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend. Period 38 demand reached a new high of 4,068 units. Over the last four periods (P35-P38), the average demand is 3,741.5 units, which is a significant increase from the average of 3,375.5 units recorded in the P32-P35 window (+10.8%). Despite regular arrivals, we are still experiencing stockouts (P38 ended with 0 inventory after selling all 3,562 units available, missing 506 units of demand) because arrivals are based on orders placed 4 periods ago when demand expectations were lower. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistently confirmed by the arrival of the P34 order in P38. To stop the cycle of stockouts and accommodate the sustained growth, I am increasing mu_hat using a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~3741). Since the game is in a clear growth phase, I will use an explicit sigma_hat set to approximately 10% of the mu_hat per-period mean to account for the increasing volatility that typically accompanies scaling demand, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to cover both the review period and the lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 35-38 average demand is 3,741.5 units (+10.8% vs Period 32-35 average of 3,375.5). Lead time remains confirmed and stable at 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. The most recent demand at Period 39 was 3,993, with a 4-period average (P36-P39) of 3,834 units, compared to the P32-P35 average of 3,375.5 units (+13.6%). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 35 order in Period 39. Despite aggressive ordering, the on-hand inventory remains extremely low (96 units) due to rapid demand growth outstripping the arrivals of orders placed when demand was lower. To address this, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. Given the current 4-period average of ~3,834 and the observed growth rate, I project the demand for the next 5 periods (Review + Lead Time) to average approximately 4,150 units per period. Thus, mu_hat is set to 20,750 (4,150 * 5). Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility associated with this higher demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 36-39 average demand is 3,834 units, representing a 13.6% increase over the Period 32-35 average (3,375.5). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. Period 40 demand was 3,881 units, while the average of the last four periods (P37-P40) is 3,939.75 units, a significant increase from the previous high-demand regimes. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory is 16,604. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the Period 40 arrival (ordered Period 36, arrived Period 40). To account for the aggressive growth and prevent stockouts caused by trailing supply, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent demand acceleration (average ~3,940). This results in a mu_hat of approximately 19,700 (calculated as (1+L)*mean = 5 * 3940). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect current volatility accurately. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 37-40 average demand is 3,939.75 units (+14.5% vs Period 33-36 average of 3,440). Lead time remains confirmed and stable at 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to track a strong upward trend, which has been consistent throughout the game. Period 41 demand was 3997, and the average over the last 4 periods (P38-P41) is 3984.75, representing approx 3.9% increase over the P34-P37 average (3831). The lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P37 order arrived in P41). We are still frequently hitting stockouts or near-zero ending inventory (On-hand: 7) because arrivals are based on orders placed 4 periods ago when demand levels were slightly lower. To capture this growth and avoid further stockouts, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to focus on the current peak demand level (~3985 per period). Since L=4, mu_hat will represent demand over 5 periods (L+1). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the lead time and the current period's demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 38-41 average demand is 3,984.75 units (+4.6% vs Period 35-38 average of 3809). Lead time remains confirmed and stable at 4 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend. Period 42 demand reached 4,099 units, while the average demand over the last four periods (P39-P42) is 3,992.5 units. We are currently in a persistent stockout state because the arrivals (e.g., Period 42 arrival of 3,665 units ordered in Period 38) reflect historical demand levels rather than present needs. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. To ensure mu_hat reflects the most recent growth, I am using recent_N with N=4 to capture the ~4,000 units/period level. Given the steady growth, I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 300 (roughly 7.5% of demand) to provide a safety buffer against the high variability observed during this acceleration phase, ensuring the base stock level remains high enough to capture the next wave of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained: Period 39-42 average demand is 3,992.5 units (+15.6% vs Period 33-36 average of 3,452). Lead time remains confirmed and stable at 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained growth trajectory. Comparing recent averages, the mean demand over the last 4 periods (P40-P43) is 4,098.5 units, which is a 4% increase over the previous 4-period average (P36-P39: 3,939.75). Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods by the Period 43 arrival (ordered Period 39). Given the constant stockouts\u2014where sales are limited by incoming arrivals rather than actual market demand\u2014I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the base stock is calculated against the most recent demand peak. I estimate the current period demand at 4,400 to reflect the Period 43 demand level (4,417). With L=4, mu_hat = (1+4) * 4400 = 22000. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher volatility seen in the high-demand regime, ensuring a robust safety stock in the face of ongoing supply/demand imbalances.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 40-43 average demand is 4,098.5 units (+4% vs Period 37-40 average). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained growth trend. In Period 44, demand was 4,470, and the average over the last 4 periods (P41-P44) is approximately 4,246 units, compared to the P40-P43 average of 4,098.5 (+3.6%). The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P44 arrival of the P40 order). Current on-hand inventory is 98 units, and the pipeline inventory is 16,440 units, which covers the next few periods but remains tight relative to the accelerating demand. To ensure high service levels and mitigate the chronic stockouts seen in previous growth bursts, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most current demand level (L+1 = 5 periods of demand). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the slightly higher volatility seen during this aggressive expansion phase. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the promised 4 periods remains accurate.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 41-44 average demand is 4,245.75 units (+4% vs Period 40-43 average). Consistent lead time of 4 periods remains confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68514.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. Period 45 demand reached 4,605 units, the highest recorded. The 4-period moving average (P42-P45) is approximately 4,398 units, which is a 4% increase over the previous 4-period window. Arrivals are currently lagging slightly because they reflect order quantities from 4 periods ago (e.g., Period 41 order of 3,508 units arrived in Period 45). Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all concluded shipments. To account for the aggressive growth and minimize stockouts, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the most current demand regime. With Profit=$19 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio is 0.95, justifying a high service level. Setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) projects a total demand of (1+L)*local_mean = 5 * ~4400 = 22000. This aggressive targeting is necessary to satisfy demand during the 4-period lead time plus the current review period while demand is still climbing.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 42-45 average demand is 4,397.75 units (+4% vs Period 41-44 average). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to demonstrate a steady upward trend. Period 46 demand reached 4,638 units, and the Period 42-45 average (4,397.75) highlights a 4% growth over the previous four-period block. Despite the system remaining largely in a stockout or near-zero ending inventory state (Period 46 ending on-hand is 0), arrivals have accurately tracked the promised lead time of 4 periods. The 'In-transit' pipeline (18,354 units) consists of orders from Periods 43-46. Given the consistent growth, I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most current demand level (avg ~4,400 per period), which results in a target total base stock for 5 periods (L+1) of approximately 22,000 units. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture current volatility. Lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 42-45 average demand is 4,397.75 units (+4% vs Period 41-44 average). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74480.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has been consistent throughout the simulation. In Period 47, demand reached a new peak of 4,955 units. The four-period average (P44-P47) is now approximately 4,667 units, compared to the previously observed averages. The lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 43 order in Period 47. Because we are at Period 48 of 50, and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game's horizon. However, the objective remains to maximize total reward through Period 50. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 19,132 units. The arrivals expected in Period 48 (ordered P44: 4,919), Period 49 (ordered P45: 4,764), and Period 50 (ordered P46: 4,751) are sufficient to cover the projected demand of ~4,700-5,000 units per period for the remaining two periods. To avoid incurring excess holding costs at the end of the simulation while still protecting against the stockouts seen in P47, I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method (N=4) to capture the current high demand regime (~4,667 units per period) and stay consistent with the growth trend for the OR backend's target stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a new peak of 4,955 in Period 47; the Period 44-47 average demand is 4,667 units, representing a 10% increase over the Period 41-44 average (4,245 units).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, with the most recent demand (Period 48) hitting 4,820 and the preceding period hitting 4,955. The average demand over the last four periods (P45-P48) is approximately 4,755 units. Given that Period 50 is the final period, the goal for Period 49 is to maximize sales and satisfy the remaining demand without over-ordering for a non-existent Period 51. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Orders placed today (P49) will not arrive before the game ends (arrival in P53). Therefore, the 'in-transit' inventory already covers the remaining demand cycle. However, the OR backend logic requires parameters to manage the current base stock. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4-period demand average (N=4) to ensure the target stock level reflects the current peak regime, helping to clear out the pipeline and maximize whatever availability remains in on-hand plus near-term arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a peak regime: Period 45-48 average demand is 4,755 units (+12% vs Period 41-44 average of 4,245). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88757.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reside in a peak regime, with the Period 45-48 average demand at 4,755 units. Recent periods (P46-P49) show demand consistently near or above the 4,700 mark (4,638, 4,955, 4,820, 4,681). The lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Since the system is still recovering from a long string of stockouts caused by accelerating demand, and the current on-hand inventory is very low (182 units) compared to daily demand, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture this high-volume peak regime. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current ~4,700+ units/period demand level. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to account for the increased volatility seen at these higher volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak regime established: Periods 46-49 average demand is 4,773.5 units, showing stabilization at the highest recorded levels (+12% vs P41-P44 average). Lead time remains confirmed and stable at 4 periods.
