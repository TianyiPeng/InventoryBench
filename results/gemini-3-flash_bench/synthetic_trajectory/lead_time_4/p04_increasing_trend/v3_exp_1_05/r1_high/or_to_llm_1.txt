The promised lead time is 4 periods. The OR algorithm suggests ordering 165 units based on a base-stock policy (1+L = 5 periods of coverage). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to build our pipeline immediately. The OR recommendation of 165 units seems slightly conservative given the recent upward trend in demand (127 and 160 in the last two historical points), but as it is the first period of active play and we have no confirmed lead-time drift or lost shipments yet, I will follow the OR recommendation to establish a baseline.

Since we are in Period 2, the order placed in Period 1 (165 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible in Period 6 start). No arrivals were expected in Period 1.\n2. **Inventory Analysis**: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 165 (from Period 1). Total pipeline is 165. \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Historical demand (Periods 1-5 provided in prompts) suggests a mean of ~115 (103, 81, 107, 127, 160). Period 1 actual demand was 118, which aligns with this range. \n4. **Strategy**: The lead time is long (4 periods), requiring us to cover a total window of L+1 = 5 periods. Total expected demand for 5 periods is approximately 115 * 5 = 575 units. Currently, we have only 165 units in the pipeline. This leaves a significant gap. \n5. **OR Recommendation**: The OR algorithm suggests 160 units. This seems conservative given the 4-period lead time and the current zero inventory state. However, the OR 'capped' policy is designed to smooth ordering. \n6. **Adjustment**: I will follow the OR recommendation of 160. While it might feel low, adding 160 to the existing 165 in-transit brings our total commitment to 325.

According to the sequence, an order placed in P1 arrives during P5 (concludes at P5 START, visible P6). We have not reached the delivery window for the first order yet, so there is no evidence to suggest actual lead time differs from promised or that orders are lost.\n3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) and recent conclude data (118, 88, 108) show a mean of approximately 110-120 units per period. The Period 4 demand (127 or 160) suggests a slight upward trend or variance, but no confirmed regime shift yet.\n4.

Current total inventory (On-hand 35 + In-transit 900) equals 935 units. This leaves a deficit of 90 units. \n5.

However, 1425 units in-transit precisely equals the sum of orders from P26 to P29 (210 + 330 + 435 + 450 = 1425). My lead-time inference confirms a stable 4-period lead time. This means the order I place now (P30) will arrive at the start of P35. To avoid stockouts from P30-P34, I must rely on existing in-transit units. The expected arrivals are: P30: 210 units (from P26), P31: 330 units (from P27), P32: 435 units (from P28), P33: 450 units (from P29). Since current demand is ~400 units/period, P30 and P31 will likely see significant stockouts (210 and 330 units arriving against ~400 demand).

The 5-period average (P40-P44) is approximately 753 units, but the most recent two periods (P43-P44) average over 800 units, indicating a new floor. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is currently 3,100 units (orders from P41, P42, P43, P44). Based on a Lead Time (L) of 4, our 'on-hand + in-transit' should cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. At a projected demand of 810 units/period (reflecting recent trends), we need a total inventory position of approximately 4,050 units. Subtracting the current 3,100 in-transit units, we need an additional 950 units. The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely due to its sensitivity to the pipeline cap and historical data that significantly lags the current growth.
