Since this is a snack product, demand is relatively stable but shows some upward variance. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and become visible in Period 6's decision phase. To avoid stockouts while covering the lead time and the next period's demand (L+1 = 5 periods), I need to target a pipeline that covers demand for the next 5 periods. My total target inventory (Inventory Position) should be around 578 units (115.6 avg * 5 periods) plus a safety stock buffer due to the rising trend in the historical samples (127, 160). I will aim for a total pipeline of 650 units. Since current On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 0, the order quantity for this period is 650.",

Total expected demand for 5 periods is approximately 575-600 units. Since 650 units are already in-transit, the current pipeline is theoretically sufficient to cover demand through Period 5 once it arrives. However, since we are currently out of stock and the lead time is long, I will place a small supplemental order to account for the slightly higher-than-average demand seen in Period 1 (118) and Period 5 (160) from the historical list, ensuring we don't run dry immediately after the first shipment arrives if demand trends upward.",

On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to stockouts in the last three periods because incoming shipments were based on lower previous forecasts. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Total pipeline units needed = 780 * 5 = 3900. Total current inventory + in-transit = 108 + 898 + 700 + 750 + 750 = 3206.

Analysis of the last four periods (P41-P44) shows demand of 755, 741, 774, and 845, yielding a moving average of 778.75 units. I will use a forecast of ~800 units per period to account for this growth. The confirmed lead time is 4 periods. With the decision for Period 45, I must cover demand for periods 45, 46, 47, 48, and 49 (L+1 = 5 periods) before the next order arrives. Total required inventory = 800 * 5 = 4000 units. Current pipeline: On-hand (161) + In-transit (2980) = 3141 units. The gap is 4000 - 3141 = 859 units.

The most recent demand (Period 45) reached 919 units, following 845 in Period 44 and 774 in Period 43. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' observation from Period 45 that the regime has shifted again, moving from ~750-780 to a higher range likely between 850-950 units/period. The lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and current demand expected to hit or exceed 920, I need to cover demand for Period 46 plus the 4-period lead time (P47, P48, P49, P50). Total units needed for P46-P50 (5 periods) at an average of ~920 is 4,600. Current in-transit is 3,140 (placed in P42: 750, P43: 750, P44: 780, P45: 860). Note: The game ends at Period 50. My Period 46 order will arrive in Period 50 (46+4=50). Any order placed after Period 46 will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, I must order enough now to cover any remaining gap for the final period (Period 50) and account for the fact that I am currently at 0 stock. Calculating the pipeline: In-transit arriving P46: 750, P47: 750, P48: 780, P49: 860. Total arriving before P50: 3140. Total expected demand P46-P49: ~3680 (at 920/period).

Since the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 47) will not arrive until the resolution phase of Period 51, which is outside the 50-period horizon.
