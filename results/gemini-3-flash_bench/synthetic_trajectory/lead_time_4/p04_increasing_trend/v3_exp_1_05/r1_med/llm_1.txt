Historical data for the first 5 periods shows demand ranging from 81 to 160, with an average of approximately 115.6 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive in Period 5 (Arrival Resolution) and be visible to me in Period 6. To avoid stockouts, I need to cover demand for current and future periods until the next delivery arrives. Since on-hand and in-transit are both 0, and the lead time is 'L=4', I should target covering demand for L+1 periods (Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Total expected demand for 5 periods based on the average (115.6 * 5) is 578 units. Given the upward trend in the provided historical samples (103, 81, 107, 127, 160), I will lean towards a slightly higher forecast to ensure availability.",

My pipeline (on-hand 1285 + in-transit 2500 = 3785 units) needs to cover the current period (P43) plus the 4-period lead time (total 5 periods). At an expected demand of 750 units/period, the 5-period requirement is 3750 units. Currently, I have 3785 units in the system. To maintain a safe but lean inventory buffer and avoid excessive holding costs ($1/unit), I will order a quantity that replaces the current demand and maintains a buffer above the lead-time requirement. Since I am already slightly above the bare minimum 5-period demand (3785 vs 3750), I will target an order of 750 to stay aligned with the new consumption rate.",

Total available supply for the final three periods is 81 + 600 + 750 + 1000 = 2431 units. Based on a forecast of ~975 units/period, total expected demand for P48-P50 is ~2925 units. Since 2431 < 2925, we will likely stock out in Period 50, but placing an order now (P48) will not arrive in time to satisfy any remaining game demand.

The P45 order (750 units) is expected to arrive during Period 49, and the P46 order (1000 units) is expected in Period 50.
