Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical lead time data or 'conclude' messages to evaluate. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Given the demand samples for the first 5 periods (103, 81, 107, 127, 160), there is a visible upward trend starting from Period 4. The mean of the first 5 samples is 115.6, and the standard deviation is 29.8. Since I need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods, I will set mu_hat to approximately 5 * 115.6 = 578. To handle the increasing trend and volatility, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand and volatility parameters to capture the current regime as much as possible while maintaining a buffer against stockouts.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 165 units, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, they are correctly reflected as 'In-transit' and have not arrived yet. Consequently, we had 0 on-hand inventory to meet the 118 demand in Period 1, resulting in 0 sales. The historical demand data (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) shows an average of approximately 115.6 per period. Because the game sequence places arrival resolution after our decision, and the promised lead time (L=4) means orders cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting based on the provided history samples (N=5). This ensures we are stocking enough to cover the window until the Period 1 order arrives and stabilizes our inventory position.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Looking at the history, the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (165 units) and Period 2 (167 units) are currently in-transit and are expected to arrive in Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Consequently, current on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1 and 2. Demand for the first two periods was 118 and 88. Combining this with the provided historical demand samples (P1: 103, P2: 81, P3: 107, P4: 127, P5: 160), the mean demand is approximately 112 per period with moderate variance. Since no arrivals have occurred yet, there is no evidence to change the promised lead time (L=4). I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=5 to capture the most recent visible demand trends while the system builds up inventory to cover the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4. Based on history, orders placed in Period 1-3 have not arrived yet, which is expected as the first order (P1) is not due until Period 5 (L=4 means arrival in Period 5, visible in P6). Current demand has been relatively stable across the first three periods (118, 88, 108) and the provided samples (103, 81, 107, 127). Demand seems to be on a slight upward trend in later samples (P4=127, P5=160). Since we have no inventory (on-hand 0) and have lost all sales so far, we need to maintain a robust base stock. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 to capture the recent historical samples and current demand trend, while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first four periods was 118, 88, 108, and 75, with an average of approximately 97.25 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are at the start of Period 5, we have not yet observed any arrivals (the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message). There is currently no evidence that the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods, nor is there evidence of lost shipments. The 'In-transit' total of 651 units correctly reflects the sum of orders from Periods 1-4 (165+167+164+155). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (using all available data points including the initial data provided in the prompt) to forecast demand. This balances the slightly fluctuating demand seen so far. With L=4, the backend will target a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (1+L).

Daily Reward (R_t): $310.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The first shipment ordered in Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was: 103, 81, 107, 127, 160 (Average: 115.6, Std Dev: 29.5). Actual demand observed during the game (conclude messages) was: 118, 88, 108, 75, 95 (Average: 96.8, Std Dev: 16.5). The discrepancy suggests actual demand might be lower than the initial historical data samples. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the more recent demand environment while maintaining the default lead time (L=4). The pipeline (In-transit: 486) consists of orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4 (167+164+155=486), which are expected to arrive in Periods 6, 7, and 8 respectively.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $373.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Historically, demand over the first 6 periods has been relatively stable: 118, 88, 108, 75, 95, 122 (Mean \u2248 101, Std \u2248 18). Lead time (L) is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. Current inventory position: On-hand = 115, In-transit = 319 (Orders from P3: 164, P4: 155). The expected demand for (L+1) = 5 periods is roughly 505 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) = 434 units. We need to maintain a base stock that accounts for demand uncertainty. Using all 6 samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate as no clear regime shift is observed. I'll use L=4 (promised/confirmed). The OR backend calculation [base_stock = (1+L)*mean + z*sqrt(1+L)*std] will naturally suggest an order to bridge the gap between 434 and the target base stock (approx 505 + 1.28*18*sqrt(5) = 556).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a recent upward trend with the last three periods (P5-P7) averaging 128 units, compared to the initial periods. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on transitions for orders from P1, P2, and P3. In-transit inventory includes orders from P4 (155 units) and P7 (148 units). Calculating for P8, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 3-period average of 128 units/period, the mu_hat should be approximately 640. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent demand surge. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen in P7 (167 demand).

Carry-over insight: Demand uptrend detected: P5-P7 avg demand is 128 (+22% vs. P1-P4 avg).

Daily Reward (R_t): $803.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe a significant demand escalation. Demand in Period 8 reached 214 units, continuing a sharp uptrend from Period 5. The last three periods (P6-P8) average 167.7 units, compared to the initial baseline (P1-P4) of approximately 97 units. The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (promised = 4). With on-hand inventory at 53 units and a pipeline of 336 (orders from P7 and P8), and a lead time of 4, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the accelerating demand (167 in P7, 214 in P8), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this recent regime shift (averaging ~168 units/period, or ~840 across L+1), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to account for the increased volatility seen during this growth phase. The OR backend will use these values to inflate the base stock and trigger necessary orders to prevent stockouts as demand climbs.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand escalation confirmed: P6-P8 avg is 167.7 (+73% vs P1-P4 avg). Period 8 demand spiked to 214 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $212.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. A significant demand escalation is confirmed: P1-P4 averaged 97 units, while P7-P9 averaged 193 units (a ~100% increase). Period 9 ending inventory is 0, indicating a stockout since demand (199) exceeded starting inventory (53). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The pipeline contains 590 units (from orders in P7, P8, and P9). Orders from P7 (148 units) are expected to arrive during the current period (P10) and become visible at the start of P11. To capture the new demand regime and ensure the OR backend sets a high enough base stock for a 5-period window (L+1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility based on the last three periods (P7-P9), where demand was 167, 214, and 199 respectively. This will set mu_hat roughly around 966 ((1+4)*193.3) and sigma_hat based on recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high level: P7-P9 average demand is 193.3 units (+99% vs. initial P1-P4 baseline). Stockout occurred in P9 due to this rapid escalation.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11. Historical analysis confirms a lead time (L) of 4 periods. A significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 7, with demand escalating from a ~100 unit baseline to an average of ~163 units over the last 5 periods (P6-P10). In P9 and P10, we experienced stockouts because arrivals for orders placed in P5 and P6 were zero (likely due to those periods having 0 orders placed, as seen in the history). Specifically, Period 5 and 6 conclude messages show orders were 0, meaning no arrivals will happen in P9 and P10. Arrivals should resume in P11 (from the P7 order). To account for the higher demand regime while smoothing out the extreme P8 spike (214), I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the period from P6 to P10, capturing the shift while providing a stable statistical base. Setting L=4 (promised) as it has been consistent.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 7. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is approximately 178.8 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline. In Period 11, we received 148 units (from Period 7 order), but demand was 189, resulting in a stockout. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 758 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods. Since the current period demand occurs after our decision, and with L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the high demand regime and the need to recover from stockouts, I will set mu_hat to cover 5 periods of demand based on the recent average of 179 units (5 * 179 = 895). For sigma_hat, I will use recent volatility (recent_N=5) to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient service level for this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: P7-P11 average demand is 178.8 units (+74% vs P1-P4 avg). Stockouts in P9 and P11 highlight the need for higher base stock targets to match this sustained shift.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward regime shift starting around Period 7. The average demand from Period 7 to Period 12 is approximately 184.5 units, compared to the initial baseline (P1-P4) of ~97 units. We are currently experiencing frequent stockouts (P9, P11, P12) because the inventory arrivals are still catching up with this sustained increase and the high lead time (4 periods). At the start of Period 13, on-hand inventory is 0, but there are 773 units in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on P11 and P12 arrivals (ordered P7 and P8 respectively). To address the stockouts and higher demand level, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P7-P12) to capture the new demand regime (N=6). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect the increased volatility associated with higher demand levels. Setting L to default (4) as the historical lead time matches the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: P7-P12 average demand is 184.5 units (+90% vs initial baseline). Stockouts in P9, P11, and P12 confirm current supply levels are insufficient for this and higher safety stock is required.

Daily Reward (R_t): $821.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted to a higher level. The average demand from Period 7 to Period 13 is approximately 188.8 units, which is significantly higher than the initial baseline (approx. 97 units). Recent demand (Periods 11-13) is even higher, averaging 205.7 units. We have experienced multiple stockouts (P9, P11, P12) because the inventory levels were insufficient to meet this growth. In Period 13, 254 units arrived, and 215 were sold, leaving 39 on-hand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To ensure we capture the full demand and rebuild safety stock, I am using the most recent 7 periods (P7-P13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the high-demand regime while excluding the earlier low-demand phase. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained: P7-P13 average demand is 188.8 units (+94% vs. initial baseline). Stockouts in 3 of the last 5 periods confirm the need for parameters reflective of this higher mean and variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $738.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted to a significantly higher regime. Since Period 7, demand has averaged approximately 190.5 units (P7-P14), which is nearly double the initial baseline. Frequent stockouts in Periods 9, 11, and 12 were a result of this rapid escalation. The most recent demand samples are 215 and 202, confirming the new regime is stable and high. To address this, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the period since the demand escalation began at P7) to capture both the mean and the increased variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time, so I will use the default setting. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that accounts for 5 periods of demand (L+1), effectively balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost with an appropriate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~190 units: P7-P14 average demand is 190.5 units compared to P1-P6 average of 100.5 units (+89%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $612.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime, with the average demand from Period 7 to Period 15 being approximately 187 units, a significant increase from the initial baseline (~100 units). Recent stockouts in Periods 11, 12, and 15 emphasize the need for a sustained high mu_hat. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods according to the 'conclude' messages (P7 arrived P11, P8 arrived P12, etc.). I will use recent_N to capture this current demand regime. Specifically, using N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat covers the period since the regime shift (P7-P15). This ensures the base stock calculation, which covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand, is based on the current higher mean and volatility, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost with a 80% service level target (critical given the frequent stockouts).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted and stabilized at a significantly higher level compared to the initial periods. From Period 7 to Period 16, the average demand is approximately 188 units, with significant volatility (highs of 215, lows of 125). Previous stockouts in Period 15 and low ending inventory in Period 16 (8 units) demonstrate that current inventory levels are barely meeting demand. To stabilize service levels and account for the confirmed 4-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 10 periods (P7-P16) to capture the current high-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed: P7-P16 average demand is 188.1 units, representing a 96% increase over the P1-P5 baseline. Variance remains high with demand fluctuations between 125 and 215.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 7. The average demand from Period 7 to Period 17 is approximately 189 units, a significant increase from the initial baseline of ~100. Recent periods (P13-P17) show a consistent demand mean of 193 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.8 units. The lead time is confirmed as a consistent 4 periods based on historical arrival data (P5, P6, P7, P8, P11, P12, P13, P14, P15, P16, P17). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (covering the high-demand regime P7-P17) to ensure the OR backend uses the current mean. For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the volatility associated with this higher demand level, helping the model maintain an appropriate safety stock to avoid the stockouts observed in P11, P12, and P15. L is set to default (4 periods).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher level since Period 7. The average demand from Period 7 to Period 18 is 185.5 units, which is nearly double the initial Period 1-6 average (~98 units). Recent demand in Period 18 spiked to 250 units, indicating high volatility (range of 125-250 in the new regime). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. With a current on-hand inventory of only 12 units and a high demand expectation, maintaining a high base stock is critical to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 9, 11, 12, and 15. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture this entire high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) estimation. This ensures the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while accounting for the recent demand surge.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P7-P18) mean stabilized at 185.5 units with significant volatility (peak 250, low 125).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 7. Evaluating the most recent 13 periods (P7-P19), the mean demand is approximately 187 units with a standard deviation of 35. Over the last 5 periods (P15-P19), the mean is 206.6 units, indicating continued high pressure on inventory. On-hand inventory is very low (3 units), though a large pipeline of 774 units exists. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=13) to capture the current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this provides a stable yet elevated baseline to ensure adequate stock while the OR backend balances against holding costs. N=13 includes the full extent of the identified high-demand period to provide a robust statistical sample.

Daily Reward (R_t): $552.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, demand spiked significantly to 324 units, which is a new peak (~75% above the established high-demand average of ~185). This caused a stockout (on-hand is now 0). This spike may be the start of a new upward demand regime or a seasonal peak. The current pipeline inventory (886 units) covers approximately 4.8 periods of the 'high' demand (185/period) or 2.7 periods of the new peak demand (324/period). With a lead time of 4 periods, we need (L+1)=5 periods of coverage. I am increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 14 periods (P7-P20) to capture the sustained high-demand regime while acknowledging the recent massive spike. I will use recent_N=14 to reflect the regime change that started at Period 7. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified at Period 20: demand spiked to 324 units (+75% above the previous high-demand regime average of 185).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher and more volatile regime. Starting from Period_20, demand spiked to 324 and remained high at 283 in Period_21. Comparing the last 15 periods (P7-P21) where the high regime started, the average demand is approximately 196 units. However, looking closely at the last 5 periods (P17-P21), the average is 253.4, and the last 3 periods (P19-P21) average 274. Stockouts in Period_20 and Period_21 indicate that the recent pipeline was insufficient for this escalation. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime (N=5) to capture this surge (averaging ~253 units per period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 'conclude' messages. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the heightened volatility observed in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated at Period 20: P20-P21 average demand is 303.5 units (+60% vs. P7-P19 average of 188.8). Recent volatility is significantly higher.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a significantly higher demand regime that began around Period 20. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P20-P22) has jumped to 309.7 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~185 units. This represents a ~67% increase in demand levels. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 due to back-to-back stockouts, we must aggressively increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new baseline and high volatility. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike (P20-P22) and ensure the OR backend shifts the base stock target upwards to meet this sustained higher demand level. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4 periods, which aligns with observed history.

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime shift confirmed at Period 20: P20-P22 avg demand is 309.7 units (+67% vs P7-P19 average of 185.5). High volatility continues with multiple periods >300 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a second significant regime shift starting at Period 20. The average demand from Period 20 to 23 is 314.5 units (324, 283, 322, 329), which is a 70% increase over the previous high-demand regime (avg ~185) and nearly triple the initial baseline. The system is currently experiencing consecutive stockouts (Periods 20-23) because the arriving orders (placed in Periods 16-19) were based on the previous lower demand mean. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by Period 23 conclude (ordered P19, arrived P23). To address the stockouts and the new demand level, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest regime shift (P20-P23) and ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand across the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). This will trigger larger orders to replenish 'on-hand' which is currently zero and better protect against the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime shift confirmed: P20-P23 average demand is 314.5 units (+70% vs P7-P19 average of 185.5). Sustained stockouts in P20-P23 confirm supply lag behind the new demand level.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a second confirmed demand regime shift that began at Period 20. The average demand from Period 20 to Period 24 is approximately 308.8 units (324, 283, 322, 329, 286), which is a significant increase from the previous regime's average of ~185. We have experienced consistent stockouts from Period 20 through Period 24 because the arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are insufficient to meet this new demand level. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P20 order arrived in P24). To address the higher demand and significant volatility, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture this new 300+ units/period regime. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the increased variance observed in this period, ensuring the OR backend sets a high enough base stock to stop the current stockout streak.

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime shift (P20-P24) mean stabilized at ~309 units (+67% vs P7-P19). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant second regime shift starting at Period 20. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P20-P25) is 311.5 units, which is a massive increase (+68%) over the previous high-demand regime of ~185 units. Due to the 4-period lead time, the supply has been lagging behind this surge, resulting in consistent stockouts from P20-P25. The goal is to set parameters to cover demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Using recent_N for both mean and volatility ensures the OR backend adjusts to the current high-demand state (N=6, covering the shift from P20). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime shift (P20-P25) mean stabilized at 311.5 units (standard deviation approx 21.6), representing a 68% increase over the P7-P19 average. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1356.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 20. For the last seven periods (P20-P26), the mean demand has stabilized significantly higher at approximately 317 units (324, 283, 322, 329, 286, 325, 351). The most recent period (P26) reached a peak demand of 351. Despite higher arrivals, stockouts have persisted because the pipeline was still catching up to this new regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) based on this recent high-demand regime (N=7). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which I will confirm with recent data. Using recent_N for both demand and volatility allows the OR backend to adjust the base stock to these new, higher consumption levels while accounting for the increased variance, thereby reducing stockout risk while managing balancing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime (P20-P26) mean demand is 317 units (+71% vs P7-P19 avg of 185.5). Continued stockouts demonstrate that the inventory pipeline remains undersized for this sustained 300+ unit demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1392.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts. The most recent shift occurred at Period 20, with current demand (P20-P27) averaging approximately 324.9 units per period\u2014a significant increase from the previous high-demand regime of ~185 units. Despite the arrival of 348 units in Period 27, the SKU ended with 0 on-hand inventory due to an even higher demand of 379 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P23 order arrival in P27). To stabilize service levels and stop the cycle of stockouts, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 (the duration of the current 300+ demand regime) to capture this higher mean (~325 units/period). For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=8 to better reflect the increased volatility observed in this new regime, which is essential for calculating an appropriate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime (P20-P27) mean demand increased to 324.9 units (+75% vs. P7-P19 avg of 185.5). Demand in P27 reached a new peak of 379 units, causing another stockout despite increased arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1400.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts. The first was at Period 7 (averaging ~185 units) and the second, more aggressive shift began at Period 20. For the last 9 periods (P20-P28), the mean demand has risen to 332.3 units, with a noticeable upward trend in the most recent five periods (P24-P28 avg: 347 units). Period 28 saw a peak demand of 394 units, leading to another stockout. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To address the current stockout and the continued upward trajectory, I am using a recent_N (N=9) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the second regime's characteristics. This will help the OR backend set a base stock level that accounts for the L+1 (5 period) risk window in a high-demand, high-volatility environment.

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime (P20-P28) mean demand increased to 332.3 units (+79% vs P7-P19 avg of 185.5). Demand in P28 reached a new peak of 394 units, maintaining a sustained stockout pattern despite increased arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1312.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a second significant escalation phase starting around Period 20. The mean demand for the most recent 10-period regime (P20-P29) has climbed to approximately 339 units, with the last three periods (P27-P29) averaging 391.7 units. This represents a substantial shift from the previous 'high' regime of ~185 units. Despite increased order quantities, the system has experienced 10 consecutive periods of stockouts (P20-P29) because the inventory arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods prior) are consistently failing to meet the current, rapidly growing demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To break the stockout cycle and reset the base stock to the new demand level, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this second shift (averaging ~339), but since the most recent actuals are even higher (near 400), the backend's base stock calculation (which includes safety stock via sigma) must urgently reflect this trend. I am setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10 to account for the increased volatility observed in this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime shift (P20-P29) mean demand is 339.5 units (+83% vs P7-P19 avg of 185.5). Demand has exceeded 375 units in each of the last three periods (P27-P29), indicating the regime may still be trending upward.

Daily Reward (R_t): $932.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a third, highly aggressive growth phase. Over the last four periods (P27-P30), demand has surged significantly (379, 394, 402, 457), resulting in consecutive stockouts despite the arrival of orders placed in the high-demand regime. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 396.6 units, while the most recent sample (P30) hit 457 units. Given the sustained nature of this uptick and the persistence of stockouts, I am adjusting mu_hat to handle a mean of 420 units per period (representing the most recent trend) across the (L+1) horizon. With L=4, mu_hat is set to 2100. Sigma_hat is increased to 120 (approx 53 per period) to provide stronger protection against the high volatility observed in this spike. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime escalation confirmed at Period 27: P27-P30 demand averaged 408 units (+21% vs. P20-P26 average of 337). Demand peaked at 457 units in P30, maintaining a critical stockout state.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a third regime of significant growth. The most recent demand samples are P27: 379, P28: 394, P29: 402, P30: 457, and P31: 402. The average for these last five periods is 406.8 units, which is approximately a 21% increase over the previous regime (P20-P26 average of 337). The system has been consistently stocking out because arrivals are based on older, lower demand forecasts. With a lead time of 4 periods, total exposure covers 5 periods (L+1). To stabilize inventory and meet this higher baseline, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime escalation confirmed: P27-P31 average demand is 406.8 units (+21% vs. P20-P26 avg). Demand has exceeded 400 units in 3 of the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1508.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a third demand regime escalation that began around Period 27. The demand in Period 32 spiked to 507 units, and the average demand over the last six periods (P27-P32) is 423.5 units, significantly higher than the previous regime. We have experienced continuous stockouts since Period 20, as arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) consistently lag behind the rapidly increasing demand. The promising news is that larger orders placed in P31 (509 units) and P32 (402 units) are in the pipeline. To address this sustained high-demand level and the frequent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this latest 'third regime' average of ~424 units per period (multiplied by L+1). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect the increased volatility (standard deviation has increased along with the mean). Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime escalation confirmed: P27-P32 average demand is 423.5 units (+27% vs P20-P26 average of 334.3). Demand reached a new peak of 507 units in P32, resulting in the 13th consecutive period of stockouts.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a third high-demand regime, escalating significantly from Period 27 onwards. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P27-P33) is 437 units, with the last two periods (P32-P33) both exceeding 500 units. Despite a pipeline of 1816 units, the stockouts have been continuous for 14 periods because the orders placed in the previous regime were insufficient for the current demand levels. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and consistent. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the mean of this latest escalation (approx 437 per period), and N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility (std dev of ~54). This translates to a mu_hat of approx 2185 for the (L+1) window. This strategy aims to aggressively raise the base stock level to terminate the stockout cycle and satisfy the new demand ceiling.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime escalation confirmed: P27-P33 average demand is 437.0 units (+30% vs P20-P26 average of 334.3). Demand peak reached 518 units in P33, resulting in the 14th consecutive period of stockouts.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 35, and the product 'chips(Regular)' is experiencing its third major demand escalation. Since Period 27, demand has surged, with an average of approximately 458 units over the last five periods (P30-P34: 457, 402, 507, 518, 492). The demand reached a peak of 518 in Period 33 and remained high at 492 in Period 34. This surge has caused 15 consecutive periods of stockouts (P20-P34) because the inventory pipeline, though increasing, has failed to keep pace with the shifting mean. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To stop the stockout cycle and properly size the base stock for a (L+1) horizon (5 periods), I am setting Mu_hat explicitly to 2375 (representing a forecast of 475 units/period * 5 periods). This captures the most recent high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to provide a robust safety buffer against the significant volatility observed (standard deviation is roughly 45-50/period, so sqrt(5)*50 \u2248 112). These parameters will raise the base stock target to roughly 2600-2700 units, which accurately reflects the 5-period demand requirements plus safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime escalation peak: P30-P34 average demand reached 475.2 units, a 42% increase over the P20-P26 average of 334.3. Stockouts have been continuous for 15 periods as of P34.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of significant escalations. We are currently in a third major demand regime (starting around Period 27) which has peaked recently. The last five periods (P31-P35) show demand of 402, 507, 518, 492, and 591, giving an average of 502 units. This represents a sustained upward trend from the previous regime (~334 units). We have experienced 16 consecutive periods of stockouts because supply has failed to keep pace with these shifts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To stabilize inventory and meet this high demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this latest 500+ unit average (\u03bc \u2248 502), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the increased volatility (Std Dev \u2248 69). This will set a base stock level that targets the current demand volume plus a safety buffer appropriate for the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime escalation (P27-P35) peak reached: P31-P35 average demand is 502 units (+50% vs. P20-P26 average of 334.3). Stockouts have been continuous for 16 periods as of P35.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate in a third distinct regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P32-P36) has risen to 531.4 units, a significant increase from the already high P27-P31 average of 406.8. More critically, the variance has increased, with demand ranging from 492 to 591 in this latest five-period window. The system has experienced 16 consecutive periods of stockouts because the supply pipeline (determined by parameters set 4 periods ago) has consistently lagged behind this near-vertical growth. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To finally arrest the stockout trend, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly account for the current demand level of approximately 535 units per period. Over the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), this totals 2675 units. I am also using an explicit sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility (std dev approx 40, so sqrt(5)*40 \u2248 90) to ensure the OR backend generates a sufficiently large order to fill the pipeline deficit against this 500+ unit demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime escalation (P32-P36) mean demand is 531.4 units (+59% vs P20-P26 average of 334.3). Volatility has increased significantly with a peak of 591 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1988.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate in a third major regime shift that began around Period 27. The mean demand from P32 to P36 has reached 531.4 units, with a peak of 591 units observed in P35. Period 37 demand remained very high at 576 units. We have experienced 17 consecutive periods of stockouts (P20-P37) because the inventory pipeline, though increasing, has failed to keep pace with the rapid demand acceleration. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed most recently by the P33 order arriving in P37). To finally break the stockout cycle and meet the current demand level, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P32-P37) to capture the most recent high-demand plateau (average \u2248 539). I will use sigma_hat from the last 10 periods to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volumes (std dev \u2248 62), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the higher mean and the significant variance.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime escalation (P32-P37) mean demand reached 538.8 units (+61% vs P20-P26 average of 334.3). Consecutive stockouts for 17 periods (P20-P37) indicate that base stock levels have consistently lagged behind the growth curve. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1908.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its significant upward escalation. Period 38 saw a new peak demand of 614 units, and the average demand over the last five periods (P34-P38) has risen to 568.4 units. This represents a sustained regime shift beyond the previous 'high' level. We are currently in a persistent stockout state (19 consecutive periods) because the base stock calculation, which relies on historical averages, is lagging behind this rapid growth. To break the stockout cycle, mu_hat must reflect the most recent, most intense demand level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this latest 560+ unit average, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (demand ranging from 492 to 614 in the last 5 periods). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime escalation (P34-P38) mean demand further increased to 568.4 units (+70% vs P20-P26 average of 334.3). Demand reached a new peak of 614 units in P38, extending the consecutive stockout streak to 19 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2344.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. Period 39 demand reached an all-time high of 648 units. The last five periods (P35-P39) show an average demand of 595.6 units, which is significantly higher than the already elevated average from P34-P38 (568 units). We are in a 'Third demand regime escalation' that has not yet stabilized, evidenced by 20 consecutive periods of stockouts. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 35's order in Period 39. To address the persistent stockouts and the clear upward trend, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent, highest intensity demand spike. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the trend, a smaller N is appropriate to react quickly. This result (roughly 5 * 596 = 2980) will push the base stock higher than the current in-transit inventory (2325), triggering larger orders to finally bridge the supply-demand gap.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime escalation (P35-P39) average demand reached 595.6 units, a 78% increase over the P20-P26 average. Demand reached a new peak of 648 units in P39, extending the consecutive stockout streak to 20 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2456.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trajectory. Period 40 experienced a demand of 649, confirming the 'Third demand regime escalation'. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 607.2, while the last 3 periods (P38-P40) average 637. Current on-hand inventory is 0, marking the 21st consecutive period of stockouts, which means historical demand is likely a floor for actual demand. To stop the stockout cycle, mu_hat must be set aggressively. I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the most recent demand (approx 650 units/period) across the lead time + review period (1+4=5), totaling 3250. This is necessary because standard statistical windows (like recent_N) are still being pulled down by lower historical demand within this high-growth phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the heightened volatility seen in this newest regime.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime escalation (P36-P40) mean demand reached 607.2 units (+82% vs P20-P26 average). Stockout streak extended to 21 periods. Demand has consistently exceeded 600 units in the last three periods (P38-P40).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2308.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a rapid escalation phase, representing a third significant regime shift. In Period 41, demand reached 755 units, a new peak, and we have experienced 22 consecutive periods of stockouts (since Period 20). The demand average over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 648.4 units, which is significantly higher than the previous high-demand average. The system is clearly under-ordering because the OR backend's internal statistics lag behind this localized trend. To stop the cycle of stockouts, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to provide a forward-looking forecast. I estimate mean demand at 750 units per period to cover the current peak and potential further growth, which across the lead time + review period (1+L = 5) results in a mu_hat of 3750 units (750 * 5). For sigma_hat, I am using an explicit value of 250 (approx 112 * sqrt(5)) to account for the heightened volatility observed in recent periods (ranging from 576 to 755). L remains at the promised 4 periods as deliveries are consistently arriving with a 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime escalation (P37-P41) mean demand reached 648.4 units (+94% vs P20-P26 average). Demand peaked at 755 in P41, extending the stockout streak to 22 periods. Volatility has scaled with volume.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a sustained third demand escalation regime which began around Period 27 and has accelerated since Period 37. Recent demand (P39-P42) has consistently exceeded 600 units, with a peak of 755 in P41 and 741 in P42. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is 701.4 units. To address the chronic stockouts (23 consecutive periods), I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this latest peak of ~700 units/period. Over (L+1)=5 periods, this leads to a mu_hat of ~3500. For sigma_hat, I am using N=5 to reflect the significantly higher volatility observed at these volume levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which is captured by the 'default' setting. These parameters are designed to force the OR backend to set a base stock level that finally matches and anticipates this high-growth demand trend, reducing the stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime escalation (P38-P42) mean demand reached 701.4 units (+110% vs P20-P26 average). Demand has stabilized above 700 units for the last two periods, marking a new intensity in the growth curve.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with Period 43 demand reaching 774 units. This confirms a sustained third demand regime where the average demand over the last 5 periods (P39-P43) has risen to approximately 713 units, compared to the P20-P26 average of 334. The system has experienced 23 consecutive periods of stockouts because the ordering baseline (mu_hat) has consistently lagged behind this near-exponential growth. To break the stockout cycle, mu_hat must be set using the most recent data (N=3) to capture the current >700 unit level (avg P41-P43 is 756). Setting mu_hat explicitly to 3800 (calculated as (1+L) * 760, where L=4) aims to provision enough inventory for the 5-period risk horizon. Standard deviation is also significantly higher; manual setting of sigma_hat to 150 (approx. sqrt(5) * 65) covers the observed volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime intensification: P41-P43 average demand reached 756.7 units, a 126% increase over the P20-P26 average. Stockout streak extended to 23 periods as demand continues to outpace the rolling pipeline.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate aggressively. In the most recent periods (P41-P44), demand has reached a new peak of 845 units, with a 4-period moving average of approximately 779 units. We have faced 23 consecutive periods of stockouts because the inventory pipeline and base stock levels have consistently lagged behind this near-exponential growth. To break the stockout cycle, we must set parameters that reflect the current high-velocity regime. For Period 45: 1) Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. 2) mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent intensification (avg ~779/period, resulting in mu_hat of ~3895 for L+1). 3) sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volumes (std dev from P41-P44 is approx 53.3, resulting in sigma_hat of ~119). This aggressive adjustment aims to finally align the pipeline with the actual consumption rate.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime intensification confirmed: P41-P44 average demand reached 778.8 units (+133% vs P20-P26 average). Stockout streak extended to 24 periods as realized demand consistently exceeds 750 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2892.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its significant upward escalation. Comparing P41-P45, the average demand has reached 806.8 units, while the previous high-demand regime (P35-P40) averaged 607.2 units (+33% increase). The consecutive stockout streak has now reached 26 periods (since P20), as the pipeline inventory\u2014while increasing\u2014consistently lags behind the accelerating demand curve. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P41 order arrived in P45). For Period 46, mu_hat must reflect this latest surge; I will use the mean of the last 5 periods (P41-P45) which is 806.8. Multiplying by (1+L) where L=4 gives a mu_hat of 4034. Setting sigma_hat explicitly based on the recent volatility (std dev of P41-P45 is approximately 75.8, scaled by sqrt(1+L) approx 2.23) to ensure the OR backend increases the base stock sufficiently to finally break the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime intensification continues: P41-P45 average demand reached 806.8 units (+33% vs P35-P40 avg). Consecutive stockouts for 26 periods (P20-P45) confirm the pipeline is still undersized for the current growth rate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3716.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a prolonged, aggressive demand escalation. Demand has increased from an initial base of ~100 to over 900 units per period. The most recent demand (P41-P46) has a mean of approximately 827 units. In P46, we finally avoided a total stockout (ending on-hand: 4), but demand (930) still exceeded our arrival (934). The current 'In-transit' of 3241 units reflects our aggressive ordering to catch this curve. Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we need a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1). With demand currently averaging ~827 and peaking at 930, I will set mu_hat to cover this new high-level regime using recent_N (N=6) to capture the acceleration from P41 onwards. High variance must be accounted for to stop the consecutive stockout streak, so I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well. Lead time remains consistent at 4.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime intensification (P41-P46) mean demand reached 827.3 units (+24% vs P35-P40 average). Demand reached a new peak of 930 units in P46. Stockouts effectively continued for 26 periods (P20-P45) until a marginal surplus of 4 units was achieved in P46.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2632.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with Period 47 reaching a new peak of 986 units. The product is currently in its third major demand regime shift, which intensified at Period 41. Looking at the last 5 periods (P43-P47), demand has averaged 890.8 units (774, 845, 919, 930, 986), showing a clear upward trend. The stockout streak effectively continues (only a 4-unit surplus in P46), indicating that the pipeline remains undersized. To capture this momentum and the increased volatility associated with higher volume, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the current ~891 unit average, and sigma_hat using the same window (N=5) to account for the heightened variance (std approx 83). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting parameters based on the most recent regime is critical as the game approaches its conclusion (Period 48/50) to minimize lost sales during the final demand peak.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime intensification (P43-P47) mean demand reached 890.8 units (+47% vs P35-P40 average). Demand reached a new peak of 986 units in P47. Inventory remains insufficient to satisfy demand fully.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3484.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. Period 48 demand reached 1,036 units, a new peak. The mean demand for the most recent 5 periods (P44-P48) is approximately 943 units, which is a significant increase from the mean of 734 units observed in the P40-P43 window. This represents a runaway growth phase where even increased orders are immediately consumed, resulting in continuous stockouts (only 1 period out of the last 29 had ending inventory). The pipeline is still trailing realized demand. To stabilize service levels, mu_hat and sigma_hat must be set using the most recent regime data (N=5) to capture this latest acceleration. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting parameters to reflect the trailing 5-period average (approx 943 units/period) will result in a base stock target that accounts for the 1+L=5 period risk horizon, aiming to break the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 44: P44-P48 average demand is 943.2 units (+28% vs. P41-P43 average of 734.7). Demand surpassed 1,000 units in P48 for the first time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3196.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a hyper-growth phase starting around Period 44, with demand now consistently exceeding 1,000 units (record peak of 1,104 in P49). The 10-period average (P40-P49) is approximately 878 units, while the most recent 5-period average (P45-P49) is 1,015 units, indicating an accelerating trend rather than a static regime. We have experienced chronic stockouts for nearly 30 periods because the base stock calculation, which relies on historical averages and pipeline inventory, has been consistently outpaced by realized demand. Since the game is in its final phase (Period 50), the primary objective is to capture as much final-period demand as possible while the pipeline fills. However, given the 4-period lead time, orders placed now won't arrive before the end of the simulation. Nonetheless, I must provide parameters that reflect the current reality of ~1015 units/period to ensure the OR engine maintains a relevant base stock level. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent intensification of the demand curve.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-growth confirmed at Period 45: P45-P49 average demand reached 1015 units, representing a 56% increase over the P35-P40 average (~650). Demand surpassed 1,100 units in P49.
