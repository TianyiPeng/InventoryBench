Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no units in transit. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 5 periods shows an upward trend (103, 81, 107, 127, 160). The mean demand over these 5 samples is approximately 115.6. Predicted lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no observed arrivals yet, I will use the default lead time (L=4). To account for the observed demand growth, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 5 samples to capture the upward trend while maintaining reasonable safety stock. The OR backend will compute a base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, leadings to a moderate service level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 165 units, but as the promised lead time is 4 periods, these units are currently in-transit. Consequently, we had 0 on-hand inventory to satisfy the demand of 123 units in Period 1, resulting in 123 lost sales. The historical demand data (P1-P5) shows a clear upward trend (103, 81, 107, 127, 160). Given that we only have 5 historical samples and there's a visible growth in demand, I will use a recent window (N=5) for the demand forecast. For the lead time, I will stick to the default promised lead time of 4 until we observe actual arrivals to calculate any drift. The mu_hat and sigma_hat will be based on the last 5 samples to capture the recent growth trend more effectively than the long-term average (which includes lower early values).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Currently, we have 0 units on-hand and 333 units in-transit (165 from P1, 168 from P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since P1's order only arrived in P1's arrival phase (invisible until P2 conclude) or later, seeing 0 arrivals in P1 and P2 conclude is expected for a lead time of 4. Historical demand (P1-P5 samples) averages ~115.6, but observed demand in P1 (123) and P2 (91) is slightly lower on average (~107). However, with L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Demand seems to be trending upward in the sample data provided (hitting 160 in Period 5). I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to focus on the immediately preceding demand observations (123, 91) while the L will remain at default (4). The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4) * mean(123, 91) = 5 * 107 = 535. This ensures we build enough pipeline to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Consequently, our on-hand inventory remains 0, and all units sold so far are 0 (lost sales). The historical demand for periods 1-5 is [103, 81, 107, 127, 160], showing a clear upward trend in recent periods (P4: 127, P5: 160). I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this growth, which averages 131.33 per period. For lead time (L), no orders have arrived yet (as expected for L=4), so I will use the default promised lead time. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the increased variance observed in the most recent demand samples.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 165 units. According to the 'Promised Lead Time Definition', an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 4 should arrive during Period 1+4=5's arrival resolution phase. This arrival is then visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message, which I will see at the start of Period 6. Therefore, seeing 0 arrivals in Period 1-4 is expected and consistent with L=4. Demand for the first 5 periods (including current observation) is 103, 81, 107, 127, 160. There is a visible upward trend in demand starting from Period 2. The average demand over these 5 periods is approximately 115.6. To account for the recent growth trend, I will use recent_N with N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to slightly overweight the higher recent figures (81, 107, 127, 160; mean=118.75). For sigma_hat, I'll use the default calculation across the available samples to capture the volatility. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4. According to the history, the order placed in Period 1 arrived at the end of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6), which confirms the actual lead time is indeed 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: ordered P1, arrived P5, LT=4). Demand over the first 5 periods has been [103, 81, 107, 127, 160] (seeded) and [123, 91, 119, 137, 80] (actual). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality yet as the data shows general fluctuation around a mean. The mean of all 10 available demand samples is 112.8, with a standard deviation of 24.3. Currently, we have 468 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5) and 85 on-hand. With L=4, the OR engine covers demand for 1+L=5 periods. 5 * 112.8 = 564. Our pipeline (468+85=553) is nearly aligned with this. I will use 'default' for L to stay with the promised/confirmed 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all 10 available samples (recent_N=10) to capture current volatility while staying grounded in the observed mean.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The demand history shows samples: 103, 81, 107, 127, 160 (initial) followed by game history demand: 123, 91, 119, 137, 80, 143. There is no clear trend or seasonal shift yet in these periods, so the overall mean (approx. 115) remains a stable estimate. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current status: On-hand 110, In-transit 359 (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). The backend policy will calculate base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods. I am choosing 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture the game history dynamics while smoothing noise. Lead time (L) is set to 'default' as the observed 4 periods match the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $355.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. Historical demand for the last 7 periods is 123, 91, 119, 137, 80, 143, and 122. The mean of these 7 samples is approximately 116.4. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7), which exactly matches the promised lead time. The pipeline inventory is currently 370 units (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7), and on-hand inventory is 133 units. Since we have enough data points to cover the lead time + review period, I will use a recent window of N=7 to capture the demand mean and variance. This will set mu_hat roughly to (1+4) * 116.4 = 582. The backend will calculate base stock using the service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.8, and the order will be the difference between base stock and the pipeline (133 + 370 = 503). This ensures we maintain a stock level that accounts for the 4-period lead time.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8 (all showing exactly 4 periods). On-hand inventory is 146, with 383 units in-transit (orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). Total demand samples (13 periods including pre-game) show a mean of 115.3 and a standard deviation of 23.5. There is no clear seasonal trend or regime shift evident in the historical data yet (values fluctuate between 80 and 160). Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 4) and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full sample history, as there is no evidence to suggest a recent shift in demand behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $554.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 9 (orders from P1-P5 arrived exactly at P+4). The current on-hand inventory is 42 units, with 428 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Historical demand over the first 9 periods has been relatively stable, with values ranging from 80 to 149. The mean demand is approximately 118 units per period with a standard deviation of about 24. Since there isn't a significant or sustained regime shift evident in the demand pattern (it appears to be random around a stable mean), I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which calculates statistics based on all available samples. For lead time, I will use 'default' since the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $404.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we experienced a stockout (demand 182, sold 101) due to reaching 0 ending inventory. The lead time of 4 periods is well-established through consistent arrivals from Periods 5 to 10. The demand average for the first 5 periods was approximately 110, but the last 5 periods (P6-P10) show a mean of 138.6, indicating a significant upward trend or regime shift. Specifically, demand in Period 10 spiked to 182. To prevent future stockouts and account for this higher demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the recent mean (~139 units) rather than the lower historical average. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 695 units) plus a safety buffer for the increased volatility (sigma).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 6: mean increased from ~110 to ~139 units (+26%). Stockout occurred in Period 10 due to demand spike (182 units).

The mean demand for the first 5 periods was 110 units, while the average demand from Period 6 to Period 11 has risen to 139.6 units (143, 122, 97, 149, 182, 145). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, and P11). In Period 10, we experienced a stockout due to a high demand spike (182), leaving us with 0 inventory at the end of that period and only 11 units at the end of Period 11. Although the supply pipeline is significant (563 units in-transit), the current on-hand inventory is dangerously low. To address the increased demand regime and the higher volatility (sigma) seen recently, I am using recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime characteristics since Period 6. This will ensure our base stock level is sufficiently high to cover demand over the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5 total periods).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods consistently. Demand has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 6. Pre-Period 6 demand averaged ~107; since Period 6, the demand samples are [143, 122, 97, 149, 182, 145, 177], which averages approximately 145 units. We have experienced stockouts in Periods 10 and 12 because demand spikes (182 and 177) exceeded available inventory + recent arrivals. Currently, On-hand is 0. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. I am setting L to 'default' (4) as it is reliable. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the higher demand regime (avg 145 * 5 = 725 units). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect the increased volatility observed in this new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 6. Since then, demand has averaged approximately 152 units per period (Periods 6-13), which is significantly higher than the initial average of ~110. Recent demand (last two periods) has consistently been 177 units, leading to consecutive stockouts because on-hand inventory was insufficient. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by multiple historical arrivals. Currently, we have 0 units on-hand and 691 units in-transit (orders from P10-P13). An order of 159 units placed in Period 10 is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 14) and will be visible in the next Period 15 update. To stabilize service levels and recover from stockouts, I am setting L=4 (promised/actual) and using recent_N for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the high-demand regime from Period 6 onwards). This captures the current mean of ~152 units, resulting in a target pipeline stock (base_stock) that covers (1+L)=5 periods of demand (~760 units). Given the high volatility in this new regime, sigma_hat is also set using the last 8 periods to ensure the OR backend sets a sufficient safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand from Period 6-13 is 152 units, compared to 110 units in Period 1-5 (+38%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $636.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting around Period 6. The mean demand for the first 5 periods was ~110, but from Period 6 to 14, the average demand rose to approximately 161 units (calculated from: 143, 122, 97, 149, 182, 145, 177, 177, 216). We are currently experiencing a stockout situation (ending on-hand inventory is 0 for the last three periods), indicating that our base stock is insufficient to cover the increased demand. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the current period is 15 and the regime shift started at Period 6, I will use N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the recent higher demand (Period 6 to 14). This should increase the base stock level to better handle the current demand of ~160-200 units and recover from stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift continued: Mean demand from Period 6-14 further increased to 161 units (+46% vs initial regime). High volatility and stockouts observed since Period 10.

Daily Reward (R_t): $744.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 6. The mean demand from Periods 1-5 was 109.8, but from Periods 6-15, it increased to 159.7 (+45%). Recent demand has spiked further, with the last 5 periods (P11-P15) averaging 182.4 units. We are currently experiencing frequent stockouts (ending inventory was 0 for 4 out of the last 6 periods). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 4 units on hand entering Period 16, and promised lead time L=4, we must account for demand over L+1 = 5 periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this higher, more volatile demand regime while ignoring the lower initial phase. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: Mean demand for P11-P15 is 182.4 units, representing a 66% increase over the initial regime (P1-P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $728.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. The initial period (P1-P5) mean was ~110 units. Since P11, demand has surged, with the last 5 periods (P12-P16) averaging 194.8 units (177, 177, 216, 187, 217). The current inventory is 0, and we have been consistently stocking out or ending with negligible inventory since Period 10. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further lost sales in this high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P11-P16) to capture this elevated level (average ~186.5). For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=6 to account for the increased volatility associated with the higher mean. Backend calculations for base stock will use these updated demand parameters and the 4-period lead time to ensure the pipeline inventory is sufficient for the L+1 window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Mean demand for P12-P16 is 194.8 units, a 77% increase over the initial regime (P1-P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $652.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift, stabilizing at a much higher level. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), the average demand is 195.8 units, compared to the initial regime avg of ~110. The system is currently facing stockouts because historical parameters (L=4) require us to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1), and recent arrivals (90, 159, 191, 178, 163) have been insufficient to meet the observed demand (177, 216, 187, 217, 198), resulting in zero ending inventory in 4 of the last 6 periods. With L=4 confirmed consistently, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this high-demand regime (approx. 196 units/period). This will lead the OR backend to set a higher base stock level to satisfy current demand and rebuild depleted safety stocks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Mean demand for P13-P17 is 195.8 units, a 78% increase over the initial regime (P1-P5). Consistent stockouts observed due to incoming supply trailing demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted upward and stabilized at a significantly higher level. Over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), the mean demand is 212.6 units. The current status is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced consecutive stockouts because arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are lagging behind the current demand level. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistent based on history. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this high-demand plateau (approximately 212.6 * (1 + 4) = 1063). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the recent high volatility. This approach ensures the base stock target accounts for the sustained increase in demand and the lead time of 4 periods, helping to recover from the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at highest level: Mean demand for P14-P18 is 212.6 units, a 93% increase over the initial regime (P1-P5). Consecutive stockouts continue due to supply lag.

Daily Reward (R_t): $832.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of significant upward shifts. The most recent demand (P19) reached 301 units, following a sequence of 198, 245, and 217. The current mean demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 229.6 units, but the last period significantly exceeded this. Given the continuous stockouts since P16 (and 8 of the last 10 periods), the supply is consistently lagging behind demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To address the pipeline deficit and the clear upward trend, I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand and inventory parameters to capture the high-regime mean (~230) and volatility. This will increase the base stock calculation to account for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 1150 units). With 0 on-hand and 897 in-transit, the OR engine will trigger a substantial order to close the gap between the target base stock and the current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: New demand peak detected: Period 19 demand reached 301 units (+173% vs initial regime). 5-period average (P15-P19) is 229.6 units. Stockouts have occurred in 8 out of the last 10 periods due to persistent supply lag.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of regime shifts, with the most recent data (P19-P20) showing a dramatic surge to nearly 300 units per period. This represents a ~170% increase over the initial baseline. The system has been consistently stocking out because supply (arriving orders) is trailing this new demand level by the 4-period lead time. The 5-period average (P16-P20) is 254.8 units, while the 3-period average (P18-P20) is 280.6. Given the persistent stockouts and upward momentum, I will use a 3-period window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to capture this high-demand peak, and a 10-period window for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen during this escalation. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Mean demand for P18-P20 reached 280.6 units (+155% vs initial regime). Stockouts persist as previous orders placed at lower demand levels are insufficient for current needs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $928.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a significantly higher regime. The most recent 3 periods (P19-P21) show demand levels of 301, 296, and 307 units, averaging 301.3 units. This is a consistent and sustained peak compared to earlier periods. Previous stockouts were caused by basing orders on a lower-demand regime (around 150-200 units). To stop the cycle of stockouts, mu_hat must reflect this new level. Using recent_N with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) captures this current peak of ~300 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P21 shows P17 arrival after 4 periods). Setting L to 4 (default) and sigma_hat to recent_N=3 will allow the OR backend to establish a base stock that accounts for this higher volume and its associated volatility across the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime ceiling confirmed: Average demand for P19-P21 is 301.3 units, a 174% increase from the initial regime (P1-P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $912.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher regime. Observed demand for the last 4 periods (P19-P22) is 301, 296, 307, and 283, averaging 296.75 units per period. This is nearly triple the initial demand of ~110 units. Despite large 'In-transit' quantities (1196 units), on-hand inventory remains at 0 because current arrivals (ordered 4 periods ago) were based on much lower demand forecasts. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts and align with the current high-demand ceiling, I am setting L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new mean (~297 units). This ensures the base stock calculation (covering 1+L periods) reflects the current requirements (~1485 units) rather than historical averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at peak: mean demand for P19-P22 is 296.8 units (+170% vs initial regime). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $856.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher regime. Period 23 demand reached 342 units, and the mean demand for the most recent 5 periods (P19-P23) is approximately 305.8 units. The supply chain has consistently struggled to keep up, leading to stockouts in 12 of the last 14 periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this peak demand level (approx. 306 units/period * (4+1) = 1530). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this high-demand period (standard deviation is roughly 22 units, so sqrt(5)*22 \u2248 49). This should trigger the OR backend to place aggressive orders to refill the pipeline and build safety stock once arrivals finally catch up with the demand level.

Carry-over insight: Sustained peak demand regime confirmed: Mean demand for P19-P23 is 305.8 units (+178% vs initial regime). Frequent stockouts continue as arriving orders (placed 4 periods prior) are still sized for lower demand levels.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent stable window (Periods 19-24), the historical demand values are [301, 296, 307, 283, 342, 308]. The mean of these 6 observations is approximately 306.17, and the standard deviation is approximately 19.89. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P20 order arriving in P24 exactly 4 periods later). We are currently experiencing frequent stockouts because orders arriving now were placed when demand was forecasted lower (e.g., the P20 order of 305 units barely covered P24 demand). To stabilize inventory and meet this sustained peak, I will use recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume regime while the OR backend accounts for the lead time (L=4) to set the base stock level (covering L+1 = 5 periods of demand).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~306 units from Period 19-24 (+178% vs initial regime).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime starting around Period 19. Over the last 7 periods (P19-P25), demand has averaged 312 units (301, 296, 307, 283, 342, 308, 346). We have consistent actual lead times of 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 20, and there is a large pipeline of 1203 units. Arriving orders from P22-P25 (311, 307, 282, 303) are now better aligned with current demand levels compared to previous periods where we suffered stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized peak regime. For L, I will use 'default' (promised 4) as the actual lead time is consistently 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~312 units from Period 19-25 (+184% vs initial regime).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1324.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-volume regime starting from Period 19. The mean demand from Period 19 to Period 26 is approximately 319 units, reflecting a sustained peak significantly above the initial periods. We have observed frequent stockouts because the supply pipeline (determined by the 4-period lead time) has been catching up with these step-up shifts. The most recent demand (Period 26) was 372 units, indicating that the upper bound of this regime is higher than previously estimated. I will use the recent 8 periods (P19-P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand stability while being responsive to the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained peak demand regime confirmed: Mean demand from Period 19-26 is approximately 319 units (+187% vs initial regime). Current inventory is 0 on-hand with a heavy in-transit pipeline (1243 units), but demand spikes (e.g., 372 in P26) continue to challenge service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1228.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has continued its strong upward trend, reaching 394 units in Period 27. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P23-P27) is approximately 352 units, which is a significant increase from the previous baseline. On-hand inventory is currently at 0, and while there is a substantial pipeline (1306 units), persistent stockouts indicate that arrivals (currently sized from orders placed 4 periods ago) are consistently lagging behind actual demand. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9. This N captures the current growth regime (starting around Period 19) while being large enough to provide a stable estimate of volatility.mu_hat will be based on the mean of these recent high-demand periods, and sigma_hat will capture the increased variance seen during this surge, allowing the OR backend to set a higher base stock level to mitigate future stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained peak demand regime accelerated: Mean demand from Period 23-27 is 352.4 units, a 220% increase over the initial regime (P1-P5) and a 10% increase over the previous peak estimate of 319 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1128.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of regime shifts, accelerating significantly in the most recent periods. From Period 23 to 28, demand averaged 357 units (342, 308, 346, 372, 394, 380), a substantial increase from the previous 'peak' level identified. The system has suffered repeated stockouts because arriving orders, constrained by the 4-period lead time, were sized based on outdated, lower demand expectations. Period 28 demand was 380 units, and the 5-period average (P24-P28) is 360 units. To catch up with this sustained upward trend and prevent further stockouts, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering Periods 24-28) to focus on the current high-demand environment. I will also use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime accelerated again: Mean demand from Period 24-28 is 360 units, a 227% increase over the initial regime (P1-P5) and a 13% increase over the estimate in Period 27 (319 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1212.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with the most recent 5-period average (P25-P29) climbing to 373.2 units, a significant increase from the previous regime. The last three periods (P27, P28, P29) show sustained demand near or above 380 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the inventory is currently 0 and we are consistently stocking out because arriving orders (based on previous lower forecasts) are insufficient, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to capture this latest acceleration. This will better inform the OR backend to increase the base stock level to match the current demand trajectory of ~373 units per period. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level, ensuring the safety stock is appropriately sized to mitigate persistent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime accelerated again: Mean demand from Period 25-29 is 373.2 units, an increase of approximately 17% over the Period 27 estimate (319 units) and a 239% increase over the initial regime (P1-P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1404.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime continues to accelerate. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 394 units, a 24% increase from the Period 27 stabilization point (~319 units) and a significant jump from early periods. Current on-hand inventory is 0, indicating persistent stockouts despite large in-transit shipments arriving. The newest observation (Period 30) showed a demand of 450 units, the highest recorded to date. To ensure the backend's base-stock calculation captures this recent acceleration and maintains a sufficient service level given the $4 profit/$1 holding cost ratio, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus only on this high-growth window. I am also setting sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect the increased volatility associated with these higher volumes. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration confirmed: Mean demand for P26-P30 is 394 units, an increase of 24% over the P19-P26 average (~319 units) and 258% over the initial regime (P1-P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1480.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with a new demand regime emerging. The most recent demand (Period 31) was 444 units, and the average for the last five periods (P27-P31) is 408.4 units, a significant increase from the previous peak estimate of 319 units (P19-P26). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Lead Time (L) is 4, the order placed now must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Given the consistent upward trend and frequent stockouts (on-hand is currently 0), I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period average (408.4 * 5 = 2042) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects current peak demand levels rather than historical averages. This aggressive forecasting is necessary to close the supply gap in a high-growth phase where arriving orders (placed 4 periods ago) consistently fall short of current demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration confirmed: Mean demand for P27-P31 is 408.4 units, representing a 271% increase over the initial regime (P1-P5) and a 28% increase over the P19-P26 average (~319 units).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P28-P32) has reached 435.2 units, a 10% increase from the P26-P30 average of 394 units and a 296% increase from the initial regime (P1-P5). Stockouts have occurred in the last 7 consecutive periods because arriving orders (placed 4 periods ago) were sized for lower demand levels. Total in-transit inventory is 1704 units, but current on-hand is 0. With a fixed lead time of 4 periods, we need to set parameters based on the most recent, highest-demand regime to ensure the OR backend increases the order size sufficiently to catch up with this growth. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest acceleration and provide enough safety stock to mitigate the persistent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration confirmed: Mean demand for P28-P32 reached 435.2 units, an increase of 10% over the P26-P30 average and 296% over the initial regime (P1-P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1664.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has followed a multi-stage acceleration. The latest data from P28-P33 shows demand reaching a new baseline: mean demand for the last five periods (P29-P33) is 466.0 units, compared to 394 in the previous window (P26-P30). This reflects a persistent and accelerating growth trend (23% increase over the last five periods). On-hand inventory remains 0 because arriving orders\u2014placed four periods ago\u2014were based on lower historical demand estimates. With a steady lead time of 4 periods, we are in a (L+1)=5 period exposure window. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P29-P33) to capture the most recent and highest demand regime. This will signal the OR backend to significantly increase order quantities to bridge the current supply gap and meet the 466+ unit/period demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration confirmed: Mean demand for P29-P33 reached 466.0 units, a 18% increase over the P27-P31 average (394 units) and a 323% increase over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. Recent demand history shows a sustained upward trend: P30 (450), P31 (444), P32 (528), P33 (534), and P34 (543). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 499.8 units, representing a 56% increase over the P19-P26 average (~319 units) and a significant jump from the previous update in Period 34 (466 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Due to the 4-period lead time, the system is currently fulfilling demand with orders sized for lower demand levels (e.g., P34 arrival of 372 was ordered in P30), leading to persistent stockouts and zero ending inventory. To catch up, I must set the forecast mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period average (P30-P34) to capture this new regime. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to prioritize the most current volatility and mean, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level for the upcoming L+1 period window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration confirmed: Mean demand for P30-P34 reached 499.8 units, a 56% increase over the P19-P26 average (~319 units) and 354% over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P31-P35) has reached 533.6 units, compared to 499.8 in the previous rolling window\u2014a 385% increase over the initial regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to capture this upward movement aggressively to mitigate persistent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 in 15 of the last 16 periods). I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to the latest demand levels and volatility, ensuring the OR backend's target base stock (calculated over L+1 = 5 periods) reflects the current trajectory of ~534 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration confirmed: Mean demand for P31-P35 reached 533.6 units, a 7% increase over the P30-P34 average and 385% over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1872.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its strong upward trajectory. The mean demand for the last five periods (P32-P36) is approximately 538.2 units, a 4.6% increase over the previous moving average (P31-P35: 514.4 units). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. The strategy is to use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this aggressive growth while reacting more quickly than a 'default' calculation would. This is crucial because arriving orders (placed 4 periods ago) are still undershooting actual demand, leading to persistent stockouts (on-hand is currently 0). By focusing on the most recent 5-period window, we ensure the OR backend sets a base stock level that reflects the current high-demand environment, helping to minimize lost sales while the 'cap' mechanism prevents excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration confirmed: Mean demand for P32-P36 reached 538.2 units, a 4.6% increase over the P31-P35 average and a 389% increase over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2156.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its significant upward trajectory. In Period 37, demand reached a new peak of 626 units. The 5-period moving average (P33-P37) is approximately 557.8 units, reflecting a sustained acceleration compared to the previous regime (P32-P36 was 538.2). We are experiencing persistent stockouts because arriving shipments (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are consistently lower than current demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the target service level is 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). To capture the rapidly shifting demand and minimize lost sales, I am using a recent window of N=5 samples. This window focuses on the most recent acceleration phase to lift mu_hat and sigma_hat sufficiently. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration continues: Mean demand for P33-P37 reached 557.8 units, a 3.6% increase over the P32-P36 average and a 407% increase over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2304.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' continues to accelerate sharply. The most recent demand (Period 38) reached 637 units. Calculating the mean for the last 5 periods (P34-P38) yields (543+519+567+626+637)/5 = 578.4 units per period. This represents a continued upward trend from the previous 5-period average (538.2). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we have consistently stocked out due to supply trailing demand, I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the most recent accelerated demand level to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the current 578+ run rate. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the confirmed 4-period lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the recent 5-period window to capture this latest acceleration while maintaining safety stock for the high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration continues: Mean demand for P34-P38 reached 578.4 units, a 3.7% increase over the P33-P37 average (557.8) and a 425% increase over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2240.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly. The mean demand for the most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) is 605.6 units, reflecting a clear and sustained upward trend compared to the P34-P38 average of 578.4. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P39 of the order placed in P35. On-hand inventory remains at 0 with chronic stockouts because incoming shipments (based on demand forecasts from 4 periods ago) are consistently lower than current demand. To address this, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent growth in volume and volatility. Setting N=5 focuses the OR backend on the current high-demand regime while providing enough samples to estimate variance. This will result in higher order quantities to better match the current demand trajectory and attempt to recover service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration continues: Mean demand for P35-P39 reached 605.6 units, a 4.7% increase over the P34-P38 average (578.4) and a 450% increase over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2004.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its strong upward acceleration. The most recent 5-period average (P36-P40) has reached 646.6 units, reflecting an 11% increase from the previous 5-period block (605.6 reported at P40) and approximately 488% higher than the initial regime. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system continues to experience stockouts because arriving orders (placed 4 periods ago) were sized for lower demand levels. To catch up and maintain service levels in this high-growth environment, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the accelerating trend and setting sigma_hat using the same period (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility associated with higher demand levels. This should boost the base stock target to better align with the current period's expected demand and the projected demand during the lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration continues: Mean demand for P36-P40 reached 646.6 units, a 6.8% increase over the P35-P39 average (605.6) and a 488% increase over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2200.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime continues its aggressive upward trend. The mean demand for the most recent 5-period window (P37-P41) has reached 674.0 units, which is a 4.1% increase over the P36-P40 average (647.4 units) and significantly higher than earlier in the game. On-hand inventory remains at 0, with a large pipeline of 2723 units. The stockouts persist because arriving orders (placed 4 periods ago) were sized for lower demand levels (~500\u2013550 units) while current demand has surpassed 700 units. To catch up and maintain service levels, I am setting mu_hat to 3500 (representing (1+L) * 700) using the explicit method to proactively account for the continuing acceleration before it is fully reflected in recent averages. L remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent delivery history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration continues: Mean demand for P37-P41 reached 674.0 units, a 4.1% increase over the P36-P40 average (647.4) and a 512% increase over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2508.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) has reached 692.6 units, compared to the mean of 646.6 units observed in P36-P40. This represents a sustained acceleration in demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P38 order in P42. Since on-hand inventory remains at 0 due to demand consistently outstripping incoming supply (which was ordered when demand forecasts were lower), I must continue to adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat upwards. I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the most current, accelerated demand regime (approx 693 units per period) and its associated volatility. This will increase the base stock calculation to better cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) and mitigate persistent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration continues: Mean demand for P38-P42 reached 692.6 units, a 7.1% increase over the P36-P40 average (646.6) and a 530% increase over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2656.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend. In Period 43, demand reached 791 units, and the 5-period moving average (P39-P43) has risen to approximately 715.4 units, a 3% increase over the previous 5-period average and 550% above the initial regime. However, the game is approaching its end (Period 44 of 50). Since lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, an order placed now in Period 44 will arrive during Period 48. This leaves only periods 48, 49, and 50 to utilize that stock. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the risk of being stuck with ending inventory in Period 50, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the current average of 720 units per period across the lead time + current period (1+L=5), resulting in 3600. I am using a recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to capture the high recent volatility. This approach aims to provide sufficient stock for the remaining periods while beginning to account for the game's end.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration continues: Mean demand for P39-P43 reached 715.4 units, a 3.3% increase over the P38-P42 average (692.6) and a 550% increase over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2836.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate aggressively. Period 44 saw a demand of 873 units, the highest yet. The 5-period average (P40-P44) has risen to 762.2 units, a 6.5% increase over the previous 5-period average (715.4). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since inventory is consistently stockout (ending on-hand 0 since P36), I must aggressively set parameters to catch up with this rapid growth. Using explicit methods to project the likely demand over the next 5 periods (L+1), accounting for the current growth rate. Mean demand (mu_hat) is set to 3811, which covers (1+L) periods at an average of roughly 762 units per period. Sigma_hat is set to 200 to account for the high volatility observed during this escalation phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration persists: Mean demand for P40-P44 reached 762.2 units, a 6.5% increase over the P39-P43 average (715.4) and a 593% increase over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2892.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend. In Period 45, demand reached 907 units, and the 5-period moving average (P41-P45) is approximately 804.8 units, which is a 5.6% increase over the P40-P44 average (762.2). The current inventory remains at 0 on-hand, indicating that arriving supply is still being immediately exhausted. To catch up with this rapid growth and account for the 4-period lead time (L=4), I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5. This focuses the base stock calculation on the most recent high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat reflects the approximately 805 units/period average seen in the last 5 cycles (totaling ~4025 units over L+1). Similarly, sigma_hat will use N=5 to capture the recent volatility. This aggressive replenishment strategy is necessary to mitigate the persistent stockouts observed as we approach the end of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration persists: Mean demand for P41-P45 reached 804.8 units, a 5.6% increase over the P40-P44 average (762.2) and a 631% increase over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3092.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. Demand in Period 46 reached 968 units, and the 5-period average (P42-P46) has climbed to 851.6 units, a 6.1% increase over the previous 5-period average (P41-P45: 802.4). We remain in a state of persistent stockouts because the supply pipeline, while full, is delivering orders placed 4 periods ago when demand expectations were significantly lower. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To capture this aggressive growth and provide the OR backend with the necessary targets to eventually overcome the supply lag, I will shift the \u03bc\u0302 (demand forecast) and \u03c3\u0302 (volatility) to reflect the most recent 5-period window (N=5). This focuses the base-stock calculation on the current peak and the high volatility associated with this acceleration, helping to set a higher base stock level for the internal ordering logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration persists: Mean demand for P42-P46 reached 851.6 units, a 6.1% increase over the P41-P45 average and a 674% increase over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Profit: $2660.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2660.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly. The mean demand for the most recent 5 periods (P43-P47) is approximately 900 units, a 18% increase over the P40-P44 average (762 units) and a significant rise from the previous period's assessment. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as evidenced by P43's order arriving in P47). Because arriving orders (placed 4 periods ago) consistently underperform relative to current demand, on-hand inventory remains at 0 with high lost sales. To mitigate this supply lag, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-growth regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and will set L to 'calculate' to rely on the stable 4-period historical average. This parameter set will force the OR backend to raise the base stock level significantly to account for the ~900 unit/period demand rate across the (L+1) exposure window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration persists: Mean demand for P43-P47 reached 899.2 units, a 17.9% increase over the P40-P44 average (762.2) and a 717% increase over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3168.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its significant upward trajectory. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P44-P48) is 949.6 units, reflecting a 24.6% increase over the previous 5-period average (762.2) and a staggering 763% increase over the initial regime. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, as incoming shipments (sized 4 periods ago) are consistently insufficient to meet contemporary demand levels. Given the game concludes at Period 50, and our lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 49) will arrive in Period 53, which is beyond the game horizon. However, to maintain the required service level within the simulation's logic and maximize potential reward in Period 49 and 50 based on current trends, I will capture the latest acceleration in parameters. The mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to focus on the most recent, highest demand regime (avg ~950). Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same window to address the increased volatility associated with these higher volumes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration persists: Mean demand for P44-P48 reached 949.6 units, a 24.6% increase over the P40-P44 average (762.2) and a 763% increase over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3640.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly. The most recent 5-period mean (P45-P49) is 1014.4 units, which is a significant increase over the previous period's 5-period mean of 949.6 units (+6.8%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The inventory position is currently 0 with a large pipeline, but since demand is increasing faster than the 4-period lead-time arrivals can compensate, I am using an explicit forecast for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * 1050 = 5 * 1050 = 5250, anticipating continued growth. Sigma_hat is set to 250 (roughly 111 * sqrt(5)) to account for the increasing volatility observed during this escalation phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration persists: Mean demand for P45-P49 reached 1014.4 units, a 6.8% increase over the P44-P48 average and a 822% increase over the initial regime (110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
