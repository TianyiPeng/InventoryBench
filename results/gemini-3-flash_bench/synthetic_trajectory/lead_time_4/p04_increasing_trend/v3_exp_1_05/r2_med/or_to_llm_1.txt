The average demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is approximately 317 units. The last period (P25) recorded 346 units. The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically driven by the large pipeline (1030 units) and its reliance on older, lower demand averages, which fails to account for the current high-burn rate.\n3. **Inventory & Pipeline Evaluation**: \n   - On-hand: 234 units.\n   - In-transit (Pipeline): 1030 units.\n   - ETAs (based on 4-period LT): Period 26 (from P22: 300 units), Period 27 (from P23: 180 units), Period 28 (from P24: 250 units), Period 29 (from P25: 300 units).\n4. **Strategy**: Target coverage for the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Total projected demand over 5 periods (at ~320 units/period) is ~1600 units. Total current position (On-hand + Pipeline) is 234 + 1030 = 1264 units. There is a deficit of approximately 336 units to safely cover the next 5 periods at current demand levels.
