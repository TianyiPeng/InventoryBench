Historical demand samples (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) show an upward trend with a mean of approximately 116 units. Given the trend, I'll project a slightly higher average demand of 125 units per period. Target inventory for 5 periods is 125 * 5 = 625 units. Since on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0, I will place an initial order of 625 units to build the pipeline.",

A pipeline target of approximately 4,100 units (820 units * 5 periods) is appropriate to ensure service levels and rebuild safety stock. Subtracting current pipeline (3059) from target (4100) suggests an order of ~1041 units.
