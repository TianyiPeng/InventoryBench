Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no historical conclusion to observe yet. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Historical demand samples (P1-P5: 103, 81, 107, 127, 160) show an upward trend. The mean of these 5 samples is 115.6, and the standard deviation is approximately 29.5. To account for the visible growth in demand (from ~100 to 160), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture this recent behavior rather than just the default. With L=4, we need to cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Using N=5 for both mu and sigma will allow the backend to use the provided samples effectively. No lead time data is available yet, so L will remain at 'default' (promised).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 165 units was placed with a promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. As per the sequence, since L=4, we do not expect this order to arrive until Period 5 (arrival resolution) and be visible in the Period 6 start observation. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (including Period 1 data from the game history) is [103, 81, 107, 127, 160] and the most recent demand in Period 1 was 123. The average demand across these 6 samples is approximately 116.8. Since there is no clear regime shift yet, I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat which utilizes all historical data. For L, I will use 'default' (promised L=4) as no actual lead time data has been concluded yet. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Due to the 4-period lead time, no orders have arrived yet (P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5, P2 in Period 6). We are currently experiencing stockouts (0 sales for P1 and P2 despite demand). The historical demand for periods 1-5 is provided as [103, 81, 107, 127, 160]. Since we are at Period 3, we have seen P1 and P2 demand (103, 81) which aligns closely with the provided statistics. There is a clear upward trend in the demand data provided for periods 1-5 (moving from ~100 to 160). I will use the recent_N method with N=2 to capture the early mean, as we expect demand to grow. Given the stockout situation and high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), it is critical to ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5 periods). I will keep L at the promised 4 periods as there is no evidence yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (deciding for Period 5). The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1 arrive during Period (1+4)=5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (read at Period 6). Therefore, the zero arrivals in Periods 1-3 are expected. Demand for the first five periods (historical + context) has been [103, 81, 107, 127, 160], showing a clear upward trend (mean ~116; recent demand is significantly higher). We currently have 0 on-hand and 508 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4). To ensure we cover the (L+1) window, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat to capture the rising demand trend, and use the default lead time (L=4) until an actual arrival confirms a drift.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (165 units) should arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution phase) and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet, which is expected given L=4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is [103, 81, 107, 127, 160]. There is a visible upward trend in demand over the last three periods (107 -> 127 -> 160). Period 5 demand (160) is significantly higher than the initial average. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this recent growth while maintaining a stable lead time expectation of 4. Since the OR backend targets a service level based on profit ($19) and holding cost ($1), it will naturally aim for a high base-stock to avoid stockouts during the lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1435.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The first shipment ordered in Period 1 (165 units) arrived in Period 5 after a lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. This arrival resulted in an ending on-hand inventory of 85 units. Total units in-transit currently stands at 499 (the sum of orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Historical demand over the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) ranges from 81 to 160. Specifically, looking at the game history only, demand has been [123, 91, 119, 137, 80], averaging approximately 110 units per period. There is no clear evidence yet of a regime shift or seasonality, so I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current mean and standard deviation. Setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Reviewing history: Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current inventory is 103 on-hand with 392 in-transit. Demand samples (excluding first 5 provided in prompt): P1=123, P2=91, P3=119, P4=137, P5=80, P6=143. Mean demand is approx 115.5. Total pipeline (OH + In-transit) = 495. Target coverage should be (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 * 115.5 = 577.5. The OR engine needs L=4. Demand shows a slight upward trend in variance but the mean is relatively stable around 110-120. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and default for L as it matches the promised lead time.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. Historical demand for the first 7 periods (103, 81, 107, 127, 160, 143, 122 - including pre-game samples) shows no significant regime shift, averaging approximately 120 units per period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from P1, P2, and P3 arriving in P5, P6, and P7 respectively. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 367, consisting of orders from P4 (138), P5 (18), P6 (54), and P7 (157). On-hand inventory is 163. Total coverage (163+367=530) is close to our target of roughly 600 units (5 * 120). I will use 'default' for L (4 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand mean and volatility to capture the most recent behavior while smoothing out noise.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of the game history confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). The promised lead time of 4 is accurate. Looking at demand, the most recent 8 periods show values: 123, 91, 119, 137, 80, 143, 122, 97. The mean of these samples is 114. Since the lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using the mean of all available history (8 samples), the projected demand (mu_hat) for 5 periods is approximately 570. The current inventory position is 570 (On-hand: 204 + In-transit: 366). The pipeline is currently balanced with the expected demand. I will use the 'default' method for L (which is 4) and use 'recent_N' with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the variance and mean of the observed demand history while maintaining stability.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a stable environment. The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P9). Historical demand across 9 periods shows a mean of approximately 118.2. There is no evidence of a demand regime shift or seasonality at this stage, so 'default' methods (using all available history) are appropriate for balancing the 95% service level target (implied by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio) against holding costs. The Current In-transit (431) reflects the tail of the order pipeline, and the current on-hand (73) with incoming arrivals should cover the demand for the next lead time window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2413.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the SKU went out of stock because demand (182) exceeded the starting on-hand plus arrival (127). The history confirms a consistent lead time of 4 periods. Since P5, demand has trended slightly higher, averaging approximately 139 units (P5-P10) compared to 118 units (P1-P4). Total demand from P1 to P10 averages 125 units. To prevent future stockouts, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to capture this higher mean of 139 units/period across the (L+1) horizon. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=10) to reflect overall variability. Inventory currently shows 0 on-hand with 536 in-transit; the backend will order up to the base stock level which covers 5 periods of demand. No new regime shifts are confirmed yet, but demand volatility is noted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2743.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (Periods 5-11) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a recent upward trend: while the initial samples averaged ~105, the last 6 periods (P6-P11) have averaged approximately 139.7 units per period. Specifically, Period 10 saw a spike to 182, causing a stockout. My current on-hand inventory is very low (12 units), but there are 558 units in transit. Given L=4, my base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent 6 periods to calculate mu_hat (N=6) captures the elevated demand levels better than the full history. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on these parameters and order enough to cover the pipeline gap, keeping service levels high against the backdrop of recent growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 6: average demand increased from ~105 to ~140 (+33%).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand data confirms a regime shift that began around Period 6. From Period 1 to 5, average demand was approximately 110. From Period 6 to 12, the average demand increased to approximately 145, with higher volatility (observed values reaching up to 182). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a high stockout risk as demand (177 in P12) is exceeding arrivals. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To address the increased demand and restore service levels, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering the periods since the shift at P6). This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that factors in the current higher demand mean (~145) and the increased variance, aiming for a base stock approximately covering 5 periods of demand (L+1). L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 is being consistently met.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (Periods 6-13) has shifted higher, averaging ~149 units per period, compared to the initial average of ~105. Our Carry-over insights flag a regime shift at Period 6. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 13). However, we have experienced stockouts in Periods 10, 12, and 13 because the pipeline inventory ordered during the lower-demand era was insufficient for the new regime. To stabilize service levels, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (covering the higher-demand regime from Period 6 to 13). This allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level reflecting the current demand mean of ~149 and its associated volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at the default (promised) value of 4 periods, as it is stable.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 for the third consecutive period due to a sustained demand surge. Historical demand shows a clear shift: Periods 1-5 averaged ~105, while Periods 6-14 averaged ~155, with more recent peaks exceeding 200. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current pipeline (in-transit) is 695 units, which covers approximately 4.5 periods of the current high demand (~155/period). To ensure we return to a healthy service level and cover the (L+1)=5 period horizon, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods and mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the regime change since Period 6). This will calculate mu_hat based on the elevated average demand of approximately 155 per period, totaling ~775 for the horizon, which allows the OR backend to properly evaluate if the current pipeline is sufficient or if a further top-up is required to avoid persistent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6 confirmed: avg increased from 105 to 155 (+47%), with recent surges exceeding 200 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3401.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 731 units. Reviewing the history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 6, demand has undergone a significant regime shift, increasing from an initial average of ~105 to approximately 172 units over the last 10 periods (P6-P15). Recent samples (P13: 177, P14: 216, P15: 187) suggest a further acceleration, with the last 3 periods averaging ~193.3 units. We need to ensure the base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) reflects this higher demand regime to mitigate the stockouts observed in periods 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the post-shift demand mean while smoothing the recent volatility, and default settings for lead time and sigma.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3553.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher regime starting around Period 10, frequently exceeding 180 units and reaching over 210 units recently. Since Period 12, there has been a consistent stockout (sold < demand), indicating that our current inventory position and in-transit orders are insufficient to meet this elevated demand. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. To address the stockouts, I am increasing the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N (N=7, covering Periods 10-16) to capture this new mean (~186 units per period). Multiplied by (1+L)=5, this targets a base stock level that accounts for the current demand surge. I am also increasing sigma_hat using the same recent window to ensure the OR backend increases safety stock (z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) to protect against the high volatility observed in the latest periods (182 to 217).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 10-16 average demand is approximately 186 units, up from the previous estimate of 155, with a standard deviation increase reflecting higher volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3686.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level, with the average demand from Period 10 to 17 being approximately 188.6 units. This is a significant increase from the initial game history mean (~105), and recent periods show consistent demand around or above 200. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 785 units. In-transit orders from P14 (135), P15 (215), P16 (208), and P17 (227) are expected to arrive in Periods 18, 19, 20, and 21 respectively, based on a confirmed stable lead time of 4 periods. Since the current demand regime (P10-P17) shows higher mean and volatility, I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock levels are calculated using the most relevant data. The backend OR will handle the (1+L) scaling for the total exposure period (lead time + review period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 10-17 stabilized at an average of ~189 units per period, consistently higher than initial 105 (+80%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2565.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 10. The average demand from Period 10 to 18 is approximately 194 units (Demands: 182, 145, 177, 177, 216, 187, 217, 198, 245), with notable growth in recent periods (245 in P18). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current 'On-hand' is 0, and we have been hitting stockouts consistently (sold < demand) because the pipeline wasn't aggressive enough for this new regime. To rectify this, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the entirety of this high-demand regime (starting P10). This will calculate the forecast based on the mean (~194) and standard deviation of these recent 9 samples, adjusted for the 1+L lead time window (5 periods). Using 'recent_N' instead of 'explicit' allows the OR backend to handle the standard deviation calculation automatically while focusing on the relevant data subset.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 10-18 stabilized at an average of ~194 units per period (previously ~189), confirming sustained higher demand and high stockout risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4085.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant escalation. Recent demand in Period 19 reached a peak of 301 units, continuing a sustained upward trend that began around Period 10. The average demand from Period 10 to Period 19 is now ~205 units, compared to the initial ~105. Despite arrivals of ~215 units in Period 19, the ending on-hand inventory is 0 because demand exceeded supply. Every order since Period 13 has resulted in a stockout. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent and verified. To address the stockout risk and accommodate the new demand regime (approx. 205 units/period), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher mean. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the increased volatility observed during this high-demand period. L remains at the default promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed: Period 10-19 average demand is ~205 units, a 95% increase from the initial baseline, with recent peak demand reaching 301 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3952.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift, stabilizing into a high-demand regime starting around Period 10. The average demand from Period 10 to Period 20 is approximately 213 units, with the most recent two periods (P19 and P20) surging to 301 and 296 units respectively. The current on-hand inventory is 0, indicating a persistent stockout condition despite consistent arrivals based on a 4-period lead time. To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) with N=11 to capture the entirety of this high-demand regime (P10-P20). The standard deviation (sigma_hat) will also use N=11 to reflect the increased volatility seen in this period. The lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 10-20 has stabilized at an average of ~213 units per period (previously ~205), with recent peak volatility maintaining demand near 300 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4313.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Starting from Period 10, demand surged from an average of ~105 to over 200 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P17-P21) show demand levels of 198, 245, 301, 296, and 307 (average ~269). Using the last 12 periods (P10-P21) as the current regime (N=12), the average demand is ~221 units. However, given the clear upward trend where the last three periods are around 300, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this higher recent mean (L+1 * ~270) to prevent further stockouts. The inventory is currently 0, and we have been stockouting consistently since Period 12, meaning on-hand inventory is exhausted every period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to 1350 (i.e., 5 periods * 270) and using a high recent sigma to handle the volatility is necessary to recover from the service level deficit.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P17-P21) shows a shift towards an average of ~270 units per period, with peaks consistently exceeding 300 units; previously estimated average was ~213.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of significant upward shifts. Looking at recent history, the demand regime from Period 17 to Period 22 shows a mean of 282 units (values: 198, 245, 301, 296, 307, 283). The current stock situation is critical; 'On-hand' is 0, and we have been consistently selling out, indicating that demand likely exceeds the recorded 'sold' units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistent in all 'conclude' messages. To capture this recent intensification of demand and aggressive growth, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to prioritize the most current market regime (P17-P22). This will calculate a base stock covering the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=5 periods) using an average demand of approximately 282 units/period, adjusted for the observed high volatility.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P17-P22) confirmed with an average of 282 units per period (previously ~270 estimate); sales are consistently capped by inventory availability (stockouts in 13 consecutive periods).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a severe demand surge. In Period 23, demand reached 342, the highest observed yet, and sales have been capped by inventory for 14 consecutive periods. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current average demand for the most recent regime (P17-P23) is approximately 291 units per period (up from the previous estimate of 282). Due to continuous stockouts, the true demand potential is likely even higher than the observed sold units or captured demand metrics. To recover inventory levels and meet this elevated demand across the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), I will set mu_hat explicitly based on the new regime mean (~291 * 5 = 1455). Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' over the last 7 periods to capture the heightened volatility associated with this surge. This strategy aims to force the OR backend toward a higher base stock to end the stockout streak.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P17-P23) average has risen to ~291 units per period (previously ~282); stockouts have occurred for 14 consecutive periods, suggesting true demand may be higher.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of significant upward shifts. Since Period 17, the SKU has entered a high-demand regime, with an average demand of approximately 307 units per period (P17: 198, P18: 245, P19: 301, P20: 296, P21: 307, P22: 283, P23: 342, P24: 308). The last 15 periods (P10-P24) have all ended in stockouts due to actual demand consistently exceeding arriving supply, which was based on older, lower forecasts. Lead time has been stable at 4 periods. To prevent further lost sales, mu_hat must represent the current regime. Setting N=8 for mu_hat (P17-P24) provides an average of 285 units per period, which when multiplied by (1+L) = 5 periods, results in a base stock target that accounts for the most recent surge. Volatility (sigma_hat) is also increasing, so N=8 is used to capture the standard deviation of this recent period.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P17-P24) average is ~285 units per period (previously ~291), with demand consistently constrained by supply (15 consecutive stockouts).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has been in a severe stockout state for 16 consecutive periods (P10-P25) because historical orders were based on a demand level that has since shifted upward. Demand has structurally increased from an initial ~100 units to a range between 280-350 units. Specifically, the period 17-25 window shows an average demand constrained by supply of ~285, but recent unconstrained demand signals (P23-P25) are consistently above 340. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a large pipeline (1294 units), the priority is to maintain a base stock that accounts for this higher demand regime (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat to capture the regime starting around Period 17, and set L to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=9 to reflect the increased volatility in this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 17 has stabilized at a higher level; Period 17-25 average demand is ~314 units (unconstrained demand often exceeds 340), representing a 200% increase from the initial baseline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward shifts, currently stabilizing in a high-demand regime that started around Period 17. From Period 17 to Period 26, the average observed demand is approximately 314 units, though actual demand is likely higher as sales have been inventory-constrained (starting on-hand was less than demand) for 17 consecutive periods. In Period 26, demand reached 372 units, and the arrival of 360 units (the largest so far) was immediately exhausted. To address this sustained growth and high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to focus on this latest regime (P17-P26), and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the increased volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (4) as arrivals are consistent with the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 17 remains active and supply-constrained; Period 17-26 average observed demand is ~314 units, with recent peak reaching 372. Stockouts have occurred for 17 consecutive periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6498.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently supply-constrained for 18 consecutive periods. The latest observed demand in Period 27 was 394 units, and the average observed demand since the most recent regime shift (Period 17 to 27) is approximately 312 units. However, because sales are frequently equal to the arrived inventory, true latent demand is likely even higher. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($19 vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat explicitly based on the recent peak demand trend. I'll use a forecast of ~370 units per period to ensure the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 periods, or 5 periods of demand) is robust against recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 17 continues to escalate; Period 27 demand reached 394 units. Observed average (P17-P27) is 312 units, but actual demand is likely ~370+ due to 18 consecutive periods of stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6726.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of significant upward shifts. Since Period 17, the observed demand has consistently exceeded 300 units, frequently reaching near 400 (394 in Period 27, 380 in Period 28). We have experienced 19 consecutive periods where ending inventory was zero, meaning 'sold' units represent the supply arrival rather than true demand. The unconstrained demand is likely between 370 and 420 units. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 2100 (which is (1+L=5) * 420) to ensure the base stock calculation targets the top end of this regime. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=12, covering the Period 17 shift) to capture the increased volatility of the high-demand state. Lead time L is held at the promised value of 4 as deliveries remain consistent. This aggressive posture is necessary to break the stockout cycle and maximize profit, as the $19 profit far outweighs the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Significant sustained demand increase: Period 24-28 average observed demand reflects unconstrained demand levels potentially exceeding 400 units, continuing the growth trend observed since Period 17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4522.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a massive structural shift. Period 29 conclude shows demand at 374, following a peak of 394 in P27. Since Period 17, we have been in a chronic stockout state (19 consecutive periods), meaning 'sold' units are simply 'arrived' units, not actual demand. True demand is consistently exceeding 380-400 units. To stop the cycle of stockouts and maximize profit ($19 vs $1 holding), we must aggressively increase the base stock. The current 'In-transit' of 1695 includes larger orders from P26-P29, but since lead time is fixed at 4 periods, we must set parameters that reflect the current high-demand regime (approx. 400 units/period). I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat based on (1+L)*400 = (1+4)*400 = 2000. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the increased volatility of this higher regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 19 consecutive periods of stockouts (P10-P29); true demand is significantly under-represented by sales data. Unconstrained demand is estimated at 380-420 units per period based on P26-P29 observations.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe and prolonged stockout state, with 20 consecutive periods (P10-P30) where sales were capped by arrivals. Period 30 demand reached 450, while only 336 units arrived. The latest four periods of demand (P27-P30) are 394, 380, 374, and 450, averaging 399.5 units. Because supply consistently fails to meet demand, the true unconstrained demand mean is likely at or above 400. To break the stockout cycle and properly account for this higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 2010 (representing a forecast of 402 units per period over the 1+L=5 period window). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Setting sigma_hat explicitly to 110 (approx. sqrt(5) * 50) to account for increased volatility observed in recent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: unconstrained demand mean estimated at ~400 units (observed P27-P30 avg: 399.5), continuing the significant upward trend from the initial 105 baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7277.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently under-forecasted, resulting in stockouts for 21 consecutive periods (P10-P31). Recent data (P27-P31) shows observed starting on-hand/sales at 383, 354, 238, 336, and 383, but these values were capped by what arrived, not actual demand. The recorded demands for P30 and P31 were 450 and 444, respectively. This confirms a new regime starting around Period 27/28 where unconstrained demand is significantly higher, likely averaging ~400-450. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To aggressively address the supply gap and the under-representation of demand in the OR backend's default calculations (which are based on sales, not total demand), I am using 'explicit' methods to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1) at a projected average of 450 units/period (5 * 450 = 2250). sigma_hat is set to 150 to reflect the high volatility (approx 65-70 per period across 5 periods). This will raise the base stock level significantly to bridge the persistent inventory deficit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28: Unconstrained demand now averages ~440-450 units (confirmed by P30-31 demands of 450 and 444), up from the previous ~400 estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8778.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a further significant increase. Observed demand in Period 32 was 528 units, following values of 450 and 444 in previous periods. This confirms that the demand regime is accelerating beyond the previous estimate of 440-450. The current 3-period average (P30-P32) is approximately 474 units. Given that stockouts have occurred in every period since Period 10, the observed demand represents a floor rather than the true unconstrained demand. To prevent further lost sales and capture the true demand potential, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to 2500, which represents a forecast of 500 units per period over the 5-period window (L+1, where L=4). I am setting sigma_hat with 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the increased volatility during this growth phase. The lead time L remains stable at 4 periods based on historical evidence.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: Unconstrained demand now averages ~500 units per period (P32 demand: 528), continuing the strong upward trend from previous levels.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. Recent unconstrained demands are Period 32 (528) and Period 33 (534), confirming a new regime shift around Period 32 with an average of approximately 530 units per period. This follows a clear upward trend from P1 (105) through multiple levels (186, 314, 400, 440). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With stockouts occurring in 23 of the last 24 periods, the priority is to aggressively increase the base stock level to capture this growth. I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to an explicit value based on the most recent demand level (~530 units/period) multiplied by (1+L) where L=4, totaling 2650. I am also increasing sigma_hat to reflect the higher standard deviation seen in higher demand regimes. Current in-transit (1997) is significantly below the required level for a 5-period horizon at 530 units/period, so the OR backend will trigger a large corrective order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: Unconstrained demand now averages ~530 units per period (confirmed by P32: 528 and P33: 534), up from the previous ~500 estimate.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate significantly. Based on the most recent observations from Period 32 to 34, demand has reached a new regime averaging approximately 535 units (P32: 528, P33: 534, P34: 543). The system has consistently stocked out for 24 consecutive periods (P10-P34), indicating that sales only reflect available inventory rather than true market potential. To prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 2700 units, which covers 5 periods (L+1) at a projected unconstrained demand of 540 units per period. I am also increasing sigma_hat using 'explicit' to 150 to account for higher volatility observed during this rapid growth phase. The lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32 confirmed: average unconstrained demand now approximately 535-545 units per period (P32-P34 observations), continuing a significant upward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7239.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. Recent observations from Period 32 to 35 show unconstrained demand values of 528, 534, 543, and 519, confirming a new regime stabilization above 530 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a significant pipeline of 2457 units. Given the 4-period lead time, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Based on the most recent 4 periods of unconstrained demand, the average is approximately 531 units. To account for the continuing growth trend and ensure high service levels where profit ($19) vastly outweighs holding cost ($1), mu_hat is set to (1+L) * 545 = 2725. This proactive adjustment aim to break the long streak of stockouts and capture the full projected demand including potential further growth. The lead time L is maintained at the confirmed stable value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 32 is confirmed with an average of ~530 units (P32-P35 avg: 531), representing a significant and sustained increase from previous levels.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, showing a sustained upward trend. Starting from Period 32, demand has consistently been above 500 units, with the most recent observation in Period 36 reaching 567 units. This confirms the new demand regime identified in the carry-over insights. Since Period 10, the system has faced near-constant stockouts (26 consecutive periods where ending inventory was 0 or units sold matched on-hand inventory), meaning recorded 'demand' is often just a reflection of available supply rather than true market demand. To catch up and maintain service levels, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect an average demand of 560 units per period (multiplied by L+1). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility observed during this growth phase (approx 30 units per period, scaled).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 32 has reached a new peak; Period 36 demand of 567 units suggests the previous estimate of 530 is now too low. New growth floor appears to be ~560 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11476.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb rapidly. Period 37 saw a demand of 626 units, confirming the previous upward trend observed since Period 32. The average demand from Period 32 to 37 is approximately 552.8 units (528, 534, 543, 519, 567, 626). However, the most recent observation of 626 suggests that the 'floor' or new mean is likely higher, around 580-600 units. To prevent further stockouts (which have occurred for 28 consecutive periods), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to reflect a conservative forecast of 600 units per period over the 1+L (5 period) horizon. Sigma_hat is set using recent_6 to capture the increased volatility of this growth phase. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 32 has escalated again; Period 37 demand of 626 units indicates a new mean of ~580-600 units, significantly up from the previous estimate of 530-560.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a potent upward trend. Period 38 saw a demand of 637, following 626 and 567, confirming that the average has shifted to approximately 600-610 units. We have encountered nearly continuous stockouts (or ending inventory near zero) for 29 consecutive periods, indicating that we are still chasing demand rather than leading it. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the priority is ensuring sufficient stock to meet this aggressive growth. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value based on the current mean of ~610 across the lead time + current period (L+1=5), totaling 3050. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to account for the increasing volatility observed during this escalation phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 37 has shifted to a new mean of ~610 units (P37 demand: 626, P38 demand: 637), representing a sustained upward trend from the previous 530-580 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12445.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate significantly. Based on observations from Period 37-39 (626, 637, 679), the previous mean estimate of ~610 is now trailing actual demand. The most recent demand of 679 units represents a clear shift to a new regime with a mean likely around 650-680 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 38 and 39 demand data are the most representative of the current upward trajectory, I am using an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~670 units per period. With L=4, mu_hat = (1+4) * 670 = 3350. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the increased volatility of this latest growth phase while allowing the OR backend to maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: Demand has reached a new level, with Period 39 demand at 679 units (avg P37-P39: 647). New expected mean is approximately 650-680 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5814.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate significantly. Period 40 demand reached 694 units, surpassing the previous period's peak and cementing a new demand regime. The average demand from Period 37 to Period 40 is approximately 659 units (626, 637, 679, 694). Given this consistent upward trajectory and the fact that 29 of the last 31 periods resulted in stockouts (meaning true demand is likely even higher than observed sales), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect an expected per-period demand of 700 units. Over the (L+1) horizon of 5 periods, this totals 3500 units. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for high volatility and to maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40: Demand has consistently grown, reaching 694 units (avg P37-P40: 659). True unconstrained demand is estimated at 700+ units as stockouts continue to persist in 29 of the last 31 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11590.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. Period 41 demand reached 734 units, consistent with the trend observed since Period 37. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 674 units, but the most recent observation of 734 suggests a shift towards a mean of 720-750. With 30 stockouts in the last 32 periods, historical sales data significantly underrepresents actual demand. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 750 (where L=4, so 5 * 750 = 3750) to account for this rapid growth and prevent further lost sales. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to accommodate the increasing volatility and the risk of further demand spikes as we approach the end of the simulation. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns (e.g., P37 order arrived in P41).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41: Unconstrained demand mean has increased to approximately 720-750 units (P41 demand: 734), continuing the sustained upward trend. Stockouts have occurred in 30 of the last 32 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12635.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend, largely unconstrained except for brief moments of inventory availability. Recent periods show demand levels hitting 734 (P41) and 719 (P42), following a growth trajectory from ~530 to ~700+ units. Stockouts have occurred in 31 of the last 33 periods, meaning observed 'sold' units are simply 'maximum available'. Consequently, the true demand mean is likely higher than the recent observed average. To counteract the consistent stockouts and capture the escalating trend, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 4000 (roughly 800 units/period * 5 periods), which allows the OR backend to target a higher base stock level relative to the lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for high volatility during this growth phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent concluded shipments (P37 order arrived P41; P38 order arrived P42).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: Unconstrained demand mean continues to rise, now estimated at 750-800 units (up from 720-750) given recent demands of 734 and 719 despite persistent stockouts. Trend shows no sign of plateauing.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14402.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with Period 43 demand reaching 791 units. Since Period 40, demand has consistently been above 690 units, and the last three periods (P41-P43) averaged 748 units. Persistent stockouts (occurring in 32 of the last 34 periods) indicate that actual unconstrained demand is likely at or above the 800-unit mark. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend policy naturally targets a high service level. To account for the sustained upward trajectory and ensure we minimize lost sales in the remaining 7 periods, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 4250. This is calculated as (L+1) * 850, where 850 represents my conservative estimate for unconstrained demand in the upcoming window, considering the trend. Sigma_hat is set to 250 (approx. 110 * sqrt(5)) to account for the increasing volatility observed alongside the volume growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43: Unconstrained demand mean continues to climb, now estimated at 800-850 units based on P43 demand of 791 and total depletion of available stock (758 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $13623.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with Period 44 demand reaching 873 units, far exceeding the 717 units available (resulting in a stockout). Since Period 32, demand has shown a clear upward trend without plateauing. Historical observed demands from Period 41-44 are 734, 719, 791, and 873. Given the consistent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 in 33 of the last 35 periods), the true unconstrained demand mean is likely higher than the observed sales. I am estimating the new mean demand (mu_hat) for the lead time plus review period (1+4=5 periods) at approximately 900 units per period to finally catch up with this growth and prevent further lost sales. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat (5 * 900 = 4500) and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility and the risk of under-ordering during this aggressive growth phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 44: Unconstrained demand mean has increased to approximately 850-900 units (up from 800-850) based on P44 demand of 873 and 100% depletion of arrived stock (717 units). Growth trend remains aggressive with no signs of stabilizing.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, significantly surpassing previous estimates. Period 45 demand reached 907 units, marking a clear escalation from the Period 44 demand of 873. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P43-P45) is approximately 857 units, and the single-period growth rate suggests next-period unconstrained demand will likely exceed 920-950 units. We have been in a near-continuous stockout state for over 30 periods, confirming that observed 'sold' units are simply a ceiling of available inventory, not the true demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts and capture this growth, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 4750 (representing a 5-period window forecast of ~950 units/period) and sigma_hat at 150 to account for high volatility and forecasting error. This aggressive stance is necessary as the OR backend's standard calculations would lag significantly behind this non-stationary growth trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 45: Unconstrained demand mean has increased to approximately 900-950 units (up from 850-900) based on P45 demand of 907. The growth trajectory remains steep with no evidence of saturation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18352.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, with Period 46 demand reaching 968 units. Based on recent demand values (P44: 873, P45: 907, P46: 968), the mean unconstrained demand has shifted to approximately 950-1000 units. To prevent stockouts in the final periods of the game (ending at Period 50), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 5000 units (representing (L+1) * 1000, where L=4). Although the game ends at P50 and orders placed now (P47) arrive at the arrival resolution of P51 (effectively beyond the evaluation window of P50's conclusion), I must continue to provide valid parameters as per the controller role. I maintain L at 'default' as the observed lead time is consistently 4 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for the high volatility observed during this hyper-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 46: Unconstrained demand mean has increased to approximately 950-1000 units (up from 900-950) based on Period 46 demand of 968. The growth trend remains very strong.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18116.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend, with the most recent observed demand at 957 units. Over the last three periods (P45-P47), demand has consistently ranged \u0628\u064a\u0646 907-968, indicating a new regime with a mean likely around 950-1000 units. Although there were 67 units of on-hand inventory remaining at the end of Period 47, we have faced stockouts in the vast majority of periods since Period 10, meaning historical 'demand' figures are often floors for actual unconstrained demand. To capture this rapid growth without over-lagging, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 (Periods 45, 46, 47) to focus on the current peak levels. This results in a per-period average of ~944 units. Multiplied by (1 + L) with L=4, the OR backend will target a base stock covering ~4720 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival pattern of previous orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 47: Unconstrained demand mean has stabilized at approximately 950-1000 units (P45-P47 avg: 944), up from the previous ~900-950 estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19759.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, with Period 48 showing the highest unconstrained demand yet at 1,043 units. The trend has been consistently upward since Period 32, with recent demands (P46-P48) of 968, 957, and 1,043 units, averaging approximately 990 units. While arrivals have significantly improved (1,034 units in P48), we are still operating on a razor-thin margin with only 58 units on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent stockouts in this high-growth environment, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent demand level (~990 per period). This translates to (1+L)*990 = 4,950. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher demand levels. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that accounts for both the high mean and the significant variance, ensuring high service levels during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 48: Unconstrained demand mean has reached approximately 1000-1050 units (P48 demand: 1043), continuing the sustained upward trend. Growth trajectory remains very strong.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20687.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trajectory. Period 49 demand reached 1097 units, following a clear trend: P48 (1043), P47 (957), P46 (968), and P45 (907). The average over the last 3 periods (P47-P49) is approximately 1032 units, and the last 5 periods (P45-P49) average 1014 units. Given this consistent growth, I am setting the unconstrained demand mean (mu_hat) to 1100 units per period to account for the ongoing trend and prevent further stockouts. With a lead time of 4, the OR backend requires mu_hat to represent (1+L) * single-period demand, which equals 5 * 1100 = 5500. I will use 'explicit' to ensure this specific forecast is applied. Sigma_hat is set to 150 (sqrt(5) * ~67) to account for increasing volatility at these higher demand levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 49: Unconstrained demand mean has increased to approximately 1050-1100 units based on P49 demand of 1097. Growth trajectory remains very strong and persistent.
