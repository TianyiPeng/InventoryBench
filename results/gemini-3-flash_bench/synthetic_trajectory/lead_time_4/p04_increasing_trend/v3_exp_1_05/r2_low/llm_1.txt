Historical demand from Periods 1-5 shows values of 103, 81, 107, 127, and 160, averaging approximately 116 units per period. Since I must cover demand for the lead time (4) plus the current period (1), I need to account for approximately 5 periods of demand (5 * 116 = 580 units). Given the upward trend in the last two historical periods (127, 160), I will aim for a slightly more aggressive initial order to build inventory and account for potential growth while balancing the $1 holding cost. I will order 600 units to establish a pipeline that covers the lead-time window.",

Historical demand (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) and recent game demand (123, 91) suggest a mean around 110-120 units per period. Timing & Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in P5 (visible P6). Current pipeline is 720 units (600 from P1, 120 from P2). Inventory Status: On-hand is 0, leading to lost sales since all demand must be satisfied from stock. Because the lead time is 4, I cannot address stockouts until P5. Order Logic: I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods (P3, P4, P5, P6, P7). Estimated demand for 5 periods @ 120/period = 600 units. Total pipeline (720) already exceeds the next 5 periods of expected demand. However, to maintain a rolling inventory and account for potential lead time drift or higher demand peaks (like the 160 seen in historical data), I should ensure the pipeline covers more. Since On-hand is 0 and I have a massive order of 600 arriving in P5, I will place a maintenance order to keep the pipeline moving, but I must be careful of the $1.00 holding cost which equals the profit. High holding costs penalize overstocking. Current in-transit (720) is sufficient for ~6 periods. I will order 120 more to maintain a 'one-period demand' rhythm.",

(c) Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P9 arrived P13, P10 arrived P14). (d) Inventory Assessment: On-hand is 0. In-transit is total 858 units. Pipeline schedule: P11 order (350) arriving P15 (bringing on-hand to 350 during P15 demand); P12 order (188) arriving P16; P13 order (160) arriving P17; P14 order (160) arriving P18.
