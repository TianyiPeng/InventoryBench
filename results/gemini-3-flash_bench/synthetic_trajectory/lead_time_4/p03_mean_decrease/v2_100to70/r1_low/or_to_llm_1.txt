The average demand is approximately 87.5 units per period. \n3. Pipeline Management: To cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (total 5 periods), we need roughly 5 * 87.5 = 437 units in the system. \n4. Current Pipeline: We have 149 units in-transit.

This seems conservative given the 0 on-hand inventory and the long lead time. The OR cap likely restricted the order size. Due to the urgent need to build a pipeline to avoid stockouts in periods 2-5, I will increase the order quantity.

The OR recommendation of 99 units is based on this mean and a safety stock calculation.\n4. Strategy: I will follow the OR recommendation of 99 units. While we are currently stocking out due to the lead time gap, the pipeline already contains 329 units which covers roughly 3.5 periods of future demand.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand has slightly moderated (92, 122, 85, 89, 46, 62), with an average around 88.3 units/period over the last 17 periods. 4. Strategic Assessment: Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 413. Comparing this to a 5-period (L+1) demand window (approximately 440-450 units), there is a small gap.

Inventory & Demand Analysis: Current on-hand inventory is 33 units. Demand across the last 10 periods has been stable, averaging approximately 80 units (ranging from 46 to 122). With an actual lead time (L) of 4, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Expected demand for 5 periods is ~400 units.\n3. Pipeline Check: Total stock (On-hand 33 + In-transit 328) = 361 units. To reach our target inventory position of ~400 units, a replenishment of approximately 40-50 units is needed.\n4. OR Comparison: The OR algorithm recommends 83 units based on a capped base-stock policy. However, the OR model assumes L=4 but often overreacts to the specific timing of arrivals and the slightly higher variance in the early history. Given that our Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand (safety stock factor z* = 0).

The pipeline (In-transit) is 287 units, consisting of orders from Period 42 (74 units), Period 43 (64 units), Period 44 (79 units), and Period 45 (70 units). Average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 71 units per period. The 5-period demand target (L+1) is roughly 355 units (71 * 5). Total current and expected inventory is 356 units (69 + 287). The OR recommendation is 51 units. Since the target stock level (355) is almost exactly equal to current inventory + pipeline (356), a small order is sufficient to maintain this balance for the next period's horizon.

Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning safety stock should be minimal. We are at Period 47 of 50. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P47) will arrive in Period 51 (47 + 4 = 51), which is after the game ends. Therefore, placing any order now will only incur holding costs for inventory that cannot be sold within the game's timeframe. Our current inventory position consists of 84 units on-hand and 264 units in-transit. The in-transit units are scheduled to arrive in P47 (64 units), P48 (79 units), P49 (70 units), and P50 (51 units). Total inventory available before the game concludes is 84 + 264 = 348 units. Average demand is approximately 75 units per period. Over the remaining 4 periods (47, 48, 49, 50), total expected demand is ~300 units. Since 348 > 300, we already have sufficient inventory to cover demand without stockouts, and adding more would be wasteful. Thus, I am overriding the OR recommendation of 57 and ordering 0 units.",

Since Period 52 is outside the simulation's duration (ending at 50), any order placed now will only incur potential costs or represent wasted capital without contributing to sales or reward within the game timeframe. Currently, on-hand inventory is 73 units. Looking at the 'In-transit' balance of 200 units, these consist of orders from Period 44 (79 units), Period 45 (70 units), and Period 46 (51 units), which are expected to arrive in Periods 48, 49, and 50 respectively. Specifically: Period 48 arrival (ordered P44) = 79 units; Period 49 arrival (ordered P45) = 70 units; Period 50 arrival (ordered P46) = 51 units. Given the average demand is approximately 70-80 units, the existing on-hand stock and incoming pipeline are more than sufficient to cover the final three periods (48, 49, 50).
