Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' and we have 5 historical demand samples (61, 107, 84, 144, 69) with a mean of 93.0 and a standard deviation of 33.1. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have no observation of actual lead times yet, I will use the 'default' method for L. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), the samples show some volatility but no clear trend over these 5 data points; I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent history. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand, balancing the $1.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 149 units (based on the OR backend's initial calculation given P0 start), and demand was 66. Because the promised lead time is 4 periods, no units arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0), resulting in 66 lost sales (sold=0) and 0 ending inventory. Currently, 149 units are in-transit. We have 5 historical demand samples (61, 107, 84, 144, 69) plus the Period 1 actual demand of 66. The average demand across these 6 points is approximately 88.5. Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using 'default' for L (4 periods) and 'default' for mu_hat/sigma_hat is appropriate as we have no evidence yet that the lead time or demand regime has shifted from the provided baseline samples.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. For 'chips(Regular)', orders were placed in P1 (149 units) and P2 (141 units). Total in-transit is 290. As per the timing rules, a lead time of 4 means the P1 order arrives during P5 (visible in P5 conclude, playable in P6). My current on-hand is 0, and I have missed sales in P1 (66) and P2 (117) because starting inventory was 0. I need to establish a base stock that covers demand through the lead time (L=4) plus the review period (1), total 5 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including those not yet 'concluded' in the game status but provided in the prompt) are: 61, 107, 84, 144, 69. Mean demand is ~93. Over 5 periods (1+L), expected demand is ~465. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend OR (critical ratio q = 0.5) will naturally set a conservative safety stock. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the early volatility.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 are still in transit (420 units total). Following the game mechanics, an order placed in P1 (L=4) is expected to arrive during P5's arrival resolution and be visible at the start of P6. Thus, the current on-hand inventory of 0 and arrived=0 are expected and consistent with the promised lead time. Demand across the first three periods has been 66, 117, and 122 (mean ~102). Including the provided historical samples (avg ~93), the overall mean is approximately 98. With L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using all available data (8 samples) provides a stable baseline for mu_hat and sigma_hat while we wait for the first shipment to arrive. No lead time shifts or lost orders are yet detectable.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. This arrival will only be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Therefore, seeing 0 on-hand inventory and 0 arrivals so far is expected. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 61, 107, 84, 144, 69 (average ~93). Total in-transit is 482 units (149+141+130+62), which aligns with the demand being covered for the lead time + current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since no orders have reached the 'conclude' phase yet, I will maintain the default lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use all 5 available samples to establish a baseline, as there is no clear evidence of a regime shift yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 66, 117, 122, 92, 93 (Mean: 98). The promised lead time is 4. In Period 5, we observed the first arrival from the order placed in Period 1, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. My on-hand inventory is 56, and in-transit is 333 (orders from P2, P3, P4). Since the lead time is 4, demand across the (L+1) horizon (5 periods) needs to be covered. The mean demand is approximately 98. Thus, mu_hat should be around 5 * 98 = 490. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(5) * std(66, 117, 122, 92, 93) \u2248 2.23 * 22.3 \u2248 49.8. I will use the 'default' method for L as the promised lead time holds. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most relevant demand statistics since the start of the simulation.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have 104 units on-hand and 293 in transit. Looking at the history, orders from Period 1 and Period 2 arrived exactly as promised after 4 periods (arriving in Period 5 and Period 6 respectively). This confirms the lead time L=4 is reliable. Demand history shows values ranging from 66 to 122, with the most recent two periods stable at 93. Given the sample size is small (6 periods of observed demand), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the mean demand while smoothing out the early volatility. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' (all samples) to ensure we account for the higher demand seen in Period 3 (122) and Period 2 (117) to maintain a safety buffer, especially since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%. The current pipeline (104 + 293 = 397) is roughly 4 periods of demand, which aligns with covering (L+1) periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-98.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistent with the promised 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). Demand has been relatively stable with a slight decrease in the most recent period. Mean demand over the last 7 periods is approximately 93 units. With the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current on-hand is 166 units and in-transit is 283 units (from orders in P4, P6, and P7), totaling 449 units of pipeline inventory. Given profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level is 50%, meaning the base stock should roughly equal the expected demand over the lead time. I will use a 5-period window for demand mean and volatility to capture recent behavior while maintaining L=4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 ordered arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand remains stable with a historical mean of ~93 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of concluded periods (P5-P8) confirms the lead time is exactly the promised 4 periods (all orders arrived with lead_time=4). Historical demand mean from P1-P8 is approximately 96.75 units, but the last 4 periods show a slightly lower mean of 94.25 units. The current on-hand inventory is 105, with 240 units in transit (orders from P6, P7, and P8). To cover the lead time (L=4) and the current review period, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 captures the full demand profile while respecting the confirmed lead time stability. The OR engine will use these parameters to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, demand spiked to 150 units, resulting in a stockout (ending on-hand=0). Based on the history, actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P4 arrived P8). No order was placed in Period 5, explaining the arrived=0 in Period 9. The current in-transit inventory (374 units) represents orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9. The next arrival (P6's order of 101 units) will occur during Period 10's resolution but is not yet available to meet today's demand. Average demand across all 9 periods is approximately 102.6 units, but recent periods (P8, P9) show an upward trend (123, 150). Given profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level (z=0). I will use a recent N=4 for mu_hat to capture the elevated demand level (averaging ~108.5 units) while maintaining the default L=4. This ensures the target base stock covers 5 periods of demand (L+1) to reach the next arrival cycle effectively.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing: Period 8-9 saw an average of 136.5 units vs earlier mean of ~90 units. Stockout occurred in Period 9 due to a missing order cycle in Period 5 combined with high demand.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P6 order arrived in P10). However, the system skipped ordering in Period 5, which caused the stockout in Period 9 and continues to strain inventory levels. Demand has shown increased volatility starting around Period 8; while Period 10 was lower (72), the mean of the last 6 periods (P5-P10) is approximately 100 units, compared to the earlier mean of 93. Given the Lead Time (L=4) and the current period (L+1=5), we need to cover demand for 5 periods (~500 units). Current inventory position is 29 on-hand + 430 in-transit = 459 units, which is slightly below the required coverage. I will set mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand mean of ~100 per period (500 total for L+1) using a recent_N approach to adjust for the structural shift in demand volatility observed since Period 8.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 7 order in Period 11. Demand has shown significant volatility; while the long-term average is approx 99 units, recent periods (P8-P9) peaked as high as 150 units, followed by a dip to 72 in P10. The stockout in P9 was primarily caused by the lack of an order in P5 and high demand, but the pipeline is now well-populated (351 units in-transit). I will set L to 4 (promised) as it is consistently observed. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher demand variance (avg ~106 units) while smoothing out the volatility. I will use a larger sigma_hat (recent_N=7) to account for the increased standard deviation seen in the last few cycles to maintain a buffer against further spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains volatile post-Period 8: average demand from P8-P11 is 109.5 units compared to the initial 93 units, with a peak of 150 (P9) and a trough of 72 (P10).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 13 units. An order was placed in Period 9 (134 units) and, with the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, it is expected to arrive during Period 13 resolution, becoming visible at the start of Period 14. This will resolve the immediate low stock. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, and P12 arrivals all confirm L=4). Demand analysis: While Period 10-12 saw lower demand (72, 93, 62), the period from P8-P12 shows a higher variance and an average of approximately 92, which is close to the long-term stable mean of ~94. However, Period 9 had a significant spike (150). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level (q=0.5). To ensure we cover the lead time + review period (5 periods) considering the recent volatility, I will use a recent window of 5 periods (P8-P12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime's mean and higher variance.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13). The missing arrival in Period 9 was due to a zero order in Period 5. Demand has exhibited higher volatility since Period 8. The mean demand for the first 7 periods was approximately 93 units, while the mean demand from Period 8 to Period 13 is approximately 104 units. Given the higher recent variance (ranging from 62 to 150), I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture the current demand regime and volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' allows the backend to use the observed lead time average, which is currently stable at 4. The on-hand inventory is low (22), but a large in-transit pipeline (353) exists from previous high-volume orders (P10: 157, P11: 41, P12: 99, P13: 56). Parameters focus on maintaining service levels amidst this higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-Period 7: average demand increased from ~93 to ~104 with increased volatility (StdDev significantly higher). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 40 units and in-transit is 342. Since Period 8, we've observed a demand regime shift and increased volatility. Average demand from Period 8 to Period 14 is ~109 units, compared to ~93 units in the first 7 periods. Demand in the most recent two periods (P13: 125, P14: 139) suggests a potential upward trend or higher volatility peak. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (L=4). To account for the recent demand increase and the observed volatility since the regime shift at P8, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire new regime (P8-P14), providing a more responsive forecast to the higher average demand and variance compared to the full history. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand, ensuring sufficient safety stock for the current volatility while accounting for the significant pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift from Period 8 onwards confirmed: Average demand increased from ~93 to ~109 (+17%) with significantly higher volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we experienced a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0, satisfied only 81 of 94 demand) due to the low arrival from Period 11 (41 units). The demand regime has clearly shifted higher since Period 8. Analyzing demand from P8 to P15, the average is approximately 107.25 units per period with a high standard deviation (approx 31). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since we have a zero on-hand balance and high in-transit inventory (465 units), we must ensure our parameters reflect the elevated demand and volatility to recover service levels. I will use a recent_N of 8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift that started at Period 8, while keeping the lead time at the default promised value of 4, which is currently being met.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe an on-hand inventory of 15 units. Reviewing the history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 8; demand from Period 8 to 16 averages approximately 104.7 units, compared to the initial mean of 93. Volatility is also noticeably higher in this recent window. We experienced a stockout in Period 15, indicating our safety stock was insufficient for the increased variance. To stabilize the inventory level and better account for the (L+1)=5 period exposure window, I will use the last 9 periods (Period 8 to 16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand pattern while providing enough samples for a more robust volatility estimate, aiming to prevent further stockouts given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0/$1.0).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18, we have observed a confirmed lead time of 4 periods consistently (the last arrival from Period 13 arrived in Period 17). On-hand inventory is low at 13 units. We are in a higher-demand regime that started around Period 8; the average demand from Period 8 to Period 17 is approximately 100.1 units, with significant volatility (highs of 150 and lows of 58). To manage this, I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture this current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that covers the demand over the lead time plus the decision period (L+1 = 5 periods) while accounting for the increased variance seen recently. I will maintain L at the promised value of 4 since arrivals are currently predictable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are observing a demand environment that shifted around Period 8, characterized by higher mean demand and increased volatility. Since Period 8 (the last 11 periods), the average demand is ~99.2 units, compared to the initial 93 units. Recent demand (P14-P18) has averaged ~93 units, but with a recent spike and stockout in Period 15. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 68 units, with a substantial 341 units in-transit. To capture the current volatility and the regime shift, I will use a N=11 (since P8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using L=default (4) ensures the backend calculates a base stock for a 5-period window (L+1). This approach balances the need to cover the recent demand spikes while accounting for the high holding cost by not overreacting to the single highest peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-78.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the current on-hand inventory is 155 with 264 units in-transit. Historic lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals from periods 1-15 arriving exactly 4 periods later). Since the promised lead time of 4 is accurate and stable, L is set to 'default'. Demand analysis shows a regime shift around Period 8; the pre-P8 mean was ~93, while the mean from P14-P19 is ~90, suggesting the high-demand volatility observed between P9-P14 has stabilized back toward a lower mean, though with persistent variance. To capture this recent stability while remaining responsive to the higher standard deviation seen in the second half of the game, I am using recent_N with N=12 to cover the data since the first major volatility shift began in Period 8. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current demand environment (L+1 periods) without being overly influenced by the initial low-volatility start or the extreme demand spike in Period 9.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Period 15: average demand P15-P19 is ~81 units, significantly lower than the P8-P14 volatile period (~105 units). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observed a demand spike to 152 units, which contradicts the previous insight that demand had stabilized at a lower level (~81 units). Analyzing the last 5 periods (P16-P20), the mean demand is approximately 92.4 units (84, 58, 91, 77, 152), which aligns more closely with the historical long-term average than the restricted Period 15-19 window. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Given profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock equivalent to the mean demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1). To account for the recent volatility and the latest spike, I will use a recent_N method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current demand regime while smoothing the P20 outlier without ignoring it.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility re-emerged in Period 20 (demand=152), shifting the 5-period average (P16-P20) to 92.4 units, invalidating the 'stabilized low demand' observation from Period 20. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with the Period 17 order arriving as expected in Period 21. Demand continues to be highly volatile; after a spike to 152 in Period 20, it dropped to 67 in Period 21. Looking at the last 7 periods (P15-P21), the mean demand is approximately 89 units. Given the high parity between profit and holding costs ($1.0 each), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should align closely with the median/mean demand over the (L+1) horizon. However, to guard against the observed volatility (which caused stockouts in P9 and P15), a slightly more responsive window is used for sigma. I will use a recent window of N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime which fluctuates around 90-100 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we are managing the 'chips(Regular)' SKU with a profit/holding cost ratio of 1.0/1.0, targeting a 50% service level via the OR backend. Historical demand shows a long-term mean of ~96 units, but it is characterized by significant volatility (Standard Deviation ~26.5). Recent demand (P18-P22) has cooled off slightly, averaging ~81 units, but given the volatility spike in Period 20 (152 units), we must remain cautious. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is high (332 units), with expected arrivals of 87 units (from P19) and 68 units (from P20) in the coming cycles. To balance the high holding cost ($1.0) against the risk of stockouts during volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent 10-period window (P13-P22) to capture the current regime which includes both high peaks and more recent lows, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 100 units per period (or 500 units for the L+1 window).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P16-P23) shows a mean of approximately 78.5 units (84, 58, 91, 77, 152, 67, 54, 75). Excluding the outlier in Period 20 (152 units), the demand is relatively stable but averages lower than the previous regime. I will use a recent_N window of 8 periods to capture this current trend, which includes the high-volatility spike in P20, ensuring the OR backend accounts for both the lower average and the potential for spikes. Lead time from P1 to P19 orders has consistently been 4 periods, which is in line with the promised lead time. Inventory is currently healthy with 71 units on hand and 325 units in-transit (orders from P20, P21, P22, P23), which are expected to arrive in P24, P25, P26, and P27 respectively. The chosen parameters aim to maintain a service level that balances the unit profit against the equal holding cost, while respecting the detected demand shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-23 has stabilized at a lower mean of ~78.5 units, though Period 20 demonstrated a significant upward spike (152 units), indicating continued latent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-3.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the demand context shows a stabilization around a lower mean compared to the volatile mid-game period. Since Period 16, demand has averaged approximately 83.1 units (P16-P24), encompassing the outlier in P20 (152 units). Excluding that outlier, the average is ~74.5. The most recent three periods (P22-P24) show very stable demand (54, 75, 68). I will use a recent_N window of 9 periods (P16-P24) to capture this current regime while accounting for the recent spike's impact on variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by every concluded order. The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock for a (L+1) horizon (5 periods) using these updated statistics. On-hand is 71 and in-transit is 273 (sum of orders from P21-P24), providing a healthy pipeline for the next few periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-24 has stabilized: average demand is 83.1 units (including P20 spike) or 74.5 units (excluding spike). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-156.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current observation shows a significant demand drop in Period 25 (21 units), following a period of relatively stable demand around 70-80 units. The 10-period average (P16-P25) is approx 74.8 units, though this includes the Period 20 spike (152 units). On-hand inventory is healthy at 177 units, and in-transit is 206 (orders from P22-P25: 50+80+16+60 = 206), which aligns with the promised lead time of 4 periods. The lead time remains reliably at 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P20, P21 orders arrived exactly 4 periods later). Given the extreme low demand in P25, I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture the current lower demand regime while still accounting for the volatility/spikes seen previously. This ensures the OR backend adjusts for the recent slowdown without overreacting to a single outlier of 21 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: Demand dropped to 21 units, bringing the 10-period average (P16-P25) to 74.8 units, confirming a sustained lower average compared to the P8-P15 volatile period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-33.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting around Period 16, with a more pronounced drop recently (Period 25: 21 units, Period 26: 97 units). The 10-period average (P17-P26) is approximately 81.1 units, but the last 3 periods (P24-P26) have averaged only 62 units. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (1:1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0), effectively aiming to cover the mean demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) captures the stabilized lower demand while smoothing out the extreme low in P25. Sigma_hat is set to the last 10 periods to account for the high volatility observed (range 21 to 152 in the current regime).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 17-26 has stabilized at a lower mean of 81.1 units compared to the volatile P8-P15 period (~105 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-62.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P21-P27) has stabilized at a lower mean of 72 units. While the Period 20 spike (152 units) remains a historical outlier, the more recent downward trend (highlighted by a drop to 21 in P25 and subsequent moderation around 74-97) suggests a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat is appropriate to capture the stabilized regime without being overly influenced by the highly volatile early periods. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across the entire game (verified by actual arrival messages through P27). On-hand inventory is healthy (136), and in-transit (170) includes orders from P24-P27, ensuring the pipeline is well-stocked for the 4-period lead time. Using N=10 for both demand and volatility allows the OR backend to react to the lower recent mean while respecting the observed variance in the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 17-28) is significantly lower than the preceding volatile period, with an average demand of 76.1 units. The most recent demand was 92. Therefore, using a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to capture this lower average and its associated volatility while allowing for the occasional peaks seen in the data. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods, which is captured by the 'default' method. The backend system will compute a base stock level to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods) and subtract the current pipeline inventory (236 units) while respecting the safety stock requirements calculated from these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 17-28 has stabilized at a lower mean of 76.1 units compared to the volatile P8-P15 period (~105 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-mean regime since approximately Period 17, following a volatile period (P8-P15). The most recent 13 periods (P17-P29) show an average demand of approximately 80.2 units (77, 152, 67, 54, 75, 68, 21, 97, 74, 92, 95). While Period 20 was a significant outlier (152 units) and Period 25 was unusually low (21 units), the general trend is consistently lower than the previous ~105 average. Lead time remains stable and predictable at exactly 4 periods based on all recent 'conclude' messages. Pipeline inventory is currently high (269 units), which covers nearly 3.3 periods of expected demand at the current average. To account for the observed volatility within this 'stable' regime (standard deviation around this mean is roughly 30), I will use the last 13 samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent mean shift while respecting the underlying variance.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the shipment ordered in Period 26 (0 units) arrived exactly as expected (L=4), resulting in a stockout because demand (86) exceeded on-hand inventory (25). This was caused by the decision not to order in Period 26. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Since Period 17, the demand regime has stabilized around a lower mean compared to the volatile mid-game period. The average demand from Period 17-30 is approximately 78.5 units. Current pipeline inventory (orders from P27, P28, P29, P30) is 368 units, which covers nearly 4.7 periods of demand at the current average rate. With 0 on-hand inventory, I will maintain the L=4 setting and use recent_N=14 to capture the steady-state demand since the regime shift at Period 17, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects both the observed mean and the current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stabilized around a mean of 75-80 units, with Period 30 showing a stockout due to a missing shipment from Period 26. Specifically, the order placed in Period 26 (amount 0) resulted in no arrival in Period 30, while demand was 86. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P27 order arriving in P31). Current inventory (37 units) and in-transit (302) must cover the next 5 periods. I will use a recent_N of 15 periods to capture the current stable-but-volatile regime (P17-P31), which has a mean of approximately 78.5 units. This provides a balance between the lower demand seen recently and the occasional spikes like Period 20.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Missing shipment cycle confirmed for Period 30 (caused by 0 order in Period 26). The demand regime from P17-P31 remains stable with a mean of ~78.5 units and moderate volatility.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 17, with a mean demand of approximately 78.3 units. Period 32 demand was 71 units, continuing this trend. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P28 arrived P32), although Period 30 experienced a gap in arrivals due to a zero-order in Period 26. In-transit inventory stands at 269 units (orders from P29, P30, P31, P32). Since the demand regime is stable with moderate volatility, I will use a 15-period lookback window (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established stability while weighting out the volatile Period 8-15 era. This window covers the period from P18 to P32. L is set to calculated to maintain the observed 4-period lead time consistency.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 17, with a mean demand of approximately 78-79 units and moderate volatility. The most recent demand (Period 33) was 59 units, which is within the expected range. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P31, P32, and P33 matching orders from P27, P28, and P29). Inventory is currently recovering from the stockout at Period 30 caused by the skipped order in Period 26. With on-hand inventory at 82 and in-transit at 252, the pipeline is well-stocked. I will continue using recent_N (N=17, covering P17-P33) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable regime while filtering out the high-volatility period of P8-P15.

The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 17, with a mean demand of approximately 78.5 units. Recent demand (P31-P34) has shown some fluctuation (57, 71, 59, 122), but remains within the established volatile range. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 34 of the order placed in Period 30. Currently, on-hand inventory is 59 units and in-transit is 200 units (from orders in P31, P32, P33, and P34). Given the lead time (L=4), we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Using a 10-period lookback (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the recent regime's mean and volatility while smoothing out the spike in Period 34. This approach maintains a safe base stock level to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a stabilized phase that began around Period 17, with a mean of approximately 78.5 units. Recent demand (P31-P35: 57, 71, 59, 122, 48) shows an average of 71.4 units, slightly lower but consistent with the moderate volatility observed in this regime. The spike in Period 34 (122 units) suggests that while the mean is lower, the standard deviation remains significant. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is currently at 296 units, which is quite healthy relative to the expected demand over the (L+1) horizon (approx. 5 * 78 = 390 units). I will use a recent_N of 18 (P17-P35) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture this specific regime's characteristics while filtering out the volatile P8-P15 period and the early startup phase.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 17, with a mean demand of approximately 78.5 units. Recent demand (P31-P36) has shown some fluctuations (range 48 to 122) but averages 73.5 units, consistent with the long-term stable regime. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (14 units) following a demand of 74 in Period 36, but a significant pipeline of 303 units is in transit, including orders from Periods 33 (76 units), 34 (47 units), 35 (124 units), and 36 (56 units). I will continue using recent_N with N=20 to capture the stable regime mean and volatility, which effectively addresses the risk of stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained relatively stable since Period 17, with a mean demand around 78-80 units. Recent demand (P34-P37) has shown some fluctuation (122, 48, 74, 88), bringing the 5-period average (P33-P37) to 78.2 units and the 10-period average (P28-P37) to 79.2 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Since the 10-period average aligns well with the longer-term stabilized mean and accounts for recent moderate volatility, I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a stable yet responsive forecast. The pipeline inventory (295) is healthy relative to the expected demand over the lead time (1+L=5 periods), but the on-hand inventory is very low (2), making the current period's parameters critical for maintaining service levels as the next delivery (from order P34) is expected to arrive during the resolution of this period.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P25-P38) remains stable with a mean of approximately 78.8 units and a standard deviation of 25.1 units, despite occasional spikes and small troughs. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P34 order arrived P38). A stockout occurred in Period 38 due to inventory depleting to 0. With total in-transit at 347 units (representing orders from P35, P36, P37, and P38), we are effectively covering the lead time pipeline. I will continue using recent_N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable-but-volatile regime since Period 25. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the consistent 4-period history.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 78 units since Period 17, with relatively moderate volatility. The most recent demand (Period 39) was 79, consistent with this regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 35 order in Period 39. Currently, on-hand inventory is 45 units with 247 units in-transit. A stockout occurred in Period 38 due to low starting inventory, but the system is recovering with the arrival of 124 units in Period 39. I am using a recent_N of 20 for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the stabilized regime from Period 17 onwards while maintaining enough samples for a robust volatility estimate. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' based on its consistent performance.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the long term. Since Period 17, the mean demand has hovered around 79 units, with recent periods (P31-P40) showing a mean of 76.1 units. The most recent demand (Period 40) was 72 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as evidenced by P36 order arriving in P40). Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 282) plus on-hand (29) totals 311 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate (311 / 76.1 \u2248 4.08). I will set mu_hat using the last 20 periods (recent_N=20) to capture the stable regime from P21 onwards, and sigma_hat using the same window to address the moderate volatility. L will remain at the promised 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 17, with a mean demand of approximately 78-79 units per period. Recent performance (P37-P41) shows demand values of 81, 72, 79, 74, 122, 48, 74, 88, 53, 79, 72, and 81, supporting this. The current lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 16 and in-transit inventory at 266, the total pipeline is 282 units. I will use the recent 20 periods (P22-P41) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this window captures the modern stable regime while accounting for the moderate volatility observed (like the 122 in P34). The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 17, with a mean demand of approximately 78.3 units. Period 42 showed a significant drop in demand (31 units), which mirrors the isolated low demand seen in Period 25 (21 units). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 84 and in-transit at 252 (total 336), we are well-covered for the lead time plus the review period (5 periods x ~78 units = 390 units). However, the recent drop in Period 42 suggests a potential shift or continued high variance. I will use the last 15 periods (roughly since Period 27) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable-but-volatile regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock for the (L+1) horizon.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 17, with a mean demand of approximately 76-78 units. However, recent periods (P39-P43) show a slight downward trend with a mean of 66 units and lower volatility (standard deviation of 19.5), specifically highlighted by a significant drop to 31 units in Period 42. Lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods, with orders from P35-P39 arriving exactly as scheduled. Current inventory management must bridge the gap between Period 44 and the arrival of orders placed in P40-P43. On-hand inventory is 41, and in-transit is 262, covering a significant portion of future demand. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability while accounting for the recent variability, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (4+1) periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime post-Period 38 has softened slightly: average demand for P39-P43 is 66 units, compared to the P17-P38 average of ~78 units. Lead time continues to be stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a softer regime since Period 39. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P39-P44) is 67.3 units, down from the long-term stable average of ~78 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P38-P40 orders arrived at P42-P44). Pipeline inventory (226 units) + current on-hand (58 units) equals 284 units. Given L=4, the base stock targets demand for 5 periods. A mean of ~67 units/period implies a base stock requirement around 335-370 units depending on the safety stock (sigma). I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this lower demand regime and recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to capture the moderate volatility observed recently. This should prevent overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the occasional spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime post-Period 38 stabilized at a lower mean: average demand for P39-P44 is 67.3 units (-14% compared to P17-P38).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shown a sustained decrease since Period 39. The average demand for the last seven periods (P39-P45) is approximately 62.3 units, which is notably lower than the previous regime (P17-P38) average of approximately 78 units. The lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals (P41 order arrived P45). With on-hand inventory at 78 and in-transit at 227 (total 305 units), the pipeline is currently healthy relative to the lower demand. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current softer demand and its volatility accurately for the final periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted to a lower mean starting around Period 39. For the most recent 8 periods (P39-P46), the average demand is 64.5 units per period, a significant decrease from the previous average of ~78 units. Consequently, I am setting N=8 for the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters to reflect this recent low-demand stabilization. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by consistent 4-period arrival cycles (e.g., P42 order arrived in P46). Current inventory (On-hand: 84, In-transit: 149) is sufficient for the short term, but parameters need to be adjusted down to avoid excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50). Using recent_N=8 captures the current softened demand while providing enough buffer for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime post-Period 38 has stabilized at a lower mean: average demand for P39-P46 is 64.5 units (-17% compared to the P17-P38 average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower mean starting around Period 39. For the most recent 9 periods (P39-P47), the average demand is 65.8 units, significantly lower than the preceding long-term average (~78 units). Lead time has remained perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the history (excluding the deliberate zero-order gap in Period 26 which caused the arrival at Period 30 to be 0). Current on-hand inventory is 41 units, and in-transit inventory is 204 units. To respond to the sustained lower demand while maintaining a high service level (given profit vs. holding cost is 1:1, q=0.5), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture this softer demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This prevents over-ordering based on older, higher demand data. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as it has been consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted to a lower mean since Period 39. The most recent 10 periods (P39-P48) show an average demand of 64.0 units, a significant decrease from the previous stable period (P17-P38) which averaged approximately 78 units. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P44 order arrived in P48, confirming L=4). With on-hand inventory at 48 and in-transit units at 233, the total inventory position is 281. Using the most recent 10-period regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) provides the most accurate protection against current demand patterns while accounting for the recent softening in sales. Since the next period is P50 (the final period), the 'cap' logic in the OR backend will naturally limit excessive ordering, but providing parameters based on the current regime (N=10) ensures the base stock calculation reflects the most up-to-date information.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime post-Period 38 has stabilized at a lower mean: average demand for P39-P48 is 64.0 units (-18% compared to the P17-P38 average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-mean regime since Period 39. The average demand from Period 39 to Period 49 is approximately 65.7 units (Sum=723, N=11). This is significantly lower than the preceding period (P17-P38) which averaged around 78 units. Consequently, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 to reflect this updated regime. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all observed arrivals (no drift or loss detected recently). Profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 0.50 (q = 1 / (1+1)). The inventory position (On-hand: 18 + In-transit: 219 = 237) compared to a lead-time demand estimate (5 periods * 66 units = 330) indicates a need for continued ordering to maintain availability, especially since on-hand inventory is low (18 units) and the next arrival (Period 46 order) is only 7 units.
