The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now will arrive during Period 5 and be reflected in the Period 6 decision phase. Current inventory is 0. Based on the 5 historical demand samples (61, 107, 84, 144, 69), the mean demand is approx 93 units per period. The OR recommendation is 149 units, calculated using base-stock logic (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302) and capped to prevent over-ordering. Since I am at the start of the game with no on-hand or in-transit inventory, I need to build a pipeline to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Safety Stock Considerations: With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the critical fractile is very high (0.95), justifying high safety stocks to avoid stockouts once inventory arrives. 4.

{
  "rationale": "The game is currently at Period 48 out of 50. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which means any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4) at the earliest. Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed today will never arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence the final profit calculation through sales. Every unit ordered now would only add to costs without providing any benefit. My current inventory (204 units) is significantly higher than the average demand (~80-90 units), meaning I am already at risk of incurring unnecessary holding costs for the final three periods (48, 49, 50). Therefore, the optimal strategy for the remaining periods is to stop ordering entirely.",

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The OR recommendation suggests ordering 131 units for Period 49. However, our game objective is to maximize total reward over the total periods, and we are currently at Period 49 out of 50. In a supply chain with a 4-period lead time, any order placed today (Period 49) will not arrive until Period 53 (P49 decision -> arrives P53 arrival phase). Since the simulation ends at Period 50, this order will never arrive to satisfy demand or influence the ending inventory within the game's horizon. Consequently, placing an order now would simply incur a cost without providing any benefit to revenue or final state metrics. The current inventory (On-hand: 221) and the incoming arrival (ordered P45, arriving P49 resolution phase) are more than sufficient to cover the demand for the final two periods (P49 and P50), which has averaged ~80 units per period. Therefore, I am overriding the OR recommendation to 0.",

Current inventory levels (On-hand: 210, In-transit: 29) are more than sufficient to cover the demand for this final period (historical average demand is ~82 units).
