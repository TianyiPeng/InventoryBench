Long-term average is approx 90. 4. OR Strategy: The OR agent recommends 59 units. Let's evaluate total coverage: On-hand (83) + Pipeline (343) = 426 units. Total demand over the L+1 window (5 periods) is roughly 425-450 units. 5. Adjustment: The current inventory position (426) is already very close to the base-stock target (approx 480-500).

Period 48 (Period_48) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The goal is to maximize total reward until Period 50. We are currently at the decision phase of Period 48. Given the lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4 = 52). Since the game ends after Period 50, this order will never arrive to satisfy demand within the game's horizon. Furthermore, holding costs are incurred on ending inventory, and since we already have 119 units on-hand and 178 units in-transit (with arrivals expected in Period 48 and 49 due to orders from Period 44 and 45), we have more than enough inventory to cover the remaining 3 periods of demand (Periods 48, 49, and 50). Specifically, demand averages around 60-80 units; our 119 on-hand units plus upcoming arrivals (78 from P44, 100 from P45) will result in a significant surplus. Therefore, placing any additional order now would only risk incurring holding costs if the game were to continue, and serves no purpose for a game ending at Period 50.",

Since the confirmed lead time is 4 periods (as noted in the Carry-over Insights and historical arrivals like Period 48 arriving from Period 44), any order placed in Period 49 will arrive in Period 53 (49 + 4). Since the game ends at Period 50, this inventory will never arrive to satisfy demand or influence profit within the game's horizon. Furthermore, additional inventory would only incur holding costs if it arrived earlier, but since it arrives after the game ends, it is simply wasted expense. Current on-hand inventory is 106 units, and there are 100 units in-transit (ordered on Period 45, expected arrival Period 49). This will be sufficient to cover demand for the final two periods (Period 49 and Period 50), which has averaged ~78 units recently.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "The current period is 50, which is the final period of the game. Based on the game mechanics, the sequence of events is 1) VM Decision, 2) Arrival Resolution, 3) Demand Resolution, and 4) Period Conclusion. While orders placed now would arrive in Period 54 (given the confirmed 4-period lead time), there are no subsequent periods to benefit from these arrivals. Furthermore, the current on-hand inventory is 161 units, and the average historical demand is approximately 81 units per period. Even if we were considering demand for this final period, the 161 units on hand are more than sufficient to cover it. Any additional units ordered would simply incur holding costs without the possibility of being sold. Therefore, the optimal strategy for the final period is to place an order of 0 units for the SKU 'chips(Regular)'.",
