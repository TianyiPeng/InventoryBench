Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 with no inventory and no in-transit orders. The product is 'chips(Regular)' which suggests a relatively stable snack category, but with significant variation observed in the provided 5-period sample (mean: 93, std: 32.7). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be available in Period 6. To ensure we have enough inventory to cover the lead time and the current period (L+1 = 5 periods), I will set mu_hat based on the mean of all available samples multiplied by (L+1). Since the sample size is small (5), the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate as it uses all available data points to establish a baseline. I'll use the 'default' lead time (4) as we have no historical data to suggest a drift yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 149 units (the OR engine's recommendation based on the seed data), but since the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, these units are currently in-transit and not available for sale. This explains why 66 units of demand were lost in Period 1 (sold=0, ending inventory=0). The current in-transit amount of 149 units covers the initial pipeline, but we must continue to plan for the next 5 periods (L+1) to ensure the base stock levels remain robust as demand evolves. Historical demand across the first 5 samples provided in the prompt (61, 107, 84, 144, 69) and the actual demand from Period 1 (66) suggest a mean demand of approximately 88.5 units. With L=4, we need to cover demand for Period 2 through Period 6. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the initial variance and mean effectively, using N=5 to incorporate the most relevant historical samples while centering on the current trend.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order placed in Period 1 is not expected to arrive until Period 5 (visible at start of Period 6). Demand has been recorded for P1 (66) and P2 (117), in addition to the initial historical samples. Total demand observations now include: 61, 107, 84, 144, 69 (pre-game) and 66, 117 (current game). The mean of these 7 samples is 92.57. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the default calculation (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate as there is no evidence yet of a lead time shift or a sustained demand regime change.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 1+4=5 and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (read at Period 6). Therefore, seeing arrived=0 for Periods 1-3 is expected behavior. Current demand history (P1: 61, P2: 107, P3: 84, P4: 144) shows a mean of 99 and standard deviation of 35.5. Total in-transit is 441 (149+148+144), which is roughly consistent with the pipeline needed for a 4+1 period cycle. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=4 to capture the current mean (99) and variability, allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock for the (L+1) horizon.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observed so far for Periods 1-4 is expected behavior. My current on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no stock has arrived yet. The demand history for the first four periods is [66, 117, 122, 92], with a mean of 99.25. Including the user-provided Period 5 demand (69), the 5-period mean is 93.2. I will use 'default' for L (promised 4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the initial behavior. The pipeline of 525 units (from P1-P4) roughly covers 5 periods of demand at current levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $316.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Looking at the history, the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time L=4. Demand samples (66, 117, 122, 92, 93) show a mean of approximately 98. Since we have only 5 samples and no clear calendar context or regime shift yet, I will use all available samples (N=5) to estimate demand. The profit is $4 and holding cost is $1, which suggests a target service level of 0.8 (4/(4+1)). The pipeline currently has orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4 in transit (148+144+84 = 376). With on-hand inventory at 56, the total inventory position is 432. The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock for (L+1)=5 periods. 5 * 98 = 490. My parameters rely on the recent 5 samples to capture the mean and standard deviation accurately while the system stabilizes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $261.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms this: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 (L=4), and Period 2 order arrived in Period 6 (L=4). In-transit inventory includes orders from P3 (144), P4 (84), and P6 (101), total 329. The demand history (61, 107, 84, 144, 69 from user input and 66, 117, 122, 92, 93, 93 from history records) shows a mean demand of approximately 95 units per period. Since the lead time is stable at the promised value of 4, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent stability in demand (approx 93-95 range) while ignoring the initial noise, ensuring we cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods based on P1 and P2 arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the last 7 periods is [66, 117, 122, 92, 93, 93, 68]. The mean demand is approximately 93 units per period. The promised lead time (L) is 4, and recent arrivals (Period 5, 6, 7) confirm that the actual lead time is indeed 4 periods. Since the lead time is stable and reflects the promised value, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the full range of observed demand variability without over-weighting the early zeros (which were lost sales due to no stock). The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current on-hand (187) plus in-transit (290) equals 477 units, which roughly covers 5 periods of average demand (approx 465 units), suggesting we are well-positioned.

Daily Reward (R_t): $344.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods, as arrivals from Period 1 through Period 4 have all arrived with a lead time of 4. Demand over the last 8 periods has averaged 96.75 units. Recent demand in Period 8 was 123, showing some volatility but no clear structural shift. On-hand inventory is 148, and there are 235 units in transit (expected from orders in periods 6, 7, and 8). Since the promised lead time (L=4) matches the observed lead time, I will use 'default' for L. For demand forecasting, I'll use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture the full history available while smoothing out the early period variability, accounting for the lead time plus the decision period (1+L=5 periods of demand coverage).

Daily Reward (R_t): $592.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 9 where demand (150) exceeded available stock (148). The pipeline inventory is 369 units, consisting of orders from P6 (101), P7 (105), P8 (29), and P9 (134). Demand has shown an increasing trend in recent periods (P8: 123, P9: 150). Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). No order was placed in P5, which explains why 'arrived=0' was reported for Period 9. The P6 order is expected to arrive during Period 10 and will be visible in the P11 start message. To account for the recent demand increase and the stockout, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (last 5 periods) and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean shift (approx avg 105 over P5-P9 vs earlier lower numbers). L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $259.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Promoted lead time is 4, and historical 'conclude' messages (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. The order placed in Period 5 (arrived=0 in conclude messages) appears to be lost or is significantly delayed, as it should have arrived in Period 9's arrival phase (visible in P10 conclude). This resulted in a stockout at Period 9. On-hand is currently 29 with 426 in transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, P10). Demand has been somewhat volatile (range 66-150). Given the lead time of 4, our base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use the mean of the most recent 5 demand samples (P6-P10: 93, 68, 123, 150, 72; Avg=101.2) to set mu_hat, which results in (1+4)*101.2 = 506. I will use 'default' for L as the promised 4 matches the observed 4. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Possible lost shipment or severe delay for order placed in Period 5 (149 units expected in P9, but arrived=0 in P10 conclude).

Daily Reward (R_t): $331.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the order placed in Period 5 (which would have been for 0 units) is technically missing, but as it was 0 units, it doesn't impact the inventory physically. However, the order placed in Period 8 (29 units) was expected to arrive in Period 12 but has not yet appeared in a conclude message (it will be visible at the start of Period 13). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals from Periods 6 and 7. Demand averages 94.9 units over the first 11 periods. Current on-hand is low (41), and the pipeline (In-transit: 438) includes orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11. With L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Average demand * 5 = 474.5 units. Current total position (41 + 438 = 479) is very close to this target. I will use recent_N for both demand mean and lead time calculation to stay responsive to the steady demand and confirmed lead time stability.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory is critically low (8 units). Looking at the history, the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods is consistently observed for P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, and P8. However, the order from Period 5 (which would have arrived in Period 9 resolution) never arrived, confirming a lost shipment. This loss caused a stockout in Period 9 and low inventory currently. The pipeline inventory (475 units) includes orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12. The P9 order (134 units) is expected to arrive during the Period 13 resolution phase (visible in P14). Demand remains relatively stable with a mean around 95-100. I will maintain L=4 (default) as the reliable lead time for successful shipments. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the demand profile since the system stabilized after the initial 5-period seed data, covering the period where we have actual sales and inventory data.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Order placed in Period 5 (149 units) never arrived (expected P9). All other orders (P1-P4, P6-P8) adhered to a 4-period lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14. Historical demand analysis shows a relatively stable mean around 98 units per period (Periods 1-13). There was a confirmed lost shipment (Period 5 order, 149 units) which caused a stockout in Period 9 and depleted on-hand inventory levels. Since then, lead times have returned to the promised 4 periods (as seen in Period 13 conclude for the Period 9 order). Current on-hand inventory is low (17 units), and we have 386 units in transit. The in-transit inventory covers the expected demand for the next 4 periods (approx 400 unis) reasonably well, but the loss of the Period 5 shipment means the pipeline is still lean relative to the risk. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent demand behavior (Mean approx 101, StdDev approx 28) and use L='calculate' to rely on the confirmed 4-period lead time observed in successful deliveries.

Daily Reward (R_t): $520.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from Periods 1-4 and 6-10 arriving consistently (with the exception of the lost shipment from Period 5). The current inventory state is 36 on-hand units with 364 units in-transit. The in-transit pipeline accounts for orders placed in Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14 (117, 66, 45, and 136 units respectively). Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) has averaged 98.2 units, which is slightly higher than the overall mean of approx 94.6 units. To maintain safety stock while compensating for the previous lost shipment and the current volatility, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this recent upward trend and variance. L will be kept at 'default' since the promised lead time of 4 matches the actual realized lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $317.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has been relatively stable with a slight upward trend in recent periods (mean of last 5 periods \u2248 112.6, mean of all samples \u2248 100). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains the standard, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-8 and 10-15. We have confirmed the loss of the order from Period 5 (149 units), but the pipeline inventory (400 units) currently reflects orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15, which are expected to arrive in Periods 16, 17, 18, and 19 respectively. Since on-hand inventory is 59 and the lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using a recent_N approach for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 (N=10) captures the current mean of 110.1 units per period better than the lifetime average, ensuring a safer base stock for the next cycle without excessive holding costs.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 6 to Period 16 has averaged approximately 101 units per period, showing a slight increase from the initial game history. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods, with the exception of the lost shipment from Period 5. To ensure sufficient coverage for the (L+1) = 5 period lead time window, I will use recent_N to capture the current demand mean and volatility over the last 11 periods (since the lead time stabilized and we have consistent data after the lost shipment incident). Setting N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will provide a stable estimate of current consumption patterns while accounting for the recent variability in demand (ranging from 62 to 150 units).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 7, arrivals have consistently confirmed an actual lead time of 4 periods (except for the lost shipment from Period 5). The game history shows demand fluctuations but no clear structural break in mean demand over the last 10 periods (avg ~98). Current on-hand is low (28), and pipeline inventory is 472. Given the lead time L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. The most recent 10 samples (P8-P17) provide a stable basis for both the mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) of demand. Using N=10 for recent_N allows the model to capture the recent volatility and mean without being overly influenced by the initial setup phase or the lost shipment impact.

Daily Reward (R_t): $291.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) appears relatively stable with moderate variance. The average demand across all 18 periods is approximately 100 units (mean = 100.0, std_dev \u2248 24.6). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (excluding the lost P5 order) consistently show an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since the P5 order was confirmed lost (as per Carry-over Insights), the 398 units currently listed as 'In-transit' represent orders from Period 15 (153), 16 (109), 17 (74), and 18 (62), which are expected in Periods 19, 20, 21, and 22 respectively. I will use 'default' for lead time (4) and 'recent_N' with N=18 for demand parameters to capture the full stable regime, ensuring the OR backend calculates the base stock based on a 5-period window (L+1).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Evaluating the history for P20, the demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without significant regime shifts since the start. The mean demand over the last 15 periods (since the initial data) is approximately 97.2, and the overall mean is around 94.6. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (excluding the confirmed lost order from P5). Given the stable demand and reliable lead time, I will use a window of the last 15 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the active game history while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. The OR engine will use these parameters to calculate a base stock covering the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5) to maintain the target service level based on the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the inventory stands at 106 units on-hand with 269 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on recent arrivals (P16 order arrived in P20). Demand over the last 10 periods (P11-P20) has averaged 97.5 units, which is slightly higher than the overall mean but shows no significant new regime shift. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this slightly higher recent demand volatility while keeping L at default (4 periods). The pipeline inventory (269) plus current on-hand (106) totals 375, which covers roughly 3.8 periods of average demand, necessitating a small top-up order via the OR backend to maintain the target service level (q=0.8).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains relatively stable (last 5 periods mean: 89.8), following an initial jump in Period 9. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, with the exception of the confirmed lost order from Period 5. Based on the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.8. In Period 22, we have 113 units on-hand and 345 units in-transit (orders from P18, P19, P20, and P21). All expected arrivals are currently within the 4-period window, so no new shipments are flagged as lost. I am using the 'calculate' method for lead time as the 4-period pattern is robust. For demand, I'm using recent_N=13 (covering Periods 9-21) to capture the current demand regime which shifted after Period 8, while providing enough samples for a stable mean and standard deviation estimate.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) shows relatively consistent behavior with no obvious seasonal shift in the recent periods (avg demand of ~79 units over the last 5 periods vs ~98 units historically). The lead time remains steady at exactly 4 periods, with the exception of one lost order from Period 5. Pipeline inventory (374) plus on-hand (121) equals 495 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (Period 23 plus 4 lead periods). I will use a recent window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the slightly lower recent demand and preserve responsiveness, while maintaining the L parameter at the promised/confirmed 4 periods. The service level (q) target remains approximately 80% based on $4 profit and $1 holding cost, which the backend will handle with the base-stock policy.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but exhibits noticeable fluctuations. The recent 5 periods (P19-P23) show a mean demand of 85 units, compared to the overall historical mean of approximately 95 units. Given the seasonality inherent in snack products (though specific calendar dates aren't detailed, we see consistent volatility), I will use a recent_N window for demand forecasting to react to the slightly lower recent demand levels. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods, with the exception of the confirmed lost shipment from Period 5. Pipeline inventory is currently 350 units (orders from P20-P23), and the system needs to maintain stock to cover L+1 (5) periods. Setting N=10 for mu_hat captures the recent trend while smoothing out high peaks like Period 20 (152 units). Using N=10 for sigma_hat provides a robust volatility estimate for the OR backend's safety stock calculation.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 111 units, with 328 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the conclusion of Period 24 where the Period 20 order arrived). There are no currently missing or delayed shipments since the confirmed loss in Period 9. Demand over the last 15 periods (since Period 10) has averaged approximately 87.8 units per period, while the overall average since Period 1 is 98.6. Recent demand (last 5 periods) shows a slight cooling (avg 63.6), but we must prepare for the (L+1)=5 period horizon. I will use a recent_N of 15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history, providing a balance between responsiveness and stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-156.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant decrease in the most recent period (Period 25 demand = 21), compared to the preceding 5-period average of approximately 64. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently high (240 units) following the arrival of a large order from Period 21. With 232 units in-transit (ordered P22-P25), the current pipeline is substantial. To prevent excess holding costs while demand is potentially softening, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to smooth out recent variability while acknowledging the lower demand trend. Lead time parameter L is set to 'calculate' to rely on the consistent historical performance of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift: Period 25 demand dropped to 21, notably lower than the previous 10-period average (~83). Monitoring for a sustained low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $154.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand rebounded to 97 units after a sharp drop to 21 in Period 25. This suggests the low demand in P25 was an outlier rather than a sustained regime shift. However, current on-hand inventory is high (234 units) and there is a significant pipeline of 141 units. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods since the single lost shipment in Period 5. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to reflect the consistent 4-period history. For demand parameters, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=10) to capture the current mean demand of ~80 while allowing the high Period 25 outlier to influence the safety stock through the sigma_hat 'recent_N' (N=10) calculation. Given the high starting stock, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a zero or small order, which is desirable to minimize holding costs while the excess inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Demand drop in P25 (21 units) was transient; P26 demand (97 units) returned to the previous average range (~80-90 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand drop in Period 25 (21 units) was indeed transient, as confirmed by demand in Period 26 (97 units) and Period 27 (74 units), which returned to the historical baseline. Current on-hand inventory is high at 200 units, with an in-transit pipeline of 171 units (orders from P24, P25, P26, P27). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the transient dip in Period 25 slightly lowered the arithmetic mean of the 'all-time' data, and recent demand is consistent with the pre-dip average (~85-90), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture a stable demand regime while excluding the noisy startup phase. This window includes the dip but ensures we don't overreact to it while maintaining sufficient stock. L remains at the promised/confirmed 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a transient dip in Period 25 (21 units). Demands in periods 26, 27, and 28 were 97, 74, and 92 units respectively, which are consistent with the long-term historical mean of approximately 85-90. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 28 (ordered in Period 24). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 155 units, with 242 units in-transit (orders from P25, P27, and P28). I will continue using a lead time (L) of 4. For demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat), I will use the recent_N method with N=15 to capture the stable demand regime while filtering out the noise of the Period 25 outlier.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a transient drop in Period 25. The most recent demand samples (Periods 26 to 29) are 97, 74, 92, and 95, indicating a stable regime around a mean of ~90 units/period. The average of the last 10 periods (excluding the outlier in Period 25) is approximately 84. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable yet slightly higher recent average, ensuring a responsive forecast. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (Periods 26-29 all confirmed a 4-period lead time). On-hand inventory is 114, and in-transit is 266, totaling 380 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of demand at the current rate. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a service level balance between the $4 profit and $1 holding cost (target service level ~80%).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently at Period 31. Reviewing the 'Period 30 conclude' message, I notice that 'arrived=0' despite an order being placed in Period 26 (lead time 4). This follows the confirmed lost shipement from Period 5 (expected P9). All other orders have arrived with a consistent 4-period lead time. This suggests Period 26's order of 0 units (which happens to be 0 anyway) is accounted for, but more importantly, we must verify if the pipeline inventory is accurate. On-hand is low (28), and in-transit is 348. The demand has stabilized around a mean of 80-90 units after a brief transient dip in Period 25. Specifically, the last 4 periods of demand were: 74, 92, 95, 86 (Mean: 86.75). Since the lead time is reliably 4 periods when units are actually shipped, I will use L=4. For demand, I'll use a recent window (N=10) to capture the current stable regime (averaging ~83 units including the dip, or ~90 excluding it). Given the high service level requirement (Profit $4 / Holding $1), a slightly higher mu_hat is safer to rebuild the low on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Potential missing shipment trend continues; Period 26 order (arrived=0 in P30) confirmed. Current demand regime stable around 85-95 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, demand was 57 units, following a stable regime of approximately 85-95 units. The shipment tracking reveals a confirmed lost shipment: the order from Period 26 (ordered 0, though functionally this refers to the sequence of arrivals) never arrived in Period 30 as expected. The Period 27 order arrived on time in Period 31 (lead time = 4). With on-hand inventory at 41 and the next expected arrival (Period 28 order of 118 units) due in Period 32, we must ensure the pipeline is robust against potential further losses. I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable regime while smoothing the transient dip in Period 25 and the lower demand in Period 31. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. Lead time calculation is kept at 'calculate' to incorporate the reliable historical data of 4 periods while recognizing the loss of the Period 26 shipment.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a transient dip in Period 25. Over the last 6 periods (P27-P32), demand has averaged approximately 80 units (74, 92, 95, 86, 57, 71). I am using a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the current regime while recovering from the low outlier in P25. The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods for successful deliveries, however, we have confirmed lost shipments for orders placed in Period 5 and Period 26 (demonstrated by the 'arrived=0' in Period 30 for the Period 26 order). Because the backend OR logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, keeping lost orders in the 'In-transit' count causes under-ordering. To compensate for the 'phantom' inventory of the Period 26 order (which was 0 units ordered, but let's look at the in-transit discrepancy), the current in-transit is 245. Orders from P29 (78), P30 (82), P31 (32), and P32 (53) total 245. Since 245 matches exactly the sum of the last 4 orders, there is no phantom 'in-transit' from the P26 order (which was 0). The system is currently stable. I will use recent_N=10 for demand parameters to reflect the steady state.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a transient drop in Period 25. Over the last 8 periods (Period 26-33), the average demand is approximately 78.8 units (97, 74, 92, 95, 86, 57, 71, 59). I will use N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime. Regarding logistics, a shipment from Period 26 is confirmed lost (arrived=0 in Period 30 conclude, and no arrival in subsequent periods). All other recent shipments (Periods 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29) arrived exactly within the 4-period promised lead time. Therefore, I will maintain the lead time parameter at L=4 but remain cautious of potential future losses. Current on-hand inventory (107) and in-transit (245) total 352 units, which is approximately 4.5 periods of demand at the current rate, positioning the stock level well against the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed second lost shipment: Order from Period 26 never arrived (expected P30). All other orders from P23-P29 (excluding P26) arrived with a lead time of 4 periods.

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a transient drop in Period 25. Over the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the average demand is 80.4 units, which is consistent with the long-term average. The promised lead time is 4 periods. While there have been two confirmed lost shipments (orders from Period 5 and Period 26), all other orders have consistently arrived with a 4-period lead time. Since lost shipments are handled as indefinitely in-transit by the backend, I will use lead time 'calculate' to reflect the actual arrival behavior observed for successful shipments. For demand, I will use a recent_N of 10 to capture the current stable regime while smoothing out the outlier from Period 25. This ensures the base stock calculation covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods) at a service level determined by the profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable, with a slight decrease in the most recent period (48 units). Over the last 10 periods (P26-P35), demand has averaged approximately 80.9 units, which aligns with the long-term historical mean. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, despite two previous lost shipments (P5 and P26 orders). My strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current stable demand regime while accounting for the inherent volatility. I will keep the lead time L at the default (promised) value of 4, as recent successful deliveries (P27-P31 orders) arrived precisely in 4 periods. This approach maintains sufficient inventory to cover the lead time + 1 period of demand while optimizing for the 80% critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains stable around a mean of ~80 units over the last 10-15 periods, despite some local fluctuations (Range 48-122). Specifically, the average demand of the last 15 periods (since Period 21) is approximately 80 units. I am using recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable regime while filtering out the transient drop in Period 25. Regarding lead time, the promised lead time is 4. Historical data shows two lost shipments (Period 5 order and Period 26 order), but all other delivered orders have consistently arrived with a lead time of 4. Therefore, I will set L to 'default' (4), as the OR backend's inventory calculation needs the expected time between ordering and arrival. The pipeline inventory (339) is relatively high compared to current on-hand (30), reflecting the sequence of orders placed from P33-P36. These are expected to arrive in P37, P38, P39, and P40 respectively.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the 80\u201390 range, with recent fluctuations between 48 and 122. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (20), but pipeline inventory is high (302). While most orders follow a 4-period lead time, history shows two lost shipments (from Period 5 and Period 26). However, recent arrivals (Periods 33, 34, 35, 36) have all occurred consistently at L=4. Given that we are in Period 38, we rely on the stable demand mean over the last 10 periods (~81.5 per period) to calculate requirements. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable yet somewhat volatile regime, while keeping L=calculate to account for the consistent 4-period arrivals seen since the last loss in Period 26.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with recent observations (P34-P38) averaging approximately 77 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data (orders from P27-P29 and P31-P34) confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods when shipments are not lost. We have experienced two lost shipments (P5 and P26 orders), so maintaining a robust pipeline is essential. Given the stable demand and consistent 4-period lead time for successful deliveries, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (averaging ~77.4 units). For the lead time L, although shipments can be lost, the arrival timing for successful ones is consistently 4; therefore, I use the 'calculate' method to utilize the observed average lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $231.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 30-39) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 76 units. Although there was a brief volatility period earlier, the last 10 periods (N=10) provide a reliable snapshot of current demand patterns. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods despite historical lost shipments (P5 and P26). The current on-hand inventory (85) and in-transit (256) total 341 units. With a promised lead time of 4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will adapt the base-stock level to the most current demand mean (~76) and variance, ensuring the OR backend balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost effectively (~80% service level). No signs of new lost shipments are present in recent 'conclude' messages (P31-P35 arrived as expected).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a recent mean of approximately 78 units over the last 15 periods (P26-P40). Lead time is consistently 4 periods, despite historical lost shipments in Period 5 and Period 26. Currently, on-hand inventory is 77, and there is 261 units in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40). Using recent_N for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) is appropriate here to capture the current stable regime. I've selected N=15 to balance responsiveness with stability, covering the period since the last major demand anomaly in Period 25. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 4-period consistency, as the OR backend handles the base stock calculation using L+1 periods of demand.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 15 periods with a mean around 75 units, despite a transient dip in P25 and spikes in earlier regimes. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods for all successful shipments (P30-P41 follows the 4-period pattern). I am setting L to 4 as it is the observed reliable lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using a recent_N of 14, which covers the period from P28 onwards, effectively excluding the P25 demand anomaly and the historical high-demand period around P20, focusing on the current stable regime (~75 units/period). This addresses the current on-hand inventory (37) and in-transit (308) to maintain the targeted service level.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand show a slight dip in Period 42 (31 units), but the overall trend since Period 26 remains stable with a mean of approximately 74 units. Lead time continues to be reliable at 4 periods (validated by the arrivals in P41 and P42). In-transit inventory (269 units) includes orders from P39 (35), P40 (69), P41 (88), and P42 (77). There are no current indications of lost shipments following the confirmation of the P26 loss. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time observed in the concluded history. For demand (mu_hat), I am using N=17 (from Period 26 to 42) to capture the stable long-term mean following the P25 outlier, ensuring the OR engine accounts for the ~74 units/period average over the lead time + review period. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=17 to reflect current volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable around a mean of 65-70 units recently, despite a notable drop to 31 in Period 42. Based on the last 15 periods (excluding the outlier in P42), the demand mean is approximately 68. The inventory position is healthy: 90 units on-hand plus 260 in-transit (orders from P40-P43). All recent orders (P37-P39) have arrived with the promised lead time of 4 periods, confirming that the lead time is currently stable despite historical lost shipments (P5, P26). I am setting L to default (4 periods) as the system has stabilized. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'm using recent_N=15 to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the noise from the transient drop in Period 42. This ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate of ~68 units per period, adjusted for the 5-period lead+review window.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P40-P44) has been slightly lower (average ~65) compared to the long-term stable average (~85). However, a sharp drop was seen in P42 (31 units), similar to the transient drop in P25. Given we are near the end of the game (P45 of 50), it is crucial to avoid over-ordering and incurring holding costs, especially with on-hand inventory at 85 and a lead time of 4. The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods for all non-lost shipments. Pipeline inventory (244) plus on-hand (85) total 329 units, which covers approximately 4-5 periods of demand at the current rate. I will use a recent window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the slight downward trend in volume while maintaining sufficient stock to avoid stockouts in the final periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown some stability recently around 60-80 units, although it exhibited significant dips in Period 42 (31 units) and Period 45 (32 units). The overall mean of recent demand (last 10 periods) is approximately 65, which is lower than the long-term historical mean (~84). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, despite two previously confirmed lost shipments (P5 and P26). Currently, on-hand inventory (141) and in-transit units (194) provide a sufficient buffer. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the recent lower demand trend while maintaining a standard 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period arrival schedule of successful shipments. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 10-15 periods, with a slight dip in the most recent samples (P45=32, P42=31). The mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 63 units, whereas the long-term mean is higher (~80). Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, suggesting a target service level of 80%. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, despite historical lost shipments (P5, P26). At Period 47, we have 139 on-hand and 146 in-transit (orders from P43, P44, P45, P46). The game ends at Period 50. Orders placed now (P47) will arrive in P51, which is outside the evaluation window. However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage the current cycle. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the more recent lower demand trend while maintaining safety stock for the 80% service level.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the game (Period 48 of 50). The primary objective is to avoid excess ending inventory that will incur holding costs without being sold before Period 50. Demand has remained relatively stable, with a recent 10-period average of approximately 63 units, though it fluctuates. Current on-hand inventory is 88 units, and in-transit inventory is 202 units (ordered in Periods 44-47). Given the 4-period lead time, orders placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game's horizon. Even orders arriving in Period 50 (from Period 46) and Period 51 (from Period 47) might not be fully utilized. The pipeline already contains 202 units, more than enough to cover the remaining demand for Periods 48, 49, and 50 (estimated at ~63 * 3 = 189 units). Therefore, to maximize profit and minimize terminal holding cost, I am setting the parameters to trigger a zero or minimal order by using a recent N average for demand and the default lead time. The OR backend's inventory balancing will recognize the high pipeline relative to remaining periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. Reviewing the history and carry-over insights, the actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods, despite two confirmed lost shipments (orders from Period 5 and Period 26). The current on-hand inventory is 93 units. In-transit inventory is 218 units, consisting of orders from Periods 45, 46, 47, and 48 (all within the 4-period lead time window). Demand has been relatively stable, though showing some recent fluctuations (e.g., 32 in P45, 79 in P46, 77 in P47, 48 in P48). Given the game is ending at Period 50, the order placed this period (P49) will not arrive until Period 53 (P49+4), meaning it cannot be sold. Therefore, our goal is to maintain sufficient inventory for Period 49 and 50 demand without over-ordering. However, the OR backend logic is fixed; I will set parameters to reflect the stable demand regime (~70 units) and the reliable 4-period lead time to ensure the base stock calculation remains sensible for the remaining window, acknowledging that the actual order quantity in this penultimate period will be capped or calculated based on the pipeline.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 15 periods, with an average of approximately 64 units per period (P35-P49). Although there was a slight dip in P42 (31 units) and P45 (32 units), these appear to be transient fluctuations rather than a structural regime shift, as demand promptly recovered to the 70-80 range. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains the dominant actual lead time, despite historical instances of lost shipments in Period 5 and Period 26. Currently, we have 48 units on-hand and 226 units in transit (spread across orders from P46-P49). Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the target service level is 80%. I am using the most recent 15 periods (roughly 3 lead-time cycles) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current demand volatility while maintaining stability. Transitioning to 'calculate' for Lead Time acknowledges the consistent 4-period arrival observed in recent history.
