The initial historical demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' show an average of approximately 93 units per period (61, 107, 84, 144, 69). Since lead time (L) is 4, I need to cover demand for Period 1 through Period 5 (L+1 = 5 periods). Total expected demand for 5 periods is ~465 units.

Historical demand data shows a range of 59 to 144 units (averaging ~93 units per period). Period 1 actual demand was 59. Since the lead time is 4, my inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) needs to cover demand for Period 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (L+1 periods) to ensure stock availability once the next order arrives.

Orders placed in P1 (465 units) and P2 (100 units) are in-transit and not expected to arrive until P5 and P6 respectively. Current on-hand is 0, meaning we are currently stock-out and losing all demand until the first shipment arrives. d) Inventory Assessment: We have 565 units in-transit. With an average demand of ~90, the pipeline covers approximately 6.2 periods of demand (565/90). e) Order Logic: Given that we are waiting for P1's large order (465 units) to arrive in P5, and the pipeline already covers demand through P7 (P1+L+1), further ordering is not required right now. Ordering more would lead to excessive holding costs once the 465-unit shipment arrives, as that single shipment covers over 5 periods of forecasted demand.",

The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, meaning an order placed today (Period 45) will arrive at the start of Period 50. Since the simulation ends at Period 50, this is the final order that can arrive and generate revenue. To maximize profit and end with minimal inventory, I need to ensure enough product is available for Periods 45 through 49. Total demand needed for P45-P49 (5 periods) is approximately 375 units (75 units/period * 5). Current inventory + pipeline includes 21 (on-hand) + 80 (P41) + 60 (P42) + 70 (P43) + 60 (P44) = 291 units. The gap to cover demand through Period 49 is 375 - 291 = 84 units. Any inventory arriving in Period 50 can only satisfy Period 50 demand. I will order 150 units to ensure no stockouts occur in the final stretch (P45-P49) while providing enough stock for the final P50 demand resolution, balancing against the $1 holding cost.",

Orders placed now will arrive in Period 50 (46+4). Any orders placed after Period 46 (i.e., Period 47 onwards) will arrive in Period 51 or later, which is outside the simulation timeframe and would represent wasted capital/holding cost. Therefore, this is the final order that can impact the game. Current status: On-hand = 47 units. In-transit = 340 units (P42: 60, P43: 70, P44: 60, P45: 150). Expected Arrivals: P46: 60 units (from P42), P47: 70 units (from P43), P48: 60 units (from P44), P49: 150 units (from P45). Total expected availability including current inventory for P46-P49 is 47 + 60 + 70 + 60 + 150 = 387 units. Projected demand for P46-P49 (4 periods) at ~72/period is 288 units, leaving ~99 units on-hand for Period 50. Since expected demand for Period 50 is ~72-80 units, the existing pipeline already covers the final period's demand. Ordering more would only increase holding costs at the end of the simulation.",
