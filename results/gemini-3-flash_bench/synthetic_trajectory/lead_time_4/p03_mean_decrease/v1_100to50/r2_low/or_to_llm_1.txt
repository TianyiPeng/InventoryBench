The OR recommendation of 133 units is based on this historical data and a lead time of 4.

Based on the L=4 definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. 2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are [118, 124, 116, 96, 91]. Current demand in Period 1 (83) and Period 2 (108) are slightly lower than early samples but consistent with a mean around 100-110 units. 3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. Pipeline is 266. Total units available to cover the lead time + 1 period (P3, P4, P5, P6, P7) is our focus. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 131 units based on a base-stock policy. Given that on-hand is currently 0 and we are in the early phase of the game with a long lead time, we must maintain the pipeline to ensure that when arrivals start in Period 5/6, we can satisfy demand. The OR recommendation accounts for the 4-period lead time and the high holding cost (equal to profit), which naturally leads to a more conservative 'capped' quantity to avoid overstocking. 5. Strategy: I will follow the OR recommendation of 131 units.

The recent concluded demand (83, 108, 107) reflects this. 3. Inventory & Pipeline: Total pipeline (397 units) covers roughly 3.6 periods of average demand.

{
  "rationale": "The goal is to maximize total reward, which is Profit * units_sold - HoldingCost * ending_inventory. For chips(Regular), the profit margin is $1.0 and the holding cost is $1.0. This means the critical fractile (q) is 0.5, resulting in a safety factor (z*) of 0. My strategy is to avoid holding excess inventory that doesn't yield profit. \n\nInventory Analysis: Currently, On-hand inventory is 223 units. There are 0 units in-transit (all previous orders P18-P22 have arrived, and I ordered 0 units from P23-P27).\n\nDemand Analysis: Earlier demand (P1-15) averaged ~110 units. However, as noted in the Carry-Over Insights, a significant regime shift occurred around Period 17. The average demand over the last 11 periods (P17-P27) is approximately 48.6 units. The most recent demand (P27) was 54 units.\n\nLead Time: The confirmed lead time is 4 periods. Therefore, my current inventory of 223 units must cover demand for the current period (P28) plus the lead time (P29-P32), totaling 5 periods.\n\nCalculation: Total coverage needed = (Expected Daily Demand * 5 periods). Using the recent average of ~49 units, I need roughly 245 units to cover the next 5 periods. With 223 units on hand and 0 in transit, I am slightly below the required coverage, but because profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the penalty for being overstocked is as high as the penalty for being understocked. \n\nOR Recommendation: The OR recommendation of 147 units is based on the entire history (P1-P27), which is heavily skewed by the high initial demand (~110). If I order 147 units, my pipeline inventory would rise to 370 units. At a demand rate of 49/period, 370 units would last over 7 periods, leading to excessive holding costs. \n\nDecision: I will override the OR recommendation and order 0 units again. 223 units / 49 units/period \u2248 4.5 periods of stock. I will likely need to resume ordering in Period 29 or 30 to ensure stock arrives before Period 33, but for now, reducing the existing stockpile is the priority to maximize profit.",

The order placed in P29 (58 units) is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in P33.\n\n2. **Demand Analysis**: A regime shift was identified around P17-P22, where demand dropped from ~110 to ~55. Recent demand (P23-P29) has averaged 42.7 units per period. The OR recommendation of 145 units is significantly overestimating demand because it uses the entire history (P1-P29), including the early high-demand regime (avg ~110), whereas current reality is much lower.\n\n3. **Inventory Position**: Current on-hand is 136. In-transit is 58 (due P33).

Since the lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover demand until P34. Total demand expected through P34 (5 periods away) is approximately 43 * 5 = 215 units. We have 194.

In-transit inventory consists of: P33 (100 units, ETA P37), P34 (30 units, ETA P38), P35 (30 units, ETA P39), and P36 (33 units, ETA P40), totaling 193 units. Historical demand has settled into a lower regime: the average demand since Period 22 is approximately 43 units per period. Over a 5-period horizon, expected demand is ~215 units. The OR baseline recommends 139 units, but this algorithm uses all historical data (including the early high-demand period) and is heavily affected by the current zero on-hand status. However, the 100-unit shipment from P33 is arriving during P37's resolution (after our decision), which will satisfy P37 demand. The current pipeline (193) plus an order of 60 units would bring total coverage to 253 units, which safely covers the ~215 units expected over the lead time plus some safety stock for recent volatility (P35/P36 showed demand in the 50-60 range).

This confirms the regime shift noted in Period 39. The OR recommendation of 31 units is significantly undervalued because it likely uses the long-term historical mean (which includes a very low period between P17-P28) and doesn't fully weigh the current surge.\n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand is 0.

Current pipeline is 351 units. However, looking at the sequence: P41 (60 arrivals vs 62 demand), P42 (50 arrivals vs 62 demand), P43 (138 arrivals vs 62 demand).

Period 46 (Period_46) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The goal is to maximize total reward over the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50). The current inventory state for chips(Regular) is 140 units on-hand with 112 units in-transit. Based on the fixed lead time of 4 periods, the in-transit units are scheduled to arrive as follows: P46: 32 units (ordered P42), P47: 0 units (ordered P43), P48: 60 units (ordered P44), P49: 20 units (ordered P45). The current order placed in Period 46 will arrive in Period 50, the final period. Demand has stabilized recently; the average demand since the P35 regime shift is approximately 53 units/period (P35-P45). With 140 on-hand and 112 in-transit, we have 252 units total to cover demand for periods 46 through 49. Total demand for these 4 periods is estimated at 212 units (53 * 4). This leaves a projected 40 units on-hand at the start of Period 50. To satisfy Period 50 demand (est. 53 units) and minimize both stockout risk and ending inventory holding costs, an order is needed. The OR recommendation is 116 units, but this is calculated using a wider historical window and assumes a long-term horizon. Since Period 50 is the final period, any inventory left at the end of P50 is simply a holding cost penalty. Therefore, I will order 30 units. This quantity, combined with the projected 40 units remaining, provides 70 units for Period 50, which safely covers the ~53 unit mean while minimizing excess ending inventory.",

{
  "rationale": "1. **Lead Time Analysis**: Confirmed actual lead time is 4 periods (as seen in the Period 46 conclusion where Period 42's order arrived). \n2. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P43-P46) has been 48, 42, 57, and 15, averaging ~40.5 units per period. This suggests the demand regime shift noted in Period 39 (averaging ~65) has cooled down significantly in the last few periods to a level closer to the earlier stabilization (P27). \n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand inventory is 157 units. The pipeline (In-transit) consists of orders from P43 (0), P44 (60), P45 (20), and P46 (30), totaling 110 units. Total inventory position = 267 units. \n4. **Horizon Calculation**: Since we are at Period 47 and the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (P47) with a lead time of 4 periods will arrive in the arrival resolution phase of Period 51. This is AFTER the demand phase of the final period (Period 50). \n5. **Conclusion**: Any order placed in Period 47 will not be able to satisfy demand within the 50-period game window. Furthermore, the existing total inventory (267) is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (P47-P50), which is approximately 160-200 units based on current trends.

Specifically, orders placed at P47 arrive P51, P48 arrive P52, etc. Therefore, any order placed now (Period 48) will arrive in Period 52, well past the end of the simulation. Since holding cost is $1.0/unit and the game is about to conclude, any additional inventory ordered now will only incur costs without the possibility of being sold. Current on-hand inventory is 83 units. Recent demand average (P43-P47) is approximately 47 units per period.

However, this is Period 49 of 50. Orders placed now (Period 49) will not arrive until Period 53 (49 + 4 lead time), which is beyond the game's end. 2. Inventory Position: We have 71 units on-hand. Looking at recent demand (P45-P48: 57, 15, 74, 72), the average is around 54.5 units per period. 3. Final Period Strategy: Since the game ends at Period 50, and any order placed now will arrive too late to satisfy any demand or affect profit, ordering now only incurs risk if there were more periods. More importantly, since this is the penultimate decision and the order arrives after the game ends, any units ordered will not contribute to units_sold but will also not affect the ending inventory of the final period (Period 50). However, the standard objective is to maximize reward within the timeframe. Ordering 0 is the most logical choice as we have sufficient stock (71 units) to cover the likely demand of the final period (approx 55 units) without risking overstock or waste, and new orders won't arrive in time to be useful.",
