Since inventory starts at 0, we need to establish a pipeline to cover demand during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). The OR recommendation is 133 units, calculated using the empirical mean and a safety factor based on a critical fractile of 0.8 (Profit $4 / ($4+$1)). However, the OR cap logic (\u03bc + 1.645\u03c3) seems quite tight (107 + 1.645*14.8 \u2248 131) for an initial stock-up phase when on-hand is zero. Given the lead time is 4 periods, an order of 133 units will only arrive in Period 5, meaning we will almost certainly stock out in Periods 1-4. While I cannot fix the immediate stockout due to the lead time, I will follow the OR recommendation of 133 units as a baseline to begin filling the pipeline, acknowledging that the actual demand over 5 periods (L+1) is expected to be around 535 units (107 * 5).

Pipeline inventory is distributed as: P6 (124 units due P10), P7 (59 units due P11), P8 (153 units due P12), and P9 (100 units due P13). 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand over 14 samples (including P1-P9) averages roughly 115 units/period. The current period (P10) will receive 124 units, bringing availability to 150, which should satisfy demand (~115). 4. Inventory Balancing: Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) = 462. Using the (L+1) period logic (L=4), we should cover 5 periods of demand. 5 * 115 = 575. OR recommends 154 units. Total after OR action = 462 + 154 = 616 units. 5. Final Strategy: Scaling back OR's 154 to 120. While the pipeline is deep, the stock on-hand is currently low (26). However, the P6 order arrives *now* (Period 10), ensuring no stockout.

Strategy: We need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At the current mean of 78, required stock is ~390 units.

This results in an inflated base-stock level that doesn't account for the sustained drop in demand.\n5. **Strategy**: To cover demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods) at a mean of ~45 units/period, we need roughly 225 units in the pipeline/on-hand.

  "rationale": "The on-hand inventory is currently 199 units with 98 units in-transit (ordered Period 43). At the current stabilized demand rate of ~58 units per period (observed since Period 36), the available 199 units will cover approximately 3.4 periods of demand. Given the lead time is 4 periods, additional arrivals are needed. The OR recommendation of 132 units is based on building a high safety stock using the entire history which includes much higher early demand; however, we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 46 of 50). An order placed now (Period 46) will arrive in Period 50. Since only 4 periods remain in the game, we must ensure coverage through Period 50. Total demand for Periods 46-50 is projected at ~290 units (58 units * 5 periods). Total current assets (On-hand 199 + Pipeline 98) equal 297 units. This pipeline exactly covers the remaining expected demand of the game without incurring excessive holding costs at the conclusion. Therefore, no additional order is required.",

With 208 units on-hand and only 3 periods of demand remaining (Period 48, 49, and 50), the total expected demand is roughly 150-180 units.
