Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no units in transit. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (P1-P5) is 118, 124, 116, 96, 91, which averages to 109 units. Since the OR backend uses L+1 (5 periods) of demand to set the base stock, I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5. This allows the backend to capture the initial demand mean (~109/period) and variance while we wait for lead time observations. There are no concluded periods yet to verify actual lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 133 units was placed, but because the promised lead time is 4 periods, it is currently in-transit and not yet arrived. The starting inventory was 0, resulting in 102 units of lost sales. Demand for the first five historical periods was [118, 124, 116, 96, 91], and the most recent demand in Period 1 was 102. There is no evidence of a demand shift or change in lead time yet, as only one period has concluded and the order is not expected to arrive until Period 5. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'default' demand statistics to establish a baseline while we wait for lead time confirmation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for chips(Regular) has been: P1=118, P2=124, P3=116, P4=96, P5=91 (from seed data) and actualized demand in the game has been P1=102, P2=87. The average demand across these 7 points is approximately 105. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 263 in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1 and 2, 'arrived=0' is expected since the lead time is at least 4. We keep L at the default (4). For demand (mu_hat), we use the mean of all available samples (N=7 effectively) to calculate the base stock for (1+L)=5 periods. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the variance of all observed samples to ensure a proper buffer against stockouts.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 are still in transit (133 + 130 + 129 = 392 units), which is expected as the first order (P1) is not due to arrive until Period 5 (visible in Period 6's conclude message). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales for the first three periods. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging 105 units (102, 87, 126). Since we have no confirmed arrival data yet, I will stick to the default lead time (4) and use all available historical demand samples (including the 5 samples provided in the prompt: 118, 124, 116, 96, 91) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures we are ordering enough to cover the lead time plus one period (L+1=5), accounting for the pipeline inventory.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (133 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 525 units in transit (orders from Periods 1-4). Since no arrivals have been confirmed yet, we must rely on the promised lead time. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the first 5 periods (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) shows a slight downward trend, with an average of approximately 109 units per period. Given the holding cost and profit are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, but the OR engine's capped policy will adjust this. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and standard deviation to capture the initial behavior while the pipeline fills.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4. According to the Period 5 conclude message, the order placed in Period 1 arrived during Period 5 (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time for the first shipment. Demand across the first 5 periods has been [102, 87, 126, 88, 115], with a mean of 103.6 and a standard deviation of approximately 16.7. Currently, we have 18 units on hand and 392 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4). Since the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The pipeline of 392 units plus on-hand 18 (total 410) is roughly aligned with 4 periods of demand (~414 units), but we must ensure we maintain the base stock level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent history, and keep lead time at 'default' (4) as the observed lead time matches the promised one.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by two consecutive arrivals: Period 1's order arrived in Period 5 and Period 2's order arrived in Period 6. Currently, we have 60 units on hand and 370 units in transit (orders from Periods 3, 4, 6). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable, with recent samples (96, 91, 102, 87, 126, 88, 115, 88) showing no significant trend or seasonal shift yet. The mean demand is approximately 100 units per period. With L=4, the base stock should cover 5 periods (L+1), which is approximately 500 units. Since 60 (on-hand) + 370 (in-transit) = 430, the system will naturally order around 70 units to bridge the gap to the base stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand stability while ignoring the very first few samples, and 'default' for L since the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a confirmed lead time of L=4. Historical demand over the last 7 periods averages approximately 97.4 units (102, 87, 126, 88, 115, 88, 76). The most recent three periods (P5-P7) show a Slight downward trend (115, 88, 76), but given the variability (std dev ~17), I will use the mean of all available 7 samples to stabilize the forecast. Current on-hand is 113, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 316, totaling 429 units of inventory. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, leading to a target base stock at the median of the demand distribution over L+1 periods. L=4 remains consistent with the promised lead time and historical arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-56.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of concluded periods 5 through 8 confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (matches promised). Historical demand from Period 1 to 8 shows a mean of approximately 97.1 units with some variability. Currently, on-hand inventory is 151 units and in-transit is 266 units (total pipeline = 417). Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the 'calculate' method for L is appropriate here as it tracks the observed 4-period lead time. For mu_hat, using all 8 available historical demand data points (mean \u2248 97.1) via 'default' or 'recent_N' is suitable; I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to focus on the full available history. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture observed volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers expected demand while accounting for the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (aiming for a 50% service level fundamentally, but the capped policy manages risk).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistent at 4 periods, as orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 arrived exactly 4 periods later. The order from Period 5 was 0, which explains why 'arrived=0' was reported in the Period 9 conclude message. We are currently expecting the order of 108 units from Period 6 to arrive during Period 10. Demand has been relatively stable, with the most recent 5 periods (P5-P9) showing an average of 90.2 units/period, compared to the overall average of 95.2. Given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, meaning our base stock should target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the slight downward trend in recent demand, and 'default' for lead time and sigma_hat to maintain stability based on the promised lead time and historical volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods. Since P5, we have observed consistent arrivals following a 4-period lag (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). An apparent gap occurred in P9 because no order was placed in P5 (ordered=0), which is consistent with the 4-period lead time. The arrival in P10 was the order from P6. Therefore, L is stable at 4. On-hand inventory is 86 units, and pipeline inventory is 269 units (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Demand has shown a slight downward shift; the first 5 periods (samples provided + history) averaged ~108, while the last 5 periods (P6-P10) averaged ~86.4. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a service level, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this lower demand regime. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% from the base-stock formula, though the capped policy will adjust this.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: average decreased from ~108 to ~86 (-20%) over the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting at Period 6. Calculating the mean demand from Period 6 through Period 11 (88, 76, 95, 77, 96, 78) gives an average of 85 units per period, which aligns with the previous insight of a ~20% decrease from the initial levels. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With L=4, the pipeline inventory must cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Current on-hand is 83 and in-transit is 271, totaling 354 units. To maintain safety stock for the current regime, I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last 6 periods of lower, more stable demand. This choice ensures the OR backend is tuned to the current consumption rate rather than the higher initial demand, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $1 profit / $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current demand regime (starting Period 6) shows a sustained average of ~85.3 units (88, 76, 95, 77, 96, 78, 90). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 76, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 259. Since the promised lead time L=4 is reliable, I will use L=4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the demand since the regime shift at Period 6. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to reflect the volatility of this lower-demand period. The backend OR logic will use these parameters to target a base stock covering (1+L)=5 periods of demand, balancing the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost (aiming for a 50% service level due to q = 1/(1+1)).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the product chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 35 and 284 units in transit. Historical lead times have consistently settled at 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, and P13 all confirm L=4). Demand analysis shows a regime shift occurred around Period 6. Pre-Period 6 demand averaged ~108, while demand from Period 6 to Period 13 has averaged approximately 89. However, the last two periods (P12 & P13) show an uptick (90 and 110 respectively). I will use N=8 for mu_hat to capture the current post-shift regime (P6-P13) which covers these recent fluctuations. Sigma_hat will also use N=8 to reflect the volatility of this specific regime. With Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand over the protection interval (L+1=5 periods). Setting L to 'default' (promised 4) is appropriate as actual lead time matches promised.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (On-hand: 0). The demand in Period 14 (82) slightly exceeded the available supply (77). Reviewing historical demand, there was a shift around Period 6. From Period 6-14, the average demand is 87.2 units, compared to the early average of 103.6 units for Periods 1-5. However, the last two periods (P13: 110, P14: 82) averaged 96, suggesting a possible slight rebound or higher volatility. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on all 'conclude' messages. We have 351 units in-transit (P11-14 orders). To ensure we return to optimal base stock levels while accounting for the recent demand regime, I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering the stable lower-demand regime from P6-P14). This provides a mean demand of ~436 over the (L+1) horizon. Given Profit = $1.0 and Holding = $1.0, the OR target cycle service level is 50%, which seeks to minimize total cost by balancing stocking against holding costs.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 16. On-hand inventory is 0, following two consecutive periods of stockouts (Period 14 and 15) where demand exceeded available stock. The in-transit inventory is 363 units. Reviewing the arrival history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by recent arrivals from P10 and P11). In Period 16, we expect the order from Period 12 (71 units) to arrive during the arrival resolution phase. Demand analysis: the demand regime shifted around Period 6 to a lower mean. Over the last 10 periods (P6-P15), the average demand is 90.7 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 13.0. Given the high stockout risk (on-hand is 0) and the lead time of 4 periods, we need to ensure the pipeline covers 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable regime while providing enough data points for volatility estimation. L is set to 'calculate' to rely on the stable observed lead time of 4.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, current on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (Periods 13-16) shows a slight uptick (110, 82, 112, 78) compared to the previous regime of ~86 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (381 units) consists of orders from Period 13 (94), Period 14 (109), Period 15 (89), and Period 16 (89). The Period 13 order is expected to arrive during this period (Period 17), resolving the stockout seen in Periods 14-16. I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current mean demand of ~91.6 units (covering the most recent regime including the slight uptick) across the lead time + current period (L+1=5). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to reflect current volatility and ensure safety stock levels protect against the stockouts observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~92 units (last 6 periods average) starting from Period 11, slightly higher than the Period 6 shift.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 11-17) has stabilized around an average of 91.85 units (78, 90, 110, 82, 112, 78, 53). Although Period 17 saw a lower demand of 53, the overall trend supports keeping the recent_N window at 7 periods to capture this stabilized regime. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P13). There is currently an on-hand inventory of 41 units and a high pipeline of 365 units in-transit. By using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend will calculate demand parameters based on this stabilized period (approximately 92/period), while the capped policy will naturally reduce ordering to account for the incoming pipeline and the relatively high holding cost ($1.0) compared to profit ($1.0), which suggests a neutral target service level (z-score near 0).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19, the demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward shift over the last two periods (P17: 53, P18: 30) compared to the previous stable average of approximately 92. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is roughly 71, but the very recent drop suggests a potential new low-demand regime or seasonal dip. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (120) and a large pipeline (281), we are currently overstocked relative to recent demand. To prevent further inventory accumulation and high holding costs (equal to profit per unit), I am switching to a 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting with N=5 to capture the recent deceleration, while maintaining 'calculate' for lead time and using 'recent_N' for sigma to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop observed starting Period 17: Average demand fell from ~92 back down to ~41.5 over the last two periods (P17-P18), suggesting a potential volatility shift or new downward regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-109.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant decline over the last three periods (P17-P19), with demand values of 53, 30, and 50 respectively. The average demand during this recent window is 44.3, which is a major drop from the previous regime average of ~92. While on-hand inventory (159) and in-transit units (192) are relatively high, the OR backend needs updated parameters to reflect this lower demand regime to avoid further overstocking, as the holding cost ($1.0) is equal to unit profit ($1.0). Carrying-over the lead time insight (confirmed 4 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this downturn. This will reduce mu_hat appropriately, allowing the base-stock calculation to inventory for the projected demand and prevent excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 17: average decreased from ~92 to ~44 (-52%) over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-76.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data shows a significant shift in demand. From Period 1 to 16, demand was relatively high (averaging ~92 in the later part of that window), but from Period 17 onward, it dropped significantly, though Period 20 showed a rebound to 86. The average of the last 4 periods (P17-P20) is 54.75. Given the high on-hand inventory (162) and in-transit units (103), the current stock levels far exceed the requirements for the recent lower-demand regime. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 reflects the current lower average demand (~55 units/period) better than the long-term average, which helps prevent further over-ordering while the system burns through excess inventory. A higher sigma_hat is justified due to the recent volatility (swing from 30 to 86).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased after the Period 17 drop: P17-P20 demand values were 53, 30, 50, 86. While the regime shift to a lower average (~55) is confirmed, the variance is currently higher than previous regimes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-108.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower, yet volatile, regime since Period 17. The recent five periods (P17-P21) show demand values of 53, 30, 50, 86, and 66, resulting in an average of 57.0 units. This is significantly lower than the previous regime (~92). On-hand inventory is currently high (174 units) compared to this demand level, leading to potential holding costs as Profit/Holding cost ratio is 1:1 ($1.0 each). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we have a high on-hand balance and a new stable demand level, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the mean of 57.0 across the (L+1)=5 period horizon. For sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current higher volatility observed in this regime (standard deviation of ~20.9). Lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at Period 17: Average demand is 57.0 (P17-P21) with increased volatility compared to early periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-125.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 17. Looking at the most recent 6 periods (P17-P22), demand values are 53, 30, 50, 86, 66, and 37, resulting in a mean of 53.7 and a standard deviation of approximately 19.8. This confirms the lower, high-volatility regime compared to earlier stages of the game. On-hand inventory is currently high (162 units) due to arrivals from previous higher-demand forecasts. In-transit inventory stands at 86 units (derived from orders in P19=0, P20=0, P21=9, P22=77). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting L to 'calculate' to use historical data. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=6 to capture this current low-demand/high-volatility regime (P17-P22) accurately without being skewed by the much higher demand seen prior to Period 17.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P17-P22) is stable at a lower average (~54 units/period) but features significantly higher volatility (std dev ~20) compared to previous periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-122.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 17. Over the last 7 periods (P17-P23), the mean demand is approximately 48.86 units/period (53, 30, 50, 86, 66, 37, 20). There is a notable downward trend within this window, with the most recent sample at 20. The volatility (standard deviation) in this recent period is approximately 22, which is higher than the early periods relative to the mean. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations (P18 arrived at P22; Period 19 had 0 ordered, explaining the 0 arrival in P23). With 142 units on-hand and 107 in transit (total 249), and a projected demand of ~49 units/period, we have approximately 5 periods of cover. Using recent_N=7 for demand capture (P17-P23) accurately captures the current lower-demand, high-volatility regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 17 continues to show a downward trend within its lower average; P23 demand dropped to 20 units. Average demand (P17-P23) is ~49 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-70.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 17 continues to show lower averages and high relative volatility. Demand over the last 8 periods (P17-P24) has been 53, 30, 50, 86, 66, 37, 20, and 36, averaging approximately 47.25 units. This is a significant drop from the previous regime (~92). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (106) and in-transit units (107), we have a total pipeline of 213 units, which comfortably covers expected demand for the (L+1)=5 period horizon (approx 236 units based on recent mean). Because profit and holding coastal are equal ($1.0), the backend's default service level q is 0.5, meaning it targets the mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend adjusts its base stock down to avoid excessive holding costs, while accounting for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 17 narrowed: average demand P17-P24 is ~47 units, a -49% decrease from the P11-P16 average (~92), with sustained high volatility (std dev ~21).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 17. From Period 17 to Period 25 (9 samples), the mean demand is ~47.7 units with a standard deviation of ~19.5. This is a dramatic decrease from the ~92 mean observed between Periods 11-16. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P21 order arriving at P25). Inventory management is currently focused on reducing excess stock; we have 64 units on-hand and 122 in-transit, while our expected demand for the (L+1=5) period window is approximately 238 units. Choosing recent_N=9 for mu_hat captures this current low-demand regime. For sigma_hat, recent_N=9 is also used to reflect the increased volatility observed in this lower regime (standard deviation increased to ~20 compared to earlier periods).

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P17-P25) mean is ~48 units, down from ~92 (-48%), with sustained higher volatility (std dev ~20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-37.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 17, and it has stabilized at a significantly lower average with higher volatility. Over the last 10 periods (P17-P26), demand has averaged approximately 48.3 units (53, 30, 50, 86, 66, 37, 20, 36, 51, 52), with a standard deviation of roughly 19.3. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 89 and in-transit units at 98 (totaling 187 pipeline inventory), and a target based on 5 periods (L+1) of demand, we need to adjust parameters to reflect this recent 10-period regime. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat captures the current lower demand trend, while recent_N=10 for sigma_hat accounts for the increased volatility relative to the mean. This helps prevent overstocking (given the 1:1 profit to holding cost ratio) while maintaining enough buffer for the high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 17 and has stabilized around an average of 50.18 units (mean of P17-P27) compared to the previous ~92 average. Recent demand is fairly consistent (P25: 51, P26: 52, P27: 58). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 52 and 131 units in-transit, the pipeline is relatively full compared to the new lower demand level. I will use a recent window (N=11, reflecting the regime shift from P17 onwards) for demand and calculation for lead time to capture the observed state accurately. Sustaining a high sigma (standard deviation) is necessary due to the historical volatility within this lower regime (e.g., P23 was 20 while P27 was 58).

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (Period 17-27) average demand is 50.18 units, stable but with moderate volatility (range 20-86).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable at a lower average of approximately 50 units per period since Period 17 (P17-P28 mean = 50.0). Recent volatility remains moderate. On-hand inventory is very low (4 units). While in-transit inventory is high (193 units), the OR backend handles the base stock calculation relative to pipeline inventory. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. I am using recent_N=12 to capture the entirety of the current regime (since P17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the forecast reflects the lower demand level while accounting for the increased variance observed in this period range.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 17 and has remained stable but volatile. At Period 30, the mean demand from Period 17 to Period 29 is approx 49.3 units per period. Recently (P25-P29), the average is slightly higher at 53.2 units, but the overall lower-average regime holds. The stockout at the end of P29 (ending on-hand: 0) was caused by a zero arrival in Period 28 (order from P24 was likely 0 units as shown in history) and a small arrival in Period 29. However, there are 217 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given Profit=1 and Holding=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend toward the mean. I will use recent_N=13 for mu_hat (P17-P29) and recent_N=13 for sigma_hat to capture the shift in both volume and volatility accurately while accounting for the current stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 17-29 average is 49.3 units (down ~46% from P11-P16). Recent volatility remains higher (std dev ~17) than the earliest periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context (starting Period 17) remains stabilized at a lower average of approximately 49-50 units per period compared to earlier stages. Analysis of periods 17-30 shows a mean demand of 49.33 units. Although the stock out in Period 30 (sold 53, demand 62) highlights the impact of volatility (std dev ~17.5), the inventory replenishment is currently driven by a fairly consistent 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is 0, and in-transit is 194. With L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). A base stock calculation using the current regime (N=14) gives a total required pipeline of approximately (1+4)*49.3 = 246.5 units. Given 194 in-transit and 0 on-hand, the system needs to order to reach the target base stock. I will use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime's characteristics while mitigating the influence of much higher demand from the first 16 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 17 and has remained stable but volatile since then. The average demand from Period 17 to Period 31 is approximately 50.4 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 16.7. Recent periods (P29-P31: 55, 62, 30) confirm this range. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P27 order arrived in P31). Current inventory position is tight: 24 on-hand with 198 in-transit. A stockout occurred in P29 and P30 due to arrival timing, though P31 saw a recovery. I will use the recent demand regime (last 15 periods, P17-P31) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the current sustained market behavior. L will remain at the promised/observed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 17 onwards is confirmed stable: Period 17-31 average demand is 50.4 units with a standard deviation of 16.7. This represents a sustained -45% drop from the mid-game peak (~92).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 50.4 units and a standard deviation of 16.7. This represents a significant decline from early to middle periods of the game. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on recently concluded arrivals (P22 ordered arrived P26, P23 arrived P27, P25 arrived P29, P26 arrived P30, P27 arrived P31, P28 arrived P32). Pipeline inventory is currently 159 units, and on-hand inventory is 62 units. Since the hold cost and profit are equal ($1.0), the backend aims for a 50% service level which means base stock will be close to the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the entire stable regime starting from Period 17 (Periods 17-32) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend uses the most representative data for the current demand state while ignoring the much higher demand seen in the first half of the game.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 50.4 units and a standard deviation of 16.7. Recent demand in Period 33 was 63 units, which is slightly above the average but within the expected volatility range. Lead times have consistently remained at the promised 4 periods, with the Period 29 order arriving exactly 4 periods later in Period 33. On-hand inventory is 47, and pipeline inventory is 127, totaling 174. Given the lead time (L=4) and the current period (T), we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. At an average of 51 units/period, we need ~255 units. The current total inventory (174) is below this target, so I am using the 'recent_N' method for demand parameters to focus on the stable regime from Period 17 (N=17 for the current Period 34). This will allow the OR backend to calculate the appropriate base stock for this low-demand, moderate-volatility environment.

The demand regime since Period 17 remains stable with an average of approximately 50 units per period.

The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual observations (most recently P30 order arrived in P34). Pipeline inventory is at 165 units, and on-hand inventory is 59 units. Given that (1+L) * mean demand (5 * 48.5 = 242.5) is very close to current total inventory (59 + 165 = 224), I will maintain the current regime parameters using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (capturing the entire stable period since the shift at P17) to smooth out recent volatility while reflecting the lower demand average.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 17 continues to be stable. For the last 19 periods (P17-P35), the average demand is 48.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. Recent demand in the last 5 periods (P31-P35) has shown slightly more variance (60, 18, 63, 24, 60) but maintains a similar mean. Since Period 17, lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this long-term stable regime (N=19) to filter out high-frequency noise while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the observed volatility. The current on-hand inventory (57) and pipeline (117) are sufficient, but we must continue ordering to cover the (L+1) window of ~242 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 50.4 units and moderate volatility (std dev ~16.7). Recent demand from Period 32 to 36 has been 24, 63, 18, 60, and 34, continuing this pattern. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the history (e.g., P32 order arrived P36). Current on-hand inventory is 46, and in-transit is 157. Total pipeline inventory is 203. Given the base stock calculation targets (1+L) periods of demand, and L=4, we are covering 5 periods. 5 * 50.4 = 252 units. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 (covering the stable regime since P17) and keep L at default (4). This ensures the OR backend targets approximately 252 units total system inventory minus current pipeline, while accounting for the recent higher volatility compared to the game start.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, lower-volume regime since Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 49.3 units per period (calculated from Period 17 to Period 37). While individual periods show fluctuations (e.g., Period 37 demand was 69, Period 34 was 18), the overall trend does not show a new sustained regime shift. Lead times are consistently 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, with 172 units in-transit. These in-transit units include orders from Periods 34 (68 units), 35 (10 units), 36 (63 units), and 37 (31 units). Based on lead time, the 68 units from Period 34 are expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 38. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=21, covering the regime since P17) and lead time (N=5) to ensure parameters reflect the current lower-demand environment while accounting for recent volatility. Specifically, mu_hat will target roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1), which at ~49 units/period is ~245 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 50 units. The most recent demand (P38) was 55 units. Over the last 5 periods (P34-P38), the demand was 18, 60, 34, 69, 55, resulting in an average of 47.2 units. Volatility remains moderate to high compared to earlier periods, so I will continue using a recent_N window of 10 for sigma_hat to capture this variability without overreacting to single peaks. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The pipeline is currently full with 171 units in-transit, while on-hand inventory is low at 13 units. An arrival from the Period 35 order (10 units) is expected next period. Using N=20 for mu_hat captures the stable long-term mean of the current regime (~50 units) to ensure sufficient stock for the (L+1) period horizon while maintaining stability in the base stock calculation.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 17, with an average of approximately 50 units per period. Recent periods (P33-P39) show a slight increase in mean demand (approx. 51.5) and sustained volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the last two periods (P37, P39) resulted in stockouts due to demand (69, 62) exceeding available stock (62, 23). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Orders from P36, P37, P38, and P39 are in transit (total 221 units). To address the current stockout and maintain the service level while managing holding costs, I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility (P30-P39), which reflects the recent demand levels more accurately than the full history.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 17, with a mean around 50 units and moderate volatility. Recent demand (P31-P40) averages 48.0 units, which is consistent with the long-term regime mean of 50.4 identified in earlier carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 36 order in Period 40. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 176 units in transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, P40). To maintain the target base stock, I will use recent history (N=10) to capture the current demand mean and volatility, ensuring L=4 is used. The chosen parameters aim to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods, balancing the risk of stockouts against holding costs where profit equals holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand regime has been stable since Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 50.4 units. Recent demand (P37-P41) shows values of 69, 55, 62, 65, 44, which maintains this average range. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are 209 units in transit. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P38-P41). I will continue to use a recent_N approach with N=25 (covering the regime from Period 17 to Period 41) to capture the current mean and the elevated volatility observed in this regime compared to the very early periods. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1) while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime established at Period 17. For the most recent 10 periods (P33-P42), the average demand is 52.0 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.4. The lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P38 order arrived P42). On-hand inventory is low (17), but in-transit inventory is high (179), which covers the pipeline for approximately 3.4 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=26 (Period 17 to Period 42) to capture the full characteristics of the current stable regime. L is set to 'calculate' as the lead time of 4 is confirmed and stable.

The demand regime has been stable since Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 50 units and higher volatility compared to earlier periods. Recent periods (P33-P43) show an average demand of 49.6 units, reinforcing this stability. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. With only 7 periods remaining in the game (P44-P50), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=27 (the length of the current regime from P17 to P43). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the sustained lower mean (~50) and the increased variance (std dev ~17) observed in this regime. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as historical data shows it remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 50.4 units and moderate volatility (std dev ~16.7). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. As we are approaching the end of the game (Period 45 of 50), the primary goal is to maintain enough stock to meet demand over the remaining lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods) while avoiding excessive holding costs, especially as the game concludes. Current in-transit inventory is 173, and on-hand is 27, totaling 200 units. Over 5 periods, expected demand (50.4 * 5) is approximately 252 units. To prevent stockouts, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=28 (covering the stable regime from P17 to P44) and default for L (4).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 50 units and a standard deviation of about 17. Looking at the most recent periods (P41-P45), demand has been 44, 50, 26, 42, 42, which averages to 40.8. However, the longer-term stable average of ~50 provides a more robust forecast for this phase. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P46-P50), the strategy shifts toward maintaining enough stock to capture remaining sales while minimizing ending inventory costs. My inventory position (on-hand 49 + in-transit 150 = 199) is sufficient to cover approximately 4 periods of demand at the average rate of 50. Since the game ends after Period 50, and items ordered now (P46) with a 4-period lead time will arrive in Period 50 (the final resolution phase), this is the last or second-to-last meaningful order. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=29 (tracing back to the start of the current regime at Period 17) to provide the OR backend with the most accurate parameters for this stable but volatile period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-10.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 50 units and a standard deviation around 16.7. Recent demand (P42-P46: 50, 26, 42, 42, 38) shows a slight dip, averaging 39.6, but remains within the established volatile range. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations (e.g., P42 order arrived in P46). Inventory levels are currently managed with 48 units on-hand and 154 units in-transit, totaling 202 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A safety stock calculation using the backend's logic for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=30 (covering the stable Period 17-46 range) will provide a robust base stock that accounts for the observed volatility while minimizing holding costs as the game nears its end (Period 50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The demand regime starting from Period 17 has remained stable with a mean of approximately 50 units and moderate volatility. Historical lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 3 decision cycles remaining (P48, P49, P50), and 140 units already in-transit (orders from P44, P45, P46, P47 expected to arrive in P48, P49, P50, and P51 respectively), the primary goal is to maximize profit while minimizing ending inventory in the final period. The current on-hand inventory is 38. Total demand over the next 3 periods is expected to be around 150 units. The pipeline of 140 plus current 38 equals 178 units, which is likely sufficient to cover demand through the end of the simulation. For the OR parameters, I will use 'recent_N' with N=31 (the length of the current stable regime from P17 to P47) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the backend uses the accurate lower-demand baseline. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the promised 4 periods remains accurate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. Reviewing the demand history from Period 17 onwards, the average demand is approximately 50.4 units with consistent volatility (std dev ~16.7). Recent demand (Periods 47-48) was slightly higher (60, 64) than this long-term average, leading to a stockout at the end of Period 48. On-hand inventory is 0, and there are 180 units in-transit (orders from P45, P46, P47, P48). Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we expect the P45 order (41 units) to arrive in the resolution phase of Period 49. To account for the recent demand strength and the high lead-time-plus-review period (L+1=5), I will use the recent regime (P17-P48, N=32) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Setting L to 'calculate' handles the stable 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the final period (Period 50). The demand regime has remained stable since Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 50-51 units per period and a standard deviation of roughly 16-17. Recent samples (P40-P49) show a mean of 47.4. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods. Since this is the last decision period and the goal is to maximize total reward, the order placed now will not arrive until Period 54 (4 periods later), which is beyond the game's duration. Therefore, the priority is to ensure the OR backend utilizes sufficient parameters to cover the remaining periods if the game were to continue, though any order placed now will not affect the final score. I will use N=33 for mu_hat (covering the stable regime from P17 onwards) to capture the long-term stable mean of 50.3, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the slightly higher volatility seen in later stages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 17 to end of game (Period 49) confirmed stable with a mean of 50.3 and a standard deviation of 16.5, representing a permanent -45% shift from mid-game levels.
