Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical system performance or 'conclude' messages yet, however, demand data for the first 5 periods is provided (118, 124, 116, 96, 91). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no lead time observations, I will use the 'default' method for L. For demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat), I will use the 'default' method which utilizes all available historical samples provided (Periods 1-5). The base stock calculation will target a service level based on the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), and the current inventory is 0, so the system needs to place an initial order to cover demand throughout the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an initial order of 133 units was placed, but because the promised lead time is 4 periods, it will not arrive until Period 5 (visible in Period 6 start). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 133 in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 102. Historical demand from the provided sample shows: 118, 124, 116, 96, 91 (Mean: 109). Period 1 demand (102) is consistent with this range. I will use 'default' for L to stick with the promised lead time of 4. Since we have very few observations (only 1 period of active game history, but 5 historical samples), I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the backend to use all available data points (109 average) for the (1+L) calculation. This approach covers the pipeline requirement for the 4-period lead time.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 are still in transit and are not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively, which explains the current 0 on-hand inventory and lost sales (demand not met). The available demand history (Periods 1-2 and the provided pre-game samples Periods 1-5) shows a mean demand of approximately 104.6 units per period (118, 124, 116, 96, 91 from samples; 102, 87 from game history). There is a slight downward trend in the most recent periods (96, 91, 102, 87). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this recent lower demand level (avg ~94) while acknowledging the lead time of 4. L is set to default (4). Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the overall historical volatility.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (133, 130, and 118 units respectively) are still in-transit, totaling 381 units. Following the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Consequently, we have had 0 sales to date because on-hand inventory has been 0. Historical demand samples (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) suggest a mean demand of approximately 109 units per period. The recent demand in the game history (102, 87, 126) averages to 105. Since the promised lead time is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using all 5 provided pre-game samples plus the 3 observed game periods (total N=8) to establish the forecast. No evidence yet to deviate from the promised lead time of 4.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Consequently, on-hand inventory is currently 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no stock has arrived yet. Demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable over the first four periods (102, 87, 126, 88), with an average of 100.75. Demand for Period 5 is 91 (per historical data provided). For the OR parameters, I will use the promised lead time (L=4) as we have not yet seen any completed delivery cycles to contradict it. Mu_hat and sigma_hat will be based on all available demand samples (Periods 1-5) to provide a stable forecast, as no significant trend or seasonality is yet apparent. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand, accounting for the 514 units already in the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $442.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4. Period 5 conclude confirms the order from Period 1 arrived after exactly 4 periods (arrived in Period 5). This validates the lead time theory. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 102, 87, 126, 88, 115 (Mean: 103.6, Std Dev: 16.9). Currently, on-hand is 18 and in-transit is 424 (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~104, coverage needs to be around 520 units. Our current pipeline + on-hand is 18 + 424 = 442, which is slightly low. I will use the default methods for L and sigma_hat as there is no evidence of lead time drift or volatility shifts yet. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of all 5 available samples to stabilize the forecast, as demand appears relatively stationary around 104 units.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in P5 (from P1 order) and P6 (from P2 order). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the first 6 periods has been relatively stable with a mean of 101 units and a standard deviation of approximately 16.2. On-hand inventory is 60, with 399 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). The total pipeline inventory (inclusive of on-hand) is 459, which covers approximately 4.5 periods of average demand. Since lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I will use the default lead time (4) and use all available historical demand samples (N=6) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as there is no evidence of a regime shift yet. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the 5-period risk horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $202.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the first 7 periods averages 97.4 units (samples: 102, 87, 126, 88, 115, 88, 76). The demand appears relatively stable with moderate variance; there is no clear seasonal trend or structural shift yet. In terms of lead time, orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 arrived exactly in 4 periods as promised, following the logic (Arrival at Period N+L, observed at N+L+1). Specifically, P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6, and P3 order arrived P7. The 'default' L (4) is accurate. I will use all available demand samples (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to establish a robust baseline. On-hand inventory is 102 and In-transit is 358 (orders from Periods 4, 5, 6, and 7), which aligns with the lead-time expectations.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe a stable environment for 'chips(Regular)'. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Current inventory is 140 units on-hand with 286 in-transit (orders from P5, P6, P7, P8). Demand has been relatively stable with a slight downward trend or variance (last 5 periods: 115, 88, 76, 95, and historical samples 118, 124, 116, 96, 91). The average demand over the available 8 periods of execution history is approximately 99 units/period. The backend calculates base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My goal is to maintain the service level while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the full execution history and 'default' for sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $202.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since Period 5, we have consistently observed actual arrivals confirming a lead time of exactly 4 periods (P1 at P5, P2 at P6, P3 at P7, P4 at P8, and P5 at P9). Current on-hand inventory is 106 units with 334 units in transit (expected arrivals for P6, P7, P8, and P9). The demand history for chips(Regular) shows relatively stable behavior with some fluctuations. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has an average of approximately 88.8 units (115, 88, 76, 95, 77), while the overall average is slightly higher. Given the consistency of the lead time, I will set L to 4 using the 'calculate' method. For demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (all available data since demand started) to capture a reliable baseline while covering the (L+1) window effectively. This balances protecting against stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Analysis of the first 10 periods confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5 through P10). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively consistent, with a mean of approximately 95 units per period (ranging from 76 to 126). Since there is no significant evidence of a regime shift or seasonal trend in the available 10 data points, a 'default' or 'recent_N' approach is appropriate. However, using recent_N=10 (all available demand data) provides a more grounded estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat than just relying on the seed samples. On-hand inventory is 115 and in-transit is 296, totaling 411 units. With a target base stock based on (1+L)=5 periods of demand (approx 5 * 95 = 475), the OR backend will calculate a modest order to fill the gap while accounting for the high service level indicated by the profit/holding cost ratio ($4/$1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $198.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) appears stable, showing no major seasonal shifts or regime changes based on the first 11 periods of data (average demand ~94 units). Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all 7 concluded orders. Currently, we have 114 units on-hand and 313 units in-transit (orders from Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11). Given a 4-period lead time, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~94 units, the required base stock is approximately 470-500 units. Our current pipeline (114 + 313 = 427) is slightly below this, so the OR backend should trigger a small replenishment order. I will use 'default' for L (4 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full observed demand history while protecting against the initial zero-sales periods where demand was unmet due to lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 13. Based on the history from Period 5 to Period 12, the lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for the last 12 periods has been relatively stable, with values ranging from 76 to 126. The mean of all available historical demand samples (including the seed data) is approximately 100.8 units per period. Since the lead time L is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean of all samples (approximately 101) results in a mu_hat calculation of (1+4) * 101 = 505. Standard deviation of all samples is roughly 16.2, leading to a sigma_hat of sqrt(5) * 16.2 \u2248 36.3. Given the stability of the demand and the reliability of the 4-period lead time, I will use the default methods which utilize all historical data to provide a robust estimate for the base-stock policy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $374.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14. The demand history (Periods 1-13) shows a relatively stable mean. The mean demand over the last 13 periods is approximately 94 units. Observed lead times consistently match the promised lead time of 4 periods. With L=4, we are aiming to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. The pipeline inventory (344) plus current on-hand (66) equals 410. Given a demand mean of ~94, 5 periods of demand equates to roughly 470 units. My current inventory position (410) is slightly below the required level for a high service level. Therefore, I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and lead time (L) to capture the most recent stable regime, while using a default sigma_hat to account for historical volatility. N=13 includes all data points where arrivals and actual demand resolutions have occurred, providing a robust statistical base.

Daily Reward (R_t): $277.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed through historical arrivals (P1-P10). Average demand remains stable with no significant shifts detected over the last 14 periods. Recent demand (P11-P14) exhibits a mean of approximately 90 units per period, which is slightly lower than the all-time average including the user-provided samples. To ensure a balanced inventory level that accounts for the (L+1) exposure period, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to filter out the very early startup volatility while maintaining a robust sample size. The on-hand inventory is currently at 51, and with an in-transit pipeline of 370 units (orders from P11, P12, P13, P14), the inventory position is adequate compared to the expected demand of ~450 units over the next 5 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival from Period 1 through Period 11, confirming it as reliable. Demand for chips(Regular) shows a stable mean without significant jumps or trends in the first 15 periods (mean approx 94 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 33 units, which is relatively low compared to the average demand. However, there are 335 units in-transit (orders from P12-P15), with the Period 12 order (71 units) expected to arrive during this period (Period 16). Since the demand process is stable, I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture recent variability while smoothing out noise. Given the pattern is consistent, I'll set N to the length of the current stable regime (15 periods). L is set to 'calculate' as the historical lead times are consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) remains relatively stable, with an average demand across the first 16 periods being approximately 94.2 units. Recent demand (last 5 periods) shows a slight increase in volatility but the mean remains around 93 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by all concluded arrival messages (P5 through P16). Currently, we have 26 units on-hand and 384 units in-transit. The in-transit units correspond to orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16 (112 + 93 + 59 + 120 = 384), which are expected to arrive in Periods 17, 18, 19, and 20 respectively. Since there are no missing shipments and the lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the full stable regime observed since the start of the game, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) or 5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 17 periods. Analyzing the historical demand (excluding periods before ordering began or initial noise), the mean demand for Periods 1-17 is approximately 91.5 with a standard deviation of 17.6. Recently (Periods 13-17), the demand has fluctuated (110, 82, 112, 78, 53), suggesting slight volatility but no clear structural regime shift yet. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in every 'conclude' message (e.g., Period 13 order arrived at Period 17). At the end of Period 17, we have 85 units on-hand and 360 units in-transit (orders from Periods 14, 15, 16, and 17). Since L=4, the base stock should cover 1+L=5 periods of demand. Using the long-term stable mean (\u224892) results in an expected requirement of 460 units. Pipeline + On-hand is currently 445 units (85+360), which is close to the requirement. Given the stable lead time and mean, I will use 'calculate' for lead time and 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture the full stable history of demand while allowing for recent variability to influence the sigma.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the inventory on-hand is 148 with 313 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. A downward demand shift is observed starting at Period 17 (demand dropped from around 80-110 units to 53 in Period 17 and 30 in Period 18). This shift likely reflects the end of a high-demand cycle for regular chips. Using a recent demand window (last 3 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is necessary to avoid overstocking while demand is declining. L=4 is stable and confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Average demand decreased from ~90 to ~40 (-55%) over the last 2-3 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift observed at Period 17 is now firmly established over three consecutive periods (P17: 53, P18: 30, P19: 50), with the average dropping from ~92 to ~44 units (-52%). I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower baseline and higher relative volatility. Observed lead time is stable at 4 periods (P15 order arrived P19), so L remains at 'default'. With 157 units on hand and 254 in transit\u2014totaling 411 units against a significantly reduced demand forecast of ~220 units for the (L+1) horizon\u2014the system is overstocked. Using recent_N will lower the base stock target, causing the OR backend to restrict further ordering until the surplus inventory is depleted, thereby minimizing holding costs while units are sold.

Daily Reward (R_t): $153.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downwards shift. Until Period 16, the average demand was approximately 93 units per period. Starting at Period 17, the last four periods have recorded demands of 53, 30, 50, and 86 (averaging ~55). While Period 20 showed a higher value (86), the overall trend justifies a more conservative forecast to avoid excessive inventory given the $1/unit holding cost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 191 and in-transit is 134, totaling 325 units. With the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we are well-covered for the (L+1)=5 period horizon if we anticipate the new lower average. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (to capture the shift from Period 17 onwards) and sigma_hat (to reflect recent volatility). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 17: Average demand decreased from ~93 to ~55 over the last 4 periods (P17-P20).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 17. Previous average demand was approximately 93 units, but the last 5 periods (P17-P21) show a lower average of approximately 57 units (53, 30, 50, 86, 66). While P20 and P21 showed slight recovery, the overall trend remains lower than the initial baseline. We have high on-hand inventory (213 units) and 46 units in-transit (reaching us in Period 22). To avoid excessive holding costs in this lower-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the last 5 periods of lower demand. L remains at the confirmed 4 periods. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 5 periods to reflect the current volatility of this new regime.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 17. Previous average demand was approximately 90-100 units, but recent demand (Periods 17-22: 53, 30, 50, 86, 66, 37) suggests a new mean of approximately 54 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (222 units) and 65 units are already in-transit, which is more than enough to cover the lead time + review period demand at the current rate (5 * 54 = 270 units). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this lower demand regime (P17-P22), and sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect current volatility. This configuration helps the OR backend reduce unnecessary replenishment given the high inventory and lower sales rate.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 17, decreasing from an average of ~93 to approximately 52 over the last 8 periods (P17-P24). The inventory levels are currently high (On-hand: 166) relative to this new demand level, and there are 216 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory and the reduced demand trend, the focus is on preventing overstocking while adjusting to the new mean. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This should help the OR engine avoid excessive orders while maintaining a buffer for the lower demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime shift: Average demand from P17-P24 is ~52 units/period, confirmed significantly lower than the P1-P16 average of ~93.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 17. The pre-shift average (P1-P16) was approximately 93 units/period, whereas the post-shift average (P17-P25) is approximately 47.6 units/period (Demand: 53, 30, 50, 86, 66, 37, 20, 36, 51). In the most recent 9 periods, demand has stabilized at this lower level. Currently, on-hand inventory is 115 units and there are 216 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed history. Given the new demand regime, the current pipeline and on-hand inventory are more than sufficient to cover the (L+1) window (approx. 5 periods * 48 units/period = 240 units). I will use the recent N (N=9) to capture the lower demand mean and variance while maintaining the default lead time calculation to avoid over-ordering during this adjustment phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 17 is well-established. From Period 17 to Period 26 (10 periods), the average demand is approximately 53.1 units (sum: 53+30+50+86+66+37+20+36+51+52 = 481 / 9 = 53.4, or 10 periods 481/10=48.1). Looking at specifically the lower regime, N=10 captures this recent behavior. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion for the Period 22 order. However, there are gaps in arrivals: Orders from P19, P20, and P21 were for 0 units, which explains the '0 arrived' messages in P23-P25. The order from P22 (65 units) arrived on time in P26. On-hand inventory is 128 and In-transit is 151 (from orders in P23/P24). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for Period 27/28/29/30/31. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the new lower demand average (~50/period) ensures we don't over-order while we have significant stock on hand. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=10) to capture the lower volatility of this new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 17. From Period 17 to Period 27, the average demand is ~49.7 units, compared to the P1-P16 average of ~93 units. Recent periods (P25-P27) show stable demand (51, 52, 58). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P22 arrived at P26, P23 arrived at P27). I will use recent_N=11 for mu_hat (covering the lower regime from P17 onwards) to capture this new mean demand. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=11 to reflect the standard deviation of this stable, lower regime. This avoids inflating inventory based on the much higher historical fluctuations seen in the first 16 periods. The on-hand inventory is 90 and in-transit is 131, which is sufficient relative to the current lower demand trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a structural shift around Period 17, moving from a mean of ~93 to a new lower level. From Period 17 to Period 28, the average demand is approximately 53.6 units per period. The recent N (last 12 periods) covers this new regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from Periods 22, 23, and 24 all arriving with 4-period lead times. Currently, on-hand inventory is 173 and in-transit is 59 (the order from Period 28). Since the base stock level (1+L) * mu_hat at the new mean would be approximately 5 * 54 = 270, and our total pipeline (173 + 59 = 232) is fairly close to that, the OR backend will decide if a small top-up is needed. Using recent_N for demand (N=12) and sigma (N=12) captures this new lower-demand, lower-variance environment effectively.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 17, decreasing from an average of ~93 to approximately 52 units per period (P17-P29). The most recent 5 periods (P25-P29) show very stable demand around 52.8. Current inventory (118 on-hand + 105 in-transit) is relatively high given the lower demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Orders from P25 onwards are expected starting Period 29 (though P25 was 0). I will use the recent N=13 for mu_hat (covering the low-demand regime P17-P29) and recent N=13 for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased mean and associated volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the new lower scale of demand and avoids over-ordering, while maintaining sufficient safety stock for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime shift: Average demand from P17-P29 is ~52 units/period, with high consistency (std ~13). Previous regime (P1-P16) was ~93.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 17, dropping from an average of ~93 to approximately ~52 units per period (P17-P30). The last 5 periods (P26-P30) show an average demand of 55 units, indicating stability in this lower regime. The promised lead time is 4 periods and the observed lead time has consistently been 4 periods whenever arrivals conclude (e.g., P28 arrival from P24 order). Currently, on-hand inventory is 56, and in-transit inventory is 161. Pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) = 217. With a forecast demand of ~54 units/period and L=4, the required base stock (covering L+1 periods) is roughly 5 * 54 = 270 units. However, given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), the OR backend will calculate a specific safety stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (P17-P30) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime while maintaining enough history for variance calculation. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to continue using the confirmed 4-period duration.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant downward shift around Period 17, moving from an average of ~93 to approximately ~52. Over the last 15 periods (P17-P31), the mean demand has stabilized at 51.6 with a standard deviation of 15.6. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent historical conclusions (e.g., P28 arrival from P24 order). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (26 units) while in-transit inventory is high (227 units), including orders from Periods 28, 29, 30, and 31. Because the OR backend uses a base-stock policy that subtracts pipeline inventory, the high in-transit amount will naturally throttle new orders to avoid overstocking. I will use recent_N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime accurately while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in the lower regime that started around Period 17. From Period 17 to Period 32, the average demand is approximately 49.3 units per period (standard deviation ~16). The most recent 5 periods (P28-P32) show a slight further decline to an average of ~44 units. The 'Regular chips' product is currently in a stable low-demand phase. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P28 order arriving in P32). Pipeline inventory is high (191 units) relative to recent demand, which explains earlier zero-order periods. For Period 33, I will use recent_N=16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire low-demand regime since Period 17, while using the calculate method for lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period history.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting around Period 17. From Period 17 to Period 33, the average demand is approximately 50.4 units, which is significantly lower than the pre-Period 17 average of ~93 units. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods, although shipments from Periods 19, 20, 21, 25, 26, and 27 were zero-order periods, and shipments from Periods 30 and 31 (ordered at P30 and P31) are currently in-transit. The order from Period 28 arrived in Period 32 (LT=4) and Period 29 arrived in Period 33 (LT=4). Given the current on-hand inventory of 44 and a pipeline of 163, we need to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the current period (total 5 periods). I will set mu_hat based on the last 17 periods (recent_N=17) to capture the current regime's mean (~50) and use recent_N=17 for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current volatility (std ~16.7). L will be set to the confirmed value of 4 using the 'calculate' method to utilize historical lead time performance.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 17, decreasing from an average of ~93 to approximately ~52. In the most recent periods (P31-P34), demand has been even lower and more volatile (30, 24, 63, 18), averaging around 34. The promised lead time is 4, and recent arrivals (P32, P33, P34) confirm the actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the demand is in a lower-volume regime compared to the total history, I will use recent_N (N=18, covering the post-shift period from P17 onwards) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the inventory levels are tuned to the current lower demand environment while maintaining enough buffer for the observed volatility. The current inventory (On-hand: 82, In-transit: 174) is significant relative to current demand, so the OR backend will naturally scale back orders.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 17, dropping from an average of ~93 to approximately ~52 units per period. Evaluating the most recent demand data from Period 17 to Period 35 (19 samples), the mean demand is 49.3 units with a standard deviation of 17.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with recent arrivals (e.g., P31 order arrived in P35). Currently, we have 88 units on hand and 119 units in-transit (total pipeline of 207). Given the (L+1) = 5 period exposure window, the expected demand is roughly 246 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=19 to capture this lower-demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer. The OR backend will use these to adjust the base stock level, helping to prevent excess inventory (holding cost $1.0) while maintaining service levels for the lower demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed stable demand regime (P17-P35): Average 49.3 units, Std 17.5. Previous regime (P1-P16) was ~93 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime since Period 17, with a mean of approximately 49.3 units and a standard deviation of 17.5. The promised lead time is 4, and historical delivery data consistently supports an actual lead time (L) of 4. At the start of Period 37, we have 77 units on hand and 160 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 33-36). This pipeline (160 + 77 = 237) is intended to cover the current period and the 4-period lead time (5 periods total). At the current mean demand of ~49.3, the expected demand over 5 periods is ~246.5. Since the pipeline is close to this target and the OR backend's inventory policy will manage the specific 'base_stock' calculation, I will set 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' using 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the current stable regime (P17-P36). This ensures the backend uses the correct demand profile for the new regime while ignoring the higher demand from Periods 1-16.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 17, with an average of approximately 49 units per period and a standard deviation of 17.5. Recent observations (P31-P37) show demand fluctuating between 18 and 69, confirming this regime persists. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P33 order arriving in P37). Current on-hand inventory is 26 units with 172 units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) and the current period (P38), we must cover demand for periods P38 through P42 (L+1=5 periods). I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=21 (covering the entire stable regime from P17 to P37) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately for the OR backend, ensuring a balanced service level without excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the simulation (P50).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a secondary regime since Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 49.6 units per period and a standard deviation of about 17.1 over the last 22 periods (P17-P38). The initial regime (P1-P16) averaged around 93 units. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods, with orders from P30, P31, P32, P33, and P34 arriving exactly at L=4. Currently, the in-transit inventory (180 units) combined with on-hand inventory (38 units) is being managed to cover the pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods). To maintain the current demand forecast while accounting for the recent variability (e.g., P37 demand was 69), I will use the recent N=22 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this encompasses the entire current stable regime and provides the most accurate reflection of the lowered demand level.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 17 and has remained in a lower-demand regime since. From Period 17 to 39, the mean demand is approximately 49.3 units with a standard deviation of 16.2. Currently, there is a stockout (on-hand is 0) because the arrival in Period 39 (11 units) was insufficient to cover the demand (62 units), resulting in 13 lost sales. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in History and Carry-over Insights), though Period 23 and 24 orders appear to have arrived with some irregularity or were zero-filled; however, Recent orders (P28-P35) confirm the 4-period lead time is stable. I am setting L to 'default' (4), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=23 (covering the regime from P17 to P39) to capture the current lower demand level, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=23 to account for current volatility. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that should cover (L+1) periods of demand, helping to recover from the current stockout while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 17, with an average of approximately 50 units per period and a standard deviation of about 17. Period 39 and 40 experienced stockouts due to high demand (62 and 65 units) relative to recent arrivals, resulting in 0 on-hand inventory at the start of Period 41. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 0 on-hand inventory and 212 units in transit (ordered in Periods 37-40), the current strategy must ensure the pipeline can cover the upcoming (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=24 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the entire current demand regime (Periods 17-40) to provide a stable forecast. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the highly consistent 4-period lead time observed in history.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 250 units in transit. Historical demand since the regime shift at Period 17 has stabilized around an average of 50-55 units. Recent periods (P37-P41) show demand levels of [69, 55, 62, 65, 44], with a mean of 59. The Lead Time is consistently 4 periods (P37 order arrived at P41). Since we are experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand 0 for the last 3 periods), I will use the recent mean (N=25 to cover the stable regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock calculation accurately reflects the current lower-demand regime while accounting for recent volatility. I choose N=25 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to encompass the post-Period 17 behavior (approx 25 samples).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 17 and has remained stable. For the period P17-P42, the average demand is approximately 50 units (sum=1306, periods=26). Period 42 conclude shows on-hand inventory recovered slightly to 25 units. There is a large in-transit pipeline of 203 units (orders from P39, P40, P41, P42). Specifically, P39 (56 units) is expected to arrive in Period 43, P40 (51 units) in P44, P41 (68 units) in P45, and P42 (28 units) in P46. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the current in-transit amount exceeds the expected demand over the lead time (5 periods * 50 units/period = 250 units total base stock roughly), the OR backend's capped policy will moderate ordering. I will use recent_N with N=26 to capture this entire lower-demand regime precisely (P17-P42).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 17. From Period 17 to Period 43, the mean demand is approximately 50.1 units per period with a standard deviation of 16.7. Recent demand (last 10 periods, P34-P43) remains consistent with this, averaging 48.3 units. Current inventory status: On-hand is 55, and In-transit is 196 (representing orders from P40, P41, P42, and P43). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on recent arrivals (P38 order arrived in P42, P39 order arrived in P43). I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=27 to capture the entire current regime since P17, ensuring the OR backend accurately reflects the lower demand and volatility levels while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable in the lower range established around Period 17. For 'chips(Regular)', the average demand over the last 28 periods (P17-P44) is approximately 49.8 units with a standard deviation of 17.1. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P40-P44), despite the missed shipments in the P22-P25 window which are no longer impacting current flow. Current inventory position is: On-hand (64) + In-transit (168) = 232. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. 232 / 5 \u2248 46.4 units/period, which aligns closely with our current mean. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=28 to capture this entire stable lower-demand regime, and N=28 for sigma_hat to accurately reflect recent volatility. L will remain 'default' at the promised 4 periods as it is matching observations.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 17. Analyzing the most recent period (P17 to P45), the mean demand is approximately 49.3 units with a standard deviation of about 17.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on recent arrivals (P41 arrived at P45, P40 at P44, etc.). Inventory currently stands at 90 units on-hand with 140 units in-transit (orders from P42, P43, P44, and P45). With the game ending at P50, and a lead time of 4, the order placed now in P46 will arrive in P50 (the final period). Given the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is 80%. I will use 'recent_N' with N=29 (covering the current regime from P17 to P45) to set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, and use 'calculate' for lead time as it has been reliably 4 periods.

The recent demand (P41-P46) shows a mean of 40.6 and a standard deviation of 8.2, which is consistent with this lower regime. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P47 to P50), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=30) to capture the stable behavior of the current regime while ensuring coverage for the remaining lead time. On-hand is 80 and in-transit is 153, totaling 233 units, which is ample against a pipeline demand (L+1=5) of approximately 235 units. Using N=30 ensures the OR backend uses data strictly from the post-shift period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of a 50-period game. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. The demand transitioned to a lower regime around Period 17 and has remained stable around 50 units/period. Over the last 10 periods (P38-P47), demand averaged 47.7 units with a standard deviation of 12.3. Our goal is to maintain sufficient inventory for the remaining 3 decision periods (P48-P50) while minimizing holding costs as the game ends. With on-hand inventory at 69 and in-transit units at 140 (which will arrive in P48, P49, P50, and P51), our pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~50 units/period. The OR backend will likely order 0 or very small amounts given the high pipeline (140) and low remaining time (3 periods). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 31 periods (P17-P47) to accurately reflect the current stable regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 49, the penultimate period of the game. The demand has remained stable in the low-demand regime (avg ~50) that started at Period 17. Looking at the history, lead times have consistently been 4 periods. The 'In-transit' inventory is 178 units, which is quite high compared to the current demand regime and on-hand inventory of 28. Specifically, orders from Periods 45, 46, 47, and 48 are expected to arrive in Periods 49-52. Since the game ends at Period 50, and our goal is to maximize R_t = Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory, we must avoid overstocking at the end of the simulation. For Period 49, any order placed will arrive in Period 53 (49 + 4), which is past the game's horizon. Thus, the order quantity for Period 49 essentially has no impact on sales but could theoretically incur holding costs if the simulation were longer (though here it arrives after the end). To ensure we maximize reward without over-ordering, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=32 to cover the stable regime P17-P48) and keep L at default since it is reliable. The OR backend's capped policy will handle the order calculation, likely placing a small or zero order given the pipeline and the proximity to the end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $137.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 48.7 units and a standard deviation of 15.1 over the last 33 periods (P17-P49). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to the most recent arrivals (P45-P49). Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 27 units and significant pipeline inventory (205 units). At the start of Period 50, arrivals from the order placed in Period 46 are expected (41 units). The total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 232 units, which is ample to cover the lead time demand (L+1 = 5 periods) at the current consumption rate (~244 units needed for safety). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=33 to capture the entirety of the current stable demand regime starting from Period 17, ensuring the OR backend uses accurate mean and volatility estimates to balance the $4.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost.
