Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no history (this is the first decision phase), I will use the default promised lead time and historical demand statistics. The demand samples provided (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) have a mean of 92.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.7. For L=4, the review+lead period is 1+L=5. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using these defaults. No shipments are in transit or overdue since the simulation just began.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 122 units, which are currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we do not expect this order to arrive until the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). The demand in Period 1 was 146, which was higher than the provided historical samples (mean ~92). However, with only one period of observation, I will not yet treat this as a sustained regime shift. The 'In-transit' quantity of 122 reflects the order from Period 1. I will use 'default' methods for the OR backend to establish a baseline based on all available data (5 historical samples + Period 1 demand). The base stock calculation will automatically account for the lead time of 4 and the pipeline inventory.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time is 4 periods. Our history (Period 1 and 2) shows 0 arrivals, which is consistent with a lead time of 4 (arrivals are expected during Period 5 and visible in Period 6). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 268 units in-transit (122 from P1, 146 from P2). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) is 109, 68, 99, 80, 105, and the recent in-game demands were 146 (P1) and 81 (P2). The average demand across these 7 data points is approximately 98.2. Given L=4, the review+lead time window is 5 periods (1+L). The target base stock should cover roughly 5 periods of demand. Using 'default' methods for mu and sigma since there is no significant regime shift detected yet, and 'default' for L as the promised lead time has not been contradicted by any 'conclude' message yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Periods 1, 2, and 3, we placed orders (122, 146, 141 respectively) which are currently in-transit (Total in-transit: 409). According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 with L=4 will arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which I will read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' status for Periods 1-3 is expected and consistent with the promised lead time. Demand in the first five historical samples was [109, 68, 99, 80, 105], averaging ~92. The demand during the game (actual observed) was 146, 81, and 108, averaging ~111. Given the slightly higher demand during the simulation compared to history, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to adapt to this higher mean, while keeping the default lead time (L=4) as there is no evidence of delay yet.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, an order of 122 units was placed. Following the 'Promised lead time = 4' logic, this order should arrive during Period (1+4) = Period 5's arrival resolution phase. The result will be visible at the start of Period 6. Therefore, the fact that no units have arrived by the end of Period 4 is expected. Inventory levels are currently zero, and all demand has been lost so far because initial stock was zero and the first order hasn't arrived yet. The historical demand for periods 1-5 shows some volatility (109, 68, 99, 80, 105), with a mean of approximately 92.2 units. Since there is no evidence yet to suggest the lead time or demand regime has changed from the promised/initial observations, I will use 'default' methods which utilize all available history and the promised lead time of 4. This will set a base stock level to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1258.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 146, 81, 108, 72, 69 (Mean ~95). Note: The provided 'Historical Demand Data' in the prompt (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) contradicts the Game History (146, 81, 108, 72, 69). I will prioritize Game History as it reflects the actual sales and stockouts. Demand appears to be softening (avg of last 3 periods is 83). The arrival from Period 1 confirmed the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4). Current on-hand is 53, with 450 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Total expected availability is 53 + 450 = 503. Estimating demand at ~95/period, we need ~475 units. We are currently well-covered by the pipeline. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the available history while acknowledging the slight downward trend in demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand showing a downward trend from initial high (P1: 146 vs P5: 69).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1281.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by the arrival of Period 1 and Period 2 orders (both took exactly 4 periods). Demand for the first 6 periods has been 146, 81, 108, 72, 69, 74. There was a significant spike in Period 1, but since then (Periods 2-6), demand has stabilized at a lower mean. Calculating the average demand from Period 2 to Period 6 gives (81+108+72+69+74)/5 = 80.8 units per period. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized demand level, excluding the Period 1 outlier. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current volatility. Lead time L will remain at the default (promised) value of 4, as it is consistent with observations. On-hand plus pipeline (125 + 396 = 521) is being compared against the calculated base stock (approx 80.8 * 5 = 404 plus safety stock) by the backend to determine if a new order is needed.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized after Period 1 spike: Periods 2-6 average demand is 80.8, significantly lower than Period 1 (146).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1694.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P1, P2, and P3 orders arrived exactly at P5, P6, and P7 respectively). On-hand inventory is 168 units, with 255 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, and P6). Demand has stabilized since the initial spike in Period 1; the mean demand from Period 2 to Period 7 is 83.67. Given the promised and actual lead time of 4, the target inventory must cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the last 6 periods (P2-P7) for forecasting avoids the Period 1 outlier while providing a stable mean of 83.67 and a standard deviation of 15.68. The pipeline inventory (168 on-hand + 255 in-transit = 423 units) is currently robust relative to expected demand over the lead time (approx 418 units). I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the stable regime and set L to 'default' as it matches the actual performance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently 4 periods (P3 order arrived P7). Demand regime stable (P2-P7 avg: 83.7) following P1 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1400.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of 'conclude' messages confirms the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (Orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 all arrived exactly 4 periods later). Product demand experienced a single high outlier in Period 1 (146), but has since stabilized into a consistent regime. From Period 2 to Period 8 (7 samples), the mean demand is 84.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 13.9 units. Since the lead time is stable at 4, I will use L=4 (default promised). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use the last 7 samples (recent_N, N=7) to exclude the anomalous Period 1 data and better align with the stabilized regime. The on-hand inventory (234) plus in-transit (157) totals 391, which covers approximately 4.6 periods of the current average demand (84), providing a healthy buffer while the OR engine calculates the necessary replenishment to maintain service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1855.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing the history, the lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods (validated by arrivals for orders from Periods 1 through 5). The initial demand spike in Period 1 (146) proved to be an outlier; demand from Periods 2-9 has stabilized with a mean of 86.6 and a standard deviation of approximately 15.1. Currently, we have 140 units on hand and 229 units in transit (from orders in P6, P8, and P9). Using the stable regime (N=8, excluding Period 1), the target base stock calculation for (L+1=5) periods would be approximately (5 * 86.6) + (Z_critical * sqrt(5) * 15.1). With profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio q is 0.95, giving a Z-score of ~1.645. Target base stock \u2248 433 + 55 = 488. Current pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 140 + 229 = 369. To reach the target, a further order is necessary. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to exclude the Period 1 spike and 'calculate' for lead time since the promised 4 periods matches the actual observed lead time consistently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Period 1: Periods 2-9 average demand is 86.6 (Std Dev ~15), compared to Period 1 spike of 146.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1768.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following the initial Period 1 spike. For Periods 2 through 10, the mean demand is 88.2 with a standard deviation of approximately 14.8. The actual lead time has consistently been confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in the arrivals of orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), matching the promised lead time. Currently, there are 132 units on hand and 249 units in transit (ordered in Periods 7, 8, 9, and 10), totaling 381 units. Given (L+1) = 5 periods, the expected demand over the lead time is approximately 441 units (5 * 88.2). Our current inventory position (381) is slightly below the target base stock, so we'll continue using the stabilized demand data to allow the OR backend to recalculate the optimal order. I'm using N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-spike stability (Periods 2-10).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 2-10 average 88.2 (Std Dev 14.8). Lead time confirmed consistent at 4 periods.

From Period 2 to Period 11, the average demand is approximately 90.7 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 14.8. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data (orders from Periods 1-6) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. In Period 11, the arrived quantity was 0, which is correct because the order from Period 7 was 0 units. We currently have 19 units on-hand and 362 units in-transit (orders from Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11). To maintain the base stock level (covering L+1 = 5 periods of demand), I will use the recent stable regime (Periods 2-11, N=10) to forecast both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N for L ensures we align with the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 2-11 average demand is 90.7 (Std Dev ~15). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we experienced a stockout (Ending inventory=0) because the order from Period 7 (141 units) did not arrive, and the order from Period 8 (54 units) was insufficient to meet the demand of 83 units. Since orders from Period 1-6 and Period 8 arrived with a lead time of 4, the absence of the Period 7 order in the Period 11 or 12 conclude messages suggests it might be lost or delayed significantly. We are currently at Period 13, and our in-transit inventory is high (426), but our on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has remained stable after the Period 1 spike, with Periods 2-12 averaging ~90. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-spike demand regime (Periods 2-12). I will set L to 4 as the lead time has been reliable (excluding the potentially lost Period 7 shipment).

Carry-over insight: Potential lost shipment: Order placed in Period 7 (141 units) has not arrived as of Period 12 conclude (expected in Period 11 if L=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1577.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the system is facing a confirmed stockout (On-hand: 0) and a lost/severely delayed shipment from Period 7 (141 units). According to the lead time of 4 periods, the Period 7 order should have arrived in Period 11. Its continued absence as of the Period 13 conclude message indicates it is likely lost. The Period 10 order (112 units) is expected to arrive during Period 14 (visible in Period 15), but current On-hand is 0. Demand has stabilized into a consistent regime from Period 2 onwards; excluding the Period 1 outlier, the mean demand over Periods 2-13 is approximately 89.5 units with a standard deviation of 14.5. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to recover from the lost shipment while maintaining the desired service level (calculated as q = 19/20 = 0.95), I am using 'recent_N' with N=12 to focus on the post-spike stabilized demand. I am setting L to 4 (promised and historically observed) to maintain the (L+1) coverage calculation.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 7 (141 units) is officially confirmed lost (expected Period 11, absent through Period 13 conclude). Current pipeline inventory must be discounted by this amount mentally, though the OR backend will eventually adjust based on its internal logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2128.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has spiked to 163 units in Period 14, following a stable regime of ~90. The shipment from Period 7 (141 units) is confirmed lost, which has severely depleted the pipeline and caused stockouts in Periods 12, 13, and 14. Current in-transit inventory (390) consists of orders from Periods 11 (113 units), 12 (118 units), 13 (81 units), and 14 (78 units). To recover from the lost shipment and address the recent demand surge, I am setting L=4 as lead time is stable. For demand forecasting, I am using recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat to capture the post-initial-spike average while including the recent Period 14 surge (avg ~96 per period). sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=13) to account for the increased volatility observed in Period 14. This configuration will signal the backend to increase the base stock level to replenish inventory and buffer against recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike in Period 14 (163 units) following stable regime; monitoring if this is a new shift or an outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1267.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P11 order arrived in P15). Demand in P15 returned to a more normal level (69) after the P14 spike (163), suggesting the spike was an outlier rather than a regime shift. The lost shipment from P7 (141 units) is now a permanent gap in the pipeline. Current on-hand is low (44), and although the backend manages its own pipeline inventory, it calculates 'in-transit' based on placement history. Since the P7 order (141 units) never arrived and likely never will, the backend's internal 'pipeline_inventory' will be overestimated until the OR logic resets or we compensate. Using 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=14 (Periods 2-15) captures the stable regime post-P1, smoothing out the P14 spike. I will use 'default' for L as the promised 4 periods matches the observed actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: P14 spike (163) confirmed as outlier as P15 demand returned to 69. Stable regime (P2-P15) mean remains ~92.

Daily Reward (R_t): $138.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 demand dropped significantly to 15, confirming the Period 14 spike (163) was an outlier. The general demand regime (Periods 2-16) averages 91.5 units per period. The lost shipment from Period 7 (141 units) is still reflected in the system's 'In-transit' count (396 units), whereas the actual functional pipeline consists of orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16 (81+78+137+100 = 396 units). Since the OR backend calculates order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory, and the backend's pipeline matches the actual undelivered orders (P13-P16), no manual adjustment for the lost shipment is currently required in the L or mu_hat parameters to prevent under-ordering. I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-initial-spike stability (since P2). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Period 14 spike (163) confirmed outlier; Period 16 demand (15) suggests high volatility. Stable regime (P2-P16) mean is 91.5, std dev ~33.

Daily Reward (R_t): $252.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that demand in recent periods has dropped significantly (P16: 15, P17: 24), compared to the previous stable average of ~92. This suggests a potential demand regime shift downward or a very low seasonal dip. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P13 arrived in P17). We must account for the lost shipment from Period 7 (141 units) which is still technically in the 'In-transit' figure of 328 (confirmed by summing recent orders: P14: 78 + P15: 137 + P16: 100 + P17: 13 = 328). Thus, effective pipeline inventory is 328 - 141 = 187 units. With 204 units on-hand, total effective inventory is 391. Using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (average demand ~71) captures the recent P14 spike and the P16-17 troughs, while the sigma_hat needs to reflect the high volatility (Std Dev ~62) caused by these fluctuations. Setting L to calculate is safe as the lead time is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: demand dropped from an average of ~92 (P2-P15) to an average of 19.5 (P16-P17). Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is currently high relative to this new demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $298.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are experiencing a significant downward demand shift starting from Period 16. The demand from P16-P18 (15, 24, 29) averages approximately 22.7 units, compared to the previous regime average of ~92 units. On-hand inventory is high at 253 units, and there are 291 units in-transit (P15 order: 137, P16 order: 100, P17 order: 13, P18 order: 41). Total potential inventory is 544 units, which at the current low demand rate is extremely excessive. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs and address the overstock, I am switching mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this new low-demand regime. This will significantly lower the base stock target, allowing the OR engine's capped policy to pause or minimize ordering until inventory is depleted. L remains at the promised/historical 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand dropped from ~92 to ~23 (-75%). Inventory levels are currently excessive relative to new demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is now firmly established. For Periods 16-19, demand values were 15, 24, 29, and 23, resulting in a new mean of 22.75 units per period. This is a dramatic drop (-75%) from the previous long-term average of ~92. The on-hand inventory (367) plus in-transit stock (154) totals 521 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 20 periods. To prevent additional orders from the OR backend and to minimize excessive holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the 22.75 mean. Since current inventory is already nearly 10x the required base stock for this regime, the system will naturally stop ordering. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $493.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift first detected at Period 16 is now firmly established. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 20 is 27.8 units, a significant drop from the previous average of ~92 units. On-hand inventory is currently at 419 units, which is approximately 15 periods of cover for this new demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and low demand, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20) to reflect this lower demand regime. This will prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders while carrying excessive inventory. The service level (q) remains high at 0.95 (19/(19+1)), so the OR backend will target a safe base stock, but our high current inventory relative to the lower demand ensures we shouldn't be ordering for several more periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 16: P16-P20 average demand is 27.8, representing a ~70% decrease from the P2-P15 average of 92.

Daily Reward (R_t): $208.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is sustained. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is 28.5, which is significantly lower than the previous average of ~92 (P2-P15). Current on-hand inventory (400) is roughly 14 times the new average demand, which is excessive and will lead to high holding costs. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and the sharp drop in demand, I will focus the OR backend on the most recent regime to minimize further ordering. I set N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand state. This will result in a much lower base stock, effectively pausing orders until the current surplus is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand drop confirmed (P16-P21): mean demand reduced from ~92 to 28.5 (~69% reduction).

The standard deviation for this period is approximately 10.4. Inventory levels are currently very high (416 units on-hand) compared to this new demand level. Lead time (L) has remained consistent at 4 periods. The goal is to set parameters that reflect this lower demand regime to prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders while the system works through the excess inventory. I will use the last 7 periods (P16-P22) for recent_N to capture this stabilized lower demand.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, dropping from a historical average of ~92 to 29.8 (calculated over P16-P23). Current on-hand inventory is 381 units, which is extremely high (approximately 12-13 periods of supply at the current demand rate). There are no units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) and the high holding costs relative to current daily demand, the goal is to prevent further ordering until the excess stock is depleted. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 samples (Period 16 to Period 23) to accurately reflect this low-demand state and satisfy the OR backend's capped policy requirements without triggering new orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $359.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that occurred at Period 16 is sustained. Demand from Period 16 to 24 averages 29.8 units (15, 24, 29, 23, 48, 32, 25, 35, 37). The current on-hand inventory is 344 units, and there is 0 pipeline inventory. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~30/period, required stock is approximately 150-180 units. Since on-hand (344) is nearly double this requirement, no new orders should be placed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the shift) to align the OR engine's targets with the lower demand, and L=4 as the lead time remains consistent when shipments aren't lost.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 16. Since Period 16, demand has averaged 33 units per period (P16-P25), a sharp decline from the earlier average of ~92. Despite the slight uptick in P25 (62 units), the overall trend remains low. I have 282 units on hand and 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, my current inventory is sufficient for approximately 8.5 periods of demand at the new average. I will continue using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh only the post-shift data (P16-P25), which will keep the base stock calculation low and prevent ordering while I deplete the excess inventory. Lead time 'L' remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~92 (P2-P15) to 33.0 (P16-P25), a reduction of ~64%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $898.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 26, the average demand is approximately 35.7 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 223 units, with no units in transit. Given the current average demand and a lead time of 4 periods, we need approximately (4+1) * 35.7 = 178.5 units to cover the risk period. Since current on-hand inventory (223) exceeds this requirement, the OR backend will correctly place zero orders (as pipeline inventory >= base stock). To ensure the OR engine reflects the new demand reality, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N where N=11 (Periods 16-26). Lead time (L) remains at the promised 4 periods as observed lead times have been consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $397.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downwards significantly at Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 through Period 27 (N=12), the mean demand is 33.33 with a standard deviation of 14.12. This is a substantial decrease from the pre-Period 16 average of ~92. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (excluding the lost Period 7 shipment) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 192 units and in-transit is 10 units (from Period 27), totaling 202 units. Given the new demand mean of ~33, we expect demand over the next lead time + review period (1+4 = 5 periods) to be approximately 166.5 units. Since 202 > 166.5, the system is still slightly overstocked, but moving toward a balanced state. I will use recent_N (N=12) to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1068.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 16. Using the stable history from Period 16 to Period 28 (13 samples), the mean demand is 37.15 and the standard deviation is 15.63. The current on-hand inventory (129) and in-transit units (37) total 166 units. At the current demand levels, this provides roughly 4.5 periods of coverage, which is just below the necessary stock for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). Recent demand (Period 25-28) is slightly higher than the Period 16 trough, with an average of 53.75, so I will prioritize recent data to avoid stockouts while lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 16-28: mean 37.2, std dev 15.6. Short-term trend (P25-P28) shows a slight recovery to average demand of 53.8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $311.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a lower level (mean ~37) compared to the initial periods, though recent periods show significant volatility (P28: 63, P29: 22). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (promised = actual). We have experienced a lost shipment (Period 7) and a lack of arrivals since Period 22, but new orders were placed from Period 27 onwards. Current on-hand inventory is 107, and in-transit is 101 (orders from P27, P28, P29). Since the demand regime change at Period 16, we have 14 samples. I will use recent_N=14 to capture the current lower demand level and higher volatility observed in this regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock reflective of the ~37 units/period average while accounting for the recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 16-29: mean 36.1, std dev 16.3. Inventory depletion continues toward target levels after the Period 16 demand drop.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major structural shift at Period 16, dropping from a mean of ~92 to a much lower level. Analyzing the most recent regime (P16-P30), the average demand is 35.6 with a standard deviation of 15.6. The game history confirms the lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 19, the strategy has been to deplete the excess on-hand inventory caused by the sudden demand drop. On-hand inventory is now 78, with 132 units in-transit (orders from P27-P30). As the system is approaching a more balanced stock level relative to the new demand, I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (the length of the current demand regime) to reflect the lower mean and stabilized volatility. Lead time 'L' will remain 'default' as the promised 4 periods remains accurate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 16-31), the mean demand is 35.6 with a standard deviation of 15.2. Recent periods (P29-P31) show demand levels of 22, 29, and 29, indicating the market has settled at this lower level despite a slight mid-20s fluctuation. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 27 order in Period 31. On-hand inventory (59) and in-transit (147) currently total 206 units. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N=16 (the length of the current regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will provide the most accurate estimate for the OR backend to balance the high service level (95% critical ratio) against holding costs, avoiding the excessive overstocking seen in Periods 16-25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $374.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downwards significantly at Period 16. Since Period 16, demand has averaged approximately 36.5 units, compared to the earlier average of around 92. Recent history (P25-P32) shows a slight uptick but remains well below the initial levels, with a mean of ~39.5 units. I am setting N=17 (P16-P32) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this post-shift behavior accurately. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P31 and P32), so I am using the 'calculate' method. On-hand inventory is 63 and in-transit is 145 (orders from P29, P30, P31, P32). Total pipeline + on-hand is 208, which covers about 5 periods of demand at the current rate (~40 units/period). The parameters reflect the lower demand state to maintain a high service level while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 16-32: mean 36.5, std dev 15.6. Short-term trend remains below historical high, stabilizing inventory levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1073.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the data from Period 16 to Period 33, the average demand is approximately 37.8 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 15.6. The most recent demand (Period 33) was 60 units, which is on the higher end for this regime but within expected volatility. Lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 31, 32, and 33). On-hand inventory is 67 units and in-transit is 100 units (orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33). Given L=4, the pipeline visibility covers 5 periods (Review + Lead Time). I will set mu_hat using a recent_N approach with N=18 (covering the entire stable low-demand regime since P16) to provide a robust forecast that accounts for the current mean and historical volatility of this segment. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that aligns with the lower sustained demand while protecting against the observed standard deviation.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally at Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 34 (19 data points), the mean is 35.7 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 16.3. The most recent demand (Period 34) was 18, continuing the lower-regime trend. Inventory is now successfully depleted to target levels following the excess caused by the Period 16 drop. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P27-P30 orders arrived consistently at L=4). I will use a window of 19 periods (since the regime shift) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend focuses on this lower-demand environment while maintaining a safety stock appropriate for the observed volatility (std dev ~16).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 16-34 now confirmed: mean 35.7, std dev 16.3 (reduction of ~61% from pre-P16 levels). Inventory recalibration to this regime is complete.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 35, the mean demand is 35.15 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 15.8. The current observation at Period 36 shows an on-hand inventory of 80 units and 128 units in-transit (orders from P32 to P35). Lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P31 order arriving in P35). Because the demand regime is stable and significantly lower than the historical start of the game, I am using recent_N (N=20) to capture this specific regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current ~35 units/period average rather than the ~90+ units/period seen earlier in the game, preventing over-ordering while maintaining enough safety stock for the observed volatility (\u03c3\u224816).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 16, following a significant drop from the initial high-demand period. For the current period (P37), I analyzed the demand from Period 16 to Period 36. The mean demand during this 21-period interval is approximately 36.6 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 14.8. This regime is now well-established. Lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 31-36). The on-hand inventory is 62 units and in-transit is 124 units (orders from P33, P34, P35, and P36), totaling 186 units. Using recent_N=21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the current stable low-demand environment while discounting the previous high-demand regime, allowing the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock level of (1+L) * mean_demand + safety stock. L is set to 'calculate' as historical lead times are reliably 4.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable with a mean of approximately 35.8 units and a standard deviation of 16.2 units. Recent periods (P31-P37) suggest a slightly higher mean of 32.4 units, but the overall post-P16 window (22 samples) is the most reliable indicator for this stabilized lower-demand regime. Inventory levels have successfully recalibrated after the massive surplus following the Period 16 drop. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 33 order in Period 37. I will use recent_N=22 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full breadth of the current demand regime since Period 16, while keeping L at default (4) to reflect the observed and promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $726.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 16 and has stabilized around a lower mean. Analyzing recent demand (Periods 16-38), the mean is approximately 36.3 with a standard deviation of 15.1. Lead times have remained remarkably consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 31-38). The current inventory position (On-hand: 72, In-transit: 114) of 186 units is well-aligned with the target base stock for this low-demand regime. Since the demand has been stable for over 20 periods, I will use a recent_N approach (N=23, covering the entire post-shift regime) for both demand mean and volatility to ensure parameters reflect the current market state rather than the old high-demand period. This helps the OR backend maintain a service level consistent with a ~$19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio without overstocking based on ancient historical spikes.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 39, the mean demand is approximately 35.8 units per period, consistently significantly lower than the pre-Period 16 average of ~92. The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals through Period 39 (P35 order arrived P39). On-hand inventory is 59 units, and in-transit inventory is 134 units (orders from P36, P37, P38, P39), which aligns with the observed lead time of 4. Current pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 193) covers approximately 5.4 periods of demand at the current rate (35.8 * 5 = 179). I will continue using 'recent_N' with N=24 to capture the entirety of this stabilized lower-demand regime (P16-P39) to set parameters L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the current service level requirement.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime Period 16-39: mean 35.8, std dev 13.9. This sustained 60%+ reduction from initial levels is now the long-term stable baseline.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new low-demand regime starting from Period 16. Since Period 16, the average demand has been approximately 35.8 with a standard deviation of about 14. This is a significant decrease (over 60%) compared to the initial periods. Lead times have remained very consistent at 4 periods, with the exception of one lost shipment from Period 7. For Period 41, I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=25 (covering the data from Period 16 to 40) to accurately reflect this low-demand baseline. I will keep L at default since the promised lead time of 4 is being consistently met.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 41, the mean demand is approximately 35 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 14.8. Period 41 saw an exceptionally low demand of 3 units, but I will treat this as an outlier within the current regime rather than a new shift, as demand in this game has shown high local volatility. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, as evidenced by recent arrivals from Periods 33-37 all concluding with a 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is 73 units and in-transit is 154 units (ordered in Periods 38, 39, 40, and 41). My objective is to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1). Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 will capture the stable post-Period 16 regime behavior while smoothing out recent fluctuations.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in the stable regime established at Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 35.8 units and a standard deviation of 13.9. Period 41 saw an outlier low demand of 3, but Period 42 returned to the norms (40). The current inventory state shows 60 units on-hand and 139 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect 42 units (from P39) and 34 units (from P40) to arrive in the next two periods. The OR backend will use the 'recent_N' method with N=27 (Period 16 to 42) to capture the current demand regime accurately while excluding the high-demand period at the start. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is well-established as a stable baseline, significantly lower than the initial periods. Calculating from Period 16 to Period 43, the mean demand is 36.6 units with a standard deviation of 15.1. While Period 41 saw an unusually low demand of 3, the overall pattern remains consistent with the carry-over insights. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P39 order arrived in P43). I am using recent_N with N=28 (covering Period 16 to 43) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this long-term post-shift regime. The pipeline currently contains 126 units (orders from P40, P41, P42, P43), and with on-hand at 51, the total position is 177, which is sufficient for approximately 4-5 periods of demand at the current average. The OR backend will maintain this equilibrium using the provided parameters.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 35.8 units and a standard deviation of around 14 units. This represents a significant long-term shift (over 60% reduction) from the initial periods. Although there was a very low demand observation in Period 41 (3 units) and Period 44 (7 units), these are within the expected variability of the current regime. Lead times are consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P40 order arrived in P44). With on-hand inventory at 78 units and in-transit units at 146 (total pipeline of 224), the system is well-stocked for the current demand levels (average demand over L+1 periods is ~180). I will use recent_N=29 to capture the entire stable regime since Period 16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring the OR backend targets the correct service level for this lower-demand environment.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 35.8 units and a standard deviation of 13.9 based on observations from Period 16 to 45. In Period 45, on-hand inventory is 81 and in-transit inventory is 99 (totaling 180 units). Given a lead time (L) of 4, the target pipeline should cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~36, the target base stock is roughly 180 units (36 * 5), plus a small safety factor. Since current inventory (180) is almost exactly at the target, orders should remain modest to maintain this balance. The backend will use 'recent_N' with N=30 to exclude the high-demand spikes from the first 15 periods, specifically targeting the regime shift that occurred at Period 16. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 16, with a long-term mean of approximately 35.8. Recent demand (Periods 41-46: 3, 40, 51, 7, 48, 53) shows increased volatility but maintains an average around this baseline (~33.6). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 40 units on-hand and 137 units in-transit (Total = 177), and a lead time of 4, we are covering approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate (177 / 35.4 \u2248 5). The OR backend uses a base-stock policy where target stock = (1+L) * mu_hat + z * sigma_hat * sqrt(1+L). Given L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=31 (covering the period from the P16 drop to now) to capture the current regime's mean and variance while smoothing out the recent noise in demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting from Period 16, characterized by a mean of approximately 35.8 units per period, which is roughly a 60% reduction from the early game volume. Recent demand (P41-P47) has shown some increased volatility (values of 3, 40, 51, 7, 48, 53, 7), but the average remains consistent with the post-P16 regime. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods across almost all successful deliveries. Current on-hand inventory is 62 units, and pipeline inventory is 165 units (orders from P44, P45, P46, P47). Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (P48+4), which is beyond the game horizon. Therefore, the primary objective shifts to liquidating current stock while avoiding stockouts in the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50). However, the OR backend logic requires parameters to function. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=32 (P16 to P47) to capture this stable low-demand regime accurately while maintaining L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $704.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable low-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 41 to Period 48 (the most recent 8 samples), the average demand is 31.25 with considerable volatility (std dev \u2248 20). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on recent arrivals (Orders from P41 to P44 arrived exactly on schedule). Currently, we have 75 units on hand and 115 units in transit (ordered in P45-P48). Our total inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) is 190 units, while the base stock target for a 4-period lead time environment (covering 5 periods of demand) in this regime is approximately 200-220 units. I will use the recent 33 periods (P16-P48) to define the current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, and keep L at the default promised value of 4 periods to maintain stability for the final period.

Daily Profit: $247.00, Daily Holding Cost: $66.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $181.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 35.8 units and a standard deviation of 13.9. Over the last 10 periods (P40-P49), demand has followed this baseline (mean ~34.1). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the inventory levels have successfully recalibrated to this lower demand regime, I will continue using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=34 (covering the entire stable regime from P16 to P49). This ensures the OR backend captures the sustained reduction in volume and volatility compared to the early game spikes. On-hand and in-transit inventory are now well-aligned with this target.
