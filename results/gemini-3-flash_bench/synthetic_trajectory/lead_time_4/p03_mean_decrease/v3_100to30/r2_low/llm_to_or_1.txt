Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no historical data yet, I will use the baseline statistics provided in the historical demand samples (Period 1-5). The mean demand for these 5 samples is (109+68+99+80+105)/5 = 92.2. The standard deviation is approximately 16.9. Since order arrival takes L periods and demand occurs during the current period as well, the exposure period is (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (based on the provided samples) to seed the OR backend with the most relevant starting point while keeping lead time at the default (promised) value of 4.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 146 units, but since initial on-hand inventory was 0 and the order placed (122 units) has a promised lead time of 4 periods, no units were sold. The 122 units ordered in Period 1 are currently in-transit. For Period 2, I will use the mean of the available historical samples (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) and the observed demand in Period 1 (146) to set parameters. The average of these 6 samples is 101.16. With a lead time (L) of 4, the OR backend requires mu_hat to cover (1+L) = 5 periods. Using the mean (101.16 * 5 = 505.8), I will set mu_hat explicitly to ensure lead-time plus review period coverage. Sigma_hat is calculated based on the standard deviation of the samples (approx 25.4) times sqrt(5), which is roughly 56.8. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to proactively account for the high Period 1 demand alongside the historical data provided.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (122 units) and Period 2 (143 units) are correctly in-transit (Total: 265 units). No arrivals have occurred yet, which is expected as the first order is not due until the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts in Periods 1 and 2, but this is unavoidable given the lead time. Demand samples for the first 5 periods (historical + current) are [109, 68, 99, 80, 105]. The mean of these 5 samples is 92.2 and the standard deviation is 17.15. With L=4 (promised), the OR backend needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the mean of all available 5 samples (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides the most stable estimate for this early stage. I will stick to 'default' for L since no arrivals have concluded to suggest a lead time shift.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 are currently in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, an order placed in P1 (L=4) is expected to arrive during P5 and becomes visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (to be read at the start of P6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, which is expected given the lead time. Demand over the first 3 periods (146, 81, 108) averages 111.6, while the provided historical seeding (P1-P5) averages 92.2. Given the high volatility in the first few periods (std ~32), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the slightly higher observed demand compared to the mean of all provided samples, ensuring we maintain a high base stock to cover demand during the lead time and review period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. Based on the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (122 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (the current period). This arrival will be confirmed in the 'Period 5 conclude' message, which I will see at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and 559 units are in transit. Historical demand for periods 1-5 follows: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105 (average \u2248 92). Note: The user prompt's 'Game History' for periods 1-4 shows different demand figures (146, 81, 108, 72) compared to the 'Historical Demand Data' section. I will prioritize the 'Historical Demand Data' providing 5 samples, including the most recent Period 5 demand of 105. Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet, there is no evidence to change the lead time from the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all 5 available samples to determine the base stock, as no clear regime shift is yet apparent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (L=4), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Our inventory position is: 53 units on-hand and 437 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4). Customer demand over the first 5 periods has averaged 95.2 units (146, 81, 108, 72, 69). There is no specific calendar or product seasonality indicated yet. I will use the default lead time (4) and the mean of all available demand samples (N=5) to set our parameters. This sets the base stock level to cover demand over 5 periods (L+1). Since holding costs and profits are equal ($1.0), the backend will aim for a 50% service level, essentially ordering to maintain the mean demand over the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-48.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms this: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 (L=4) and Period 2 order arrived in Period 6 (L=4). Demand appears to have shifted. Periods 1-3 had high demand (avg 111.7), while Periods 4-6 show lower, more stable demand (72, 69, 74; avg 71.7). Given the Lead Time of 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent lower-demand regime (avg ~72). Inventory management: We have 122 on-hand and 294 in-transit (orders from P3, P4). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1), the OR target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand to minimize total cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 4: Average demand decreased from ~112 to ~72 (-35%); Lead time confirmed at 4 periods based on P1 and P2 arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-73.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). Demand has shown a shift: Periods 1-3 averaged 111.6, while Periods 4-7 have averaged 78.25 units. Although Period 7 saw a slight increase to 98, the overall trend since Period 4 is significantly lower than the initial start. We have 171 units on-hand and 147 in-transit (ordered in Period 4). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1)), meaning we aim for the base stock to match expected demand over the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 5). I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (Periods 4, 5, 6, 7). L is set to calculate as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-146.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of the concluding periods (P5-P8) confirms the lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). Demand has stabilized after a shift at Period 4. Pre-shift (P1-P3) mean was ~112. Post-shift (P4-P8) demand values are 72, 69, 74, 98, 86, averaging ~80. The carry-over insight noted a drop at P4, which is supported by subsequent data. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (1+L)=5 periods. My current inventory level (On-hand 232 + In-transit 74 = 306) and the high holding cost ($1.0) compared to profit ($1.0) suggest a 50% service level target (critical ratio = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), meaning we should aim for the median demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime of ~80 per period (80*5=400) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. L will be set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8 (orders from Periods 1-4) confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. A demand regime shift was previously identified at Period 4. Looking at the demand from Period 4 onwards (72, 69, 74, 98, 86, 105), the average demand is approximately 84 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 127 units, with 167 units in transit (orders from P8 and P9). Since the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. With an average demand of ~84, the pipeline target is roughly 420 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 294, suggesting the OR backend needs to order to reach the base stock. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (the length of the current regime since P4) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the current volatility (approx std ~15). L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 4: Average demand ~84 units/period with standard deviation ~15. Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is low (27 units) following a consistent demand period where demand slightly increased (averaging ~97 over the last 3 periods vs ~84 previously). The promised and historical lead time is 4 periods. Orders from periods 1-4 have arrived on time. We are currently waiting for orders placed in periods 8, 9, and 10 (totaling 276 units in transit). Given that holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the critical ratio is 50%, suggesting a base stock level near the median. I will update the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the recent higher demand levels (N=5 covers periods 6-10, where average demand was 92.6) and use recent volatility (N=5) for sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the inventory status for chips(Regular) is critical: On-hand is 0, and we experienced a stockout in Period 11, selling only 27 of 113 demanded units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since Period 5, historical data confirms orders consistently arrive after 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). The order from Period 8 is expected to arrive during the next phase of Period 12. Pipeline inventory is currently 390 units (from orders in P8, P9, P10, and P11). Demand has shown a slight uptick recently (105, 100, 113 in the last 3 periods), though the stabilized regime average since Period 4 was ~84. Given the high stockout risk and equal profit/holding cost (implying a 50% target service level in a standard Newsvendor context, though the OR backend uses profit/(profit+holding) which is 1/(1+1)=0.5), I will use the recent_N method for demand (N=8 to cover the period since the demand drop in P4) and explicit lead time of 4. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Service level failure at Period 11: Stockout occurred due to high demand (113) relative to opening stock (27) despite a robust pipeline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 opens with 0 on-hand inventory following two consecutive periods of stockouts (Periods 11 and 12). While the promised lead time L=4 is consistent (confirmed by Period 12's arrival of the P8 order), the pipeline contains 375 units. Demand has shown a recent uptick, with the last 4 periods (P9-P12) averaging 100.25 units/period compared to the previous regime of ~84 units. Specifically, Period 11 had a spike of 113. Given the stockout and the slight shift in demand mean, I will use a recent N approach for mu_hat (N=9, covering Periods 4-12 to capture the stabilized regime including the recent higher demand) to ensure base stock targets are sensitive to the current volume. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=9) to capture the increased volatility (Std Dev ~15) observed recently. These parameters aim to replenish inventory quickly and move beyond the current stockout phase while respecting the lead time constraint.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean shift detected: Average demand from P9-P12 increased to ~100 units/period from the previously stable ~84 units/period. Service level is critically low with 0 units on-hand for two periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is recovering from a stockout. We have 9 units on-hand and 352 in-transit. The history confirms a stable lead time (L) of 4 periods. Since Period 9, there has been a significant upward shift in demand, averaging approximately 97 units per period (P9: 105, P10: 100, P11: 113, P12: 83, P13: 84), which is notably higher than the previous stabilization around 84. To capture this recent trend while accounting for the recent stockouts affecting observed demand, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=5. This will calculate the forecast for (1+L) = 5 periods. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture current volatility. L is maintained at the observed stable level of 4 using the calculate method.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean shift confirmed: Average demand from P9-P13 is ~97 units/period, compared to the previous ~84. Pipeline inventory is currently high (352) to compensate for recent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 saw a significant demand spike (163 units), which is the highest observed so far, far exceeding the recent average (~97-100). The current on-hand inventory is 0. The lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, and 14. The pipeline inventory is healthy (362 units). However, the recent volatility (standard deviation increase due to the P14 spike) and the shift in mean demand over the last 6 periods (P9-P14 average is ~108 units) require an adjustment to the OR parameters to prevent further stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat to capture this recent upward trend and volatility, corresponding to the detected shift starting around Period 9. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the confirmed historical stability of the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased at Period 14: Demand spike of 163 units observed, raising the 6-period moving average to ~108 units (+28% from the previous stable regime of 84).

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory recovered slightly to 45 units after several periods of stockouts. However, demand has become highly volatile, with a significant spike of 163 in Period 14 followed by 69 in Period 15. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P9-P15) is approximately 102 units, reflecting a clear upward shift from the earlier stable mean of ~84. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P11 arrived P15). Given the recent service level failures and the high demand volatility (ranging from 69 to 163), I am using a recent_N window of 7 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime. This will set a higher base stock to protect against further stockouts while accounting for the lead time of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains elevated: most recent 7-period average is ~102 units/period (compared to prior 84) with a wide range (69-163). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, current on-hand inventory is 89 units with 409 units in-transit. Demand has been highly volatile recently: P14 saw 163 units, P15 saw 69, and P16 saw an unusually low 15. The carry-over insights correctly identified a mean shift around P9-P13, but the last three periods (163, 69, 15) suggest very high variance even if the mean is stabilizing near 100 units/period. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods across multiple arrivals (P1, P2, P3, P4, P8, P9, P10, P11, P12). Given the significant demand drop in P16, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher demand regime from P9 onwards while accounting for the recent volatility. This N balances the high demand periods with the recent low outlier. Setting L=4 (default) as it remains consistent with observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: P16 demand dropped to 15 after a peak of 163 in P14, indicating a very high standard deviation in the current regime (P9-P16 avg ~91, but with range 15-163).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-111.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that demand has entered a highly volatile regime starting around Period 9. While the average demand over the last 9 periods (P9-P17) is approximately 84 units, the range is extreme (15 to 163), suggesting significantly increased variance. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the P13 order arriving precisely in P17). Currently, on-hand inventory is 135 with a large in-transit pipeline of 339 units. Given the high volatility but lower mean in the most recent periods (P16 and P17 saw demand of 15 and 24 respectively), I am selecting a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat) with N=9 to capture the entirety of this volatile regime. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use N=9 to ensure the backend accounts for the recent demand spikes. This helps protect against stockouts during spikes while recognizing that the average demand hasn't permanently shifted as high as the Period 14 spike Suggested.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme since Period 9: Range 15-163 units, requiring higher safety stock despite a consistent 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-196.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are observing a significant shift in demand behavior following the high-volatility regime that started at Period 9. Over the last four periods (P15-P18), demand has plummeted to an average of 34.25 units/period (69, 15, 24, 29), a sharp contrast to the mean of ~100 observed between P9 and P14. This suggests a new low-demand regime or a post-spike correction. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of orders from P13 and P14 in periods 17 and 18 respectively. On-hand inventory is currently high (225 units) with a substantial pipeline (220 units), totaling 445 units against a very low recent demand trend. To prevent excessive holding costs while the backend policy naturally restricts ordering due to the high pipeline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 samples (N=10) to bridge the high-spike data (P14) and the current low-demand slump (P15-P18). This stabilizes the forecast around an average of 63 units/period, which is more representative of the current cooling trend than the long-term average or the previous peak average.

Carry-over insight: New low-demand regime detected at Period 15: Average demand dropped to ~34 units/period (P15-P18) from a previous average of ~100 (P9-P14).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-336.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a low-demand regime that began around Period 15. The demand for the last five periods (P15-P19) has been 69, 15, 24, 29, and 23, resulting in an average of 32 units/period. The lead time is consistently stable at 4 periods. We currently have excessive on-hand inventory (359 units) and 63 units in-transit (due to arrive in P20), while the expected demand over the (L+1)=5 period horizon is only around 160 units. Consequently, the pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 422) is more than double the required base stock. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward shift and allow the inventory to wind down by maintaining zero orders, which the OR backend will naturally do given the high inventory levels relative to the new demand parameters.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Low-demand regime confirmed (P15-P19): Average demand has dropped to 32 units/period, a significant decrease from the previous unstable regime. On-hand inventory is now excessive (>10x current avg demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-326.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained low-demand regime starting around Period 15. The recent 6-period average (P15-P20) is approximately 34.6 units per period, a sharp decline from previous levels. Current on-hand inventory is 374 units, which, relative to the current demand mean, represents over 10 periods of supply. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of P13, P14, P15, and P16 orders). Given the high on-hand inventory (374) and zero in-transit units, the pipeline inventory already exceeds any reasonable base stock calculation for the current regime (where base stock would be roughly (4+1)*35 = 175 units). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture this current low-demand shift for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for L. The OR backend will naturally set the order to zero as on-hand inventory far exceeds the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P15-P20) is now well-established with an average of ~35 units/period (compared to ~100 in the previous regime). On-hand inventory is significantly in surplus.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-310.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a significant low-demand regime starting from Period 15. The average demand from Period 15 to Period 21 is approximately 34 units per period (69, 15, 24, 29, 23, 48, 32). This is a stark drop from the previous high-volatility period (P9-P14). Currently, we have 342 units on-hand, which at the current consumption rate of ~34 units/period, represents over 10 periods of supply. The pipeline is empty (In-transit: 0), but since on-hand inventory is vastly higher than any reasonable base stock level for the current regime (where (1+L) * mean \u2248 5 * 34 = 170), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect this lower regime (P15-P21) to ensure the OR backend's target base stock reflects the current reality, even though the system will likely order 0 due to the high on-hand surplus.

Over the last 8 periods (P15-P22), the average demand is approximately 33 units per period (69, 15, 24, 29, 23, 48, 32, 25). Current on-hand inventory is 317 units, which is nearly 10 times the current average demand. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) and the large inventory surplus, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods of data (N=8) to reflect this lower regime. The OR engine's capped policy will ensure no additional orders are placed while the pipeline inventory (which is currently 0) plus on-hand inventory exceeds the calculated base stock. This strategy prioritizes reducing the current surplus to minimize holding costs while the low-demand trend persists.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a low level since Period 15. The recent 9-period average (P15-P23) is approximately 33 units/period, compared to the previously observed high-volatility regime (~100 units/period). On-hand inventory is currently 282 units, which covers approximately 8.5 periods of demand at the current rate (33 units/period). Given a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, the backend base stock target (1+L) should be around 5 periods of demand, roughly 165 units. Since on-hand inventory (282) already exceeds this target and there are no units in transit, no new orders should be placed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the current low-demand mean and variance accurately, and 'default' for lead time as it has remained consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods will correctly reflect the drop in volume and lead the OR backend to stop ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume regime starting from Period 15. Over the last 10 periods (P15-P24), the average demand is approximately 33.7 units, a significant drop from the previous volatile period. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 245 units, which covers more than 7 periods of average demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current demand and the high holding cost ($1.0/unit), the primary focus is on inventory reduction. I am setting L=4, mu_hat based on the last 10 samples (N=10) to reflect the recent low-demand regime, and sigma_hat also based on the last 10 samples. The backend logic will result in zero orders until the pipeline plus on-hand inventory falls below the computed base stock level, which is the desired outcome to minimize holding costs while the surplus clears.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P15-P24) confirmed steady: average demand ~34 units/period, down from ~97 previously. On-hand inventory is in significant surplus.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The low-demand regime starting from Period 15 continues to be stable. Over the last 11 periods (P15-P25), the average demand is 36.3 units/period. The most recent demand in Period 25 (62 units) is a slight uptick but still within a manageable range compared to the current on-hand inventory of 183 units. Since on-hand inventory is significantly higher than the expected demand for the lead time plus reviewing period ( (4+1)*36.3 = 181.5), the inventory is in a healthy surplus. The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. I will continue to use the recent_N method (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime, while maintaining L at the stabilized value of 4 via calculated history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-65.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 15. Analysis of demand from Period 15 to 26 shows an average (mu) of approximately 38.3 units/period, with a standard deviation (sigma) of approximately 14.8. Currently, on-hand inventory is 124 units with zero in-transit. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4, the review period + lead time is 5 periods. The required base stock at a 50% service level (as profit equals holding cost) is roughly 5 * 38.3 = 191.5 units. However, current inventory of 124 is being slowly depleted from a previous massive surplus. Demand in the last two periods (P25=62, P26=59) has trended slightly higher than the P15-P24 average (~34), so I will use N=12 to capture the specific low-demand regime fully. I am setting L to default (4) as arrivals have consistently followed the 4-period lead time. Parameters are set to manage the transition from surplus back to regular ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P15-P26 stabilized at an average of ~38 units/period, significantly lower than the P9-P14 peak. Last two periods (P25-P26) show a minor uptick to ~60 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a lower-volume regime compared to the Period 9-14 peak. While the long-term average for the recent regime (P15-P27) is approximately 38 units, demand has shown some volatility recently (P25=62, P26=59, P27=31). The average of the last 13 periods (P15-P27) is 37.6 units, but the last 3 periods average 50.6 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (93) plus in-transit (67) equals 160 units. Given L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 13-period window (N=13) captures the current regime's characteristics while smoothing the recent small spike. The OR backend will calculate the order based on (1+L) * mean demand, and since our pipeline (160) is higher than 5 * 38 (190), the system will likely place a small replenishment order or keep it capped to avoid excessive holding costs, as profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level (q) of 0.5.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime (P15-P27): Average demand is ~38 units/period, despite a brief uptick in P25-P26. Inventory is currently being drawn down from previous levels.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-demand regime since Period 15, with an average demand of approximately 39.5 units per period over the last 14 periods (P15-P28). Although there has been some volatility (ranging from 15 to 63 units), the mean is significantly lower than the P9-P14 peak (~100 units). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. As of Period 29, on-hand inventory has dropped to 30 units, and there are 96 units in-transit (ordered in P27 and P28). To maintain a target service level given the current regime, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 14-period window to capture this stable, lower mean (~40 units/period * (1+4) = 200). Sigma_hat is also set using the same window to provide a realistic buffer for the observed volatility within this regime. Base stock logic will likely suppress orders until the pipeline clears further, preventing excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P15-P28 stabilized at an average of ~40 units/period, with a range of 15-63. This is a sustained significant drop from the P9-P14 average of ~100.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 remains significantly lower than the previous period (P9-P14), stabilizing around a mean of 40 units/period (P15-P29 average: 39.7) with moderate volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. As of Period 30, on-hand inventory is low (8 units) due to the drawdown of previous surpluses, but the pipeline is well-stocked (165 units) from orders placed in P27-P29. We need to maintain this replenishment cycle to meet the established lower demand level without over-ordering. I am using recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of this low-demand regime (P15 onwards) while ignoring the previous high-demand spikes. This allows the backend to calculate a base stock that aligns with the current average of ~40 units/period and the observed variance in this regime.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 has stabilized at a significantly lower level (average ~38-40 units) compared to earlier peaks. However, recent periods (P27-P30) show slightly higher volatility (range 22-63). At Period 31, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 184 units in-transit (ordered P27-P30). With a confirmed stable lead time of 4 periods, the P27 order (67 units) is expected to arrive during Period 31, with subsequent orders arriving in P32-P34. The total pipeline of 184 units is intended to cover the next 5 periods (Review + Lead time) at the current average demand of ~40. I will maintain the current forecast regime to avoid over-ordering, as the pipeline is sufficient to restore a healthy stock level once arrivals begin this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P15-P30 remains stable at an average of ~38-40 units/period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory was temporarily depleted in P30, but a 184-unit pipeline (ordered P27-P30) is set to begin arriving in P31.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 15, with an average of approximately 39 units per period (P15-P31). Recent demand (P27-P31) specifically averages 34.8 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 27 order in Period 31. Inventory levels are recovering from a brief stockout in Period 30; an arrival of 67 units in P31 brought on-hand to 38. With a pipeline of 122 units (including 29 units arriving in P32), the current inventory position is sufficient but requires careful maintenance. I will use a recent_N approach (N=17) for mu_hat to capture the current stable low-demand regime starting at P15, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility in this period.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 15, following a volatile high-demand period. Analysis of the last 18 periods (P15-P32) shows an average demand of approximately 39.5 units per period. While there was a brief uptick in P25-P26 (62, 59 units), recent demand has returned to the 20-30 unit range (29, 29, 23). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 44 and In-transit inventory at 119 (arrivals scheduled for P33, P34, P35, P36), the total pipeline of 163 units sufficiently covers the expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods * ~40 units = 200). However, the OR backend's capped policy will manage the order size. I will use a recent_N of 18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this entire stable regime starting from Period 15, and use the calculated lead time (which is consistently 4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P15-P32 confirmed stable at ~40 units/period (range 15-63); Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

On-hand inventory is currently 53 units with 69 units in-transit (orders from P30-P33). We are transitioning from a surplus drawdown phase back into a steady-state replenishment phase. Given the stability of the current regime (spanning 19 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=19 to set the demand parameters. This ensures the base stock reflects the current lower-demand environment while accounting for recent volatility (range 15-63). Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 remains stable with an average of approximately 40 units per period. Recent data (P31-P34) shows demand values of 29, 23, 60, and 18, maintaining this average despite localized volatility. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P27-P30 orders arrived exactly in P31-P34). On-hand inventory is currently 54 units, with 116 units in transit (ordered P31-P34). To maintain an optimal base stock for the next 5 periods (L+1), and considering the historical standard deviation of this regime (~15 units), I will continue using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the full stability of the current low-demand regime since P15. This approach balances the stockout risk seen in P30 while preventing excessive holding costs as seen in earlier surplus periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 remains stable around 40 units per period. The last 5 periods (P31-P35) show an average demand of 31 units, reflecting a slight softening in the already low-demand regime. However, looking at the broader Period 15-35 window, the mean remains approximately 38. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 34 units with 125 units in-transit. To maintain a safe stock level without over-ordering (as profit and holding costs are equal at $1.0), I will use the recent 20-period demand history to set parameters, which captures the current low-demand volatility while smoothing out the minor fluctuations seen in the last few cycles.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 15, with an average of approximately 40 units/period and a range of 15-63. Specifically, the last 10 periods (P27-P36) average 37.2 units/period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P31-P36 reaching destination 4 periods after ordering). Current on-hand inventory is 17, and the pipeline is 113. I am using recent_N (N=22, covering the start of the low-demand regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this lower volatility and mean while ensuring enough stock to cover the L+1 window. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to maintain a safety buffer based on this recent performance.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 15, with an average of approximately 36 units per period over the most recent 10-period window (P28-P37). Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in P31 through P37. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (7 units), and there is a pipeline of 147 units. The goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the review period (1). Based on the recent average of ~36 units/period, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is approximately 180 units. With 154 units already on-hand and in-transit (7 on-hand + 147 in-transit), the system needs to order to reach the target base stock. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable low-demand environment while responding to recent fluctuations like the 43 units in P36.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower-demand regime since Period 15. Over the most recent 10 periods (P29-P38), the average demand is approximately 32 units/period (total 320 / 10). The single-period high of 60 within this window and several values in the low 20s indicate moderate volatility around this mean. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as evidenced by recent arrivals (P34-P38). Currently, we have 31 units on-hand and 98 units in-transit (orders from P35-P38). Since the promised lead time L=4 is reliable, I am setting L to default. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current stable demand mean (~32) and variance while excluding the older, high-demand regimes. This will help the OR backend maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover demand over 5 periods (L+1) while avoiding excessive holding costs from the previous surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P29-P38) confirmed stable with average ~32 units/period, slightly lower than the P15-P28 average; Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the current low-demand regime. Since Period 29, demand has averaged approximately 32.5 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 8.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent and verified by recent arrivals (Periods 31-39). My objective is to maintain a base stock that covers demand across the review period plus lead time (1+4 = 5 periods). With current on-hand inventory at 10 and in-transit pipe at 115, the total position is 125 units. At the current average demand (~33/period), 5 periods of demand equals ~165 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (capturing the stable regime since P29) to allow the OR backend to calculate the base stock level from these stabilized statistics, ensuring we bridge the gap between our current 125 units and the required coverage.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains relatively stable in the long term (since P15), but has shown a slight uptick in the most recent window. The average demand from P29 to P40 is approximately 32.8 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. As of P41, we have 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in P40 (demand 48 vs starting on-hand 24). However, the in-transit pipeline (ordered P37-P40) is 138 units (53+17+31+37), which is robust for the demand level. Specifically, the 53 units ordered in P33 arrived in P37, and the 66 units ordered in P34 arrived in P38. Following this, the 53 units ordered in P37 are expected to arrive in P41. To maintain a safe inventory level given recent volatility (demand ranging from 18 to 60), I will use the recent_N method with N=12 (P29-P40) to capture the current stable-but-variable regime.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the 'low-demand' state since Period 15, but has shown a recent slight dip. The period 39 summary suggested an average of ~32 units/period (P29-P38). Recent observations (P39-P41) show demand of 35, 48, and a very low 3. The current average of the last 13 periods (P29-P41) is approximately 32.5. On-hand inventory is 50, and there is a pipeline of 115 units (ordered P38-P41). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the revenue is $1 and holding cost is $1, the target service level q is 0.5 (ignoring the cap), meaning we aim to keep roughly one cycle of demand. The OR backend cap is designed to prevent over-ordering. I will use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-P28 stable low-demand regime, and default for L as it is consistently 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P29-P41) remains stable with an average of ~33 units/period; volatility remains moderate. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:

In Period 43, we have 27 units on-hand and 98 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 39-41). The pipeline inventory is healthy. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent and accurate based on recent arrivals (P37 and P38 orders arrived exactly on time). To maintain optimal service levels while minimizing holding costs, I will use a 14-period window (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the current stable regime (P29-P42). This results in a forecast that reflects the most recent demand behavior while smoothing out the minor volatility observed in the last few periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 29, following a significant drop from the high-volatility period (P9-P14). The average demand from Period 29 to Period 43 is approximately 33.4 units per period (Avg = 501 / 15 periods). Recent demand in Period 43 was 51 units, which is slightly above the regime average but within the historical range (3 to 63 units) for this lower-demand phase. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 39 order in Period 43. Current on-hand inventory is low (7 units), and there are 102 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 40-43). The order scheduled to arrive in Period 44 (ordered in Period 40) is 37 units. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=15) captures the stable average of ~33 units per period across 5 periods (L+1), while recent_N for sigma_hat (N=15) provides sufficient safety stock to handle the observed variance without excessive holding costs, as the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained relatively stable since Period 29, with an average demand of approximately 33-35 units per period. Recent periods (P41-P44) show demand values of 3, 40, 51, and 7, maintaining this moderate volatility. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all recent observations (P31 to P44). The current on-hand inventory is 37 units, while the pipeline inventory is 122 units (ordered in P41, P43, and P44). Given that the backend base-stock calculation uses (1+L) as the horizon, the total inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 159) is being compared against a 5-period demand window. At an average of 35 per period, 5 periods equals 175 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the stable regime starting from Period 29 to the present, ensuring the OR backend responds to the current mean and variance without being over-influenced by the extreme historical volatility seen around Period 14.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 29, with an average of approximately 33 units/period (mean demand P29-P45 is 31.8). Although recent volatility exists (ranging from 3 to 51 units), the underlying trend remains consistent. Lead time is reliably 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P37-P41). Current on-hand inventory is 19 units, with a pipeline of 92 units (ordered P42-P44). Period 42 had 0 units ordered, which could lead to a gap in arrivals in Period 46. To address this and the upcoming end-of-game (Period 50), I am setting mu_hat using the last 17 samples (P29-P45, N=17) to capture the current stable regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=17 to account for the moderate volatility observed. Leading L at 'default' (4) is appropriate given the consistent 4-period arrival pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized around an average of 40 units per period (P29-P46 average is ~36.5 units, but recent samples P43-P46 show higher fluctuation with 51, 7, 48, 53). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P41 order arrived P45). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand in P46 (53) exceeded starting on-hand (19). However, 144 units are in transit, with 35 units from P43 expected to arrive in the next period (P47 conclusion). Given the recent demand volatility (highs of 51, 48, 53), I will set mu_hat using the last 18 periods (P29-P46) to capture the current stable-but-volatile regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1), accounting for the current stockout and the high pipeline which will soon start replenishing on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P29-P46) maintains an average of ~37 units/period with increased short-term volatility (range 3-53). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Profit: $7.00, Daily Holding Cost: $28.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-21.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 29 has stabilized at an average of approximately 37 units per period, though recent volatility has increased (range 3-53). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 28 and in-transit at 134, the total pipeline is 162. Given the (L+1) planning horizon (5 periods), the expected demand is approximately 185 units. The OR backend uses a base stock policy where it targets a level covering mean demand plus safety stock. By setting L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' (N=19, covering P29-P47), we ensure the forecast reflects the current stable regime (~37/period). sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=19) to capture the current volatility for safety stock calculation. This approach balances the need to replenish against recent stockouts (P46) while avoiding excessive holding costs near the game's end (Period 48 of 50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-3.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 29 remains stable with an average of approximately 36 units per period, despite some short-term volatility (range 3-53). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. As we are approaching the final period (Period 50), the goal shifts from long-term stability to minimizing ending inventory while avoiding final-period stockouts. Current on-hand is 44, relative to an average demand of 36. Pipeline inventory is 77, with arrivals expected from orders placed in Period 45 (0 units), Period 46 (52 units), and Period 47 (25 units). The backend will calculate orders based on the 1+L (5 periods) demand window. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the stable regime from P29 onwards for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the calculate method for L, as the 4-period lead time is consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-18.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a stable regime that began around Period 29, with an average demand of approximately 36 units per period over the last 20 periods (P29-P49). Although Period 46 saw a brief stockout due to a missing shipment (Period 42 order was for 0 units, and P45 had 0 units arrived), inventory has stabilized with 31 on-hand. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high criticality of maintaining a good service level (profit=holding=$1.0), the backend's base-stock policy will aim for approximately a 50% service level plus the safety factor provided by the cap. I will use a recent_N of 21 to cover the entirety of this stable regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculation, and maintain the L at the confirmed value of 4.
