The product is a staple snack item (Regular chips) with relatively consistent demand. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5 and be available for demand in Period 5 (visible in Period 6's report). To maximize reward, I need to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since there is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, I must order enough to cover the expected cumulative demand from Period 1 through Period 5 to avoid stockouts. Expected demand for 5 periods @ 92 units/period is 460 units. I will add a small safety stock to account for variance (historical max is 109). Total target = 500 units.",

Based on the promised lead time of 4 periods, this shipment is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become available for sale in Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is no sales activity yet (sold=0 in P1). The historical data (Periods 1-5 including pre-game) shows demand fluctuations between 68 and 109 units, with an average of approximately 92 units per period (P1 demand was 75). With a lead time of 4 periods, I need to cover demand for at least 5 periods (L+1) to avoid stockouts until the next possible order arrives. Total exposure (demand for 5 periods) is roughly 460 units. My current in-transit inventory is 500 units, which covers this exposure. However, since the current on-hand is 0 and the first shipment won't arrive until Period 5 (concluding for Period 6 usage), I am already in a stockout situation for the immediate future. I will place a supplemental order to ensure that once the pipeline begins to flow, I have enough buffer against demand spikes, especially considering the high holding cost relative to profit ($1:$1) which suggests a lean inventory strategy. I'll order 100 units to maintain a rolling pipeline that matches the average demand per period.",

Total in-transit is 600 units. d) Inventory Assessment: Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts (Periods 1 and 2) because we started with 0 inventory and the lead time is long.

Demand has become more volatile recently (P41: 51, P42: 32, P43: 35, P44: 53), raising the effective mean from ~25 to ~40 units. I am in a supply gap because no orders were placed between P37 and P41 when inventory was high and demand was low. My goal is to cover the remaining periods (P45-P50) while the game ends at P50. Total remaining demand (P45-P50) at a mean of 40 units is 240 units. Total pipeline is 130 + current order. P45 demand will be lost as arrivals occur after the decision phase. P46 arrival: 40 units. P47 arrival: 35 units. P48 arrival: 55 units. I need an order now (P45) to arrive in P49. To cover P49 and P50 demand (~80 units) and recover from potential stockouts, I will order 85 units.",

The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 38 units. The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a significant 4-period demand gap caused by zero orders in P37-P41. To recover, we must rely on the pipeline. In-transit units (215) consist of orders from P42 (40), P43 (35), P44 (55), and P45 (85). Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the P42 order (40 units) is expected to arrive during P46 (visible in P47). Since we are at P46 of 50, we only have 4 periods remaining. Orders placed now (P46) will arrive in P50. Any order placed after P46 will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, I need to order enough to cover the expected demand for P50 and provide a small safety buffer for the final period, while considering that the P42-P45 orders (215 units) are already scheduled to arrive between P46 and P49.",

Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (17 units) following a stockout in Period 44-45. Promised and historical lead time is 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47, P48, P49, P50), orders placed now (P47) will arrive in Period 51 (P47+4), which is outside the game's horizon. Therefore, any order placed now will only incur costs without providing units for sale. The focus must be on managing existing in-transit inventory. There are 215 units in transit from orders placed in P43 (35), P44 (55), P45 (85), and P46 (40). These are scheduled to arrive in P47, P48, P49, and P50 respectively. At the current demand mean (~33), the incoming pipeline (215 units) is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 4 periods (~132 units total).
