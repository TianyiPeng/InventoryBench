Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical performance or conclusion data yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is observed as [109, 68, 99, 80, 105], which averages to 92.2 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 16.9. Since current on-hand inventory and in-transit units are 0, we need to establish a base stock levels immediately to cover the demand during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the 'explicit' method to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the provided 5-period sample mean and volatility to ensure the OR backend has a relevant starting point before it accumulates its own running totals.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 121 units, which are now in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we expect this order to arrive during Period 5 and be visible in the Period 6 start message. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and Period 1 demand of 75 units was lost because the starting inventory was 0. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5 provided: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105) show an average demand of 92.2 units per period. The Period 1 demand in the game history was 75, which is within a reasonable range of the historical mean. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's base-stock calculation for a service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 will target the median demand. I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical data points for a stable forecast, and 'default' for L to stick with the promised lead time until evidence suggest otherwise.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. In Period 1, we ordered 121 units, and in Period 2, we ordered 118 units, totaling 239 units in-transit. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and since the lead time is 4, we don't expect the first shipment until Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Demand for the first two periods was 75 and 129 (average 102). Historical demand samples for P1-P5 show an average of (109+68+99+80+105)/5 = 92.2. Given that the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5 (q = 1/(1+1)), meaning the OR backend will target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the provided historical demand distribution, and 'default' for L as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (121 units), Period 2 (118 units), and Period 3 (134 units) are currently in-transit (total 373 units). Since L=4, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will read at the start of Period 6). Consequently, on-hand inventory is currently 0, and all demand is being lost. The demand samples for the first 5 periods (including historical context) are 109, 68, 99, 80, 105. The mean demand is approximately 92.2 units per period. Since L=4, the OR backend logic will use (1+L) = 5 periods of demand to set the base stock. I will use the 'default' method for L (relying on the promised L=4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level precisely while we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (121 units), Period 2 (118 units), Period 3 (134 units), and Period 4 (109 units) are all currently in transit. Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. Since we have not yet reached the end of Period 5, we have seen 0 arrivals so far, which is consistent with a 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales because the initial demand occurred before the first shipment could arrive. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including the current period sample provided) is [109, 68, 99, 80, 105], while the 'conclude' messages show actual experienced demand as [75, 129, 93, 149]. The mean of all provided samples is ~92.2 units. For Period 5, I will use lead time L=4 (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using all 5 available samples (recent_N=5) to capture the initial demand distribution. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is calculated based on the observed mean and variance to satisfy future demand once the pipeline starts arriving.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order (placed in Period 1) arrived in Period 5 conclude (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time holds. We have 430 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Note that for Periods 1-4, sales were limited by zero inventory (stockouts), but Demand Resolution occurs after delivery. In Period 5, demand was 140 but only 121 units (the arrival) were available, resulting in 121 sold and 0 ending inventory. Looking at the five periods of demand (75, 129, 93, 149, 140), the mean is 117.2 and the standard deviation is 31.6. Since we've only had one shipment arrive, we stick to the promised lead time. I will use the last 5 samples (recent_N=5) to capture the current demand volatility and mean, setting the inventory position to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Significant stockouts occurred P1-P5 due to zero initial inventory and lead time delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Historically, demand over the first 6 periods (including provided pre-game data) has fluctuated, but the last 6 periods show an average demand of approximately 114 units (75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by the arrival of Period 1 and Period 2 orders (both arriving after 4 periods). On-hand inventory is low (19 units) due to early-game stockouts caused by the lead-time gap. Pipeline inventory is currently 468 units (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR engine will target the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the actual realized demand variance and level since the game started. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7 (all showing a lead time of 4). Demand has fluctuated between 75 and 149. The average demand over the last 7 periods is approximately 117. With a lead time (L) of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 19, and in-transit inventory is 418 (Orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). The OR backend uses the formula base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which means z* is 0. In this case, the base stock will effectively be mu_hat. To ensure we don't stock out while accounting for the recent demand volatility, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture all experienced demand patterns since the start.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8. Currently, we have 19 units on-hand and 457 units in-transit (orders from P5, P6, P7, and P8). The demand history shows some variability but remains relatively stable around a mean. Using the game history (P1-P8 demand: 75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99, 134, 109), the mean demand is 116. Regular chips are a stable product. Given the profit-to-holding ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, meaning we aim for the base stock to align closely with the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1). I will use the 'calculate' method for L to reflect the confirmed 4-period lead time and 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand and volatility to capture the full recent history after the initial startup phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1 through 5). On-hand inventory is currently 0 after Period 9 demand (94) exceeded starting inventory (88). The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 492 units, consisting of orders from Period 6 (156), Period 7 (84), Period 8 (148), and Period 9 (104). The order from Period 6 is expected to arrive during Period 10. Historical demand over the last 9 periods shows a mean of approximately 113.5 (standard deviation ~25). Since Period 5, demand has stabilized somewhat compared to the early stockout phase. I am using the 'calculate' method for L as the lead time has been perfectly stable at 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=9 to capture all available demand data while the system stabilizes. This will target a base stock level covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. History confirms a stable Lead Time (L) of 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5-P10). Demand samples (P1-P10) show a mean of ~110.9 units per period. The recent sample from P10 was lower (86), but overall demand remains relatively stable. The current on-hand inventory is 70, with 412 units in transit (ordered P7-P10). Since L=4, my parameters need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'calculate' for L as the observed lead time is consistent. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full revealed history since the initial stockout phase, providing a stable baseline for the OR backend's base-stock calculation.

Demand from P6-P11 average is approximately 99.8 units. Current on-hand inventory is 76 units with 400 units in-transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). Since lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods, I will use 'calculate' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (last 6 periods, P6-P11) excluding the early startup volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the pipeline while maintaining a safe service level for the $1 profit/$1 holding cost ratio.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 131 units, and there are 276 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently observed as 4 periods (P5-P12 data confirms 4 periods for all settled shipments). Demand has stabilized since the initial stockout phase; over the last 7 periods (P6-P12), the mean demand is 84.7 units with a standard deviation of 22.8 units. The inventory level is currently healthy, but we must maintain the pipeline to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Using recent_N=7 for demand capture (P6 onwards) prevents the extreme stockout noise of P1-P5 (where demand may have been inflated or reported differently) from skewing the forecast. The profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 0.50 (z=0), though the OR backend's capped policy provides additional buffer. I will set L to 4 periodically via default and use the recent demand regime (last 7 periods) for mu and sigma estimates.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 13. Demand has shown a significant downward shift in the most recent period (Period 13 demand was 33, compared to a prior average of ~102). While this may be a single-period outlier, I am using a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat to start weight-averaging this lower demand without overreacting instantly. Current on-hand inventory is 202, and there are 260 units in transit (ordered in P10, P11, P12, P13), which is ample for the (L+1) = 5 period horizon. Given Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the target service level is q=0.5, meaning the OR backend will aim for a base stock near the median. The parameters chosen balance the recent low demand against the established mean to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 13: demand dropped to 33 units from a historical average of ~102.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-76.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing the 'chips(Regular)' SKU with a confirmed lead time (L) of 4. Recent history shows a significant demand volatility: Period 13 saw a drop to 33 units, but Period 14 bounced back to 101 units, which is closer to the long-term average (~95 units). The 'carry-over insight' from Period 14 regarding a drop to 33 units appears to have been a single-period outlier or a highly unstable shift rather than a sustained low-demand regime, given P14's demand of 101. Currently, on-hand inventory is 177 and in-transit is 184 (Total pipeline = 361). With the service level target q = 0.5 (since Profit $1 = Holding $1), the OR engine seeks a base stock roughly equal to the median demand over (L+1)=5 periods. 5 periods * ~95 units = 475. Given the high on-hand levels relative to the most recent low demand spike, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture the recent variance while recognizing the return to higher demand levels in Period 14, ensuring we don't over-order while we have high stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift noted in P14 was temporary; Period 14 demand (101) returned to near historical levels (~95-100), suggesting volatility rather than a sustained drop.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-23.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand volatility (33 in P13, 101 in P14, 113 in P15) suggests that the low demand in P13 was an outlier rather than a sustained regime shift. The current mean demand over the last 15 periods is approximately 102 units. Currently, on-hand inventory (136) plus in-transit stock (142: from P12, P13, P14, P15 orders) totals 278 units. With a confirmed lead time (L) of 4, the target pipeline should cover roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1). Based on a mean of 102, the target base stock is approximately 510. The OR backend will calculate the order size based on the parameter settings. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the service level q = 0.5, meaning the policy will aim for a base stock close to the median. I will use a recent window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent variability while smoothing out the P13 outlier. L is set to 'calculate' to align with the consistently observed 4-period lead time.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history has shown significant volatility in the last four periods (33, 101, 113, 54), while the overall baseline mean remains close to the historical 95-100 units. Period 16 demand (54) was approximately half the expected mean, mirroring the spike/dip pattern seen earlier. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and observed lead time consistency (consistently 4), I need to set parameters for a 5-period window (L+1). Current inventory (106 on-hand + 256 in-transit = 362) covers about 3.8 periods of demand at a mean of 95. The OR backend needs to account for the heightened volatility (recent standard deviation is higher than early periods). I will use recent_N=10 to capture the current variability while maintaining a stable mean estimate. This will allow the OR engine to decide if the current pipeline is sufficient or if a small top-up is needed to maintain service levels in the face of recent 100+ demand spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-138.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, the product chips(Regular) shows significant demand volatility. The recent historical demand includes low values (33, 54, 28) and standard values (101, 113), making the previous mean less reliable. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across 13 successful arrivals. Current on-hand (166) plus in-transit (254) totals 420 units. With an average demand over the last 10 periods of approximately 83 units, the projected demand over L+1 (5) periods is 415. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat captures the recent shifts in demand, while recent_N=10 for sigma_hat accounts for the increased volatility. The lead time method 'calculate' is chosen as the actual lead time has stabilized at the promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 13, with demand fluctuating between 28 and 113 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-116.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe an ending on-hand inventory of 141 units and an in-transit pipeline of 254 units. The lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (arriving in Period N+4). Since Period 13, demand has exhibited high volatility with a noticeable downward shift in the last three periods (54, 28, 25). The historical average has dropped from ~100 to an average of ~70 over the last six periods (P13-P18). Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 50%, meaning we should target the mean demand. With 141 on-hand + 254 in-transit = 395 units total inventory, we are currently overstocked relative to recent demand trends (estimated demand for review+lead time of 5 periods at ~70/period would be ~350). I am selecting the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for both mean and standard deviation to capture this recent increased volatility and lower average demand, allowing the inventory levels to naturally rationalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16: average demand decreased to ~35 units over the last three periods (P16-P18), compared to the previous average of ~100. This follows a period of high volatility starting Period 13.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-139.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Between Period 1 and Period 12, demand averaged approximately 102 units. However, from Period 16 through Period 19, demand has dropped sharply, averaging approximately 31 units (54, 28, 25, 16). This sustained low-demand period requires an adjustment to the forecast. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this new low-demand regime (approx. 31 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent completed arrivals. Currently, on-hand inventory (155) plus in-transit stock (224) is 379 units, which is high relative to the recent demand trend. Using recent statistics will allow the OR backend to set a much lower base stock, effectively pausing new orders until the excess inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: average demand decreased from ~100 to ~31 units (-69%) over the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-253.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained low-demand regime for chips(Regular) that began around Period 16. Over the last five periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 28.6 units (54, 28, 25, 16, 20), a significant drop from the historical Mean of ~100. The carry-over insights confirm this shift. We currently have 273 units on-hand and 86 in-transit (ordered P17, expected arrival P21). Our pipeline inventory (359) is extremely high relative to current demand (~28.6 per period). With a lead time of 4 periods, total coverage needed is for 5 periods (L+1), or approximately 143 units. Since we have 359 units currently in the pipeline, we are significantly overstocked and must avoid ordering further. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this low-demand regime, and L is calculated based on the stable history of 4 periods. The high on-hand inventory will incur significant holding costs, but the OR backend's base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) will result in zero orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime confirmed: Period 16-20 average demand is 28.6 units, compared to ~100 in the first 12 periods. Inventory levels are currently excessive relative to this new demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-283.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly since Period 16, dropping from a historical mean of approximately 100 units to a sustained low of roughly 30 units (average of the last 6 periods is 30.1). Current on-hand inventory is 321 units, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 10 periods of demand. Given the promised lead time (L=4) and high holding costs ($1.0/unit relative to $1.0/unit profit), the inventory position is excessively high. To allow inventory to bleed down and avoid further holding costs, the OR parameters must reflect this new low-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 (Periods 16-21) to capture the current low-demand regime (avg ~30, std ~14) while ignoring the high-demand data before the changepoint.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly starting around Period 16. In the last 7 periods (P16-P22), demand has averaged 32.1 units compared to the early average of ~100. Currently, on-hand inventory is 277 units with zero in-transit shipments (as previous large orders from P16/P17 have arrived). Given the current demand of ~32 units and a lead time of 4 periods, a base stock level (covering L+1=5 periods) should be approximately 160-200 units. Since current on-hand inventory (277) is significantly higher than this requirement, the OR backend capped policy will correctly result in zero orders. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this sustained low-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (7) to reflect the recent variability within this new regime. L is maintained as the promised 4 periods, which has been consistent throughout history.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. The average demand has dropped from approximately 100 units to roughly 33 units over the last 8 periods (P16-P23). Current on-hand inventory is 242 units, which is extremely high given the new demand level (approximately 7.3 periods of coverage). There are no units in transit. Since the goal is to maximize profit minus holding costs (Profit=1, Holding=1), maintaining such high inventory results in substantial holding costs that outweigh the potential profit from infrequent sales. I will set the demand parameters to reflect this recent low-demand regime using N=8 (the length of the new regime from P16-P23) to allow the OR backend to recalculate a much lower base-stock level. The system will continue to order 0 units (due to the cap and current high inventory relative to the lower mu_hat) until the surplus is depleted. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has sustained a significant downward shift starting around Period 16. In the first 12 periods, average demand was approximately 102 units. Over the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the average demand has dropped to 32.3 units. Currently, there is an excessive on-hand inventory of 211 units and no units in-transit. Given the current average demand (~32) and the lead time of 4 periods, a safe base stock level (covering L+1=5 periods) would be around 160-200 units. Since on-hand inventory (211) already exceeds this, no new orders are required. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 to reflect this lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend caps the orders until inventory levels normalize. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime confirmed (P16-P24): mean demand decreased by ~68% to 32.3 units/period. Current inventory levels remain in surplus.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a sustained regime shift starting from Period 16. Analyzing the demand from P16 to P25 (the last 10 periods), the mean demand is approximately 31.9 units per period, which is a significant drop (~68%) from the initial average of ~100 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 183 units with zero in-transit, which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the (L+1) period window (4+1=5 periods). Given the current mean, 5 periods of demand would require approximately 160 units. However, because the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend naturally targets a 50% service level (z=0) unless inventory is extremely low. To align the OR backend with this new low-demand environment and prevent unnecessary ordering while current stock depletes, I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-115.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is well-confirmed and sustained. Over the last 11 periods (P16-P26), the mean demand has stabilized significantly lower, around 32 units, compared to the initial ~100 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 149 units with zero in-transit. Calculated lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the new demand level (149 units / ~32 units/period \u2248 4.6 periods of supply), the pipeline is currently overstocked. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to isolate the low-demand regime (P16-P26). This will set a lower base stock level, allowing the excess inventory to bleed off naturally through sales before triggering new orders. Holding costs and profit are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which further supports carrying less inventory in this stable, low-demand environment.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, dropping from a mean of ~100 to a sustained average of ~33. Over the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand is 32.7 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 108 units with 12 units in transit, totaling 120 units. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a desired coverage of (L+1) = 5 periods, the required base stock is approximately 5 * 32.7 \u2248 164 units. The system is currently in a surplus state but inventory is gradually drawing down toward the target level. I will use recent_N (N=12) for demand mean and standard deviation to align the OR backend with this lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a lower regime starting around Period 16. Previous demand averaged ~100 units, but the average over the last 13 periods (P16-P28) is approximately 33.3 units. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all successfully concluded shipments. At the start of Period 29, the inventory position is 128 units (71 on-hand + 57 in-transit). Given the target base stock of (L+1) * mu_hat, and with L=4, mu_hat should reflect the current 33.3 units/period average. (4+1)*33.3 = 166.5. Currently, we have 128 units, meaning we are coming back into a position where ordering is necessary to maintain a service level for the upcoming (L+1) window. I will use recent_N (N=13) to capture this stable low-demand regime and lead time.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 14 periods (P16-P29) of this regime, the mean demand is approximately 32.1 units with a standard deviation of 9.77. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on historical arrivals (e.g., P17 order arrived in P21). Currently, on-hand inventory is 38 units and in-transit is 95 units (from orders in P27, P28, and P29). Total pipeline inventory is 133 units. Given the low-demand mean of ~32 units, a target base stock for (L+1) = 5 periods would be roughly 160 units plus a safety buffer. Since current pipeline (133) is below the likely base stock target (~160-200), the system needs to maintain a steady ordering cadence to prevent stockouts as the previous bulk inventory has finally been depleted. I will use N=14 to capture this low-demand regime specifically for forecasting.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable at a lower level (~33 units/period) since Period 16. However, we are currently facing a potential stockout risk because current on-hand inventory is down to 11 units, while the next scheduled arrival (from the order in Period 27) is not expected until Period 31's arrival phase (visible in Period 32). This means we must satisfy Period 31's demand with only 11 units on hand. From Period 31 to Period 35 (Review + Lead Time L=4), we expect total demand of approx 165 units. The pipeline inventory (128 units) + on-hand (11 units) currently totals 139 units. We need to bridge the gap to reach the target base stock. I will use recent_N (N=15) to capture the stable low-demand regime since Period 16. L remains at the promised 4 periods as observed lead times have consistently matched this.

Carry-over insight: Significant stockout risk for Period 31: On-hand inventory (11) is below average period demand (~33), and the next order (P27) is not due to arrive until Period 31's arrival phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we experienced a stockout because on-hand inventory was insufficient to meet demand (demand 33, starting inventory 23). The shipment from P27 arrived as expected (lead time 4). Since Period 16, demand has stabilized into a lower regime. The average demand for the last 16 periods (P16-P31) is approximately 31.6 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, my parameters need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=16 to capture this lower demand regime accurately. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P27 arrival. Stocking out at zero on-hand inventory while waiting for in-transit orders (141 units total) is the current challenge. With 141 in-transit and a base stock target based on ~32 demand/period, the pipeline is currently well-stocked to recover from the stockout as P28-P31 orders arrive.

Carry-over insight: Stockout confirmed in P31 (sold 23 on demand 33). Demand remains in the low regime (avg ~32 since P16). Lead time continues to be stable at 4 periods (P27 arrived P31).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a 'low' state since Period 16, with an average of approximately 31.8 units over the last 17 periods. Recent demand (P28-P32) has been consistent around 28-37 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 17 and in-transit is 119. A replenishment cycle has resumed after a long hiatus (P27-P32), with lead times confirmed at 4 periods (P27 arrived P31, P28 arrived P32). Pipeline inventory now consists of 38 (P29), 33 (P30), 25 (P31), and 23 (P32), totaling 119 units, which is ample to cover the lead time demand and safety stock at the current lower demand level (total demand over 5 periods is roughly 160). I will use the last 17 periods (N=17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect this sustained low-demand regime, and keep L at the calculated average lead time which has been consistently 4.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a sustained low-demand regime starting from Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 33 is approximately 31.5 units, a significant drop from the initial ~100 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by recent arrivals (P27 in P31, P28 in P32, P29 in P33). We currently have 45 units on-hand and 108 units in-transit (orders from P30, P31, P32, P33). Period 34 demand will be satisfied by on-hand inventory, and the P30 order (33 units) is expected to arrive during the Period 34 arrival phase. Our pipeline is currently rich relative to the new demand level (153 total units vs an expected 5-period demand of ~158). I will use the recent N=18 periods (P16-P33) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new regime, ensuring we maintain a high service level while preventing the excessive overstocking seen in the middle periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) remains in the low-state that started around Period 16. Over the last 19 periods (P16-P34), demand has averaged approximately 31 units per period, a significant drop from the ~100 units observed earlier. Period 31 saw a brief stockout because local on-hand inventory was insufficient for a 33-unit demand, but arrivals from P28, P29, and P30 have since replenished the stock. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P30 arrived in P34). Current on-hand is 46, with 79 in-transit units scheduled to arrive over the next few periods (from orders in P31-P34). Given the current demand mean of ~31, I will use recent_N=19 to capture this stable low-demand regime and use the calculate method for lead time as it has been consistently 4. These parameters will help the OR engine maintain a base stock that aligns with the lower volume while avoiding the excess holding costs seen between P13 and P26.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a 'low-demand' regime that began around Period 16. Over the last 20 periods (P16-P35), the average demand is approximately 32.2 units. Recent demand in the last 5 periods (P31-P35) remains consistent with this, averaging 29.4 units despite some fluctuations (range 10-44). Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P27, P28, P29, P30, and P31 all exhibiting L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 27 and in-transit is 86. Total pipeline inventory is 113. Given the Lead Time (L=4) plus the current review period, the inventory needs to cover 5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~32, this requires approximately 160 units (plus safety stock). The pipeline of 113 is slightly below this, and the OR backend's natural replacement logic will adjust. I will use recent_N (N=20) for demand and volatility to capture the characteristics of this sustained low-demand regime specifically.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand state since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 30.6 units per period over the last 21 periods. This is a significant shift from the initial pre-Period 13 average of ~100. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36. Current on-hand inventory is 40 units, and in-transit inventory is 110 units (orders from P33-P36). Given the low-demand regime, a pipeline of 110 units is more than enough to cover the lead time + review period (5 periods * ~31 units = 155 units required total). The OR backend parameters are set to reflect this lower mean and variance. I am using recent_N=21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire duration of the low-demand regime starting at P16. L is set to calculate as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods throughout the game history.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P36) average is 30.6 units/period, compared to the initial ~100. Lead time stability at 4 periods remains confirmed.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable low-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 30.1 units per period over the last 22 periods. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P31-P37). Current on-hand inventory is 46 units, and there are 88 units in-transit (orders from P34-P37), meaning the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the current low-demand regime's mean and volatility while excluding the initial high-demand period. This helps the OR backend compute a base stock that avoids over-ordering while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the moderate volatility observed (e.g., P35 demand was 44).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 30 units per period. Recent demand (P33-P38) has been even lower, averaging around 19 units, though this is within expected volatility for this regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P34 order in P38. Currently, on-hand inventory is 29 units and there is 97 units in-transit (orders from P35, P36, P37, and P38). Given the promised lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. With a target mean of ~30/period, required pipeline stock is ~150. Current total inventory (29 + 97 = 126) is slightly below this target. I will use recent_N (N=23, covering P16-P38) to capture the sustained low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time calculation which aligns with the observed 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing the last 24 periods (P16-P39), the average demand is approximately 29 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P31-P39). Currently, the inventory position is comfortable: On-hand is 47 and In-transit is 89, totaling 136 units. Given the target service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 for the base stock formula, but the backend uses the capped policy with a 0.95 safety factor), the system is well-covered for the L+1 window. I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical stability of 4 periods and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=24 to capture this low-demand regime (post-P16) while smoothing out the minor volatility seen in recent weeks (e.g., demand ranging from 10 to 44). This ensures the OR backend doesn't over-order based on the high-demand periods (P1-P15).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a low-regime shift that began around Period 16. Analyzing the recent 25 periods (P16-P40), the mean demand is approximately 28.5 units, which is significantly lower than the initial ~100 units observed in P1-P12. Over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), demand has dropped further (mean \u2248 14.8), suggesting a potential secondary decline or increased volatility within the low regime. On-hand inventory is currently high (86 units) relative to recent demand, and there are 53 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining service levels, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for lead time as it remains consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains low: P16-P40 average is 28.5 units. Possible secondary downward trend noted P36-P40 with average demand of 14.8 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the 'low' state established since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 28.5 units. However, recent periods (P36-P41) have shown increased volatility and a lower average of approx 20.8 units, including a significant drop to single digits (P40) followed by a spike to 51 (P41). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 40, and in-transit inventory is 52 (Orders from P38, P39, P40, P41). Total pipeline is 92. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, effectively targeting the median demand. I will use recent_N=26 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire low-demand regime since Period 16, providing the backend with a stable base for the decreased demand levels while accounting for recent volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume regime since Period 16, with a more recent significant drop observed from Period 36 onwards. Evaluating the last 7 periods (P36-P42), the average demand is 22.4 units, a decrease from the previous low-regime average of ~30. In Period 42, on-hand inventory is 21 with in-transit inventory at 89 (orders from P39, P40, P41, P42). Specifically, the P39 order (24 units) is expected to arrive during the Period 43 arrival phase, which should sufficiently cover current demand levels. The lead time remains highly stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (1:1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (base stock at the mean). I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat to capture the most recent downward trend while maintaining enough data for stability. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 36: average demand decreased from ~31 to 22.4 units (-28%) over the last 7 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone two regime shifts. The first occurred around Period 16, dropping demand from ~100 to ~31 units. A second downward shift was confirmed at Period 43, with the average demand over the last 8 periods (P36-P43) settling at approximately 23.9 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P39 order in P43. Current on-hand inventory is low (10 units), but pipeline inventory is high (68 units), with 11 units ordered in P40 expected to arrive in Period 44's arrival phase. Given the current low demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand behavior while maintaining the stable lead time estimate of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 begins with 0 units on-hand and 99 units in-transit. In Period 44, a stockout occurred (sold 21 on demand 53) because on-hand inventory was insufficient to cover the demand spike. The secondary demand regime shift identified in Period 43 (starting P36) showed a mean of ~22.4 units, but the last 4 periods (P41-P44) have shown higher volatility and an average demand of 42.75 units, suggesting the 'secondary shift' might have been transient or volatility is increasing again. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the current 0 on-hand status and 50 units ordered in P42 (due P46), I need to ensure the pipeline covers the remaining 5 periods of the game (L+1). I will use recent_N (N=9, covering P36-P44) for demand parameters to capture the current volatile but generally lower-than-initial regime (~30-40 range), which allows for the recent spikes while respecting the overall lower demand level compared to the start of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased P41-P44 (avg 42.75) compared to the P36-P40 period (avg 14.8), challenging the previously identified secondary downward shift. The regime is now characterized by high variance around a mean of ~30-35 units.

The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) following a demand spike (Avg P41-P44: 42.75) that exhausted the low inventory buffer kept during the previous low-demand regime. Period 45 demand was 19, but only 4 units were sold as supply was restricted. Demand analysis: the primary regime (P16-P45) averages ~30.6. However, the secondary drop (P36-P40 avg: 14.8) was clearly followed by a bounce (P41-P44 avg: 42.75). Given Period 45 was 19, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture this higher volatility period (P36-P45) which averages 25.2 units/period. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. In-transit inventory is 133 units (Orders from P42, P43, P44, P45), which is sufficient to cover (L+1) demand at current rates (5 * 25.2 = 126). Setting mu_hat to recent_N (N=10) and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=10) to account for the increased variance seen in the last 10 periods (14 to 53 range).

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Demand regime from P36-P45 shows increased volatility (Range 8-53) with a mean of 25.2. Recent stockouts (P44-P45) highlight the danger of the 'secondary downward shift' identified in P43, which has been superseded by high variance volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within the lower regime that established around Period 16. Over the last 11 periods (P36-P46), the mean demand is 26.3 units, but with a wide range (8 to 53). Recent periods have seen stockouts (P44, P45) because the order quantities based on the previously perceived downward trend were insufficient to cover the upside volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P42 arrived in P46). On-hand inventory is currently 27, with 83 units in transit (orders from P43, P44, P45). Specifically, 3 units are expected in P47, 42 in P48, and 38 in P49. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high variance, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=11, covering the current volatile regime from P36-P46) and the stable lead time of 4. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) using the higher observed variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently characterized by high volatility since Period 36, with observations ranging from 8 to 53. The most recent demand (P47) was 31, consistent with the identified mean for the high-variance low-demand regime. Average demand since the volatility spike (P41-P47) is approximately 34.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 101 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, P44's order (42 units) is expected to arrive in Period 48, followed by P45 (38 units) in Period 49. Due to the proximity to the game end (Period 50) and recent stockouts from P44-P47, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 periods (P36-P47) to capture both the recent mean and the increased volatility while ensuring enough stock to cover the remaining 3 periods of the game. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has remained stable throughout the history.

Carry-over insight: No new sustained changes; volatility remains the primary characteristic of the current low-demand regime.

Daily Profit: $42.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period. The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has zero on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 48 (demand 56, sold 42). Current in-transit inventory is 91 units, consisting of orders from P45 (38 units), P47 (21 units), and P48 (32 units). The order from P45 (38 units) is expected to arrive during P49's arrival resolution (lead time = 4). However, with only one period remaining after this one (P50), any order placed now (P49) with a 4-period lead time will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, the primary goal is to manage the existing pipeline and on-hand inventory to satisfy the remaining demand. The demand regime from P36-P48 shows high volatility with a mean of 29.5. Given the zero on-hand status and the final stages of the game, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent average demand and use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed recently, ensuring the OR engine attempts to cover the immediate demand gap with the incoming P45 order.

Daily Profit: $30.00, Daily Holding Cost: $8.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 8 units and in-transit is 106 units. Historically, a clear demand regime shift occurred at Period 16, moving from an average of ~100 to ~30 units. Recent periods (P41-P49) show increased volatility around a slightly higher mean of approximately 38 units (ranging from 19 to 56). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P45 order in P49. To account for the recent increase in both average demand and volatility since P44, I will use a recent_N method with N=7 (covering P43-P49) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent volatile behavior and ensures the order-up-to level (base stock) accommodates the (L+1)=5 period risk horizon. Given the current 106 units in-transit (orders from P47, P48, P49 yet to arrive) plus 8 on-hand, the pipeline is relatively healthy against the current demand average, but the increased variance requires a slightly wider safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high (P44-P49 range: 19-56, avg ~38). The 'secondary downward shift' identified in P43 has been invalidated by this increased volatility which now informs the current regime.
