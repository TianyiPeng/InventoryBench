Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no history to analyze for lead-time deviations or demand shifts yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no previous 'conclude' messages, we assume the actual lead time matches the promised (L=4). Historical demand data shows samples [109, 68, 99, 80, 105], with an average of 92.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. For the first order, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to set the base stock level. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4) * 92.2 = 461 and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+4) * 17.5 \u2248 39.1. With a high profit and low holding cost ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level to minimize stockouts during the lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 122 units. Per the promised lead time of 4 periods, this order is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that 0 units arrived and we had 0 starting inventory, resulting in 75 lost sales since demand cannot be met without stock. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including the starting samples provided) are 109, 68, 99, 80, 105. Period 1 demand in the game was 75. Combining these, the average demand is approximately 89 units. Since L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the default calculation (mean of all samples) provided by the backend for mu_hat will use the historical samples plus the Period 1 observation. No lead time data is yet available to calculate a drift, so we stick to 'default' (promised lead time).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Reviewing history: Period 1 (ordered 122) and Period 2 (ordered 118) have concluded, with a total in-transit of 240 units. No arrivals have occurred yet, which is consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods (P1 order expected P5, P2 order expected P6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because starting inventory was 0. Demand samples range from 68 to 129, with a mean of ~92. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 19:1, suggesting a high service level (~95%). Since the promised lead time is 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With demand samples P1: 109, P2: 68, P3: 99, P4: 80, P5: 105 (provided in seeds), and historical game demand P1: 75, P2: 129, the demand appears stable but volatile. I will use 'default' methods to leverage the full sample set for now, as no clear regime shift is detected and we are awaiting the first arrivals to validate lead time.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4), meaning they will first be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Consequently, the current on-hand inventory is 0, and sales have been 0 despite demand, which is expected given the lead time. The in-transit inventory is 371 units (122 from P1, 118 from P2, 131 from P3). Demand for the first five historical samples was 109, 68, 99, 80, 105 (Mean \u2248 92). The demand observed in the first three game periods was 75, 129, 93 (Mean \u2248 99). These are relatively consistent. I will use the 'default' methods which utilize the full history for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat, as there is no evidence yet of a lead time shift or a significant demand regime change. The OR backend will target a base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1-4 are currently in-transit (Total 499 units). Per the timing rules, an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 4 should arrive during Period 5's execution and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, which is expected given the lead time. Demand samples show a mean of approximately 92.2 units (75, 129, 93, 149, 105). I will use the default method for L as there is no evidence yet to contradict the promised lead time of 4. Since the demand shows some variability but no clear regime shift yet, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean while waiting for the first shipment to arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2318.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on history, the order from Period 1 arrived at the start of Period 5 (concluded message read at Period 6), confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because demand has consistently exceeded arrivals, primarily due to the 4-period lead time delay and stockouts in Periods 1-4. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 536 units (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, 5). Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105 (Mean \u2248 92). However, the 'conclude' messages show demand values of 75, 129, 93, 149, 140 (Mean \u2248 117). I will rely on the conclude message demand data as it reflects the realized environment. I'll use L=4 (default) and recent_N for demand (N=5) to capture the trend of the last 5 periods. Sigma will also use recent_N to reflect actual volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Average demand in first 5 periods (from conclude messages) is 117.2 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1862.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have confirmed the lead time is exactly 4 periods based on deliveries from Period 1 (arrived P5) and Period 2 (arrived P6). On-hand inventory is currently low (19 units) because the initial demand exceeded the first shipment. The demand history from 'conclude' messages (P1-P6: 75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99) shows an average of approximately 114.17 units/period. The provided pre-game demand samples (P1-P5: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105) averaged 92.2. The actual demand encountered during gameplay is significantly higher (~23% increase). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=6) to capture this higher mean, and explicit methodology to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 570 units). With 585 in transit and 19 on hand, we are well-positioned, but must maintain the higher forecast to avoid stockouts in the coming periods.

Carry-over insight: Gameplay demand (P1-P6) is ~114 units/period, significantly higher than pre-game samples (Avg 92). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2530.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have confirmed the lead time (L) is stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 arriving in Periods 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Demand patterns have shifted significantly from the pre-game average (~92) to a higher gameplay average. The average demand over the first 7 periods of gameplay is approximately 117 units per period [(75+129+93+149+140+99+134)/7 = 117]. There is high volatility (standard deviation ~27). Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Current pipeline inventory (529 units) plus on-hand (16 units) equals 545 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this higher gameplay demand regime while excluding the irrelevant pre-game samples. L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Gameplay demand (P1-P7) average confirmed at ~117 units/period, significantly higher than pre-game samples. Lead time consistently observed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2036.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). Demand during the gameplay periods (P1-P8) has averaged approximately 116 units/period (total 928 / 8), which is significantly higher than the pre-game sample average of 92.2. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P5-P8) show a mean of 120.5 units/period. The current pipeline (In-transit: 544) includes orders from P5, P6, P7, and P8. To ensure we cover the risk of stockouts during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the gameplay average of ~118 units/period multiplied by 5. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=8) to capture the higher volatility seen during actual gameplay compared to pre-game data. Method for L is 'default' since the promised lead time of 4 matches the observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Gameplay demand (P1-P8) average is stabilized at ~116 units/period, 25% higher than pre-game samples. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1686.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P5 arrival from P1, P6 from P2, P7 from P3, P8 from P4, and P9 from P5). Demand shifted significantly at the start of gameplay compared to the pre-game samples. Pre-game demand mean was ~92, while gameplay demand (P1-P9) has averaged approximately 114 units (75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99, 134, 109, 94). Even though the last four periods have shown slightly lower demand (avg 109), the overall average since Period 1 is the most reliable baseline given the volatility. I will set L to 4 using the 'calculate' method as it has been stable. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture only the gameplay demand regime (P1-P9), excluding the lower pre-game samples to prevent under-ordering. sigma_hat will also use N=9 to capture gameplay volatility. This targets a service level of ~95% (Profit $19 / (Profit $19 + Holding $1) = 0.95), which the OR backend handles via the base stock formula.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe stable performance relative to our strategy. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on 6 consecutive arrivals (P5-P10). Average demand from gameplay samples (P1-P10) is 110.8 units per period, which is higher than the pre-game samples (92.2). However, looking at the last 5 periods (P6-P10), demand has slightly cooled to an average of 104.4 compared to the surge seen in P1-P5 (average 117.2). We are currently in a good inventory position with 181 units on-hand and 394 in transit. To avoid over-ordering as demand stabilizes after the initial surge, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full gameplay history (P1-P10) while excluding the less relevant pre-game samples. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers (4+1) periods of demand at the observed gameplay rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Average gameplay demand (P1-P10) is 110.8, showing a slight decrease from the initial peak but remaining ~20% above pre-game levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1304.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 178 units with 392 units in-transit. Analyzing the 'conclude' messages from Periods 5 through 11, the actual lead time for chips(Regular) has been consistently 4 periods (matching the promised lead time). Looking at historical demand within the game (Periods 1-11), the demand values were [75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99, 134, 109, 94, 86, 78]. There is a noticeable decline in demand over the last five periods (averaging ~92), compared to the earlier periods (averaging ~117). I will use a window of the last 11 samples (all gameplay data) to set my parameters, as this captures the full range of actual gameplay demand while moving away from the pre-game seed data which was lower (92 average). Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period observations and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=11 to balance the initial peak and recent dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1539.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current state shows on-hand inventory of 228 and in-transit units of 314. Reviewing the 'Period 12 conclude' message, the shipment ordered in Period 8 arrived exactly on schedule at L=4. This confirms the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 6, demand has shown a downward trend compared to the initial high-demand phase (P1-P5). Demand values from P6 to P12 are: 99, 134, 109, 94, 86, 78, 93. The average for these 7 periods is 99 units. This represents a distinct regime shift from the early gameplay average (which was ~117). Using N=7 for recent_N captures this lower-demand regime accurately while discarding the higher noise of the initial periods. Setting L=4 (default) and using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will adjust the base stock to target this lower mean, preventing excessive inventory buildup while maintaining the desired service level (calculated as 95% by backend).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: Average demand decreased from ~117 to ~99 (-15%) and has remained stable at this lower level for 7 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $325.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is currently in a lower-demand regime that stabilized around Period 6. The average demand from Period 6 through Period 13 is approximately 91 units per period, a significant drop from the early gameplay average (~117). Period 13 specifically saw a very low demand of 33, which might be an outlier or a further downward shift; however, I will treat it as part of the current lower-demand regime for now. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P5 through P13). With On-hand (302) and In-transit (228) totaling 530 units, and the expected demand over the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5) being roughly 455 units (based on the ~91 avg), we are adequately stocked. I am selecting 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 (back to Period 6) to capture this established lower demand regime while filtering out the high-demand noise from the first 5 periods. Sigma_hat will also use N=8 to reflect the current volatility. L is set to 'calculate' as the actual lead time has been perfectly stable at 4.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 270 units with 189 units in-transit. Demand since Period 13 has slowed significantly, with Period 13 at 33 and Period 14 at 101. The Carry-Over Insight from Period 13 correctly identified a demand regime shift around Period 6/7, where demand dropped from an early peak (avg ~117) to a lower level (avg ~99). However, recent performance (last 4 periods) shows an even lower average of ~76 units. Given the high inventory on-hand (270) and consistent lead time of 4 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 9 samples (Periods 6-14) to better capture the current lower-demand regime while maintaining a buffer. L will remain at the promised/confirmed 4 periods. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same recent period to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand from Period 6 to 14 is approximately 92.5 units/period, a decrease from the initial 5-period average of 117.2 units.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Period 6 to 15) has stabilized at a lower level compared to the initial periods. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P6-P15) is approximately 93.4 units/period, which aligns with the carry-over insight noted in Period 15. The promised and actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. In-transit inventory (217) consists of orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15 (65+21+30+101=217), which are expected to arrive in Periods 16 through 19. With 230 units on-hand and 217 in-transit, we have 447 units to cover the next 5 periods (L+1). At an average demand of ~93, this is approximately 4.8 periods of supply, which is close to the target stock level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this stable regime of lower demand while discarding the initial high-demand noise from Periods 1-5. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistently 4 units without drift.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows a stabilized lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 6, demand has shifted to a lower regime. The average demand from Period 6 to Period 16 is approximately 90.45 units/period (total demand 995 over 11 periods). The most recent 5 periods (P12-P16) shows an average demand of 78.8 units, though this is volatile (33 to 113). I will use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat to capture this lower regime since P6, providing a stable forecast for the (L+1) horizon. With On-hand (241) and In-transit (273, totaling 514), and an expected demand of roughly 450 over the 5-period horizon, the inventory position is healthy. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 6 confirmed: Avg demand P6-P16 is 90.45 units/period, down from 117.2 in P1-P5.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting around Period 13. Since Period 13, observed demand has been: 33, 101, 113, 54, 28, averaging approximately 65.8 units/period. This is significantly lower than the P6-P12 average of ~92 units. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. With On-hand inventory (234) and In-transit (293) totaling 527 units, we have enough stock to cover roughly 8 periods of demand at the recent average. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent lower demand trend (explicitly covering 1+L=5 periods). Sigma_hat will also be set based on these 5 periods to reflect increased recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand reduction confirmed since Period 13: Average demand (P13-P17) is ~66 units/period, compared to ~92 in the previous regime (P6-P12).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward shift starting around Period 13. The average demand from Period 13 to Period 18 is approximately 45.6 units/period (33, 101, 113, 54, 28, 25). However, looking specifically at the most recent 3 periods (P16-P18), demand has dropped even further to an average of ~35.6 units/period. The lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (239 units), and there are 263 units in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18). Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At the recent average of 45, the total safety target should be around 225 units. Since on-hand + in-transit (502 units) far exceeds this, no new orders are needed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat to capture this lower demand regime (starting P13) while maintaining a safe buffer, and N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand reduction sustained: Average demand from Period 13 to 18 is 45.6 units/period, a -50% decrease from the P6-P12 average (~92).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-20.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically, demand averaged over 100 units; however, since Period 13, it has dropped dramatically. The average demand from Period 13 to Period 19 is approximately 38.6 units/period (33, 101, 113, 54, 28, 25, 16). Specifically, the last three periods (P17-P19) show extremely low demand (28, 25, 16). Current on-hand inventory is 324 units, which is enough to cover roughly 8.4 periods of demand at the 38.6 rate, or over 15 periods at the most recent 3-period average. Pipeline inventory is 162 units (orders from P16-P19). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory and the collapsed demand, I need to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime to prevent the OR backend from ordering more and accumulating further holding costs. N=7 is chosen for mu_hat to capture the post-P13 decline, while sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the lowered volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand reduction sustained: Average demand since Period 13 is 38.6 units/period, a -58% decrease compared to the P6-P12 average (~92).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-45.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a significantly lower regime since Period 13. Over the last 8 periods (P13-P20), demand has averaged approximately 48.75 units/period, but the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20) show an even lower average of 28.6 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 425 units, which is approximately 14-15 times the current average demand. With a lead time of 4 periods and in-transit inventory of 41 units (the order from P17), the total pipeline and stock are far in excess of the needs for the next review+lead time window (5 periods). To stop accruing high holding costs, I am continuing to order 0 units by providing parameters that reflect the current low-demand reality. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the regime shift from P13 onwards and sigma_hat similarly to reflect the reduced volatility. L is kept as calculate as lead times have been consistent at 4.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand reduction sustained: Average demand from Period 16 to 20 slowed further to ~28.6 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $294.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically, demand was around 110-120 units (P1-P10), dropped to ~90 (P11-P15), and has since sharply declined to a much lower level starting around P13-P16. Specifically, the last 6 periods (P16-P21) have seen demand values of 54, 28, 25, 16, 20, and 38, averaging approximately 30 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 428 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate and the 4-period lead time. At 30 units/period, the current stock covers over 14 periods of demand, while the pipeline target (L+1) only requires coverage for 5 periods (~150 units). Consequently, no new orders are needed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain 'default' for L as the observed lead time is consistently 4 periods. The high on-hand inventory will prevent the OR backend from placing new orders until levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime confirmed: Average demand from Period 16 to 21 is ~30.2 units/period, a ~66% decrease from the P6-P12 average (~92).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant and sustained reduction. Starting around Period 13, demand dropped from an average of ~92 to a much lower regime. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 16-22), demand has averaged approximately 32 units per period (54, 28, 25, 16, 20, 38, 44). Currently, on-hand inventory is 384 units with 0 in-transit. With the current average demand of ~32, this inventory covers approximately 12 periods, which is far beyond the coverage required for the 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy (Base Stock - Pipeline), the current massive surplus (384) relative to the needed safety stock for this low-demand regime will naturally lead to zero orders being placed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) to reflect this new low-demand environment accurately, and keep L at default as it has consistently been 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime confirmed: Average demand from Period 16 to 22 is ~32.1 units/period, a significant decrease from previous regimes. Inventory levels are currently in heavy surplus.

Daily Reward (R_t): $316.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Initially averaging ~117 units/period (P1-P5), then ~90 units/period (P6-P12), it has now collapsed and stabilized at a much lower level. Since Period 16, the average demand is 32.7 units/period (32.7 = avg of 54, 28, 25, 16, 20, 38, 44, 35 over P16-P23). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 349 units with zero in-transit. A lead time (L) of 4 is confirmed. To calculate the target base stock, we use L=4 and the recent demand mean of ~33. Base stock = (1+L) * mu = 5 * 33 = 165 units. Since on-hand inventory (349) is significantly higher than the required base stock (165), the OR backend will correctly order 0 units. I am setting parameters to reflect this new low-demand regime: L=recent_4 to maintain lead time stability, and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the last 8 periods (since P16), which captures the start and stabilization of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime further confirmed: Average demand from Period 16 to 23 is 32.7 units/period, down from earlier averages of ~90 and ~117. Holding costs are high due to significant inventory surplus from previous orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $271.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a low-demand regime since Period 16, with the average demand over the last 9 periods (P16-P24) being approximately 32.3 units/period (54, 28, 25, 16, 20, 38, 44, 35, 31). Current on-hand inventory is 318 units, while in-transit inventory is 0. With a lead time of 4 periods (L=4), the inventory needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current average demand of ~33 units/period, the required base stock would be roughly 165 units (plus safety stock). Our current on-hand inventory of 318 units is nearly double the required level and is sufficient to cover demand for approximately 9-10 periods. Consequently, no new orders should be placed. I will use a recent_N approach (N=9, covering the regime since P16) to accurately reflect this lower demand and volatility in the OR backend, ensuring that the base stock level is calculated correctly, even though the capped policy will ultimately result in a zero order due to the massive surplus.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P24) stabilized at avg ~32.3 units/period, a ~65% decrease from the P6-P12 average (~92).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 16-25), the average demand is 32.3 units per period (323 total over 10 periods). The current on-hand inventory is 290 units, with 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, the current on-hand inventory covers approximately 9 periods of demand at the current average rate (290 / 32.3 \u2248 8.97). This is far in excess of the (L+1) coverage requirement (5 periods). To minimize the high holding costs ($1/unit/period) while slowly drawing down the surplus, I will continue to set parameters that result in zero ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this stabilized low-demand regime (Period 16 onwards).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime starting around Period 16. From Period 16 to Period 26, the average demand is approximately 31.6 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 256 units with no units in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, the coverage required for the next 5 periods (L+1) at the current average demand (31.6 * 5 = 158 units) is significantly lower than the existing stock. I will set mu_hat to reflect this low-demand regime (using recent_N where N=11, covering P16-P26) to stop the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders while the surplus is cleared. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P26) confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~31.6 units/period, a significant reduction from the earlier P6-P12 average (~92).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent period segment (P16-P27), the average demand is approximately 32.5 units per period. Prior regimes saw significantly higher averages (~117 in P1-P5 and ~92 in P6-P12). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. Currently, there is a massive inventory surplus of 215 units on-hand with zero units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, the pipeline inventory targets a coverage of (L+1) = 5 periods. At the current demand rate, 5 periods of demand would require approximately 163 units (32.5 * 5). Since the current on-hand inventory (215) already exceeds this requirement and there are no units in-transit, no new orders should be placed until levels drop further to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=12) to reflect the stabilized low-demand regime since Period 16.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand from Period 16 to Period 28, the average demand is approximately 32.7 units per period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 178 units with no orders in transit. Given the current average demand (~33 units) and a lead time of 4 periods, total exposure (L+1 = 5 periods) requires approximately 165 units (5 * 33). Since the current on-hand inventory of 178 units already exceeds this requirement, no new orders are necessary. The goal is to slowly bleed off the existing surplus to minimize holding costs. I will set the parameters to reflect this recent low-demand regime (N=13, from P16 to P28) to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation stays below the current inventory level, preventing further orders until more stock is depleted.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 33.4 units per period (P16-P29). The current on-hand inventory (145 units) and in-transit inventory (26 units from Period 29) total 171 units. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, a base stock needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). At the current average demand, the base stock requires approximately 167 units (5 * 33.4). Since the pipeline inventory (171) already satisfies this requirement, additional ordering is not strictly necessary, but setting parameters to reflect this current regime is essential for the OR backend effectively. I will use recent_N with N=14 (P16-P29) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained low-demand volume and volatility, and explicit L=4 as the lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P29) continues to hold: average demand is 33.4 units/period, roughly 64% lower than the early-game average.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 30, the average demand is approximately 32.7 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently at 118 units, with 57 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 29 and 30). Given the lead time of 4 periods, we must provide for demand through Period 35 (L+1 = 5 periods). Total units to cover these 5 periods at an average of 33 units/period is approximately 165 units. Our current total inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) is 175 units (118 + 57). This suggests we are slightly over-supplied for the immediate horizon, but since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy with a cap, setting parameters to match this recent regime will prevent excessive over-ordering while maintaining a safety buffer. I will use N=15 for recent_N to capture this stable low-demand regime (P16-P30). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime starting around Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 through Period 31 is approximately 32.3 units per period (sum of demands P16-P31: 54+28+25+16+20+38+44+35+31+28+34+41+37+33+27+33 = 524; 524 / 16 = 32.75). The most recent 5 periods (P27-P31) show an average of 34.2 units/period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since On-hand inventory (85) plus In-transit (26+31+24 = 81) totals 166 units, which covers over 5 periods of demand at the current average (32.75 * 5 = 163.75), inventory is now reaching a balanced state after earlier surpluses. I will use recent_N (N=16) to capture the stable low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for lead time (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P31) stabilized at ~32.8 units/period, roughly 65% lower than early-game peaks.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 32.8 units per period (N=17). Currently, the system has 57 units on-hand and 113 units in-transit (orders from Periods 29-32). Given the lead time (L=4), the pipeline inventory of 113 units plus the 57 on-hand units totals 170 units. This is significantly higher than the expected demand over the lead time plus one review period ((1+4) * 32.8 = 164 units). The OR engine will likely order minimal or zero units based on the base stock calculation, which is appropriate to avoid further holding costs while slowly depleting the surplus. We set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 17 periods (Period 16 to 32) to capture this sustained low-demand regime accurately.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime since Period 16, with the most recent average (P16-P33) being approximately 30.5 units per period. The spike in inventory has finally been drawn down to 73 units on-hand, with 113 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the Period 29 order arriving in Period 33. Given the current on-hand inventory (73) and the in-transit pipeline (113), the total inventory position is 186. At the current demand rate of ~31 units/period, the expected demand over the (L+1) horizon (5 periods) is approximately 155 units. The current inventory position is slightly above the required base stock level to cover the lead time horizon, but not excessively so. I will continue to use a recent_N approach (N=18, covering the low-demand regime since P16) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the demand remains consistently low (the P33 demand of 10 units is unusually low, but I will let the statistical average handle it).

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P33) remains steady at an average of ~30.5 units/period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable low-demand regime since approximately Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data from Period 16 to Period 34, the average demand is approximately 30.5 units per period. The inventory surplus that plagued the middle of the game has finally been depleted, with on-hand units now at 72. With a confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods, we need to maintain a pipeline that covers demand for L+1 (5) periods. Total inventory (72 on-hand + 90 in-transit) is 162. Over 5 periods at an average of 30.5, expected demand is ~153. Given the service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), the current inventory position is nearly optimal but requires small adjustments to maintain the buffer. I am using 'recent_N' with N=19 (covering the regime from P16-P34) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this sustained low-demand environment while keeping L at the default promised value of 4, which aligns with recent 'conclude' observations.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P34) remains remarkably stable with an average of ~30.5 units/period, down ~65% from early-game peaks. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime starting around Period 16, with the average demand from Period 16 to 35 being approximately 32 units per period (the most recent 5-period average is 29.8). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual arrivals (verified by P29-P31 orders arriving on time). Currently, on-hand inventory is 52 units and in-transit is 97 units (orders from P32-P35: 32+26+8+31=97), totaling 149 units of pipeline inventory. Given the stable demand of ~32 units/period, the target base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) should be approximately 160-170 units to maintain a high service level while minimizing holding costs. Since pipeline inventory (149) is nearing the target, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand regime since P16.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The low-demand regime has been remarkably stable since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 30.5 units/period. Over the last 10 periods (P27-P36), demand has averaged 29.5 units, though there is some fluctuation (range 10 to 44). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. My strategy is to maintain the base stock level using the recent N=10 samples (P27-P36) to capture this stable but low demand. On-hand inventory (74) plus in-transit (113) equals 187 units, which is quite high relative to a 5-period requirement (L+1 = 5) of roughly 150-160 units. The OR backend's capped policy will naturally reduce or stop orders to burn off this excess while my parameters reflect the current regime's mean and volatility.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 30.5 units per period. Using the last 20 periods (N=20) for mu_hat captures this sustained shift while ignoring the early-game high-demand peaks. The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods, verified by sequential arrivals (P29-P33). On-hand inventory (79) and in-transit units (90) totaling 169 units are currently sufficient to cover the expected demand for the (L+1)=5 period horizon (approx. 153 units). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($19.0), maintaining excess inventory is penalized, so I continue to use recent_N to reflect the current lower demand environment. The small order in Period 37 (3 units) suggests the OR backend is already moderating orders based on the pipeline. I will stick with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain stability in this regime.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime since Period 16, with the average demand from Period 16 to 38 being approximately 30.1 units per period. Recent volatility is observed (e.g., Period 33 demand was 10, Period 35 was 44), but the overall mean remains consistent. The lead time is verified at 4 periods. Current inventory stands at 66 units on-hand with 97 units in-transit (Total pipeline = 163). Given the current demand average of ~30 and a lead time of 4, the required base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) is approximately 150-160 units. Since current on-hand + in-transit (163) already covers this, and the goal is to manage holding costs while avoiding stockouts, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach. I'll set N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stability of the current regime while filtering out short-term fluctuations. This will likely result in a small or zero order this period to lean out the inventory slightly.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime since approximately Period 16, averaging around 30-31 units per period. Evaluating the most recent 10 periods (P30-P39), the average demand is 24.0 units, slightly lower than the overall low-regime average, suggesting a possible further softening or just recent volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 83, In-transit: 87) total 170 units. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Our pipeline of 170 units already covers approximately 7 periods of recent demand (170 / 24 \u2248 7.08). The system is currently in a surplus state, which will incur holding costs. To minimize these costs while maintaining service levels, I will use recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand behavior and maintain L at the default (4). The backend OR engine will naturally reduce orders due to the high pipeline inventory relative to the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand (P30-P39) has averaged 24.0 units/period, slightly lower than the stabilized low-demand regime of ~31 units observed since P16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $29.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a very low-volume regime. Over the last 10 periods (P31-P40), demand has averaged approximately 24.1 units per period, which is a further reduction from the previous 'low' regime of ~31 units. The most recent demand (P40) was only 8 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 123 units with 39 units in-transit (orders from P37, P38, and P39), totaling 162 units of pipeline inventory. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At the recent average of 24 units/period, target inventory would be roughly 120 units. Since pipeline inventory (162) significantly exceeds this target, the OR backend needs to be steered toward a lower base stock to avoid further accumulation of holding costs. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture this most recent downward drift in demand (P30-P40), which averages ~24.4 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further reduced: Average demand from Period 30 to 40 is 24.4 units/period, down from the ~31 unit average observed between P16 and P29.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 30, averaging approximately 24.4 units per period (P30-P41). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 75 units, and there are 36 units in-transit (orders from P38 and P39). For Period 42, the total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 111 units. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At the current average of ~24.4, the required base stock is approximately 122 units plus a safety buffer. Since current pipeline (111) is close to the expected demand of 122, the OR backend will decide if a small top-up is needed based on the z-score calculations. I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat to capture the current reduced demand regime specifically since Period 30, and recent_N of 12 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility more accurately than a long-term average.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistently low regime. Analysis of the most recent data (P30-P42) shows an average demand of approximately 25 units per period, which is lower than the previous mid-game regime (~31 units) and significantly lower than early-game peaks. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 38 order in Period 42. Currently, there is a moderate inventory on-hand (58) and in-transit (69). Given the low demand, I am using a recent window of N=13 (covering the start of this lower demand period) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the inventory levels are optimized for the current demand rate without overstocking, as the holding cost of $1.0 is significant relative to demand.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (since Period 30) has stabilized at around 24-25 units per period, with Period 43 showing a slight uptick to 35. The carry-over insights correctly identified a lower demand regime (P30-P40 avg: 24.4). My lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P40-P43). Currently, I have 44 units on-hand and 96 units in-transit (orders from P40, P41, P42, P43). Given the lead time of 4 periods, I need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With an expected demand of ~25 units/period, my target base stock is approximately 125 units. Since my current pipeline (44 on-hand + 96 in-transit = 140) already exceeds this, the OR backend will likely order 0 or very little to avoid excessive holding costs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (covering the recent lower regime since P30) to capture the current mean and variance accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 30 remains lower, averaging 25.8 units/period (P30-P43), which is a further reduction from the previous ~31 unit regime.

Recent demand in Period 44 spiked to 53, resulting in a stockout (on-hand = 0). While on-hand is zero, the pipeline inventory is 135 units (ordered P40-P44: 0, 0, 48, 48, 39). These are expected to arrive in Periods 44-48 given the stable 4-period lead time. Specifically, an order of 0 arrived in P44 (from P40), and the P41 order of 0 is expected in P45. The inventory crunch is temporary until the P42 order (48 units) arrives in P46. To recover from the stockout and maintain a safe base stock for the final 6 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 15 periods (N=15) to capture this stable ~28 units/period regime. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 30 has been stable but slightly lower than the previous period's average, currently sitting at 26.5 units/period (P30-P45). However, a stockout occurred in Period 44 and 45 because the order placed in Period 40 (lead time 4) resulted in 0 units arriving, likely due to a lost shipment or a zero-order quantity which I had set previously. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Pipeline inventory is 187 units (from orders in P42, P43, P44, P45). With the game ending in 5 periods (P46-P50), I need to ensure there is enough stock to cover the remaining demand while accounting for a consistent lead time of 4. Since the backend policy calculates order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap), and pipeline (187) is likely already near the required base stock for a 26.5 mean demand (approx 133-150 units for L+1=5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the stable demand since Period 30 and ensure the service level is maintained.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 30 confirmed stable at approximately 26.5 units/period (P30-P45). Stockout in P44-P45 due to lack of arrivals from P40-P41 decisions.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 30 has stabilized at an average of approximately 27 units per period. The recent stockouts in Periods 44 and 45 were caused by zero arrivals of orders from Periods 40 and 41 (which were null orders). Inventory has recovered in Period 46 with the arrival of 48 units from Period 42. Currently, there are 25 units on hand and 141 units in transit (from orders in P43-P46). Given we are at Period 47 of 50, and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 51, which is outside the game's horizon. However, the backend logic requires maintaining a base stock. I will set mu_hat based on the recent regime (last 16 periods since P30, avg ~27) to ensure logical continuity, although the primary goal now is to consume existing in-transit inventory. The in-transit amount (141) already significantly exceeds expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (~108 units total), so the OR backend will naturally minimize new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $547.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 30-47) is stable at an average of 26.8 units per period. The inventory stockout in Period 44-45 was due to a lack of orders in Periods 40-41, not a lead time shift or demand spike. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of Period 42 and 43 orders in Periods 46 and 47 respectively. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (Decision 48, 49, 50), orders placed now (L=4) will arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game's horizon. However, the OR backend logic requires parameters to manage current stock and pipeline. On-hand is 42 and in-transit is 115 (from orders P44-P47). The total pipeline plus on-hand (157 units) easily covers the expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (~81 units total). I will set L to 4 as observed, and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the most recent regime (N=18, from P30 onwards) to maintain the policy's structure, though the cap will likely prevent significant new orders since the horizon is closing.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 30 confirmed stable at approximately 26.8 units/period (P30-P47). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1039.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 30 has stabilized at an average of approximately 27 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 25 units, with 105 units in-transit. Shipments from Period 45 (52 units), Period 46 (2 units), Period 47 (22 units), and Period 48 (29 units) are expected in the coming periods (Periods 49, 50, 51, and 52). Since the game ends at Period 50, my primary goal is to satisfy the remaining two periods of demand (49 and 50) while minimizing ending inventory. The lead time is consistent at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is usually preferred, but with only two periods left, the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend will naturally limit excessive ordering. I will use a recent_N of 19 (Period 30 to 48) to capture the current stable demand mean of ~26.8 units/period and the stable lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $523.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (since Period 30) has stabilized at an average of approximately 27 units per period, showing a consistent lower regime compared to earlier phases of the game. For Period 50, the on-hand inventory is 47 units, and there are 106 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect the following arrivals: Period 50 (order from P46, 2 units), Period 51 (order from P47, 22 units), Period 52 (order from P48, 29 units), and Period 53 (order from P49, 53 units). The total pipeline plus on-hand (47 + 106 = 153) is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining periods (L+1 = 5 periods * 27 units = 135 units). However, since this is the final period (Period 50), any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends (arrival in Period 54). Therefore, I will set mu_hat to a low value or let the OR engine calculate based on recent trends, noting that the order quantity will likely be capped or zeroed as the pipeline already exceeds the base stock needs for the final horizon.
