Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical data or conclude messages yet to infer lead time or demand variance. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately to cover the demand during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). The initial demand sample for Period 1 is 216. Without further history, I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will calculate based on all available samples (currently just Period 1). I will also use the 'default' method for L to use the promised 4 periods. The OR backend will use these to calculate an order that targets a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 212 units based on initial demand expectations. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 will arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5 (1+4) and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 212 units in transit. The demand in Period 1 was 134 units, but because arrivals happen after the decision phase and on-hand was 0, those were lost sales. Historical demand samples (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) show an average of roughly 145 units per period. Since we are in the very early stages (Period 2), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the available historical sample mean while waiting for the pipeline to start arriving. The lead time L is set to default (4) as we have no 'conclude' messages to suggest a deviation yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (212 units) and Period 2 (144 units) are currently in-transit (Total 356). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4) and becomes visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Consequently, current on-hand inventory is 0 and sales have been 0 for the first two periods due to stockout at start. Historical demand samples (P1-P5) are: 216, 129, 138, 129, 115. The mean of these 5 samples is 145.4. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the demand across review + lead (L+1 = 5 periods) is approximately 727 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the available demand history while we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4 decision phase. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (212 units) is expected to arrive during Period 1+4=5, meaning it will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 549 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has been relatively stable with samples: P1=216 (from user input history, though conclude shows 134 - I will prioritize the 'Historical Demand Data' list provided: 216, 129, 138, 129, 115). Average demand is approx 145 units. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Total demand for 5 periods is ~725 units. Since we have 549 in transit, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order. I will use 'default' for L (promised 4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the post-P1 stabilization.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are at the beginning of the simulation. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 are currently in-transit (212 + 144 + 193 + 202 = 751 total). Per the sequence of events, the Period 1 order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5 (L=4). However, as we are currently in the Decision Phase of Period 5, we have not yet seen this arrival. The 'In-transit' count of 751 correctly reflects all orders placed so far. Since we have no 'conclude' messages confirming actual lead times yet, I will stick to the promised lead time of 4. For demand, the historical samples (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) show a mean of 145.4. Recent demand in the game history (134, 195, 130, 163) averages 155.5. Given the fluctuation, I will use all 5 available historical samples (N=5) to stabilize the forecast (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean), as there is no clear sustained shift yet. This helps the OR backend maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we finally observe our first arrival (ordered P1, arrived P5) confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4). Demand across the first 5 periods (samples provided in prompt: 216, 129, 138, 129, 115; history logs: 134, 195, 130, 163, 150) shows high variability but no clear regime shift yet. The mean of the historical demand samples (134, 195, 130, 163, 150) is 154.4. With L=4, the coverage period (1+L) is 5. We have 62 on-hand and 642 in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). Given the variability, I will use all 5 available history samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat to establish a baseline while we wait for more lead-time data to confirm stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2654.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 and 2 arrived Exactly 4 periods later (concluding in Period 5 and 6 respectively), confirming the lead time is currently stable at L=4. Demand for the last 5 relevant periods (Period 2 to 6) has been: 195, 130, 163, 150, 143. The mean of these 5 samples is 156.2. Since there is no specific calendar or product seasonality indicated by 'Period_X' dates, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand level. The OR backend uses (1+L) as the horizon. With L=4, the coverage needed is 5 periods of demand. On-hand is 63, and in-transit is 663 (covering orders from Periods 3, 4, 5, 6). Total pipeline is 726. Given average demand is ~156, a 5-period requirement is ~780 units. The pipeline is slightly below this, so the OR backend will calculate a standard replenishment based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 and P2 orders arrived at P5 and P6 respectively). Average demand stable at ~156 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2944.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 7 periods shows relative stability with a mean of 153.5 units (134, 195, 130, 163, 150, 143, 160). Period 7 conclude confirms a consistent lead time of 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6, P3 order arrived P7). The promised lead time of 4 periods is accurate. On-hand inventory is 96, and 617 units are in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). Given the steady demand pattern and confirmed lead time, I will use a window of recent demand (N=7) to calculate the base stock requirements. The OR backend will calculate the order based on (1+L) demand, where L=4. This ensures coverage for 5 periods of demand while accounting for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95), which favors maintaining a healthy safety stock to avoid stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2202.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of the concluding messages from Period 5 through Period 8 confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (matches promised). Total pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 551 units, representing orders from P5 (103), P6 (165), P7 (147), and P8 (136). The P5 order is expected to arrive during Period 9 and be visible at the start of Period 10. Historical demand across all 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 150 units $(\mu \approx 150)$ with a standard deviation of approximately 22 units $(\sigma \approx 22.3)$. Since demand appears stable without significant regimes or seasonality trends yet, I will use 'recent_N' with $N=5$ to capture the latest demand behavior while maintaining stability. The OR parameters are set to cover ($L+1=5$) periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2524.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The historical lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on visual confirmation of orders from P1-P5 arriving in P5-P9. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability. Since the start of arrivals in Period 5, demand has been [150, 143, 160, 125, 140], with an average of 143.6 units. Including the data before arrivals started (P1-P4: 134, 195, 130, 163), the overall mean is 148.8 and the standard deviation is 21.0. The promised lead time L=4 is reliable. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture all available demand history for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 521) plus current On-hand (136) equals 657, which covers roughly 4.4 periods of demand, aligning well with the (L+1) coverage target.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3099.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 151 units per period across the first 10 periods. The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 4 periods for all 6 arrived shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory is 131 units and there are 523 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Since the (L+1) window requires covering 5 periods of demand (approx 755 units) and our pipeline (523 in-transit + 131 on-hand = 654) is slightly below that, more orders are needed. I will use the recent_N method with N=10 to capture the full stable history since the start of the simulation, ensuring parameters reflect the observed consistency in lead time and demand.

Analyzing the demand from Period 1 to Period 11, the mean is approximately 150.6 units per period. The last 5 periods (P7-P11) show demands of 160, 125, 140, 170, and 142, averaging 147.4. Given the stability, I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the full range of observed demand while acknowledging the lead time is steady at 4. The OR backend will calculate the base stock for (L+1)=5 periods. Current inventory position (On-hand 136 + In-transit 556 = 692) is healthy relative to expected demand over the lead time, but we must maintain the base stock level to account for the consistent arrival cycle.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 190. Demand over the first 12 periods has averaged approximately 144 units (total demand 1734 / 12), while the most recent 4 periods show a slight decrease (avg 133.5). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from Periods 1 through 8. Total in-transit inventory is 555, which represents approximately 3.8 periods of demand at the current average. To ensure sufficient coverage for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting (mu_hat) with N=12 to capture the full range of observed variation while acknowledging the stable pattern. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=12 to properly account for the observed volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 116 units, and there are 562 units in transit. Historical demand suggests an average of approximately 146 units per period (last 13 periods average is 144.6, last 5 periods average is 136). The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated through Period 13's arrival). The profit-to-cost ratio is high ($19 vs $1), targeting a high service level (approx 95%). To maintain a base stock covering the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5), I will use the recent 10 periods to capture the stable demand mean while acknowledging the slight dip in recent volatility. Using 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) with N=10 focuses on the most relevant demand regime. I will keep L as 'default' since the 4-period lead time is performing as promised.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by all arrivals from Period 5 through Period 14 (actual lead time matches promised). Demand has remained relatively stable, with an average of approximately 146 units over the last 14 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 124, and in-transit inventory is 520 units (representing orders from Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14). Total pipeline inventory is 644 units, covering roughly 4.4 periods of average demand. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to leverage the consistent history, 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the most relevant demand average (~143 units), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the inventory reaches the base-stock target while respecting the OR backend's safety stock and capping logic.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by historical arrivals from Period 1 through Period 11, with all observed lead times exactly matching the promised value. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable regime across all 15 completed periods. The average demand across all periods is approximately 147 units. While Period 12 saw a dip to 82, subsequent periods (13-15) returned to the established range (147, 159, 167), suggesting no sustained shift. We are currently in Period 16 with 137 units on hand and 495 units in transit (corresponding to orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15). I will continue using the promised lead time (L=4) and set mu_hat based on the mean of all samples to provide a stable forecast for the backend, as the demand variance remains consistent with the historical average and no significant seasonality or regime changes are detected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1308.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a fluctuating but generally stable pattern. Taking the mean of the last 10 periods (Periods 7-16), the average demand is approximately 133 units, which is lower than the long-term average of 145 including early cycles. However, the last few periods (P12 and P16) showed significant lows (~80 units), while P15 was high (167). Given that profit is much higher than holding cost ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. I set L=4, and use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the slightly lower current average and recent volatility, while still ensuring enough pipeline inventory to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $707.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 'chips(Regular)' suggests a emerging downward trend or shift in regime. For the first 15 periods, demand fluctuated around an average of ~150 units. However, in the last three periods (P15-P17), demand has dropped significantly to 167, 79, and 49 respectively (average of ~98). While Period 15 was still high, the drop in Period 16 and 17 is substantial. To avoid over-stocking and high holding costs in the face of this potential drop, I will use a recent_N (N=5) for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this downward movement while still considering some of the preceding stable period. The lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods across all recorded arrivals (P1-P13 orders), so I will use 'calculate' to lock in this observed performance. Sigma_hat will also be set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility introduced by the latest low-demand observations.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift starting Period 16: demand dropped from a phase average of ~150 to ~64 units over the last two periods (P16-P17).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1051.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe a sustained demand drop for 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand from Period 5 to 15 averaged ~145 units, but since Period 16, demand has dropped significantly (79, 49, 70), averaging ~66 units over the last three periods. This represents a -54% regime shift. The 'Carry-over Insights' also noted this potential shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent 4-period arrival cycles (e.g., Period 14 order arriving in Period 18). My current on-hand inventory (279) and in-transit (447) are very high relative to this new lower demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this local demand drop and avoid over-ordering, while keeping 'default' lead time (which is the promised 4 periods) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 16: average demand decreased from ~145 to ~66 units (-54% change) over the last 3 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 20. Historical data confirms a significant demand regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand has dropped from approximately 145 units to roughly 63 units over the last 4 periods (P16: 79, P17: 49, P18: 70, P19: 53). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is high (381 units) relative to current demand, and there is a large pipeline (292 units). To prevent excessive holding costs while adjusting to the lower demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to focus exclusively on this new lower-demand regime. The OR backend's capped policy will likely suppress new orders until the existing inventory is depleted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1205.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant downward shift starting around Period 16. The average demand has fallen from approximately 145 units per period to about 68 units over the last five periods (P16-P20). With an on-hand inventory of 486 units and 98 units still in-transit (from orders in P17 and P18), the current pipeline is extremely high relative to the new demand regime. The promised lead time L=4 has remained stable throughout the history. To prevent excessive holding costs, I am reducing mu_hat and sigma_hat by using a window of N=5 periods (capturing the regime shift) to calculate mean and variance. This will lower the base stock level and stop new orders until the existing inventory is depleted to a rational level.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand dropped from ~145 units to ~69 units over the last 6 periods (P16-P21 demand: 79, 49, 70, 53, 89, 76). With on-hand inventory at 470 units and 38 units in-transit (ordered P18, expected arrival Period 22), the total inventory of 508 units is excessively high for the current demand levels (representing roughly 7-8 periods of supply). Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the lower demand regime, which will lead the OR backend to stop ordering until the current inventory surplus is consumed, thereby minimizing holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the new, lower average demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $772.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift first detected at Period 16 is now firmly established. Over the last 7 periods (P16-P22), demand has averaged approximately 70 units (79, 49, 70, 53, 89, 76, 64), which is less than half of the previous average. The current on-hand inventory is 444 units with zero in-transit. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At the current demand rate, 444 units provides over 6 periods of coverage (444 / 70 \u2248 6.3), meaning we are already above the target base stock. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P15-P18 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). I will set L to 'default' (4) and use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand regime. This will result in a base stock lower than our current on-hand plus in-transit, prompting the backend to place zero orders and allow inventory levels to slowly normalize.

Daily Reward (R_t): $916.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 23 (8 samples), the average has stabilized around 68.5 units/period (compared to the pre-P16 average of ~145). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 376 units with 0 in-transit. A safety stock level for (L+1) = 5 periods at the new demand rate would be approximately 5 * 68.5 = 342.5 plus safety margin. Given current on-hand inventory (376) is already higher than this requirement, the OR backend will correctly logic into zero or minimal ordering. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this new regime for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to ensure the model reacts to the sustained lower demand and lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Mean demand from P16-P23 is ~68.5 units (standard deviation ~12.5), down from previous ~145 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is well-established, with mean demand dropping from approximately 145 units to 71.3 units (calculated over P16-P24). The most recent demand in Period 24 was 102 units, slightly higher than the regime average, but still within the lower range compared to the pre-P16 era. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory (274) and in-transit (16) total 290 units, which is approximately four times the current mean demand. To adjust the backend parameters to reflect this new regime and prevent excessive inventory holding, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering P16-P24) and maintain the lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, dropping from an average of ~145 units to ~68 units. However, recent demand in Periods 24 and 25 (102 and 123 units) suggests a potential upward trend or volatility returning. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 (covering P16-P25) to capture the lower regime while acknowledging the recent rise. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by historical arrivals. With 151 units on hand and 116 in transit, the current inventory levels are starting to deplete relative to the (L+1) demand window (5 periods * ~80 units = 400). The OR backend is instructed to use recent data to set parameters that balance the high profit ($19) against holding costs ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 (avg ~68) suggests potential volatility or slow recovery in Periods 24-25 (avg ~112).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1289.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown high volatility over the last 11 periods (P16-P26), initially dropping significantly and recently fluctuating between 64 and 123 units. The mean demand for this 'low/volatile' regime (P16-P26) is approximately 80.5 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains the stable observation from confirmed arrivals (P5-P22 consistently showed lead_time=4). There have been no arrivals for the last 4 periods (P23-P26) because zero orders were placed in Periods 19-22 due to an inventory surplus; the arrivals are scheduled to resume in Period 28 (order from P24). With on-hand inventory at 79 and in-transit at 231 (total pipeline=310), and expected lead-time demand plus safety stock needing to cover 5 periods (L+1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture this volatile lower-demand regime. This provides a mu_hat basis of (1+4) * ~81 units (~405), which will prompt the OR engine to maintain a moderate order flow as the surplus is now largely depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in the regime starting P16: demand effectively fluctuates between 50-125 units (mean ~81) without yet returning to the P1-P15 average of ~145.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1101.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high-volatility regime that started at Period 16. The initial drop from ~145 units/period to ~68 units (P16-P23) has evolved into wider swings between ~59 and ~123 in the last four periods (P24-P27). The average demand since P16 is approximately 78.5 units. Because of this structural shift and high variance, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=12 (capturing the regime from P16-P27) to focus on this new lower but volatile level. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival history up to Period 22 (after which the inventory surplus led to zero orders being placed for a few periods, resulting in the current arrival gap). Pipeline inventory (343 units) plus on-hand (20 units) is currently high relative to recent demand, so the OR backend will likely suppress or minimize active ordering until the stock levels normalize.

Daily Reward (R_t): $684.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high stockout risk with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, as seen by the arrival of the Period 24 order in Period 28. However, there is a gap in arrivals between Period 23 and Period 27 because no orders were placed during Periods 19-23 due to high inventory at that time. Demand since Period 16 has been in a lower, more volatile regime. Recent demand (P24-P28) has averaged ~92 units, which is higher than the P16-P23 average (~68) but lower than the pre-P16 average (~145). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P25-P28) show demand of 123, 72, 59, and 104 (mean 89.5). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=13 (covering the start of the lower regime at P16) to capture this lower average demand while acknowledging recent volatility. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=13 to account for the increased variance in this regime. L remains at the promised default of 4.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P16-P28) maintains a mean of ~81 units with significant volatility (range 49-123). Stockout situation in P28 due to order gap in P19-P23.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downwards around Period 16. Since then, the mean demand (P16-P29) is approximately 81 units, though it has been volatile recently (P24-P29 mean is ~92). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. We experienced a stockout in Period 28 due to a zero-order gap between Periods 19 and 23, but inventory is now recovering with arrivals from orders placed in Period 24 and 25. To stabilize inventory against this new demand level and recent volatility, I will use a recent window (N=14, covering the entire lower-demand regime from P16-P29) to calculate the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). This balances the earlier low-demand points with the more recent higher-demand spikes (100+ units), helping the OR backend determine a safe base stock level for a 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1058.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 16) is characterized by a lower mean than the first 15 periods, but with significant volatility. Analyzing the last 15 periods (P16-P30), the average demand is approximately 78.5 units. Over the very recent short term (P24-P30), demand has slightly increased to an average of ~87 units compared to the drop observed in P16-P23 (~69 units), indicating a partial recovery or sustained higher volatility. I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture this post-shift behavior for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), as this encompasses the entire current regime and provides a more stable estimate than very short-term windows while ignoring the irrelevant high-demand data from P1-P15. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P28, P29, P30 arrivals). Pipeline inventory (350) + on-hand (63) is 413, which is roughly 4.7 periods of current demand, keeping us well-covered as previous zero-order gaps are reconciled by the arrivals from P24-P27.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P30 shows a mean of ~78.5 units with a standard deviation of ~22 units, representing a sustained lower-demand environment compared to P1-P15 (~145 units) but with high period-to-period variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2705.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift at Period 16, dropping from approximately 145 units to a lower, more volatile regime. Recent data (P16-P31) shows a mean demand of approximately 82 units with substantial variance (ranging from ~50 to 144). The most recent demand of 144 in P31 is the highest in this new regime, indicating that volatility remains high or that demand may be trending slightly upward. Promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 31, and there is a healthy pipeline of 290 units (from orders in P28-P31). To account for the sustained lower-demand regime while respecting the inherent volatility, I will use recent_N (N=16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this second regime (P16 onwards). This ensures the base stock reflects the current environment rather than the higher initial 15 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P31 confirmed: mean ~82 units, range 49-144, replacing previous mean of ~145. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2037.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from ~145 units to a more volatile lower mean. Measuring from P16 to the most recent period (P32), the average demand is approximately 83 units with a standard deviation of ~27 units. In the last 5 periods (P28-P32), demand has averaged ~102 units, suggesting a potential slight recovery or continued high volatility within the new regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 15 units on-hand and an expected arrival from P29 (49 units) in the next period's arrival phase, current inventory is low. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 17 periods (N=17, from P16-P32) to capture the full behavior of this second demand regime while smoothing out the recent high-volatility spikes. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P16-P33) shows a mean of ~83 units, significantly lower than the P1-P15 average of ~145. However, demand remains highly volatile, with recent values like 108 (P32) and 144 (P31) contrasting with 78 (P33) and 59 (P30). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from P24-P29 arriving consistently after 4 periods. We are currently facing a stockout (end of P33 inventory is 0) because the arrival in P33 (49 units) was insufficient to meet demand (78 units). To recover from the stockout and handle the current volatility, I will use a N=18 window for demand (the length of the current lower-demand regime) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the lower average observed since P16 with the need to protect against the high standard deviation (~22 units) and recent spikes. The OR backend will use these values to target a base stock covering (L+1) periods of demand.

While there was a stockout in Period 33 due to a past ordering gap, the current pipeline (In-transit: 411) is substantial relative to the current demand level. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 19 periods (N=19, covering the regime from P16 to P34) captures this new normal of ~82 units/period. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand, balancing the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime changed at Period 16, decreasing from an average of ~145 units to a more volatile distribution with a mean of ~86 units (Periods 16-35). Recent demand (P31-P35) averages 100 units. On-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 35 where only 83 of 100 units were sold. Pipeline inventory (419 units) corresponds to orders from P32 (125), P33 (127), P34 (107), and P35 (60). The P32 order (125 units) is expected to arrive in Period 36, which should cover current demand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20, covering the entire low-demand regime since P16) to stabilize the base stock target while acknowledging the increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P35 shows a mean of ~86 units with sustained volatility (range 49-144). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $575.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' following a demand regime shift that occurred at Period 16. The historical mean demand from Period 1 to 15 was ~145 units, but from Period 16 to 36, the mean transitioned to approximately 83 units with high volatility (range 35-144). Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders (P1-P32). In the most recent period (P36), we observed a significant demand drop to 35 units, leaving 90 units on-hand. We currently have 381 units in-transit, which covers roughly 4.5 periods of average demand (381 / 83 \u2248 4.6), ensuring a robust pipeline. I will continue using a recent window (N=21, covering the start of the lower demand regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower mean and high volatility, while keeping L at the promised 4 periods to match consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 is sustained through Period 36 with a lower mean (~83 units) and significant volatility (Std Dev ~25 units, Min 35, Max 144). Lead time reliability at 4 periods remains 100% for all concluded shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1643.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we observe that the demand regime starting at Period 16 is sustained. For the last 22 periods (P16-P37), the average demand is approximately 83.5 units, which is significantly lower than the initial P1-P15 average of 145. However, this regime is characterized by high volatility, with a standard deviation of approximately 25 units and a range of 35 to 144. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is 124 units, and we have 283 units in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend will target a high service level (quantile \u2248 0.95). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=22 to capture the entirety of the current volatile lower-demand regime. This provides a stable estimate of the mean and accounts for the observed variance, ensuring the 'base stock' calculation covers the Lead Time + 1 (5 periods) requirement while preventing excessive overstocking from the old higher-demand data.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 16 remains sustained with a significantly lower average (~83 units) compared to the initial phase (P1-P15, ~145 units), though it exhibits high volatility (range 35-144). Recent demand (P36-P38) has been 35, 93, and 67. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in all concluded shipments. Current inventory status (on-hand 164 + in-transit 270) is 434 units. Given the lead time (L=4) plus the decision period (1), we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using the regime mean of ~83, the expected demand is ~415 units. Current total inventory is slightly above this mean but must account for high variance (std dev ~25). Setting N=23 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the entire current regime since Period 16, which is the most accurate representation of the current fluctuating demand environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1696.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the lower-demand phase that began in Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (P16 to P39), the mean demand is approximately 84 units with a standard deviation of approximately 25 units. The last three periods (P37-P39) show demands of 93, 67, and 96, consistent with this mean. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 128, and in-transit is 272 units (Total pipeline: 400). Following the 'recent_N' logic for the regime starting at P16 (N=24), I will use N=24 to capture the mean and volatility for the current state. This ensures the base stock calculation covers (L+1) periods (5 periods) of demand at the current average while accounting for the high period-to-period variability (sigma_hat).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1765.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from an average of ~145 units to a significantly lower and more volatile state. From Period 16 to Period 40 (25 samples), the mean demand is approximately 82.5 units with a standard deviation of 26.3. The most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) show a slightly higher mean of 78-99 units, confirming stability within this lower-demand regime. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. I am setting L to default (4) and using 'recent_N' with N=25 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the properties of this current regime (P16-P40) without being over-reactive to very short-term noise, while excluding the pre-P16 high-demand era which is no longer relevant.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P40 is sustained: mean ~82.5, Std Dev ~26.3. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1435.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-volume, highly volatile regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing the last 26 periods (P16-P41), the mean demand is approximately 82.5 units with a standard deviation of 26.3. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods without exception. Currently, we have 66 units on hand and 356 units in the pipeline (orders from P38, P39, P40, and P41). Given the lead time L=4, my parameters must account for demand over L+1 = 5 periods. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current stable but volatile regime while filtering out the much higher demand from the first 15 periods. This approach helps the OR backend maintain a service level that reflects the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (~19:1) while accounting for the significant period-to-period variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1560.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to be in a sustained lower-volume regime that began around Period 16, following an initial higher-demand phase (P1-P15). Since P16, demand has averaged approximately 82.5 units with significant volatility (reaching as low as 35 and as high as 144). The last five periods (P38-P42) show demand of 67, 96, 99, 79, and 86, which is very close to this regime's mean. Lead time has been exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods for every shipment since the start of the game. On-hand inventory is currently at 74 units, with a healthy pipeline of 361 units (orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42). I will use the recent_N method with N=27 (covering the entire current regime since P16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while maintaining the lead time at 4. This setup allows the OR backend to balance the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1) by maintaining a sufficient base stock for the next 5 periods (L+1).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is sustained, with a mean of approximately 83 units and a standard deviation of about 25 units. For Period 44, I am observing Period 43's conclusion: on-hand inventory is 81 and in-transit is 361. The lead time remains highly stable at 4 periods. My target is to maintain a base stock that covers L+1 (5 periods) of demand. Using the recent_N method with N=28 (the length of the current regime from P16 to P43) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will accurately capture the current average and volatility while ignoring the much higher demand seen in the first 15 periods. This ensures the OR backend uses relevant statistics to balance the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost, maintaining approximately a 95% service level for the current demand pattern.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 16 continues to be stable, characterized by a lower mean and moderate volatility compared to the initial periods. Over the last 10 periods (P35-P44), the average demand is approximately 79.3 units, which is consistent with the long-term regime average of ~82 units since Period 16. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods by all recent arrivals (P37-P40 orders arriving on schedule). Current inventory status shows 104 units on-hand and 314 units in-transit (orders from P41, P42, P43, P44). To maintain optimal stock levels for the remaining 6 periods of the game, I will target the current regime's demand profile. I'm using N=29 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to cover the entire stable period from P16 to P44. This ensures the OR backend captures the sustained lower demand and its specific variance since the regime shift.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the lower-demand state established since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 15 periods (P31-P45) for better sensitivity while maintaining stability, the mean demand is approximately 82 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 24 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains perfectly reliable, consistently confirmed by arrivals through Period 45. In-transit inventory is 285 units (orders from P42, P43, P44, and P45), which covers the next 4 periods of demand at the current average. Combined with 158 units on-hand, the inventory position is healthy. I will continue using the recent_N method with N=30 to encompass the entire current regime since P16, as it provides a robust statistical baseline for this sustained lower-demand environment while accounting for the high volatility (35-144 range) observed. The critical check shows arrivals are perfectly on schedule, so L=default (4) is appropriate.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 16 remains stable, with demand fluctuating around a mean of ~82 units. Over the last 10 periods (P37-P46), the mean demand is 79.8 units with a standard deviation of 22.3, which aligns with recent carry-over insights. Lead time is highly reliable at exactly 4 periods. My strategy is to use the recent 10-period window to capture the current mean and volatility while maintaining a stock level that accounts for the (L+1) period risk window. With 138 units on hand and 229 in-transit (total 367), and an expected demand over the lead time plus current period (5 periods) of roughly 400 units, current pipeline is slightly lean but adequate given we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 47 of 50). Using recent_N=10 provides a balanced forecast for the remaining cycles.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1540.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 16, with a more recent mean (P41-P47) of approximately 78.4 units. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Since we are entering the final periods of the game (P48-P50), the priority is to satisfy remaining demand while avoiding excess inventory at the end of Period 50. Currently, on-hand inventory is 113 units and in-transit is 285 units (orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47). Given L=4, an order placed now in P48 would arrive in P52, which is beyond the game's horizon. However, the OR backend logic requires parameters to manage the current base stock efficiently for the remaining periods. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand stability (~78 units) and recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. L will be set to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1636.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 16 remains the dominant pattern, with a mean of approximately 83 units and a standard deviation of 26 units. Since we are at Period 49 and the game concludes at Period 50, the primary goal is to minimize ending inventory while covering demand for the final two periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, meaning orders placed now (P49) would arrive in P53 (beyond the game's end). Current on-hand inventory (74) and pipeline arrivals due in P49 (ordered P45, 73 units) and P50 (ordered P46, 43 units) will provide a total of 190 units of supply to meet demand for the final two periods. Given the mean demand is ~83, 190 units is more than sufficient to cover expected demand. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method (N=33, covering P16-P48) to reflect the current regime, but the base-stock logic will naturally result in a zero or near-zero order because pipeline inventory far exceeds current needs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1193.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime established around Period 16, characterized by a significantly lower mean (~82 units) compared to the initial periods (~145 units), but with persistent high volatility (standard deviation ~26). Period 49 demand was 67 units, which is within the expected range for this regime. The lead time remains firmly stable at 4 periods, with every order from Period 1 through Period 45 arriving exactly as promised. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 80 units and a pipeline (in-transit) of 348 units (orders from P46-P49). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend will naturally aim for a high service level. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=34 (covering the entire regime from P16 to P49) ensures the parameters reflect the current lower-demand environment while accounting for the observed volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (4), as there is no evidence of delay or loss.
