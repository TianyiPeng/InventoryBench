Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1: Initial state for chips(Regular). Since there is no prior inventory or in-transit orders, and the promised lead time is 4 periods, we need to place an order to cover the demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current demand samples (Periods 1-5) provide a basis: [216, 129, 138, 129, 115]. The mean is 145.4 and the standard deviation is 40.5. To be conservative and ensure service level for the snack category, I will use the default methods which calculate parameters based on all 5 available samples to seed the initial base-stock calculation.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 212 units. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we do not expect this order to arrive until Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 start message). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 212 in transit. Demand in Period 1 was 137. Historical demand samples (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) show an average of approximately 145.4 units per period. Since we are in the early stages, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent history while using 'default' for lead time as no shipments have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time is 4 periods. The history shows orders placed in Period 1 (212 units) and Period 2 (145 units) are still in transit, as expected given the lead time. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales, which is unavoidable in the start-up phase before the first shipment arrives. Based on the 5 demand samples (216, 129, 138, 129, 115), the demand seems relatively stable after an initial spike in Period 1. The mean of the last 4 periods is approximately 128 units. To ensure the base stock calculation covers the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5), I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting (mu_hat) with N=4 to capture this stable post-spike behavior. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 are still in transit and are not expected to arrive until Periods 5, 6, and 7 respectively (assuming lead time = 4). Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory for the first 3 periods, resulting in 0 units sold despite demand existing. The observed mean demand over the first 3 periods is approximately 135 units (137, 130, 137). Since we have no recorded 'conclude' arrival messages yet, we cannot confirm if the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods. I will use 'default' for L to stick with the promised 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the very consistent demand seen so far (avg ~135). The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (1+L) = 5 periods of demand (~675 units). Currently, 500 units are in transit (212+145+143), so the system will likely order ~175 more to reach that target.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution Phase) and be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 642 units in transit (orders from Periods 1-4). Demand has been relatively stable with a slight uptick in Period 4 (166 units), while the first three periods averaged around 135 units. The total mean demand over the 5 available samples (including the current user-provided sample for Period 5: 115) is approximately 125.4. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full available history to stabilize the forecast, as there isn't enough evidence yet of a sustained shift in demand or lead time deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2828.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Current demand data for Period 1-5 shows samples of [137, 130, 137, 166, 152], with a mean of 144.4. Note: The external Historical Demand Data provided in the prompt (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) differs from the in-game 'Game History' (137, 130, 137, 166, 152). I will prioritize the in-game 'Game History' as it reflects the realized performance and inventory states. On-hand inventory is 60, and in-transit is 542. Since we only have 5 samples, I will use all available samples (N=5) to estimate demand. The profit margin is high ($19 vs $1 holding cost), so the OR backend will target a high service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95). L=4 is confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand mean over first 5 periods is 144.4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2515.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The inventory on-hand is 69 units. Since the actual lead time L=4 is now confirmed (P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6), the pipeline inventory (In-transit: 566) covers the next four arrivals (P3, P4, P5, P6 orders). The demand history for the first 6 periods shows values: 137, 130, 137, 166, 152, 136. The target mean is approximately 143. Based on the prompt's provided 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' (216, 129, 138, 129, 115), there is a discrepancy between the data table and the 'GAME HISTORY'. I will prioritize the GAME HISTORY mean (~143) for the recent_N calculation. The backend logic for base stock is (1+L)*mu. With L=4 (total 5 periods of coverage), the logic is sound. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the stable demand observed so far and 'default' for L and sigma_hat as the promised lead time and historical volatility are appropriate for this stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently confirmed at 4 periods across P1 and P2 orders. Demand remains stable around 143 units/period (P1-P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2148.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P1, P2, and P3 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). Historical demand over the first 7 periods has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 139.4 units per period (137, 130, 137, 166, 152, 136, 118). The current on-hand inventory is 94 units, and there are 604 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). Given the promised/actual lead time (L=4), the inventory position should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Total expected demand over 5 periods is ~697 units. Current pipeline (94+604=698) is almost exactly aligned with this. I will maintain L=4 using the 'calculate' method as it reflects the confirmed historical data. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the full stable demand history available since the start of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3144.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by orders from Periods 1-4 arriving in Periods 5-8). Demand for Period 8 was 169 units, which is slightly above the previous average but within expected variance. Currently, we have 67 units on hand and 519 units in transit. Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover demand for Period 9 through Period 13 (L+1 = 5 periods). The current average demand across all 8 periods is (137+130+137+166+152+136+118+169)/8 = 143.125. Multiplying by 5 periods gives a mu_hat around 715. I will use 'default' for lead time since the promised lead time of 4 is being met exactly. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available history (8 periods) to maintain stability, as no clear demand regime shift has triggered a change to recent_N.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Lead time reaffirmed at 4 periods (P4 order arrived P8). Average demand over P1-P8 remains stable at ~143 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2961.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by orders from Periods 1 through 5). The order placed in Period 6 (169 units) is expected to arrive during Period 10's arrival phase, which is not yet reflected in the starting on-hand inventory of 22. Historical demand from Period 1 to Period 9 averages approximately 144.7 units per period. The recent 5 periods (P5-P9) show a slightly higher mean of 146.4 compared to the earlier periods, suggesting a minor upward drift. To ensure we cover demand for the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (Review=1), making a total of 5 periods, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the overall stability of the SKU while acknowledging the recent demand levels. This will set the base stock to cover expected demand over the next 5 periods while the OR backend manages the pipeline inventory of 596 units.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1 through 6. Demand remains stable; the mean demand over the first 10 periods is 143.3 units. Recent demand (Periods 8-10) shows a slight upward tick (169, 157, 161), bringing the 3-period average to 162.3. However, given the long lead time (L=4, covering 5 periods of risk), I will lean on a slightly longer-term stable average to avoid overreacting to short-term variance while acknowledging the recent strength. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the most relevant recent history including this slight increase. Sigma_hat remains stable based on the standard deviation of available demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2769.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Throughout Period 11, the actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand analysis across all 11 periods shows a mean of approximately 146.5 units per period (1612 total units consumed / 11 periods). The most recent 3 periods (P9-P11) show a slightly higher average of 155.7 units. However, looking at the full data set including the user-provided initial samples (P1-P5 from user prompt, though history shows slightly different values starting from P1), the demand appears relatively stable with no dramatic structural shifts. Given the consistent lead time of 4 periods and a stable demand pattern, using the default calculation for lead time (which is 4) and a recent_N approach for demand parameters provides a responsive yet stable forecast. I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand behavior while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. The current pipeline inventory (606) and on-hand (62) are being managed well by the OR backend, and maintaining the promised lead time parameter L=4 is appropriate.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, there was a stockout due to a significant demand spike (206 units) relative to the arrival of the small Period 8 order (57 units). This resulted in an ending on-hand inventory of 0. The actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 8 order in Period 12. Demand has shown an upward trend in the last few periods (157, 161, 149, 206). To account for this recent increase in mean demand and volatility while maintaining the confirmed lead time, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods, and using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR backend on the most recent demand behavior (averaging ~156 units/period recently vs ~143 earlier) to recover from the stockout and buffer against further demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Significant demand surge (206 units) led to a stockout (arrived 57 units from Period 8). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, there was a stockout due to a demand spike of 206 and a small arrival (57 units). Period 13 demand dropped significantly to 89 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown increased volatility recently (P12 surge to 206, P13 drop to 89). To balance the service level after the recent stockout while accounting for the sudden drop in demand, I will use a window of the last 10 periods (N=10) for demand estimation. This N captures the recent volatility (stdev increases) while smoothing the mu_hat. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is extremely stable.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistently verified by arrivals from Period 1 to Period 10. Demand has shown a recent uptick; while the early average (P1-P8) was around 143, the sequence from P8 onwards (169, 157, 161, 149, 206, 89, 182) shows higher volatility and a slightly higher average of 159 over the last 7 periods. Period 12 saw a significant stockout due to a demand spike of 206 and a small arrival from Period 8. Period 13 demand dropped significantly (89) but rebounded to 182 in Period 14. To manage this increased volatility and higher recent mean, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime. Lead time (L) is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 8: Mean demand increased from ~143 to ~159 (+11%) with significantly higher volatility (Standard Deviation increased from ~16 to ~38). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2182.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Reviewing history through Period 15, the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed. There has been a visible shift in the demand regime starting around Period 8; the mean demand increased from approximately 143 to 159 (+11%), and volatility (standard deviation) increased significantly from ~16 to ~38. The latest demand of 123 (P15) followed a higher demand of 182 (P14), indicating continued high variance. I am setting L to default (4) as it has been stable. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=8 (the length of the current regime from P8 to P15) to capture the higher mean and increased volatility without including the lower-demand early periods (P1-P7). This ensures the OR backend sets a higher base stock to protect against stockouts during this more volatile regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1333.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system shows an on-hand inventory of 206 and a significant pipeline (in-transit) of 618 units. Promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (Periods 5 through 16) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 8, a demand regime shift was noted with a mean of approximately 159; however, the last four periods (P13-P16) have shown high volatility and a downward trend in demand (89, 182, 123, 81). The average of the last 9 samples (P8-P16) is 150.8, while the average of the last 4 is 118.75. Given the high current pipeline (618 units against a target base stock likely around 750-800) and the recent lower demand observations (specifically Period 16 showing 81), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the broader regime change while respecting the increased volatility. Setting L to 'default' as it matches the observed 4-period lead time perfectly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1189.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals through Period 17). Demand has shown significant volatility in recent periods: after a period of high demand (P8-P14), there has been a noticeable drop in demand during P16 (81) and P17 (80). However, the overall regime since Period 8 still shows higher standard deviation (~45) compared to the initial periods. The current on-hand inventory is high (331 units), and there are 474 units in transit. Given the recent low demand samples, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=10) to capture the current mean while smoothing the recent dip. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=10) to account for the heightened volatility since Period 8, which ensures the base stock calculation remains robust against stockouts despite the recent drop in demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high since Period 8 (Std Dev ~45). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1359.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a significant low-consumption phase. Over the last 6 periods (P13-P18), the average demand has dropped to 100.5 units/period, compared to the 159 units/period observed in the previous regime. Specifically, the last four periods (P15-P18) have seen demand consistently below 90 units (123, 81, 80, 88). With on-hand inventory at 313 units and 461 units in-transit (total 774 units), the system is currently overstocked relative to this new demand level. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this downward shift (1+L=5, 5 * 100.5 = 502.5), and sigma_hat will also use N=6 to capture the current volatility. This will signal the OR backend to restrict further ordering until the pipeline inventory clears and on-hand levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: Average demand decreased from ~159 to ~101 (-36%) with reduced volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1328.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 13. While the earlier phase (P8-P12) saw a mean demand of approximately 159, the most recent seven periods (P13-P19) show a much lower average demand of approximately 105 units (89, 182, 123, 81, 80, 88, 93), though P14 was a high outlier. Given the current high on-hand inventory (439 units) and in-transit inventory (242 units), the system is currently overstocked relative to the new lower demand level. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward shift in demand and reflect the reduced volatility, which will signal the OR backend to minimize or stop ordering until the inventory levels normalize.

Daily Reward (R_t): $817.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 13. The average demand has dropped from ~159 units (P8-P12) to approximately 91 units (P13-P20). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P16-P20) show an average demand of 82.2 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 494 and in-transit at 118, the pipeline is currently overstocked relative to the new lower demand level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering the start of the lower demand regime at P13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the OR backend to quickly adjust the base stock downward, which will likely result in zero orders until the excess inventory is depleted. This strategy acknowledges the reduced mean and lower volatility of the current period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: Average demand decreased from ~159 to ~91 (-42%). Volatility also significantly decreased compared to the P8-P12 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $725.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant downward shift starting around Period 13. Over the last 9 periods (P13-P21), the average demand has dropped to approximately 85.4 units per period, down from over 140 earlier in the simulation. Volatility has also stabilized relative to the P8-P12 period. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P14-P17 orders all arriving with a 4-period lead time). On-hand inventory is currently very high (491 units) due to large orders placed before the demand drop fully registered. With a lead time of 4 periods, we are looking to cover\u9700\u6c42 for 5 periods (Review 1 + Lead 4). Expected demand over 5 periods is roughly 427 units (85.4 * 5). Since current on-hand (491) already exceeds the required coverage, the OR backend logic (min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)) should naturally minimize ordering. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9) to reflect the current low-demand regime.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting around Period 13. Over the last 10 periods (P13-P22), the average demand is 94.6 units, a significant decrease from the previous regime. Volatility has also stabilized. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high (471 units) due to large orders placed before detecting the regime shift arriving now. This on-hand inventory alone covers approximately 5 periods of demand, and there are still 68 units in-transit (remaining from P21 and P22 orders). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to reflect this lower demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P15 to P18 arrivals all showing LT=4). By using the lower mu_hat, the backend's base-stock calculation will naturally suppress ordering until the current overstock is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level since Period 13: Average demand P13-P22 is ~95 units (reduced from ~159).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 13. Calculating the mean demand from Period 13 to Period 23 gives approximately 88.5 units per period ((89+182+123+81+80+88+93+69+64+77+31)/11). Current on-hand inventory (440) is very high, significantly exceeding the expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Current pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 130 units. The OR backend will likely order 0 units given the surplus. To align the backend with the new lower demand regime, I will set 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' using 'recent_N' where N=11 (Periods 13-23). The lead time 'L' remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level since Period 13: Average demand (P13-P23) is 88.5 units. Current inventory level is significantly high relative to this new demand average.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 13. The average demand from Period 13 to Period 24 is approximately 89.7 units, which is much lower than the historical average. The most recent demand (Period 23 and 24) suggests levels could be even lower (mean of 61 units over the last 2 samples), though we should use a longer window for stability. Since Period 13, the standard deviation has also decreased significantly. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory (349 units) and in-transit inventory (145 units) totaling 494 units are extremely high compared to the current demand regime (89.7 * 5 = 448.5). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 12 periods (P13-P24) to accurately reflect this lower demand environment, allowing the OR backend to work through the excess inventory while maintaining a safe base stock level for the new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $705.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 13. The average demand from Period 13 to Period 25 is approximately 85.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently very high (321 units) relative to this demand, and there are 204 units in-transit. Shipments from Period 19 and Period 20 were zero-unit orders, which explains the 'arrived=0' observations in Periods 23 and 24. A shipment of 26 units (ordered Period 21) arrived in Period 25, confirming the lead time remains at 4 periods. Given the high pipeline inventory (orders from P22-P25 totaling 204 units) and high on-hand stock, I will use recent_N (N=13, covering the low-demand regime since P13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current lower demand and reduced volatility, while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 13 remains stabilized at a low level: mean ~85.5 units (P13-P25). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a significantly lower level since Period 13. Over the last 14 periods (P13-P26), the mean demand is approximately 84.8 units, compared to the earlier regime (P8-P12) which averaged ~159 units. Current on-hand inventory (277) and in-transit units (202) are very high relative to this lower demand. The backend's base-stock logic (on-hand + in-transit) will naturally restrict ordering since the pipeline already exceeds the target for a 4-period lead time. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=14) to capture this lower regime (P13 onwards), which will lower the target inventory level and help reduce the high holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 13. Over the last 15 periods (P13-P27), the average demand is approximately 82 units per period with a significantly lower standard deviation (~34) compared to previous regimes. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 258 units and in-transit is 220 units, totaling 478 units. Given the low demand average (~82), the current pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon ((1+L) * mu = 5 * 82 = 410). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture this stable low-demand regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=15 to reflect the current lower volatility. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by arrival history.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 13. The average demand from Period 13 to Period 28 is approximately 85.5 units per period. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as evidenced by Period 24's order arriving in Period 28). Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 165 units and an in-transit pipeline of 280 units (from orders in Periods 25, 26, 27, and 28), totaling 445 units. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~86, the required base stock is roughly 430 units. Since pipeline + on-hand (445) is already above this level, the backend will naturally limit ordering. I will use recent_N to capture the stable low-demand regime since Period 13 (N=16) to ensure the OR backend utilizes the most relevant statistics for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 13 remains stabilized at a lower mean compared to the initial periods. Analyzing the last 17 periods (P13-P29), the average demand is approximately 82 units per period with a standard deviation of about 20. The current on-hand inventory is 207 units, and there are 308 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 26, 27, 28, and 29). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Given the high in-transit volume relative to the current demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained lower demand and lower volatility since Period 13, which will prevent the OR backend from over-ordering while maintaining adequate service levels. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 13 (P13-P29) confirmed stable at a lower mean of ~82 units and lower volatility (Std Dev ~20).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable at a lower level since Period 13. Analyzing the most recent block (Periods 13-30), the average demand is approximately 82 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 20. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, which aligns with the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 160 units and in-transit is 300 units, totaling 460 units. This significantly exceeds the expected demand over the (L+1=5) period window (82 * 5 = 410). However, the OR backend's capped policy will naturally reduce orders due to this high pipeline. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 18 periods (N=18) to reflect this established low-demand regime starting from P13. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is reliable.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a stable, lower-volume regime since Period 13. Analyzing the most recent data (P13-P31), the mean demand is approximately 80 units per period with a standard deviation of about 19. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (making L+1=5). Total pipeline inventory (on-hand 157 + in-transit 304) is 461 units, which covers nearly 6 periods of demand at the current rate. I will use a recent_N of 19 (the length of the current regime starting at P13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this lower demand and reduced volatility compared to the earlier high-variance period. L will be set to 'calculate' as lead times have been highly consistent at 4 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 13. Over the last 20 periods (P13-P32), the mean demand is approximately 81.3 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 30.5. Current on-hand inventory is 141 units, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 308 units (comprised of orders from P29, P30, P31, and P32). Total inventory position is 449 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. At a mean of ~81.3, 5 periods of demand equals ~406.5 units. The current inventory position of 449 is slightly above this requirement, but given the volatility (sigma), keeping the OR calculations aligned with the post-P13 regime is necessary. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the stable period since the major demand drop in Period 13.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1206.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 13, with a mean of approximately 78 units and low volatility (standard deviation of ~21) over the last 20 periods. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. While recent demand (Periods 28-33) has averaged around 81 units, the broader stable regime since Period 13 provides a more robust sample size for statistical calculations. I will use a window of last 21 periods (N=21) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand level accurately. Currently, on-hand (181) and in-transit (285) inventory levels are sufficient to cover demand for several periods, so the OR backend will calculate a modest order to maintain the base stock level relative to this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 13 (P13-P33) confirmed stable at a lower mean of ~78 units and lower volatility (Std Dev ~21). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 13, consistently exhibiting a lower mean and reduced volatility compared to earlier periods. Analyzing the most recent 22 periods (P13-P34), the average demand is approximately 78.5 units per period with a standard deviation of about 21. Lead time remains reliably constant at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 30 order in Period 34 (4-period lead time). The current inventory position is robust with 146 units on-hand and 321 units in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical ratio q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95), the OR backend will target a high service level. Using recent_N with N=20 (capturing the stable lower demand regime) will provide the most accurate mu_hat and sigma_hat for the current period, balancing the need for safety stock against the holding cost of the current inventory surplus.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since Period 13. Analyzing the most recent data (P13-P35), the average demand is approximately 81 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 24. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival of the Period 31 order in Period 35. Currently, the system has 132 units on-hand and 239 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 32, 33, 34, 35). To determine the appropriate parameters, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=23 (covering the stable period from P13 to P35). This ensures the OR backend uses the lower mean (~81) and relevant volatility (~24) to calculate the base stock for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods). The lead time parameter is set to 'calculate' to utilize the stable historical observations of 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, lower-volume regime since Period 13. Analyzing the most recent period (P13-P36), the mean demand is approximately 78.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on the arrival of recent orders (most recently, P32 order arriving in P36). Current on-hand inventory is 137 units, with 293 units in-transit (orders from P33 onwards). The total pipeline plus on-hand (430 units) is sufficient to cover about 5.5 periods of demand at the current average rate (78.4 * 5.5 \u2248 431), which is appropriate for a Lead Time (L) of 4. Therefore, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=23 (covering the period from P13 to P36 excluding the current period) to capture this specific demand regime and maintain lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable at a lower regime since Period 13. Over the last 25 periods (P13-P37), the mean demand is approximately 81.6 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 146 units, and pipeline inventory is 298 units (sum of orders from P34-P37: 68+2+133+95). To maintain the target service level given the current stability, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the characteristics of this stable, lower-demand regime while filtering out the high-volatility period between P8 and P12.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 13 (P13-P37) remains stable at a mean of ~82 units and lower volatility (Std Dev ~18). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, lower-volume regime since Period 13. Over the last 10 periods (P29-P38), the mean demand is approximately 81.5 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 16.5. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival of the Period 34 order in Period 38. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 116 units and the pipeline (in-transit) is 240 units (orders from P35, P36, P37, P38). Total inventory of 356 units is significantly higher than the expected demand over the lead time (4+1 = 5 periods * 81.5 = 407.5). However, the in-transit amount includes a very small order from Period 35 (2 units) and a very small order from Period 38 (10 units), which suggests the OR backend is already reacting to the high inventory. I will use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable low-demand period since Period 13, and default for lead time as 4 is consistent.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a lower-mean regime since Period 13. Analyzing the most recent 27 periods (P13-P39), the average demand is approximately 82 units per period with a standard deviation of about 21. The lead time remains consistently reliable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 39 of the order placed in Period 35. Currently, on-hand inventory is 53 units, and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 340 units (orders from P36, P37, P38, and P39). This high pipeline inventory, relative to the current demand mean, suggests the OR backend will likely minimize new orders to burn through the excess. To provide the most accurate base-stock calculation for the current regime, I will use 'recent_N' with N=27 to capture the statistics of the stable period since the shift at Period 13.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean since Period 13. Calculating for the most recent regime (Period 13 to Period 40), the average demand is approximately 81.3 units per period with a standard deviation of about 19.3. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 125, with 333 units in transit (ordered in Periods 37-40). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=28 to capture this stable low-demand regime fully. While the pipeline (333) plus on-hand (125) equals 458, which is more than enough to cover the expected demand over the next 5 periods (approx 406 units), the OR backend's capped policy will adjust the final order to prevent overstocking while maintaining the service level. This approach protects against the moderate volatility observed recently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 13, but I observe a further decrease in the most recent periods (P39-P41 average is ~53 compared to the long-term P13-P38 average of ~82). However, three points are not enough to confirm a new sustained regime shift yet. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory (On-hand: 188, In-transit: 294) is quite high (482 units total) relative to recent demand, as the pipeline was stocked for a higher demand expectation. I will use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the stable lower demand regime since Period 13 while naturally incorporating the latest lower observations to prevent excessive overstocking. The OR backend will balance the high profit ($19) against holding costs using this parameterization.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 13, but the most recent 10 periods (P33-P42) show a slight downward trend in mean (approx 75 units/period) compared to the long-term P13-P42 average (approx 80 units/period). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 79, with 284 units in transit (orders from P39, P40, P41, P42). Total pipeline + on-hand is 363 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At the recent average of 75/period, we need ~375 units. At the slightly higher long-term average of 80/period, we need ~400 units. Currently, we are slightly under-provisioned relative to the long-term average but appropriately stocked for the very recent low demand. To ensure responsiveness to any minor rebound while respecting the low-demand trend, I will use a recent_N of 15 for demand mean and volatility, capturing the stabilized low-demand regime since P28. Lead time remains 'default' (4).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 13 remains stabilized at a lower level. For the period P13-P43, the mean demand is approximately 81.3 units with a standard deviation of 19.8. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P1 through P39). Currently, the inventory position (On-hand 124 + In-transit 299 = 423) is quite high compared to expected demand over the lead time plus review period (5 periods * ~82 units = 410). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=31 to capture the entirety of this stable low-demand regime starting from Period 13. This ensures the OR backend captures the lower mean and reduced volatility. For Lead Time (L), 'calculate' is used as the actual lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2510.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, lower-volume regime since Period 13. Calculating the mean demand from Period 13 to Period 44 (the most recent 32 periods), we find an average of approximately 81.3 units per period. The standard deviation over this same period is approximately 32.5, which is higher than previous estimates due to recent fluctuations in periods 42 and 44. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. Currently, the system has 112 units on-hand and 263 units in-transit (orders from P41 to P44), totaling 375 units of pipeline inventory. Given a lead time of 4, our base stock target (mu_peak) should cover (1+4)=5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~81 units, we need 405 units plus a safety buffer to achieve the desired service level (calculated by the OR backend). My parameters use the recent_32 period window to capture this stable 'low demand' regime since the last major changepoint, while allowing sigma to reflect the recent uptick in volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1412.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significantly higher average over the last 5 periods (mean ~86 units) compared to the previous stabilization phase (P13-P37 mean was ~82). In the very last period (P45), demand was 79, and P44 saw a spike to 138. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 89, with 340 units in transit. Since we are at Period 46 of 50, orders placed now (L=4) will arrive in Period 50, which is the final period. Any order placed after Period 46 would arrive after the game ends. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 periods (N=10) to capture the recent volatility (e.g., the 138 and 119 spikes) while maintaining a baseline for the final stock requirement. L is set to default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased slightly in recent periods (P41-P45), with a significant spike to 138 in Period 44. The mean over P13-P45 remains approximately 82-84 units, but the recent 5-period average is higher (~86).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, the system is managing 'chips(Regular)' with 12 units on-hand and 428 units in-transit. Based on the history, lead time is consistently 4 periods. The demand regime identified since Period 13 remains largely stable with a mean of approximately 82 units, though recent periods (P42-P46) have shown a slight increase in average demand (~78 in prior long-term vs ~84 recently). Specifically, the last 10 periods (P37-P46) show an average demand of 82.5 units. The shipment from P42 (0 units) arrived in spirit but did not increase inventory, leading to the current low on-hand stock. To ensure coverage for the L+1 window (5 periods) given the stable but slightly volatile nature of the current regime, I will use a recent_N approach. I select N=10 to capture the current demand mean (~82.5) while smoothing out the volatility observed in Period 44 (138 units). This provides a balanced base stock for the OR engine to navigate the final periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1811.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable in the long-term low-demand regime starting Period 13, with a mean around 82-84 units. However, recent periods (P41-P47) show slightly increased volatility and a mean closer to 86 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P43 order arrived in P47). Note that the Period 42 order was for 0 units, which explains why no shipment arrived from that period. On-hand inventory is currently low (32 units), but there is a significant in-transit pipeline (389 units) including the P44 order (126 units) expected to arrive in Period 48. To prevent over-ordering while maintaining service levels against recent volatility, I will use a recent_N window for the demand forecast (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture the slightly higher recent activity (last 7 periods since the P41 fluctuation).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1458.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P44-P48) has been slightly higher, averaging approximately 94 units compared to the older P13-P43 average of ~81 units. Specifically, demand over the last 5 periods (138, 79, 77, 97, 79) shows an average of 94.0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P43 order in P47 and the P44 order in P48. Current on-hand inventory is low (43 units), though in-transit inventory is high (439 units), largely due to a large order placed in Period 46 (which should arrive in P50). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand intensity of ~94 units per period across the (L+1) horizon. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen since Period 44 (Std Dev of ~25 in the last 5 periods). This ensures the base stock reflects the current risk of stockouts while managing the high pipeline inventory. The backend will naturally order less because the pipeline (439) is substantial relative to the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand (P44-P48) has stabilized at a slightly higher mean of ~94 units compared to the previous ~81 units. Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2304.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, demand has recently stabilized at a slightly higher mean of approximately 94 units (P44-P48 avg = 93.4) compared to the previous regime (~81). There was a missing delivery from Period 42 (ordered 0, arrived 0, but technically a gap in arrival sequence) and Period 46 arrived 0 (ordered Period 42), which is consistent with the order of 0 placed in P42. The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods based on the arrival of P45's order in P49. With high in-transit inventory (390 units) and low on-hand (52), the priority is managing the pipeline. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat specifically targets this recent uptick in demand while sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to capture the moderate volatility (Std Dev ~28 in the last 10 periods). L is set to 'calculate' to rely on the consistent 4-period history.
