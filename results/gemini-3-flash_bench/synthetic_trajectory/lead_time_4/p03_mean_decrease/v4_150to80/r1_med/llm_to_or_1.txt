Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical data to infer lead time or demand regime shifts yet. The promised lead time is 4. Historical demand samples (P1-P5) show a mean of 145.4 and a standard deviation of 40.5. Since the lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the default methods initially to establish a baseline. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using the mean and standard deviation of all available samples multiplied by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively. With On-hand = 0 and In-transit = 0, the backend will place a significant initial order to reach the target base stock of approximately 145.4 * 5 = 727 units, adjusted for service level and capped appropriately.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 212 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected based on the lead time definition, no units arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0 visible in Period 1 conclude), leaving us with 0 on-hand and 137 units of lost sales (demand was 137, starting inventory was 0). The 212 units from P1 are currently 'In-transit'. Given the available historical demand data (P1-P5: 216, 129, 138, 129, 115) and comparing it to the actual observed demand in Period 1 (137), the demand is relatively stable within the 115-216 range. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and base my demand forecast on the provided 5 samples plus the observed P1 demand (total 6 samples). I choose 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the mean demand and volatility while we wait for the first shipment to arrive in Period 5.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we are facing a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, the orders placed in Period 1 (212 units) and Period 2 (204 units) are not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations in the history for Period 1 and 2 are consistent with the promised lead time of 4. Current demand across the first 5 samples (including the seed data) shows a mean of approximately 125 units (samples: 216, 129, 138, 129, 115). The recent demand in Period 1 and 2 was 137 and 130 respectively. I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the most recent demand baseline. This will set the base stock level to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, which is approximately 625 units. With 416 units currently in transit, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to bridge the gap to the target base stock, while the internal 'cap' mechanism prevents over-ordering.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4), meaning they will first be visible in the Period 6 decision phase. Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory for the first 3 periods, resulting in lost sales. The historical demand for periods 1-3 is relatively stable (137, 130, 137), and including the pre-game samples (216, 129, 138, 129, 115), the demand reflects a mean around 129-130 units per period. Since no orders have reached the 'arrival resolution' yet, we adhere to the promised lead time L=4. We use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=8 (3 game periods + 5 pre-game samples) to capture the most relevant demand distribution. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (212 units) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 6 start message. Therefore, current on-hand inventory remains 0, and all units sold so far are 0 (lost sales). The demand samples provided (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) and history conclude messages (137, 130, 137, 166) show a relatively stable mean. The average of all 9 available demand points is approximately 144. Since the lead time is L=4, the pipeline should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Currently, 754 units are in-transit, which covers roughly 5.2 periods of average demand (754 / 144 \u2248 5.2). I will use defaults for lead time and sigma, but use recent_N for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior while waiting for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (concluded), confirming an actual lead time of 4. Orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4 are still in transit (pipeline inventory = 542). Demand for the first 5 periods has been: 216, 129, 138, 129, 115 (as provided in the sample data) or 137, 130, 137, 166, 152 (as provided in the game history). I will prioritize the game history data for forecasting. The mean demand is approximately 144.4 units/period with a standard deviation of 15.1. Given L=4, the coverage required is (1+4)=5 periods. \u03bc\u0302 = 5 * 144.4 = 722. \u03c3\u0302 = sqrt(5) * 15.1 \u2248 33.8. Current inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) is 60 + 542 = 602. The OR backend will aim for a base stock level and determine the order size.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by two consecutive arrivals: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 (L=4) and Period 2 order arrived in Period 6 (L=4). Demand for the first 6 periods has been relatively stable, with samples: 137, 130, 137, 166, 152, 136. The mean demand is approximately 143. Including the pre-game samples provided (216, 129, 138, 129, 115), the overall mean is roughly 135. Given the target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), the OR backend needs parameters reflecting this stability. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the slightly higher demand seen during the actual game periods compared to the pre-game data. Sigma_hat will use the default calculation across all available samples to ensure a robust buffer against variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed arrivals from P1 and P2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $317.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 8. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 7 periods (137, 130, 137, 166, 152, 136, 118) shows a mean of approximately 139.4 units per period. The lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods based on concluding arrivals from Periods 1, 2, and 3. My target is to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Currently, On-hand (155) + In-transit (494) = 649. With an expected demand of ~140, 5 periods would require ~700 units. The pipeline is relatively healthy, but I will use recent_N to capture the most stable demand signal. Since demand has fluctuated slightly but stayed within a consistent range, N=7 (all available conclude data) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to balance risk. L is set to 'default' as it aligns with the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $497.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Reviewing the lead time history from the 'conclude' messages for Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8, orders placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 all arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods. This perfectly matches the promised lead time (L=4). Therefore, using the 'default' lead time method is appropriate. Regarding demand, the samples for the last 8 periods are: 137, 130, 137, 166, 152, 136, 118, 169. The mean of these 8 samples is approximately 143.1. There is no clear seasonal trend or regime shift evident yet (demand fluctuates between 118 and 169); however, the last demand point (169) was relatively high. I will use N=8 (the full concluded history) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current variance while smoothing out the noise. The system currently has 179 units on-hand and 379 in-transit. Since L=4, we need enough inventory to cover the review period plus the lead time (1+L=5 periods). 5 * 143 is ~715. Current total inventory (179+379 = 558) is below this level, so the OR backend will trigger a replenishment order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $606.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the order placed in Period 5 (0 units) would have arrived if lead time remained 4 periods. Since the Period 5 order was size 0, the 'arrived=0' message in the Period 9 conclude is expected and confirms the lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently low (22 units) because no inventory arrived this period. Historical demand remains relatively stable. I will use the last 9 periods of demand to capture the slightly higher mean (approx 145 units) observed since Period 4, compared to the initial samples. With a lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover expected demand and variability, while accounting for the 552 units in-transit.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows stable demand and lead-time behavior. The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, as supported by the arrival of orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6 exactly 4 periods after ordering. Note that there was no order in P5, which explains why no shipment arrived in P9 conclude. The order from P6 arrived in P10 conclude. We are currently waiting for the order from P7 (124 units) to arrive in P11 (visible in P12), the order from P8 (78 units) in P12, and so on. Since lead time is stable at 4, I will use L=4. Demand analysis: Demand over the last 10 periods (samples provided in prompt + game history) shows a mean of approximately 144.1 units per period (History demands: 137, 130, 137, 166, 152, 136, 118, 169, 157, 161). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality, so I will use a larger N to capture the overall variety in demand. I choose N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a stable base stock calculation, covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 146 units over the last 11 periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as confirmed by arrivals for orders from periods 1-4, 6, and 7 (Period 5 order was 0). Note: The order from Period 5 was 0, explaining why 'Period 9 conclude' showed 0 units arrived. On-hand inventory is low (13 units), but the pipeline is healthy (599 units) across the next 4 periods. Since the lead time is stable at 4, the target inventory should cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=11 for demand statistics captures the full visible history given the stability.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. Examining history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (last arrivals for orders from P6, P7, and P8 all showed L=4). However, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory because demand spiked to 206 in Period 12, causing a stockout. The order from Period 9 (173 units) is expected to arrive during Period 13 resolution (4 periods after P9). Pipeline inventory is 673 units. Looking at the demand history (including the 5 initial samples provided: 216, 129, 138, 129, 115), the Mean is approximately 144.9 and Std Dev is approximately 25.0. Recent demand (P8-P12: 169, 157, 161, 149, 206) suggests a slight upward shift (Mean ~168.4). To ensure adequate stock while covering the 5-period window (L+1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and standard deviation to capture this recent increase in volatility and mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift noted around Period 8: mean demand increased from ~135 to ~168 (+24%) with notably higher volatility in Period 12.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe a significant demand drop in Period 13 (89 units) following a peak in Period 12 (206 units). The mean demand since the Period 8 shift (P8-P13) is approximately 155.1 units, but the high volatility suggests we should use a more recent window to account for the current instability. We have an on-hand inventory of 84 and a large pipeline of 705 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (L=4). To prevent over-ordering during this volatile phase while ensuring enough coverage for (1+L)=5 periods, I will use a recent_N window of 6 periods for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher mean compared to the initial periods. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=6 to reflect the recent high variance (Period 12 spike and Period 13 dip). This helps the OR backend set a base stock that respects recent fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $653.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe the following: The lead time is stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P9 and P10 shipments arrived on P13 and P14 respectively). There was a demand regime shift around Period 8, with mean demand increasing and exhibiting higher volatility. Demand in P12 was 206, but dropped to 89 in P13 before returning to 182 in P14. Comparing the demand from Period 8 to Period 14 (169, 157, 161, 149, 206, 89, 182), the mean is approximately 159. For my OR parameters, I will use L=4 (promised and observed). For mu_hat, I will use a recent_N of 7 (P8-P14) to capture the higher mean of the current regime. For sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N of 7 to account for the increased volatility recently observed (standard deviation is significantly higher in this window than in the initial periods). The pipeline inventory (591) and on-hand (75) are substantial, so the OR backend will calculate a modest order to maintain the base stock level required for the L+1 window.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 8-15) shows a mean demand of approximately 154.5 units, which is higher than the initial periods. There was a significant spike in Period 12 (206 units) followed by a sharp drop in Period 13 (89 units), suggesting increased volatility. Lead times have been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P10 arrived P14, P11 arrived P15). Currently, we have 127 units on hand and 614 in transit (orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15). To prevent stockouts like in Period 12 while managing holding costs, I will use a recent window for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=8 for demand calculations covers the identified regime shift since Period 8. The lead time remains at the default promised value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $126.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high degree of volatility following a previously noted regime shift. While Periods 5-11 averaged ~145, Period 12 spiked to 206, and Periods 13-16 dropped significantly (89, 182, 123, 81). This suggests the regime shift at Period 8 might be evolving or suffering from high variance. I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat (covering Periods 8-16) to capture the higher mean compared to the start but also reflecting the recent slowdown. This results in an average demand of ~137.6 units/period. For L, observed lead times have been consistent at 4 periods, so 'default' (promised=4) is appropriate. Sigma_hat will use the same N=9 to account for the high variance observed in this recent window (StDev is ~45). These parameters provide a balanced safety stock to handle the inconsistency in demand while maintaining the 4:1 Profit/Holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed as a primary characteristic since Period 12; mean demand remains higher on average than initial levels (~140 vs ~130) but fluctuations are wider (81-206).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-3.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently high at 323 units, largely due to a recent arrival of 205 units and relatively low demand in the last two periods (81 and 80). The observed lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 8, demand has exhibited increased volatility, but the most recent five periods (P13-P17) show a drop in the mean demand (~111 units) compared to the preceding high-demand regime. However, this may be a localized dip within the volatile pattern established since Period 12. To avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against the volatility observed in earlier periods (e.g., P12 peak of 206), I will use the last 10 samples (P8-P17) to calculate demand metrics (mu_hat and sigma_hat). This period range captures both the higher mean period and the recent dips, providing a balanced forecast for the next 5 periods (L+1). L is set to calculated as the 4-period lead time is consistent.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand observation: The high-volatility regime starting at P12 has recently shown a cluster of lower-than-average demand (Period 13-17 average ~111), contrasting with the P8-P12 average (~168).

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe chips(Regular) with on-hand inventory of 294 and a significant in-transit pipeline of 401. Historical lead times have consistently settled at 4 periods. Since Period 13, there has been a notable downward shift in demand (P13-P18 mean is ~117), contrasting with the previous high-mean regime (P8-P12 mean was ~168). Specifically, the last three periods (P16-P18) have seen even lower demand levels (81, 80, 88), suggesting a cooling off from previous volatility. Given the 4-period lead time, the total coverage window is 5 periods (L+1). With 695 units already available or coming (on-hand + in-transit), and recent demand averaging ~117 (or even lower if looking at the last 3 samples), our current position is very high. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 samples (N=6) to capture the lower-demand shift while accounting for some residual volatility, and use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=6) to reflect the recent decrease in variance compared to the P12 spike. L remains at the default promised value of 4, consistent with observed delivery history.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand has stabilized into a lower-mean regime since Period 13 (avg ~117 vs previous ~168), with the most recent three periods (P16-P18) showing consistently low demand around 80-90 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-27.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the current on-hand inventory is 399 units with 203 units in-transit (orders from P16, P17, P18). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The demand regime has significantly shifted downwards since Period 13; while the average since P13 is ~110, the most recent four periods (P16-P19) have averaged only 85.5 units (81, 80, 88, 93). Given the high level of inventory currently held (399 on-hand) relative to this low-demand regime, and a holding cost of $1.0 vs a profit of $4.0, it is crucial to avoid overstocking. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7, covering P13-P19) to capture the lower demand mean (~110) while reflecting the recent stabilization. Sigma_hat is set to the same period to account for the reduced volatility in this period compared to the P8-P12 spike. The OR backend's capping mechanism will likely result in a zero or near-zero order to burn off the existing inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a low-mean regime (P16-P19 avg: 85.5 units), confirming the shift noted in P19.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-153.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistently lower regime over the last five periods (P16-P20), with an average demand of approximately 82.2 units (81, 80, 88, 93, 69). This is significantly lower than the previous regimes observed earlier in the game. On-hand inventory is currently very high (429 units) relative to this new demand level, which, combined with the 104 units in-transit (ordered in P17 and P18), covers more than six periods of expected demand. Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this sustained lower demand level (total demand over 1+L periods will be calculated by the backend as 5 * ~82.2). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect the reduced volatility in this current regime compared to the mid-game spikes. The high inventory levels are likely to lead the OR backend to order 0 units to minimize holding costs until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean from Period 16-20: average of 82.2 units per period (down from previous highs of ~135-168).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-160.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly shifted into a sustained lower regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent six periods (P16-P21), the mean demand is approximately 79.2 units, a significant decrease from the early and mid-game averages (130-160 range). Currently, on-hand inventory is very high at 416 units, with 53 units in-transit (ordered in P18). With a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). At the current mean of ~80 units, the required stock is ~400 units. Since current on-hand inventory (416) already exceeds this coverage requirement, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this lower volume and reduced volatility accurately. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean from Period 16-21: average of 79.2 units per period (down from previous highs and confirming the mid-80s trend).

The average demand over the last seven periods (Period 16-22) is approximately 78.9 units (81, 80, 88, 93, 69, 64, 77), which is significantly lower than the initial historical samples (~130) and the mid-game peak (~168). Our on-hand inventory is currently very high (392 units) compared to this new demand level. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~79, the required base stock is roughly 395 units. However, because we already have 392 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we are nearly at the target. The OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a zero or near-zero order to allow the inventory to wind down towards more efficient levels, minimizing holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this stabilized low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean from Period 16-22: average of 78.9 units per period, consistently staying below 100 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistently lower regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 8 periods (P16-P23), the mean demand is approximately 73 units, with the latest period showing significantly lower demand (31 units). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 361 units, which is extremely high (nearly 5x the recent average demand), and there are an additional 22 units in transit. Given the lead time (L=4) and the current period (P24), we are covering at least 5 periods of demand (L+1). The inventory position (On-hand + In-transit = 383) far exceeds the expected demand over the lead time (approximately 73 * 5 = 365). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=8 to capture this lower demand regime (P16-P23) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=8 to reflect the current volatility within this period. This will allow the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level according to the lower demand. No new order is likely to be triggered due to the high surplus, which is desirable to minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean from Period 16-23: average of 72.9 units per period, with a notable drop to 31 units in Period 23.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistently lower regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the average demand is 75.0 units with relatively stable volatility. Meanwhile, we observe that orders from Periods 19, 20, 21, and 22 resulted in 'ordered=0', meaning no new inventory was injected into the pipeline during those periods. The shipments from Periods 17 and 18 have arrived (P21 and P22), confirming the lead time remains at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 270 units, which is quite high relative to recent demand (~3.6 periods of supply). In-transit is only 40 units (from P23 and P24 orders). To ensure we don't overstock while maintaining the service level, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture this established low-demand regime. This will likely result in the OR backend ordering zero or very small amounts until on-hand inventory depletes further.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean from Period 16-24: average of 75.0 units per period (N=9), confirming a sustained drop from historical levels.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-mean pattern since Period 16. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the average demand is 72.8 units (81, 80, 88, 93, 69, 64, 77, 31, 91, 54), with a standard deviation of approximately 18.2 units. The on-hand inventory is currently high at 216 units, and there are 141 units in transit (ordered in P23, P24, and P25). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit = 357) already covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current average (72.8 * 5 = 364), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to align the OR backend with this lower-demand regime. This will help prevent excessive over-ordering and minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer against the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean from Period 16-25: average of 72.8 units per period (N=10), confirming a sustained reduction in volume compared to early-game performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $214.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistently lower regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P16-P26), the mean demand is approximately 74 units per period (sum of demands: 81+80+88+93+69+64+77+31+91+54+86 = 814; 814/11 \u2248 74). This is significantly lower than the early-game average and confirms the regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights. Lead time has been remarkably consistent at 4 periods for all successfully tracked arrivals. Although no shipments arrived in P23-P26, this is expected since no orders were placed in P19-P22. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 130 and in-transit inventory of 185 (from orders in P23-P26), totaling 315 units. Given the target base stock logic (L+1 periods of demand coverage), and with L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. At the current mean (~74), the required pipeline is ~370. To ensure the OR backend captures this lower mean and moderate volatility, I am using recent_N with N=11 to isolate this current regime (P16-P26).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean from Period 16-26: average of 74.0 units per period (N=11), maintaining the sustained reduction in volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $253.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a lower-mean regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand is 74.6 units per period, with relatively consistent behavior (most values ranging between 54 and 93, excluding the outlier of 31 in P23). Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (most recently confirmed by the P23 order arriving in P27). My strategy is to sustain the current lower inventory targets to minimize holding costs while providing sufficient coverage for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=5). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture this extended period of lower demand and its associated volatility. Current on-hand (71) and in-transit (253) units are being monitored as the system works through previous orders; the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to maintain the base stock level for this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean from Period 16-27: average of 74.6 units per period (N=12), with consistently lower volume compared to the first half of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, demand was 108 units, which is higher than the recent average but still within the expected range for this category. On-hand inventory is now 0. The system shows 318 units in-transit, which includes orders from Period 25 (101), Period 26 (44), Period 27 (90), and the most recent Period 28 (83). Orders from P25 are expected to arrive in Period 29 (now). However, to prevent stockouts given the zero on-hand balance and recent demand volatility, I am maintaining the demand forecast based on the recent regime starting at Period 16. Specifically, mu_hat is set using recent_N=13 to cover the period range P16-P28 where demand has averaged approximately 75 units. This allows the OR backend to calculate the necessary base stock to cover the (L+1) horizon while considering the high pipeline inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean from Period 16-28: average of 77.2 units per period (N=13), showing slight recovery in the most recent period but remaining significantly lower than the first half of the game.

Daily Profit: $172.00, Daily Holding Cost: $58.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistently lower regime since Period 16, with the most recent 14 periods (P16-P29) averaging approximately 75 units. Despite a spike to 108 in Period 28, the most recent demand was 43, reinforcing the lower mean. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=14 to capture this sustained shift. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P23, P24, P25 orders arriving after 4 periods). On-hand inventory is 58, but with 322 units in-transit (reflecting orders from P26, P27, P28, P29), the pipeline is sufficient. The OR backend will calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) based on this ~75 unit/period mean, and then subtract the pipeline to determine the final order. Current pipeline (322) is actually significantly larger than the projected base stock (approx 5 * 75 = 375, plus safety stock), so the order will likely be small or capped to prevent overstocking as we manage the high holding cost relative to profit (holding is 25% of profit).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean from Period 16-29: average of 74.9 units per period (N=14), continuing the trend of significantly lower volume compared to the first half of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $333.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized at a lower level compared to the early game. Since Period 16, the average demand has consistently hovered around 75 units, despite occasional fluctuations. The current on-hand inventory is low (15 units) due to a stockout in Period 28 and varying demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To address this sustained lower demand regime while accounting for the recent stockout and moderate volatility, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (covering the period from P16 to P30). This captures the mean demand of approximately 75 units and the corresponding variance of this lower-demand period, allowing the OR engine to set a base stock that balances the $4.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost effectively for the current environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean from Period 16-30: average of 75.7 units per period (N=15), maintaining a significantly lower volume than the first 15 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $310.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 16 periods (P16-P31), the average demand is approximately 76.2 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 19.3. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 31 of the order placed in Period 27 (4 periods). Currently, the on-hand inventory is low (22 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 311 units. In a lead-time of 4 periods (covering 5 periods of demand: current + 4), we expect total demand to be approximately 381 units (5 * 76.2). With on-hand (22) and in-transit (311), the total position is 333 units. Using 'recent_N' with N=16 will allow the OR backend to capture this sustained lower-demand regime while accounting for the recent volatility. This ensures the base stock reflects the current consumer behavior rather than the higher-volume historical data from the first half of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean from Period 16-31: average of 76.2 units per period (N=16), continuing to show significantly lower volume and lower peak volatility compared to the first 15 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized at a lower level compared to the first half of the game. For the period range 16-32, the average demand is 77.1 units per period. The most recent demand was 91, which is slightly above this average but aligns with the identified stable regime. On-hand inventory is low (14 units), but arrivals are consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the demand regime shift at Period 16 has been sustained for 17 periods (N=17), I will use N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific stability and current volatility. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P27, P28).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean from Period 16-32: average of 77.1 units per period (N=17), continuing to sustain lower volume and reduced peak volatility compared to the initial 15 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $246.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained consistent within its second-half regime (Period 16 onwards), averaging approximately 77 units per period. The last five periods (P29-P33) show a slightly higher recent average of 77.8 units, compared to the longer-term regime average of 77.1 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on consistently observed arrivals (P27, P28, P29, P30, P31, P32, and P33 all confirmed a lead time of 4). I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=18 (covering the entire stable regime since P16) to capture the current mean while smoothing volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=18 to reflect the reduced but persistent variation in this regime. Current on-hand (46) + in-transit (302) = 348 units, which is slightly above the expected base stock for a 5-period window (L+1), but given the holding cost vs profit ratio (1:4), a slightly conservative stock position is maintained to prevent stockouts seen earlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean from Period 16-33: average of 77.1 units per period (N=18), continuing to sustain lower volume and reduced peak volatility compared to the initial 15 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-mean regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 19 periods (P16-P34), the average demand is approximately 76.6 units per period. The most recent demand (P34) was 67 units, while the peak during this regime was 108 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on concluded arrivals (P27-P34). I will use N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable, low-volume regime. On-hand inventory is low (12), but in-transit inventory is high (340), which accounts for orders placed in P31 (90), P32 (85), P33 (94), and P34 (71). This pipeline covers about 4.4 periods of average demand, which aligns well with the L+1 coverage requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean from Period 16-34: average of 76.6 units per period (N=19), confirming long-term lower volume compared to the first half of the game.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-mean regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 20 periods (P16-P35), the mean demand is approximately 76.6 units per period. The recent 5 periods (P31-P35) show a slightly higher but consistent average of 82.4 units. I will use N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this sustained lower-demand regime while providing enough sample size for stability. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P33-P35 arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering). Current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units), but in-transit inventory is high (314 units), reflecting the lead time buffer. By setting N=20, the OR backend will calculate a base stock level tailored to the current 75-80 unit demand profile, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level based on the observed volatility of this segment.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, lower-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 21 periods (P16-P36), the mean demand is approximately 76.5 units per period. The most recent demand (P36: 74 units) aligns well with this sustained trend. Lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P30 through P36). With an on-hand inventory of 15 and 333 units in-transit, the pipeline is healthy. I will use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower-demand/lower-volatility regime while ignoring the higher-demand fluctuations of the first half of the game. For L, I will use the 'default' method as lead times have been consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 16-36 average demand is 76.5 units (N=21), maintaining the sustained reduction from the first half of the game (~135-168 range).

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-mean regime since Period 16. Over the last 22 periods (P16-P37), the average demand is 76.7 units with relatively low volatility compared to the beginning of the game. The most recent demand (P37) was 81 units, which is consistent with the current regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P33 order in P37 (109 - 28 = 81 units sold, matching P37 demand; arrived 94 units ordered in P33 as scheduled). Currently, on-hand inventory is 28 units and in-transit is 311 units. Given the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4), the backend logic (z* \u2248 0.84) will aim for a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the stable demand regime from the last 20 periods, which accurately represents the current mean of ~76 units and its associated variance, ensuring stable orders that avoid both stockouts and excessive accumulation.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 77 units per period and reduced volatility compared to the early game. Analysis of the last 23 periods (P16-P38) shows a consistent pattern confirming this lower-mean regime. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P34 order arriving in P38). Currently, there is only 1 unit on hand, while the in-transit inventory is 321 units. Given (L+1) = 5, the pipeline should cover a demand range around 385 units (5 * 77) plus safety stock. The existing pipeline of 321 plus the current order will bridge this gap. I will use recent_N=23 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the specific characteristics of this sustained low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend can correctly manage the service level without excessive holding costs as we approach the final 10 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stable, lower-volume regime. Analyzing demand from Period 16 through Period 39 (N=24), the mean demand is approximately 76.5 units per period. The most recent demand values remain consistent with this level (65, 98, 81, 74, 98). The inventory currently sits at 0 on-hand with 360 units in-transit. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P37, P38, and P39). I will continue using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=24 to capture this sustained low-demand regime starting at Period 16. Setting L to 'default' is appropriate as actual lead times match the promised 4 periods. This setting helps the OR backend maintain a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while avoiding excessive holding costs in this lower-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 16-39 average demand is 76.5 units (N=24), reflecting a long-term lower volume and reduced volatility compared to the first 15 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, lower-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 25 periods (P16-P40), the mean demand is approximately 75.9 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 16.5. This is a significant shift from the early-game volatility and higher means. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by every shipment from P1 to P36 arriving exactly on schedule. The current on-hand inventory is 43, with 318 units in-transit (orders from P37-P40). To maintain the optimal service level while minimizing holding costs for this low-mean regime, I will use a recent_N approach (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained stability, and 'default' for L as the lead time is perfectly aligned with the promised 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistently lower regime since Period 16, with the most recent Period 41 showing a significant drop to 32 units. The average demand from Period 16 to 41 (N=26) is approximately 74.8 units. The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. My strategy is to focus on the recent demand regime (since Period 16) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as using the full history would overestimate required stock due to the high-demand periods at the start of the game. I will use N=26 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Current on-hand (83) and in-transit (300) are sufficient to cover the lead time demand at this lower consumption rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 16-41 average demand is 74.8 units (N=26), continuing the trend of lower volume and reduced volatility compared to the first 15 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized at a lower level compared to the first half of the game. Since Period 16, the average demand is 75.8 units (N=27 periods). The most recent period (P42) showed a higher-than-average demand of 119 units, which follows a very low 32 units in P41, indicating that while the mean is stable (~75), volatility remains a factor. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 45 units on hand and 249 units in transit (covering orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand regime. I will continue using recent_N (N=27) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized lower-demand regime while accounting for the inherent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 16-42 average demand is 75.8 units (N=27), reflecting sustained lower volume and moderate volatility compared to the initial 15 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 28 periods (P16-P43), the average demand is approximately 75 units per period with a standard deviation around 20. The current date is Period 44, nearing the end of the 50-period horizon. The actual lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals and carry-over insights). On-hand inventory is 91, and in-transit inventory is 258 (sum of orders from P40-P43: 62 + 54 + 30 + 112 = 258). Total pipeline (including on-hand) is 349. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At an average of 75/period, expected demand is 375, so current coverage is slightly below the target safety stock level. Using recent_N=28 for mu_hat captures this sustained lower-demand regime while recent_N=20 for sigma_hat captures current volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-mean regime since Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 44 (N=29), the average demand is approximately 78 units per period, with a standard deviation around 22 units. Lead times have remained remarkably consistent at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 15 units, with 269 units in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend will naturally aim for a higher service level. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=29 to capture this established lower-demand regime while maintaining enough sensitivity to recent fluctuations (like the spike to 138 in Period 44). This N value covers the entire stable period since the major shift identified in the carry-over insights.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 16-44 average demand is 77.9 units (N=29), continuing the trend of lower volume compared to the initial 15 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-mean regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 77.9 units as of Period 45. In the most recent period (P45), the system experienced a stockout (demand 79, sold 69), ending with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages. Pipeline inventory is currently 332 units, which includes several pending orders. To ensure sufficient stock for the remaining 5 periods of the game while accounting for the recent stockout and moderate demand volatility, I will use recent_N (N=30, covering the stable regime since P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the need to satisfy demand while minimizing end-of-game holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a lower-mean regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 77 units per period through Period 44. Recent periods (44-46) have shown a slight uptick in volatility (demand of 138, 79, 77), but the overall trend remains significantly lower than the early-game average. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a substantial in-transit pipeline of 405 units. With the game ending in Period 50 and a 4-period lead time, any order placed now (Period 47) will arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends). Therefore, I am focusing on using the existing pipeline to meet remaining demand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 31 (covering the stable regime from Period 16 to 46) to reflect the current demand profile, while the OR engine's logic will naturally minimize new orders given the large pipeline and remaining time.

Daily Profit: $388.00, Daily Holding Cost: $15.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $373.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The game ends after Period 50 arrivals/demand. Orders placed in Period 48 will arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4), which is AFTER the game ends. Orders placed in Period 47 will arrive in Period 51. Therefore, no orders placed now or in the remaining periods will arrive in time to satisfy demand or impact the score positively; they would only contribute to pipeline inventory without being sold. Current on-hand is 15 units. Expected arrivals: Period 48 (order from P44: 73 units), Period 49 (order from P45: 117 units), and Period 50 (order from P46: 103 units). Total available for the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50) will be 15 + 73 + 117 + 103 = 308 units. Given the stabilized average demand of ~78 units (N=32 since Period 16), 308 units safely cover the expected ~234 units of demand for the final three periods. Consequently, I am setting L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to minimize further ordering while maintaining a valid parameter structure. Note: The OR backend 'cap' and 'base_stock' logic will effectively zero out orders when pipeline inventory is high relative to the forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 16-47 average demand is 77.9 units (N=32), confirming sustained lower volume compared to the first 15 periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49, with only Period 50 remaining in the game. Current available evidence confirms a stable demand regime since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 77.9 units and moderate volatility. Historical lead time has been consistently 4 periods. My primary goal in Period 49 is to set parameters that provide sufficient safety stock for the final period (Period 50) while acknowledging that inventory arrives after the decision phase. Since any order placed now (Period 49) with a 4-period lead time will arrive in Period 53, and the game ends at Period 50, placing a large order is not beneficial. However, the OR backend utilizes the mu_hat and sigma_hat to determine the 'base stock' levels against which it compares current pipeline inventory. To ensure we have enough stock on hand from existing in-transit shipments to cover the final period's demand without over-ordering or risking a stockout from what is already coming, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable regime since Period 16 (N=33). L remains the promised 4 periods.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 50, the final decision period. My objective is to provide OR parameters that maximize the service level for any remaining demand while minimizing the risk of excessive holding costs, although the game ends after this period. The demand regime has remained stable since Period 16, with an average of approximately 78 units. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=34 (covering Period 16 to Period 49) captures this lower-volume, moderate-volatility environment accurately. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is been observed throughout the history.
