Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have zero on-hand inventory and zero in-transit units. Promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since there is no historical data yet beyond the initial demand samples provided (P1-P5), I will use all 5 available samples to estimate demand parameters. The average demand across these 5 periods is 145.4 units, with a standard deviation of 40.57. Because the OR backend defines mu_hat as (1+L) * mean and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L) * std, setting the methods to 'recent_N' with N=5 will use these 5 sampled data points correctly. Given the promised lead time L=4, the system will aim to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 212 units was placed with a promised lead time (L) of 4. At the start of Period 2, on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order is still in transit (it is expected to arrive during the 'arrival resolution phase' of Period 5 and be visible in the Period 6 decision phase). The demand in Period 1 was 134, which could not be met, resulting in 0 sales. The historical data (Periods 1-5 provided in data, plus the actual observed Period 1 demand of 134) shows demand ranging from 115 to 216. The average of the provided samples (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) plus Period 1 actual (134) is approximately 143.5. Given we are in the very early stage of the game (Period 2) and have no observed lead time 'conclude' messages yet, I will stick with the promised lead time and used the recent samples to estimate demand across the review and lead period (1+L = 5 periods). Since we have 6 samples (5 historical + 1 actual), I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to establish a baseline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (212 units) and Period 2 (204 units) are currently 'In-transit' (Total: 416). As per the timing mechanics, an order with L=4 placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Consequently, we have had 0 inventory for Periods 1 and 2, resulting in lost sales. Historical demand data shows values of 216, 129, 138, 129, and 115 across various periods, but the 'conclude' messages for P1 and P2 show demand was 134 and 195 respectively. Given we have no confirmed lead-time arrivals yet (it's too early), I will stick to the 'default' lead time of 4. For demand, the average of the 5 historical samples is 145.4, and the average of the P1 and P2 observation is 164.5. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture a broader average while acknowledging variability.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory and 0 sales for Periods 1-3 despite significant demand (avg ~153 units/period). Our current in-transit inventory is 622 units (orders from P1, P2, and P3). For Period 4, the OR backend needs to set a base stock that covers demand for the lead time (4) plus the review period (1), totaling 5 periods. Using all 5 historical demand samples (including pre-game data: 216, 129, 138, 129, 115), the mean is 145.4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent history while maintaining a stable forecast, as no clear seasonal trend or regime shift is yet visible beyond the initial noise. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4) * 145.4 = 727.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (212 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. Since arrivals happen AFTER our decision, we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost all demand from Periods 1-4. The in-transit inventory is 762 (orders from P1: 212, P2: 204, P3: 206, P4: 140). Historical demand for Periods 1-4 was 134, 195, 130, and 163 (average ~155). The provided sample data (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) shows a slightly different distribution but similar average (~145). I will use the actual game history demand for the most recent 4 periods to set mu_hat, as it reflects the current environment. I'll stick to the promised lead time (L=4) for now as no orders have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $538.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived at the start of Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4). Demand for the first 5 periods has been [134, 195, 130, 163, 150], with a mean of 154.4 and a standard deviation of 25.1. The current on-hand inventory is 62 units, and there are 623 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2-5). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The pipeline is healthy, but we must maintain the base stock levels. I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the initial behavior of this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $449.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have confirmed a lead time (L) of 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 1 order in Period 5 and the Period 2 order in Period 6. Currently, we have 123 units on-hand and 556 units in-transit. The demand history across 6 periods (134, 195, 130, 163, 150, 143) shows a mean of approximately 152.5. Since the demand appears relatively stable without a clear trend or seasonal spike visible in the first 6 data points, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current regime average for mu_hat. Given L=4, the backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4) * 152.5 = 762.5. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the observed volatility (standard deviation ~23.3) adjusted for the lead time duration. This approach ensures we maintain enough pipeline inventory to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the confirmed 4-period arrival delay.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met for orders from P1, P2, and P3, which arrived in P5, P6, and P7 respectively. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability (Mean \u2248 150, Std Dev \u2248 23). The current inventory state has 169 units on-hand and 479 in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. The existing pipeline (479) plus on-hand (169) totals 648 units, which covers approximately 4.3 periods of average demand (648/150). To maintain the target service level and account for the 5-period risk window, I will use recent_N for both demand and sigma to track the current stable regime (N=7 excludes the noisy P1 demand if needed, but here demand is consistent). Setting L to 'default' as the promised 4 periods is being honored.

Daily Reward (R_t): $316.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods based on concluding statements for orders from Periods 1 through 4. Demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the 8 periods of history, with observations ranging from 125 to 195 units. The mean demand across all 8 periods is 150 units, and the standard deviation is approximately 22 units. We have 184 units on-hand and 501 units in-transit (orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). Since the lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using all available data (N=8) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate as there are no clear regime shifts or seasonal signals yet in this early phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $443.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing the history from Period 1 to Period 9, the lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 9). Demand remains stable with a mean of 148.9 over the last 9 periods and a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. On-hand inventory is 117, and in-transit inventory is 536 units. The sum (653) comfortably covers the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (1+4=5 periods * ~149 = 745), though it is slightly below the target base stock. Given the stability of the demand and the reliability of the lead time (constant at 4), I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most accurate operational parameters since the stockouts resolved.

Daily Reward (R_t): $596.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 84 units with a steady demand trend. The carry-over insights and historical arrival data from Periods 5 through 10 confirm a stable lead time of exactly 4 periods. Since P6's order arrived in P10 (4 periods later), we expect P7's order of 129 units to arrive in P11 (the current round's arrival phase). Demand over the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 151 units per period (134, 195, 130, 163, 150, 143, 160, 125, 140, 170), with a standard deviation around 20. There are no clear seasonal shifts or regime changes visible in the first 10 periods. I will use recent_N to capture the slightly higher recent demand average (avg of last 10 is 151) compared to the very early samples. L is set to calculated as it aligns with the observed 4-period lead time.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 11. Current demand for 'chips(Regular)' is stable, showing no significant seasonal or trend shifts from Periods 1 to 11. The mean demand across these 11 periods is approximately 150.18 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 21.05. I will continue to use the default lead time (4 periods). For forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=11 to capture the full history of the demand regime and ensure the base stock calculation covers the (L+1) = 5 period lead time window appropriately. Pipeline inventory (583 units) plus current on-hand (71) is being monitored against the base stock targets calculated by the OR backend.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a noticeable decline, particularly in the most recent period (Period 12 demand was 82, compared to an average of ~145 in the preceding periods). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 12 perfectly matching the 4-period promised lead time. Inventory is currently healthy with 151 units on-hand and 557 units in-transit (covering orders from Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12). To account for the recent drop in demand and prevent overstocking while still respecting the underlying demand distribution, I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent downward trend while maintaining enough history to handle typical variance. L remains at the default promised lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 13 periods, though recent fluctuations are noted (Period 12 saw a drop to 82, then Period 13 rebounded to 147). The mean demand over the last 8-10 periods is approximately 135-140 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded shipments. My current inventory position (112 on-hand + 461 in-transit = 573 total) is high compared to the expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). At an average of 140 units/period, required stock is ~700, but with the high holding cost ($1.0) and moderate profit margin, the base stock policy will naturally moderate the ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the stable demand regime while filtering out the initial stock-out period noise. I'll maintain L at 'default' since the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The average demand across all periods is approximately 144.6. The most recent 5 periods (P10-P14) show an average of 140, while the full history (excluding the first 5 samples provided in the prompt) shows fairly stable demand around 140-150. I will use the recent N (N=14) to capture the overall historical mean since there are no clear regime shifts detected. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the conclude messages for P5 through P14. Total pipeline inventory is 512, which represents orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14 (181 + 136 + 12 + 183 = 512). This matches the 'In-transit' figure perfectly, confirming no lost orders. I will use default L (promised 4) and recent_N for mu and sigma to smooth out the noise from the slightly lower demand in Period 12.

Daily Reward (R_t): $569.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 15 periods. Calculating the mean demand from Period 1 to Period 15, we get approximately 147.2 units per period. The standard deviation over this same period is approximately 25.4. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P5-P15). Current inventory state: On-hand is 99, and In-transit is substantial (512 units). Historically, the last 4 orders (P12-15) were 136, 12, 183, and 181. The pipeline inventory of 512 matches the sum of orders from P12-P15 (136+12+183+181=512). Since the promised lead time of 4 matches the actual lead time, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, since there is no evidence of a recent regime shift or strong seasonality in the provided dates (which are generic labels), I will use 'default' to leverage all available historical data (P1-P15) to calculate parameters for the review+lead period (1+L = 5 periods).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival from Period 5 through Period 16 (orders from P1 to P12). Consequently, I will use the 'default' method for L. The demand history (Periods 1-16) shows a stable mean. While there were lower demand observations in Period 12 (82) and Period 16 (79), the overall average remains centered around 145. I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the full breadth of observed behavior post-startup while remaining sensitive to this stable regime. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during the lead time against the holding cost of ending inventory.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in all 13 arrivals (P1 through P13). Demand has shown a downward shift starting around Period 12. Prior to Period 12, demand averaged ~148 units; however, the average of the last 6 periods (P12-P17) is significantly lower at ~97 units. Given this sustained drop, I am using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adjust the base stock level to the new regime. I am maintaining L at default as it matches the observed 4-period lead time. Note: The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 603, which is quite high compared to the current low demand, so the OR backend will likely order a very small amount or zero to prevent overstocking as it reconciles with the lower forecasted demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: average decreased from ~148 to ~97 (-34%) over the last 6 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are observing a sustained decrease in demand that began around Period 12. From Period 1 to 11, the average demand was approximately 149 units. From Period 12 to 18, it dropped to an average of 95 units. The most recent 3 periods (16-18) show an even lower average of 66 units, indicating a possible further softening or a very low-demand regime. Current on-hand inventory (232) plus in-transit stock (420) totals 652 units, which is quite high relative to the recent demand of ~95. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and lower demand, I am using recent_N (N=7 to cover the lower demand period since P12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower mean and reduced volatility. This will allow the OR backend to set a lower base stock and avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level consistent with a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 12. Prior to Period 12, mean demand was approximately 148 units (P1-P11). From Period 12 to Period 19, the mean demand dropped to 87.6 units, with the last three periods (P17-P19) showing an even lower cluster (Avg=57). The carry-over insight from Period 18 correctly identified this downward trend. On-hand inventory is currently high (360 units) relative to recent demand, and there are 239 units in-transit (orders from P16 and P17). Since the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed, I will set L to 4. I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the lower demand regime since Period 12, allowing the OR backend to adjust our base stock downward to avoid excessive holding costs. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=8 to reflect the adjusted volatility in this new lower-demand state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-92.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. From Period 12 onwards, demand has noticeably dropped compared to the initial periods. Over the last 9 periods (P12-P20), the average demand is approximately 87.6 units, whereas the earlier periods averaged around 150 units. The carry-over insight correctly identified this shift. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (448 units) due to arrivals from previous high-volume orders (P14, P15, P16) coinciding with this lower demand phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent history. To prevent further inventory bloat and minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level for the new demand level, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture only the current lower-demand regime. The OR backend's capped policy will likely result in zero orders for this period given the high on-hand and in-transit stock relative to the new demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 confirmed: average stabilized at ~88 units (previously ~150) for 9 consecutive periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 12. Prior to Period 12, mean demand was approximately 148 units; from Period 12 to 21, the average demand has dropped to 87 units. The 'Carry-over Insights' confirmed this shift. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the most recent arrival (P17 order arrived in P21). Currently, on-hand inventory is quite high (434 units) due to larger orders placed before the demand drop fully stabilized. To prevent further excess inventory and high holding costs, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=10 (covering the lower demand period starting from P12) to reflect the new, lower demand mean. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 10 periods to capture current volatility. This will allow the OR backend to stop ordering or order minimal amounts until the current surplus is consumed.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 12, dropping from an average of ~150 to a stabilized lower level. Over the last 11 periods (P12-P22), the average demand has been approximately 78 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods (as evidenced by P5-P21 arrivals). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (370 units) relative to recent demand, which covers more than 4 periods of future demand at the new lower rate. To prevent further unnecessary building of holding costs while ensuring service levels, I will align mu_hat with this recent demand regime (N=11) and use the calculate method for lead time as it is stable. The sigma_hat will also be calculated based on this recent regime to reflect the current volatility.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 12. Since then, demand has stabilized at a lower level. Specifically, from Period 12 to 23 (12 samples), the average demand is approximately 79.92 units per period (compared to ~150 previously). Recent demand (Periods 17-23) averaged 69.4 units. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this lower regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P17 arrived P21; P18, P19, and P20 had 0 orders, explaining the 'arrived=0' in P22 and P23). The current high on-hand inventory (302) and pipeline (181) reflect older, larger orders; setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower demand will allow the OR backend to naturally stop ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 12, dropping from a historical average of ~150 to a localized average of ~88. Periods 22-24 show slightly higher values (64, 68, 102), but the trend remains significantly lower than the pre-Period 12 levels. To avoid over-ordering and minimize holding costs relative to this lower demand while maintaining a high service level, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering Periods 12-24). This focuses the forecast on the current demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (Periods 5-21), so I will use the 'default' method (promised lead time). Although arrivals for the most recent periods (22-24) have not occurred yet, this is consistent with the 4-period lead time (orders from Period 18-20 were 0, so no arrivals were expected in P22-P24). The on-hand inventory of 200 units plus the 236 in-transit units provides sufficient coverage for the expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime. After the initial drop at Period 12, the last 14 periods (P12-P25) have an average demand of approximately 92.2 units, but more recently (P21-P25), demand has seen a slight uptick to 86.6. I will use N=14 to capture the stability of this post-drop regime while smoothing out the recent variability. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P21 order arrived in P25). My parameters (L=4, N=14) aim to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period lead-time cycle (L+1) while adapting to the current, lower demand level compared to the start of the game. On-hand inventory is decreasing toward the target levels after the overstock in Periods 19-21.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift around Period 12, dropping from an average of ~150 to ~88. However, recent demand (Periods 24-26) shows higher volatility and slightly higher levels (102, 123, 72), suggesting a possible stabilization or slight recovery. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Periods 18, 19, and 20 had zero orders due to high inventory, we are now clearing out that excess. I will use a recent window of 15 periods (N=15) to capture the lower post-shift average while allowing for recent variability to influence sigma_hat. This balances the lower mean demand against the risk of stockouts during the current replacement cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high variability recently. After a confirmed regime shift down to ~88 units at Period 12, subsequent periods have seen fluctuations: Period 24 (102 demand) and Period 25 (123 demand) suggested a possible upward shift, but Period 26 (72) and Period 27 (59) demand were much lower. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P18-P27) is approximately 81 units, while the average over the last 5 periods (P23-P27) is 84.8 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by arrivals from P21, P22, and P23 all having an actual lead time of 4. On-hand inventory is 127 and in-transit is 353 (total 480). To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining service levels during this erratic phase, I will use a recent window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. N=10 captures the post-Period 12 regime while including the recent volatility.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 12, with a mean of approximately 83 units over the last 17 periods (P12-P28) and a similar mean of 82 units over the most recent 10 periods. The promised lead time (L=4) is consistently observed across the history, with the most recent arrival in Period 28 confirming L=4. Given the current on-hand inventory (78) and pipeline (298), we need to ensure the total inventory covers the next 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=17 to capture the demand mean and standard deviation of this stable lower regime, which provides a more accurate forecast than the full history while maintaining a sufficient sample size for variance estimation. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that minimizes holding costs while maintaining a service level consistent with a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1 (z* approx 0.84).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 12, dropping from a historical mean of ~148 to a new, lower mean. Analyzing the last 18 periods (Period 12-29), the average demand is approximately 84.6 units per period. Recent periods (last 5) show a slightly higher but still stable mean of 90.2. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 25-29). Currently, on-hand inventory is 88 and in-transit is 348. The pipeline inventory (436) is sufficient to cover about 5 periods of demand at the current rate (85-90 units). I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat starting from the regime shift (N=18) to ensure the OR backend uses the lower demand profile for its base stock calculation while maintaining enough stock for the observed volatility. L is set to calculated as lead times have been consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Period 12 onwards) shows a sustained lower regime. While the carry-over insight noted an average of ~88 units, the demand since Period 24 has shown higher volatility and a slightly higher average, with values like 102, 123, 72, 59, 104, 93, 59. The mean of the last 10 periods (P21-P30) is approximately 84 units, but focusing on the most recent 5 periods (P26-P30) gives an average of ~77.4. Given the mix of higher (104) and lower (59) demand recently, using a recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat provides a stable baseline for this lower regime while accounting for recent fluctuations. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P25, P26, P27, P28, P29, P30). The current in-transit (308) and on-hand (161) total 469. With a target base stock calculated by mu_hat ((1+L)*mean) and z*sigma_hat, our pipeline is relatively healthy, so we maintain parameters to match the lower stabilized demand regime.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 12. Analysis of the most recent 20 periods (Periods 12-31) shows an average demand of approximately 88.5 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple recent arrivals (P25, P26, P27). Currently, there is 80 units on-hand and 245 units in-transit (orders from P29, P30, and P31). Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent mean of ~88.5, the expected demand over the lead time is approximately 442 units. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 325 units, which is currently below the requirements for a high service level. I will use the recent 20 samples to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime while ensuring the OR engine accounts for the historical variance in this new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a sustained shift that began around Period 12. Prior to that, demand averaged ~148, but over the last 20 periods (Periods 13-32), the mean has stabilized around 88.5 units. Current Period 32 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout (80 sold vs 108 demand), primarily because no shipment arrived in Period 32 (orders from Period 28 were zero, so no delivery was expected). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. To respond to the current stockout and the stabilized demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower demand mean (~88) and its associated volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current consumption rate rather than the higher initial levels. L is set to default as the lead time has been reliably 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~88 units from Period 13 through Period 32, confirming the reduction from the initial ~150 average.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a structural shift around Period 12, dropping from an average of ~150 to ~88 units. Recent data (Periods 21-33) shows the mean has potentially trended slightly higher to around 94 units, but remains far below the initial levels. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 75 units with 388 units in-transit. A stockout occurred in Period 32 due to the Period 28 order of 0 units, which created a gap in the delivery pipeline. Recent demand volatility has also increased (max demand of 144 in P31). To recover from the delivery gap and account for the current demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=13, from Period 21 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized average and variance. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period observed history.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown more volatility recently, with the last five periods (P30-P34) showing demand values of 59, 144, 108, 78, and 66. While the 'regime shift' insight suggests a mean around 88, the increased variability (standard deviation) over the last 10 periods necessitates a more responsive forecast. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent variance while basing the mean on the post-shift period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P33 and P34). The current on-hand inventory plus in-transit stock (101 + 326 = 427) is being monitored to ensure it covers the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a structural shift around Period 12, dropping from ~150 to a lower average. Analysis of the last 20 periods (P16-P35) shows a mean daily demand of approximately 88.5 units. However, more recent volatility is evident, with several periods exceeding 100 units (P31: 144, P32: 108, P35: 100). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in P33 and P34 (orders from P29 and P30). The 'In-transit' quantity is currently 407, and on-hand is near zero (1 unit), suggesting we are heavily reliant on the incoming pipeline. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Using a recent_N of 20 periods for mu_hat captures the post-shift average while smoothing recent volatility. For sigma_hat, recent_N of 20 is also used to capture the variance associated with the new regime, including the recent spikes.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant shift around Period 12, dropping from an average of ~150 to a lower stable regime. Analysis of the last 24 periods (Period 13 to 36) shows a mean demand of approximately 88.5 units. Recent demand has fluctuated (35 units in Period 36, 100 units in Period 35, 66 units in Period 34, 78 units in Period 33), but the 88.5 average remains a solid anchor. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P33, P34, and P36). Current inventory status: On-hand (120) + In-transit (306) = 426 units. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock targets (1+L) periods of demand. With a target of roughly 5 * 88.5 = 442.5, current Pipeline Inventory of 426 is slightly below the required level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=24 to capture the stable lower demand regime since Period 13, and set L to 'default' (4), which aligns with observed performance.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower level since Period 13. Over the last 10 periods (P28-P37), the average demand is approximately 88.5 units, which is consistent with the previously identified regime shift from ~150 down to ~88. Lead times remain consistently at 4 periods, with the most recent arrival confirming this. Currently, there is 169 units on-hand and 257 in-transit. The in-transit inventory consists of orders from Period 34 (30 units), Period 35 (81 units), Period 36 (53 units), and Period 37 (93 units). I will continue using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the stabilized lower demand regime while filtering out the much higher initial demand from the first 12 periods. Lead time L is set to default, as the 4-period promised lead time is holding steady. This configuration balances the 80% service level requirement (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)) against holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $136.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term stabilization around 88-90 units starting from Period 12, as highlighted in previous carry-over insights. Recent demand (last 6 periods from P33-P38) averages 73 units, with a notable dip in P36 (35 units). This indicates a possible further softening or simply higher variance in the underlying regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P34 order arrived in P38). With 132 units on hand and 264 in-transit (orders from P35-P38), the current pipeline is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 periods of demand at current rates. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the stabilized lower regime since P12, and 'recent_N' with N=10 for sigma_hat to better reflect the recent volatility while maintaining the lead time at 'calculate' to incorporate all historical data confirming the 4-period fulfillment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $267.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 12, decreasing from an average of ~150 to a historical average of ~88 units. Over the most recent 10-period window (P30-P39), the average demand is 84.6 units with a standard deviation of 30.6. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current inventory status: On-hand (117) + In-transit (258) = 375 total units. Given L=4, the base stock policy aims to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 10-period mean (84.6 * 5 = 423), the system is slightly under the target stock level, though heavily padded by in-transit units. To handle the observed volatility (sigma) while respecting the lower average demand regime, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to prioritize the current stabilized demand level for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'calculate' for the lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period observations.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since approximately Period 13. Over the last 10 periods (P31-P40), the mean demand is approximately 88.6 units, which is consistent with the previously identified shift from the initial ~150 average. Lead times have remained remarkably consistent at exactly 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 71 units with 311 units in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40). The total pipeline plus on-hand is 382 units. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the older, higher demand data. Setting L to default (4) as the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised value.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 13, with an average of approximately 85-90 units per period. In the most recent 10 periods (P32-P41), the average demand is 81.3 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods, as seen in the recent arrival of the Period 37 order in Period 41. Currently, there is 85 units on-hand and 335 units in-transit (orders from Periods 38, 39, 40, and 41). The total pipeline inventory (On-hand + In-transit) is 420. Given a lead time of 4, the target base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) at an average of 85 units would be roughly 425 units. Considering the high service level required (Profit=4, Holding=1 implies a 80% critical ratio), the current pipeline is very close to the requirement. To ensure the OR backend captures the most relevant demand frequency, I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the promised lead time L=4 via the default method.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 12 tracking a lower mean. Over the last 10 periods (P33-P42), the average demand is approximately 80 units, reflecting a stabilization after the previously noted decline. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages (P37 and P38 arrivals). Current on-hand inventory is 36, with 330 units in-transit. The OR backend needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 will capture the current stabilized regime while excluding the higher demand from the start of the game. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during the current period against the costs of holding excess inventory for a mature, lower-demand SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~80 units from Period 33 through Period 42, confirming a slight further reduction from the previous ~88 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $164.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime. Looking at the last 11 periods (P33-P43), the average demand is 76.7 units per period, consistently lower than the previous ~88 average. The lead time remains steady at 4 periods (P39 order arrived in P43, lead time 4). The current on-hand inventory is 56, and there are 327 units in-transit. The in-transit units are from orders in P40 (106), P41 (117), P42 (32), and P43 (72). We expect P40's order (106 units) to arrive in Period 44. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this lower demand period, I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the latest demand mean (approx. 77) and volatility. This helps the OR backend adjust the base stock downward to match the current sales velocity.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~77 units from Period 33 through Period 43, indicating a slight further reduction from the previous ~80 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $213.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 33, demand has averaged approximately 76.5 units per period (sum of demand P33-P44 is 918, divided by 12 periods). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 87 units and in-transit is 265 units. The total pipeline is 352 units, which covers nearly 4.6 periods of current demand. To maintain the stock level relative to the current 4-period lead time (needing to cover L+1 = 5 periods), I will use the recent 12-period window (N=12) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting this stable, lower demand environment. This ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant mean and variance for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~77 units from Period 33 through Period 44 (avg 76.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the recent 13 periods (Period 33-45) following a transition from higher consumption. The average demand in this stable regime is approximately 77 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 156 units, with 220 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods (approximately 385 units). Total current inventory (156 on-hand + 220 in-transit) is 376, which is aligned with the expected 5-period demand. To maintain this balance and account for volatility, I will use the recent 13-period regime to calculate the mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects the most current demand patterns while the OR backend manages the ordering cap and service level.

The most recent demand (Period 46) was 119, which is a spike, but recent history (last 14 periods) shows a mean of ~78. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of shipments from Periods 38-42. Currently, there are 69 units on-hand and 227 units in-transit (orders from Periods 43, 44, 45, and 46). A lead time of 4 implies we must cover demand for the current period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use recent_N with N=14 to capture the stable demand mean and variance since the last major regime shift identified around Period 33.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime for regular chips remains stable, around 75-80 units per period. The average demand from Period 33 to Period 47 is approximately 76.6 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 54 and in-transit units at 271, the pipeline is full. The game ends at Period 50. Orders placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (48+4), which is after the simulation ends. Consequently, these orders will never contribute to revenue but could incur holding costs if they were to contribute to end-of-game inventory valuation (though usually they are just 'sunk' costs or ignored depending on specific scoring). However, my objective is to set parameters that represent the current state. I will use a recent_N of 15 for mu_hat to capture the stability seen since Period 33, and stick to the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 33, demand has averaged approximately 77 units per period. Over the last 10 periods (P39-P48), the average is approximately 84 units, though several recent periods (P46, P47, P48) have seen higher demand (119, 87, 90). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 8 units on-hand and 338 units in-transit, there is significant pipeline inventory. However, at Period 49, we are nearing the end of the 50-period horizon. Decisions at this stage primarily affect terminal inventory. I am using a recent window of N=16 (from Period 33 onwards) to capture the current stable demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 33 through Period 48 has averaged 80.6 units, showing slight volatility but remaining significantly lower than the pre-Period 12 levels (~150).

Daily Reward (R_t): $255.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we review the demand regime and lead time consistency. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on historical data (e.g., Period 49 saw the arrival of the Period 45 order). Demand has been in a stabilized low-demand regime since Period 13, with a secondary slight shift identified around Period 33. Over the last 17 periods (Period 33 to 49), demand has averaged approximately 78.6 units. To capture this sustained regime accurately while allowing for recent variability (latest sample was 67, but Period 46 was 119), I am using a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=17. This length covers the entire current stable regime. For sigma_hat, I also use N=17 to capture the volatility specific to this lower-demand period. Setting L to 'default' uses the promised 4 periods, which aligns with observed arrival patterns.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 33 through Period 49 has averaged 78.6 units, maintaining a stable but slightly lower average than the Period 13-32 window (~88).
