Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical data yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The demand for the first 5 periods is provided (avg=145.4, std=39.9). Given the Lead Time (L=4), we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. mu_hat target should be roughly 145.4 * 5 = 727. sigma_hat target should be roughly 39.9 * sqrt(5) = 89.2. Since I only have 5 samples, I will use 'explicit' to set a conservative starting point based on the provided historical demand data.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 212 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, these units did not arrive in Period 1 (arrived=0), leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory. This led to lost sales as the demand was 134. Currently, 212 units are in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect these units to arrive until Period 5. For the OR parameters: 1) L is set to 'default' (4) as we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised one. 2) For mu_hat, we have very limited data (only 5 historical samples + 1 game period). The historical mean is roughly 145, and Period 1 demand was 134. I will use 'default' to capture the overall mean across the (1+L) = 5 period window. 3) For sigma_hat, I will also use 'default' to account for the observed volatility. The objective is to build up inventory to cover the long lead time while balancing the $1/unit holding cost against the $1/unit profit (which results in a target service level of 50%).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), we have no on-hand inventory and 416 units in transit (ordered in P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, 212 units were ordered, and in Period 2, 204 units were ordered. None have arrived yet, which is expected given the lead time. Total demand in P1 and P2 was 329 units, all of which were lost sales due to zero stock. The actual historical demand samples provided (P1: 216, P2: 129, P3: 138, P4: 129, P5: 115) suggest an average demand of approximately 145 units per period. However, the game history for P1 and P2 shows demand of 134 and 195 respectively. Given the promised lead time L=4, the coverage required is (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean of available historical samples (145.4), the target base stock would be roughly 727. Since we already have 416 in transit, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order. I will use 'default' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the most recent fluctuations.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Because arrivals occur during the 'arrival resolution phase' and are only reported in the 'conclude' message of the following period, we expect the order from Period 1 to arrive during Period 5 and be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no stock has arrived yet. Demand samples for Periods 1-3 were 134, 195, and 130 (mean ~153). However, the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' provided in the prompt (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) differs from the 'GAME HISTORY' demand logs. I will prioritize the 'GAME HISTORY' demand for current calculations. With a lead time (L) of 4, the demand window is (1+L) = 5 periods. Using the mean of the 3 observed periods (~153), the expected cycles demand is 765. I will use the default methods as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods, nor that the demand regime has shifted significantly from the initial observations.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (212 units) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 742 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4). No arrivals have been confirmed yet, which matches the expected lead time (L=4). Historical demand mean from the provided sequence (P1-P5: 216, 129, 138, 129, 115) is 145.4, but the observation history (P1-P4: 134, 195, 130, 163) shows a mean of 155.5. I will use all 5 available demand samples to establish a baseline. Given the 4-period lead time, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). L is set to default (4). mu_hat is set to default (mean of all samples * 5). sigma_hat is set to default to handle volatility based on the sample set.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (concluded), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods (5-1=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 62 units, with 538 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Historical demand across 5 periods shows values of 216, 129, 138, 129, and 115 (as per 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section), while the conclude messages report different demand values (134, 195, 130, 163, 150). I will prioritize the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' sample counts for statistical parameters. The mean demand is 145.4 and the standard deviation is 40.5. Since we only have 5 samples and no clear regime shift yet, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture all available data. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.5, though the backend formula uses it to determine service level), the OR backend will calculate a base stock. My L=4, mu_hat calculation is (1+4)*145.4 = 727, and sigma_hat is sqrt(5)*40.5 = 90.6.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms this: Period 1's order arrived in Period 5 (L=4) and Period 2's order arrived in Period 6 (L=4). Orders from Period 3, 4, 5, and 6 (totaling 506 units) are currently in-transit. On-hand inventory is 123. The demand samples for Period 1-6 are [134, 195, 130, 163, 150, 143], with a mean of 152.5. There is no significant seasonal signal or regime shift detected yet, as demand fluctuates around the mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent behavior while adhering to the 4-period lead time. Service level is balanced at 50% (profit $1 = holding $1), which is what the OR backend will calculate via q = 1/(1+1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed P1 arrival at P5 and P2 arrival at P6).

Daily Profit: $160.00, Daily Holding Cost: $156.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, and P3). The demand remains relatively stable with values between 130 and 195. The current on-hand inventory is 156, and there is a significant pipeline of 465 units (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). With a promised and confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. The mean demand across all history (including pre-game samples) is approximately 144 units per period (Mean of 216, 129, 138, 129, 115, 134, 195, 130, 163, 150, 143, 160 is 150). Looking at the more recent samples (P1-P7), the mean is 153. Using 'recent_N' with N=12 (all available samples) for demand effectively captures the volatility and mean without overreacting to the high pre-game Period_1 outlier. The backend will calculate base_stock based on the cost ratio (profit=1, holding=1, so q=0.5, z*=0). Our parameters aim to maintain a buffer that accounts for the 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-39.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. The lead time is confirmed to be exactly 4 periods based on order arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8 (matching the promised L=4). Historical demand across the first 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 150 units/period (134, 195, 130, 163, 150, 143, 160, 125). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality, as demand fluctuates within a standard range. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50% (q = 1 / (1+1)). This means our base stock level should focus on covering the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). Current on-hand is 164, and in-transit (representing orders from P5, P6, P7, P8) is 462. Total pipeline is 626. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using the mean of all 8 historical samples for mu_hat and the standard deviation of all 8 samples for sigma_hat provides the most stable estimate given the lack of clear trends.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (Periods 5-9) confirms an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods for all five completed deliveries. Current on-hand inventory is 32. In-transit inventory is 570 units (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). The demand history shows relative stability with no obvious seasonal shift yet, with a mean demand of approximately 144 units across the first 9 periods. Including the additional historical samples (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) provided in the prompt, the long-term mean is roughly 140. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~140, the required levels are about 700 units. Our current inventory position (On-hand 32 + In-transit 570 = 602) is slightly below this. I will use the 'default' lead time of 4 and use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the most recent demand behavior while smoothing out noise as we approach the mid-game.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed across all 6 arrivals to date (Orders from P1 to P6 arrived precisely at P5 to P10). Demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with historical samples ranging from 115 to 216. Since Period 1, the mean demand is approximately 144 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 34 units, with 541 units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) and 1 period for current demand resolution, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using all 10 available demand samples provides a robust mean (approximately 141) and standard deviation. The backend will calculate the base stock to target 5 periods of demand while balancing the $1.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost (implied service level of 50%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the conclude messages from Period 5 through Period 11 (orders from Periods 1-7 all arrived exactly 4 periods later). Current demand for 'chips(Regular)' appears stable, with samples ranging from 115 to 216 across the 11 observed periods. The mean demand of all available samples (including the seed data) is approximately 144.5 units per period. Since there are no distinct regime shifts or seasonal transitions apparent in the data yet, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the full recent history after the initial stock-out phase. The base stock calculation (L+1) addresses the lead time of 4 plus the current decision period. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the observed average lead time, which aligns with the promised 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The average demand over the last 12 periods is approximately 144 units, with a notable drop in Period 12 (82 units). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the inventory policy should be conservative to avoid excess stock. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed in historical conclude messages (P1-P8 orders all arrived exactly with L=4). Therefore, I will use L=4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), I'll use recent_N with N=12 to capture the full history since order arrivals began, which smooths out the recent low-demand outlier while accounting for the general 140-150 range. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=12 to reflect current volatility. This configuration targets a 50% service level as per the critical ratio q = 1/(1+1).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable, with a calculated mean of approximately 144.5 units over the last 13 periods. Although Period 12 showed a lower-than-average demand of 82 units, the subsequent Period 13 demand of 147 units suggests no sustained downward shift. Lead times have consistently confirmed the promised value of 4 periods (orders placed in Periods 1-9 arrived exactly after 4 periods). With the Profit ($1.0) equal to the Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, resulting in an optimal service level (z-score) of 0; thus, the OR engine will target the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). Current inventory position (On-hand 61 + In-transit 515 = 576) is below the expected requirements for 5 periods of mean demand (~725 units). I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time to maintain empirical accuracy and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=13 to capture all relevant game history while excluding the initial noisy sample seeds.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 14 periods, with no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonal spike. The mean demand across all observed periods (including the pre-game history) is approximately 143 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods, which aligns with the promised lead time. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 45 units and a healthy in-transit pipeline of 520 units. According to the lead-time sequence, the orders from Period 11 (171 units) should arrive during Period 15, Period 12 (147 units) in Period 16, and Period 13 (54 units) in Period 17. Setting L to default (4) and using all historical samples (recent_N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will provide a stable estimate of the (L+1) period demand requirement, allowing the OR backend to maintain the target base-stock level while managing the high holding cost (which equals the profit per unit).

Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has been stable across the historical samples and the 15 concluded periods. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages 139.4, which is consistent with the long-term average (approx. 144). Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P5 to P15). With an on-hand inventory of 49 and a pipeline of 513, the task is to maintain the base stock level calculated for (L+1) periods of demand. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5, which aligns with the OR engine's use of \u03bc\u0302 as the primary base stock component. I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand and lead time calculation to capture the most stable recent operational data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-38.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 140-150 units per period. The recent history (Periods 1-16) suggests a stable demand pattern without any clear seasonal or calendar-driven shifts. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 117, and in-transit is 522. We need to maintain a base stock that covers the next (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level q = 0.5, which leads the OR backend to set base_stock roughly at the mean demand over (L+1) periods. I will use a recent window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to remain responsive to any subtle drifts while smoothing out noise from recent low demand observations in Period 12 and 16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-73.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward trend over the last few periods (Periods 12-17), with demand values of 82, 147, 159, 167, 79, and 49 compared to earlier averages around 140-160. Specifically, the last two periods (Period 16 and 17) show a drop into the double digits. This suggests a potential regime change or seasonal drop. To avoid over-stocking and high holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this recent volatility and downward trend, while maintaining a buffer. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 122 and in-transit is 515 (consisting of orders from P14, P15, P16, and P17). Since L=4, the pipeline covers current and future periods. Setting L to default (4), mu_hat to recent_6, and sigma_hat to recent_6 allows the backend to adjust the order quantity downward based on the lower recent mean and higher recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16: demand dropped significantly (avg of P16-17 is 64 vs historical avg ~140).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-130.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. Analyzing the recent demands: P16 (79), P17 (49), and P18 (70), the mean is approximately 66, which is nearly 50% lower than the historical average of ~140. Using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will prioritize this new, lower demand level to avoid excessive holding costs, as Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), requiring a balanced stock position. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages (P14 arrived at P18 exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is currently high (200) relative to current demand, and there are 367 units in transit. By setting L to 'default' (which is the promised 4) and using recent_N=3 for demand statistics, the OR backend will calculate a lower base stock, effectively pausing or significantly reducing new orders until the inventory aligns with the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16: demand dropped from historical avg ~140 to ~66 (observed P16: 79, P17: 49, P18: 70).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) is 62.75 (79, 49, 70, 53), which is a sharp decline from the earlier historical average of ~140. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect this lower demand environment. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, which I will reflect using the 'calculate' method. Current on-hand inventory is 311 and in-transit is 203, totaling 514 units. Given the recent demand average, this pipeline is sufficient to cover approximately 8 periods of demand, which is well above the L+1=5 period target. The OR backend will likely order 0 units this period due to the high inventory levels relative to the new demand regime.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 20 (79, 49, 70, 53, 89), the average is now approximately 68 units/period, compared to the previous historical average of ~145. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 378 units and 47 units in-transit (ordered Period 17, lead time 4), totaling 425 units. Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At the current demand rate, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 340 units. Our current inventory position (425) already exceeds this requirement. To prevent further accumulation of excess inventory and minimize holding costs (which equal profit), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the lower demand regime and using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 persistent: avg decreased from ~145 to ~68 (-53%) over 5 periods (P16-P20).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, dropping from a historical average of approximately 145 units to roughly 69 units (average of P16-P21: 79, 49, 70, 53, 89, 76). This shift has persisted for 6 periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the recent arrival confirmation at Period 21. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (349 units) with zero units in-transit, as recent orders were suspended due to the inventory surplus. To align the OR backend with this lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (the length of the current regime). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current mean and volatility rather than the much higher historical levels, preventing unnecessary ordering while holding cost exceeds profit (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, decreasing from a historical average of approximately 145 to an average of 68.5 units per period over the last 7 periods (P16-P22). Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 285 units with zero in-transit, which is more than enough to cover the expected demand for the next lead time (L=4) plus current period (Total 5 periods), as 68.5 * 5 = 342.5. However, given the high holding cost (1.0) relative to profit (1.0), the backend needs to target a lower base stock to minimize residue. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=7) to reflect the new lower demand level. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=7) to account for the reduced volatility in this lower demand state. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. Prior to Period 16, the average demand was approximately 144 units per period. Since Period 16, the average demand has decreased to approximately 72 units per period (average of P16-P23: 79, 49, 70, 53, 89, 76, 64, 68). The current period is 24, giving us a regime length of 8 periods for this lower demand state. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals through Period 21. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 217 units, and 58 units are in-transit (ordered in Period 23). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5 (profit / (profit + holding)), meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (base stock \u2248 mu_hat). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 8 periods (N=8) to align the base stock with the current lower demand regime, preventing excessive overstocking while holding costs are relatively high compared to the margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-13.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift detected at Period 16 is now firmly established. From Period 16 to Period 24, average demand is approximately 72.2 units, a significant drop from the pre-Period 16 average of ~145. Recent demand in Period 24 was 102, which is slightly higher than the regime average but still well within the lower range compared to early history. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals up to Period 21. There are currently orders for 58 units (ordered P23) and 68 units (ordered P24) in-transit, totaling 126. With 115 units on-hand, the pipeline inventory is 241 units. To avoid overstocking while adjusting to this lower demand level and a high holding cost ($1.0), I will continue using recent_N (N=9, covering the shift) to forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the (1+L) horizon requirements based on the lower demand mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) experienced a drastic drop starting at Period 16, decreasing from a historical average of ~145 to approximately 68. However, recent demand (P24: 102, P25: 123) suggests the regime might be shifting again or returning toward the higher historical mean. I am currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) and the pipeline (226 units) consists of orders placed between P23 and P25 that are not yet due to arrive (promised lead time is 4 periods). The next scheduled arrival (P23 order) is expected during P27. Since the recent demand uptick is significant (two consecutive periods over 100), I will use the mean of the last 10 periods (P16-P25) to set mu_hat. This balances the low-demand trough with the recent recovery, resulting in an average of approximately 77.3 per period. Multiplied by (1+L) where L=4, this provides a mu_hat of ~386. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand (P24-P25) shows an uptick (avg 112.5) compared to the low-demand regime of P16-P23 (avg 67.8), suggesting a potential recovery from the previous downward shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift away from the low-demand regime (P16-P23, avg ~68). While the most recent period (P26) had a lower demand of 72, the preceding two periods (P24-P25) showed an uptick (avg 112.5). However, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory and have experienced a lost sales event in Period 25 and 26. The pipeline (341 units) consists of orders from P23-P26, and since actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, we expect the first of these (58 units) to arrive in Period 27 conclude (visible at P28 start). To avoid further stockouts, I am using a demand forecast that combines the whole history since the P16 drop to average out the recent volatility (N=11, covering P16-P26), which yields an average of ~81. This prevents overreacting to the P24-25 spike while staying above the previous lows. Sigma is calculated using the same window to capture this heightened volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased starting Period 24: P24 (102), P25 (123), P26 (72), representing a break from the stable low-demand regime (avg 68) of P16-P23.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a significant break from the low-demand regime (avg ~68) observed during P16-P23. Periods P24-P27 have had demands of 102, 123, 72, and 59, reflecting higher volatility and an average of 89. This suggests a recovery or shift towards the earlier historical levels (~140). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 327, comprising orders from P24 (68), P25 (100), P26 (115), and P27 (44). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stockout risk (on-hand is 0) and shifting demand, I am using a recent window (N=4) to capture the current volatile demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the need to respond to the recent uptick while acknowledging the volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high after the P16-P23 low-regime; avg demand for P24-P27 is 89 (+30% vs previous regime) with individual spikes up to 123.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted from a low-regime average of ~68 (P16-P23) to a more volatile and higher average (avg ~90 for P24-P28). The most recent demand at P28 was 104, confirming that the uptick is sustained. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand inventory has been 0 for 4 consecutive periods) because the pipeline inventory ordered during the low-demand regime was insufficient to cover the current recovery. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have a regime shift starting at Period 24, I will use N=5 (P24-P28) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the recent higher demand and higher volatility (range 59-123). This will raise the base stock level to better meet demand and prevent further lost sales during this recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P24-P28 average demand is 92.0, significantly higher than the P16-P23 average of 67.8 (+35%). Stockouts occurred from P25-P28 due to lagging inventory levels.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a recovery regime following the P16-P23 slump. Period 29 demand (93) aligns with the average of the last 6 periods (P24-P29 avg: 92.1). Prior stockouts from P25-P28 resulted from insufficient pipeline inventory during the transition, but the system is now catching up as seen by the arrival of 100 units in P29. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am setting L to 4 (default) and forecasting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this recovered demand level while filtering out the unrelated low-demand period. This should maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover arrivals across the (L+1) horizon while managing holding costs.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a low-demand regime (avg ~68, P16-P23) to a recovery/higher volatility regime. Over the last 7 periods (P24-P30), the average demand is 93.1. Recently, demand has shown some fluctuation (P29: 93, P30: 59), but the trend remains significantly higher than the previous low. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 63, and the pipeline is well-stocked with 339 units (orders from P27, P28, P29, P30). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=7, covering the recovery period) to capture this new average and a slightly larger N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed since Period 24.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery regime sustained: P24-P30 average demand is 93.1, a 37% increase over the P16-P23 low of 67.8. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a recovery regime following the low-demand period (P16-P23). Since Period 24, demand has averaged approximately 94.4 units per period (samples: 102, 123, 72, 59, 104, 93, 59, 144). Period 31 saw a significant spike to 144, resulting in a stockout (ending on-hand: 0). The most recent 8 periods (P24-P31) represent this new regime. Therefore, N=8 is used for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P27-P31), confirming the promised lead time holds. I will use the recent_N method to capture the recovery average while accounting for the increased volatility seen in recent spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a recovery following a low-demand regime (P16-P23). Since Period 24, we've entered a higher-demand recovery regime. Specifically, the average demand from Period 24 to Period 32 is approximately 97 units per period. Recent periods show significant volatility (P31: 144, P32: 108), necessitating a focus on this most recent historical window. I am using a recent_N of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recovery regime's mean (approx 97) and its increased variance compared to the stable low-demand period. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical arrival messages (P27, P28, P29, P30, P31, P32 arrivals all confirm L=4). Pipeline inventory is healthy (355 units), while on-hand is low (10 units), so OR parameters must ensure the total pipeline covers the lead-time demand window (~500 units total safety/base stock) without over-ordering as units from P29-P32 start arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery regime (P24-P32) average established at 97.1 units, with significantly higher volatility compared to the P16-P23 regime (avg 67.8). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a recovery regime following the Period 16-23 slump. Data from Period 24 to Period 33 show an average demand of approximately 95 units per period, albeit with higher volatility (ranging from 59 to 144). Lead time is confirmed and consistent at 4 periods (as evidenced by arrivals in P27-P33 matching orders from P23-P29). Therefore, I am aligning the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) with this recent 10-period regime (P24-P33) to ensure the base stock levels reflect the current higher consumption rate and volatility. The lead time parameter L remains at the default promised value of 4, which matches observed history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues in the recovery regime that began around Period 24. While Period 33-34 showed slightly lower demand (78 and 66 units), the overall average since Period 24 remains approximately 93.8 units per period, which is significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime (68 units). I am using recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat to capture this recovery period (P24-P34). Volatility has remained elevated compared to the stable low-demand period, so I am also using recent_N (N=11) for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for this increased variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., Period 30 order arriving at Period 34). The current on-hand inventory is 43, with 362 units in-transit. The recent orders are scheduled to arrive in the coming periods (Periods 35-38), so the parameters must maintain a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period to avoid further stockouts seen in the earlier phase of this regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a recovery regime that began around Period 24. While the average for the recovery period (P24-P35) is approximately 95 units, recent volatility remains high with demand fluctuating between 59 and 144. In Period 35, there was a stockout (demand 100, sold 79), and on-hand inventory is currently 0. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P31 order arriving in P35). To properly cover the 5-period risk window (Lead time + Review period) and account for recent volatility, I will use a recent_N lookback of 12 periods (P24-P35) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend captures the 'recovery' mean and the increased standard deviation observed since the regime shift, preventing further stockouts while balancing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-72.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows high volatility. Following a recovery from a low-demand period (P16-P23), demand has fluctuated significantly, with the last period (P36) dropping to 35 units, while P31 saw 144 units. The average demand for the 'recovery regime' (P24-P36) is approximately 89 units. I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=13 to capture this regime accurately. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, which means the OR backend aims for the median demand over the protection interval. However, because demand has been erratic, I will use a slightly larger N for sigma_hat (N=13) to ensure the backend captures the recent increase in variance. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a recovery regime that began at Period 24. For the most recent 14 periods (P24-P37), the average demand is 88.3 units, but the volatility is notably high (std ~30). Recent demand has fluctuated between 35 and 144. In Period 37, demand was 93, and on-hand inventory ended at 129 with 218 units in-transit. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. I am choosing N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of this recovery regime while smoothing out the high period-to-period variance. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level sufficient to cover the (L+1) horizon of 5 periods, addressing both the increased average and the volatility compared to the previous low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-64.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31-P38) shows high volatility with values ranging from 35 to 144, averaging approximately 81.5. This is slightly lower than the 'recovery regime' average of 97.1 identified in Period 33, but still remains well above the P16-P23 low of 67.8. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with orders consistently arriving as scheduled. Given the high volatility (sigma is significant), using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the most recent fluctuations) allows the OR backend to adjust to the current mean while maintaining safety stock for the high variance observed. On-hand plus in-transit (131+244=375) is currently healthy relative to lead-time demand, so maintaining a steady base stock calculation is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reside in the recovery regime that began at Period 24. For the most recent 16 periods (P24-P39), the average demand is approximately 89 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. The current on-hand inventory is 89 units, and there are 247 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level is 50%, which naturally aligns the base stock near the mean demand over the lead time plus review period (1+L = 5 periods). Since the demand has stabilized in this range for 16 periods, I am using recent_N with N=16 to capture this current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the older, high-demand or low-demand periods. This helps the backend set a base stock that covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current average rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 is sustained through Period 39: average demand is 89.2 units with standard deviation of 27.2 (P24-P39). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 72 and in-transit is 267 (total pipeline 339). To determine parameters, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (the length of the current regime from P24 to P40) to focus on the stabilized demand recovering from the P16-P23 dip. These parameters will provide the OR backend with a forecast based on the current higher-volatility recovery phase while maintaining the 4-period lead time expectation.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 24 remains stable, characterized by an average demand of approximately 89.2 units with a standard deviation of 27.2. Recent observations (P36-P41) show demands of 35, 93, 67, 96, 99, 79, which align with this recovery regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 6 and in-transit at 356, the total pipeline is 362. The OR backend needs to cover demand over (L+1) periods (5 periods). Using recent_N with N=18 (from P24 to P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the current mean (~89) and volatility, ensuring the base stock calculation accurately reflects the higher demand compared to the P16-P23 slump.

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a recovery regime that began at Period 24.

Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 38 order in Period 42. Current on-hand inventory is low (15 units) but with 338 units in-transit, including 57 units from Period 39 expected to arrive in Period 43. I am using recent_N (N=19) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime and L=default (4 periods).

The demand regime remains within the 'recovery' pattern identified since Period 24. For the most recent 20 periods (P24-P43), the average demand is approximately 89.2 units per period with a standard deviation of 26.6. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the Period 43 conclude message showing a P39 order arriving with a 4-period lead time). With 17 units on-hand and 366 units in-transit (P40, P41, P42, P43 orders), the pipeline inventory is relatively healthy.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a regime that began around Period 24. For the period P24\u2013P44, the average demand is approximately 87.8 units with a standard deviation of 25.1. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 40's order at the end of Period 44. Currently, we have 44 units on-hand and 311 units in-transit (orders from P41, P42, P43, and P44). Given that the game ends at Period 50, and the lead time is 4 periods, orders placed now (P45) will arrive in P49 resolution, leaving only P49 and P50 to sell them. We must avoid over-ordering at the end of the game to minimize holding costs, but also ensure enough inventory to cover the remaining periods. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=21 (P24\u2013P44) to capture the current regime characteristics accurately. L remains at the promised/observed 4.

The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 41 order exactly 4 periods later in Period 45. Currently, on-hand inventory is 98 and in-transit is 281, providing a solid pipeline (~76 units/period coverage).

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 24 remains the most relevant for forecasting. Since Period 24, the average demand has been approximately 89.2 units. Recent demand (P40-P46) shows some fluctuation (avg ~78), with Period 46 showing a significant spike to 119 units, indicating that the volatility noted in carry-over insights persists. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals (P42 order arrived in P46). To capture the current demand level while accounting for the high volatility and the recent spike, I will use recent_N with N=23 (covering the start of the current regime at P24 to the present at P46). This N is chosen to include enough samples to estimate variance accurately in this high-volatility environment while ignoring the earlier low-demand and high-demand regimes. The current inventory position (On-hand: 56, In-transit: 204) is being monitored; 204 units are in the pipeline, which aligns with 4 periods of demand at the current average, meaning no dramatic over-ordering is required, just maintenance of the base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 24) remains relatively stable. Analyzing demand from P24-P47, the mean is approximately 88.6 with a standard deviation around 26.5. In the most recent 10 periods (P38-P47), the mean is slightly lower at 81.7. Given the impending end of the simulation (Period 48 of 50), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window (N=10) to reflect the current pace while ensuring the backend's base-stock calculation accounts for the 4-period lead time. Order arrivals are consistent with the promised 4-period lead time; the last observed arrival (P47) was ordered on P43. On-hand inventory is 54, and in-transit is 248 (orders from P44, P45, P46, P47). Pipeline inventory is sufficient to cover expected demand for the remaining periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. Period 50 is the final period. The demand regime starting around Period 24 has remained relatively stable, with an average demand of approximately 88.5 units and a standard deviation of 22.8 over the last 25 periods (P24-P48). In the last 10 periods (P39-P48), the average is 83.5. On-hand inventory is low (11 units), but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline (305 units). Specifically, orders from P45 (72 units), P47 (129 units), and P48 (104 units) are expected to arrive in future periods. Since P50 is the final period, the OR backend's order for P49 will arrive in Period P53 (due to L=4), which is beyond the game's horizon. However, the OR backend logic still requires parameters to calculate the base stock for the current period's order. I will use the established recent regime (N=25) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the system targets a base stock that accounts for the current inventory position. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a recovery regime that began around Period 24. For the most recent 26 periods (P24-P49), the average demand is 86.3 units. The lead time remains consistently observed at 4 periods. Current inventory levels (on-hand 16 + in-transit 345) reflect a high pipeline, however, to maintain the desired service level in this higher-demand regime and account for recent volatility (std dev ~24 for the last 26 periods), I will use the recent_N method based on the recovery regime length. N is set to 26 (P24-P49) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and variance accurately. L is set to default (4 periods).
