Since arrivals happen after the decision phase, an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5 (1 + 4) and be usable for Period 5's demand, appearing in 'Period 5 conclude'. Therefore, we need to cover demand for Periods 1 through 5 (L+1 periods) to ensure stock availability once the shipment arrives. Historical data shows demand for Periods 1-5 as 131, 92, 118, 125, and 106, respectively. The average demand per period is ~114 (Total 572). Since there is zero current inventory and a high holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4), I will aim to cover this initial 5-period window and include a small safety buffer to account for variance observed in the history.",

Historical demand for the first 5 samples averaged ~114 units, while the actual Period 1 demand was 86 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 600 units in-transit. Since demand is roughly 100-120 units per period and the lead time is approximately 4-5 periods (requiring coverage for periods 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), our pipeline target should be around 500-650 units. With 600 units already in-transit, we have sufficient cover for the immediate lead time window.

In-transit: 470 units (110 from P42 arriving P46, 110 from P43 arriving P47, 140 from P44 arriving P48, 110 from P45 arriving P49). Total Pipeline + On-hand = 555 units. Expected demand for the 5 remaining periods (46-50) at a mean of 110 is 550 units. Therefore, the current inventory and in-transit units are sufficient to cover the game duration. Ordering more would likely end up as ending inventory, incurring unnecessary holding costs without contributing to profit, especially since any order placed now (P46) would arrive at the start of Period 51 (after the game ends).",

Since the lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods, any order placed in Period 47 will arrive during Period 51 ('Period 51 arrival resolution'), which is after the game concludes. Therefore, we will never see or sell the inventory from a Period 47 order. To maximize profit, we should minimize holding costs and stop ordering. The current pipeline (In-transit: 360 units) contains orders placed in Period 43 (110 units), Period 44 (140 units), and Period 45 (110 units). These will arrive in Period 47, 48, and 49 respectively, which is sufficient to meet the average demand of ~105-110 units per period for the remaining 4 periods (47, 48, 49, 50). Adding more orders will only potentially increase ending inventory and holding costs without any benefit to sales.",

Orders placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4), which is beyond the game's end. Similarly, orders placed in Period 47 would arrive in Period 51. Therefore, no new orders placed from Period 47 onwards can impact the total units sold. My current inventory position includes 97 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 250 units (ordered in Periods 44, 45). The expected arrivals are: Period 48 (140 units from P44) and Period 49 (110 units from P45). This creates a total available inventory of approximately 347 units (97 + 140 + 110) for the final three periods (48, 49, 50). Given the stable demand regime of ~100-110 units/period, this is more than sufficient to cover the remaining demand.

Based on the 4-period lead time, the Period 45 order will arrive during Period 49's arrival phase, becoming available to satisfy demand for the remainder of Period 49 and Period 50. Since the game ends after Period 50, any order placed now (Period 49) would not arrive until Period 53, which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, we should place an order of 0 to avoid unnecessary costs and focus on depleting the existing inventory and the final incoming shipment. The demand regime has stabilized around 100-110 units.

For this period, the goal is to maximize total reward, which includes profit from units sold in this period minus the holding cost for any ending inventory. Any inventory remaining at the end of Period 50 will incur a holding cost but will not have a subsequent period to be sold or held. Therefore, the optimal action in the final period of a finite-horizon inventory problem with no salvage value and positive holding costs is to place an order of zero. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of ~107 units. With 170 units currently on-hand, we have more than enough stock to cover the expected demand for this final period without incurring additional purchasing or future holding costs from new orders. Orders placed now would arrive in Period 54 (due to the 4-period lead time) and thus would never be available for sale within the game's duration.",
