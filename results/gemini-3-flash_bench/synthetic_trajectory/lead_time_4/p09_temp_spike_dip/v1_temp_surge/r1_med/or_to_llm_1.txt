The OR recommendation of 141 units effectively covers roughly 1.25x the historical average demand, which is a sensible starting point given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. $4.0 profit.

Currently, on-hand + in-transit = 281. Adding the OR recommendation of 144 brings the total cover to 425 units.

Our pipeline is 566. OR thinks we are overstocked relative to the safety stock level. However, we have been stocking out (sold=0) because no inventory has arrived yet.

Since demand resolution occurs after arrivals, the P2 order (140 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P6), bringing available stock to 175, which should cover the expected demand of ~110. 4. Strategic Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 63 units aims to maintain the base stock level considering a 4-period lead time. However, the pipeline is currently very full (475 units) compared to the average demand over a 5-period horizon (L+1 = 5 periods * 110 = 550 units).

Orders placed after P46 will not arrive before the game ends. Current inventory (151) + Arrivals (215 + 100 + 100) = 566 units available to cover demand for P45, P46, P47, P48, P49, and P50.

My analysis of the current state: On-hand inventory is 275 units, and in-transit inventory is 300 units (100 ordered Period 42, 100 ordered Period 43, 100 ordered Period 45). The next arrival should be the 100 units from Period 42 (due to arrive in Period 46, becoming visible in P47). The total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 575 units. The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The demand regime has returned to a baseline of approximately 100-110 units per period (Avg P41-P45: 99.8 units). Applying a (L+1) = 5 period horizon for demand coverage, we need approximately 500-550 units to meet demand and safety stock requirements. Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive in time to resolve (Period 46 order arrives Period 50). Therefore, this is the final order that can impact sales. With 575 units already in the system and 4 periods remaining (P47, P48, P49, P50), and expected demand around 100/period, we are already overstocked.
