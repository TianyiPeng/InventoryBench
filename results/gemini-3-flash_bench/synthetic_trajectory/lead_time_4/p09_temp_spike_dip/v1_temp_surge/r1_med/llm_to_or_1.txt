Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no lead-time history yet, I will use the 'default' method for L (promised L=4). For demand parameters, I have 5 initial samples (131, 92, 118, 125, 106). The mean of these samples is 114.4 and the standard deviation is 15.34. To ensure we have enough stock covering the review period plus lead time (1 + 4 = 5 periods), the backend will calculate the base stock. Using the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat will base the order on all available samples, which is appropriate at this early stage before any real-time demand or lead-time variance is observed.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 141 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, no units arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0 in the 'Period 1 conclude' message), leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory and 141 in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 86 units, which was unfortunately lost due to zero stock. The initial demand history shows values [131, 92, 118, 125, 106], with an average of approximately 114.4 units. Period 1 demand (86) is slightly lower than the historical average but within a reasonable range. Since we have no completed lead-time data yet, I will stick to the promised lead time (L=4). For demand, I will use all available historical samples to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a stable baseline (1+L=5 periods of coverage).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, 141 units were ordered, and in Period 2, 140 units were ordered (Total in-transit: 281). Since L=4, the first order placed in Period 1 is not expected to arrive until Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) because we started with 0 inventory and the lead time is long. The demand for the first two periods was 86 and 132. Combined with the historical seed data (131, 92, 118, 125, 106), the mean demand appears stable around 110-115 units per period. I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include all available data points (seed + recent history) to project demand over the 5-period window (L+1). L will remain at the default promised lead time of 4 until observations suggest otherwise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 4 periods. According to the sequence rules, an order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5 (1+4=5) and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations in Periods 1-3 are expected and do not yet indicate a lead time shift or lost orders. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 425 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand over the first 3 periods was 86, 132, and 100 (average ~106). Since we have no completed lead time cycles yet, I will use the default promised lead time (L=4). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand behavior, as there isn't enough history to suggest a regime shift yet. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (141 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (at L=4). However, as of the start of Period 5, we only have 'Period 4 conclude' data, which correctly shows 0 arrivals. We expect to see the Period 1 order 'conclude' in the Period 6 start message. Therefore, there is no evidence yet that lead times are drifting or that orders are lost. Demand has been relatively stable, with historical samples ranging from 75 to 132 (Mean \u2248 114). Since we have 570 units in transit (covering roughly 5 periods of demand) and a replenishment cycle of L+1=5, the system is currently awaiting its first arrivals to clear the stockout. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the initial baseline accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $389.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived exactly at Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the inventory position includes On-hand (35) and In-transit (429), and we observe consistent demand with a mean of approximately 114 units per period across 5 samples (131, 92, 118, 125, 106 - based on provided Historical Demand Data), the backend needs to maintain a base stock covering L+1 (5) periods. The mean demand is 114, so mu_hat should target ~570. Historical standard deviation is approx 15.6. Given the stockout in Periods 1-4 due to lead time, we now have inventory on hand. I will use the 'default' method for lead time since 4 is confirmed, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent history while maintaining stability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Base demand mean stable at ~114 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $210.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have 98 units on-hand and 365 in-transit. Historic demand over 6 periods (Period_1 to Period_6) is: 86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77. The mean of these samples is 96.0 units, with a standard deviation of 21.6. The carry-over insight confirms a lead time (L) of 4. Therefore, the planning horizon is L+1 = 5 periods. Using the mean of all samples (96.0) for mu_hat yields (5 * 96.0) = 480. Using the standard deviation of all samples (21.6) for sigma_hat yields (sqrt(5) * 21.6) \u2248 48.3. Pipeline inventory is currently 98 (on-hand) + 365 (in-transit) = 463. This is close to our target base stock, but the backend 'cap' and base stock logic will determine the final order. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (P5, P6, P7 concludes) confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current demand is stable with no visible seasonality or trend in the provided data (P1-P7 demand: 86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67). The mean demand over 7 periods is approximately 91.86, but using recent_N=5 (P3-P7: 100, 75, 106, 77, 67) gives a slightly lower mean of 85. Standard deviation remains manageable. With 175 on-hand and 319 in-transit (orders from P4, P6, P7), the pipeline is healthy. I will use 'calculate' for lead time since observed lead times are stable at 4, and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the full spectrum of observed demand volatility while staying responsive to the slightly lower recent demand levels.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Period 9. Analysis of concluded periods confirms a consistent lead time of 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). Demand mean across all 8 periods is approximately 96.25 units, with a standard deviation of about 24.3. However, there is no evidence of a demand regime shift yet; the fluctuation between 67 and 132 units appears stochastic. The pipeline currently contains 182 units (orders from P6, P7, and P8), and we have 193 units on hand. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been stable at 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the full historical record since demand started being tracked accurately) to capture the current mean and volatility while excluding the initial empty inventory phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $357.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Based on the game history, orders from Period 1 through Period 4 arrived exactly after 4 periods (promised lead time). The Order from Period 5 was 0 units, so Period 9 naturally showed 'arrived=0'. We expect deliveries to resume in Period 10 (from Period 6 order). Current on-hand is 83, with 319 in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). Demand history (P1-P9): 86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67, 127, 110. The mean demand across these 9 periods is ~97.8. However, the provided additional historical demand samples (seeds) for Periods 1-5 were higher (131, 92, 118, 125, 106). Re-calculating with strictly the 9 observed game periods: mean=97.8, std=21.6. Including the provided seed data (which seems to represent the same underlying process), the average remains around 100-110. I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture the most relevant demand behavior since the simulation started. L is stable at 4.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am currently at Period 11. Historically, the lead time has been consistent at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8, P6 arrived P10). There was no order in P5, which explains why P9 (P5+4) had 0 arrivals. The promised lead time of 4 is confirmed as the actual lead time. Demand over the 10 completed periods has a mean of 98.9 and a standard deviation of 22.0. Looking at the last 5 periods (P6-P10), the mean is 97.8 and the standard deviation is 24.3, suggesting a slight drop from the earlier periods but overall stability. Inventory levels are healthy with 51 on-hand and 374 in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). I will use recent_N for both demand and volatility based on the last 5 periods to capture this recent stability while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data (orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, and P7) consistently show an actual lead time of 4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable. Analysis of the 11 completed periods shows a mean demand of approximately 101.2 units per period (1113 total demand / 11 periods). However, looking at the most recent 5 periods (P7-P11), the mean is slightly higher at 107.4 units. Given there are no visible seasonal triggers in the generic period labels, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture this slight upward drift in mean demand. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. On-hand inventory is low (24), but there is a significant pipeline of 387 units (from P8, P9, P10, and P11). Setting L=4, mu_hat with recent_N (N=5), and sigma_hat with recent_N (N=5) will allow the backend to maintain the target service level based on current consumption trends while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we stocked out (ending inventory 0, sold 32/132 units) because the Period 8 order was unusually small (8 units). However, a large replenishment pipeline of 527 units is already in transit. Every order since Period 1 has consistently arrived with a lead time of 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11, P8->P12). The promised lead time L=4 is reliable. Demand remains stable; the mean across the last 12 periods is approximately 104 units, while the recent 5-period mean is 117. Given the stockout, I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the slightly higher recent demand intensity while relying on the pipeline to fill the current on-hand gap. Lead time remains 'default' (4) as confirmed by history.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed (all arrivals from P1-P4 and P6-P9 arrived with L=4). However, there is a stockout risk due to low inventory (25 units on hand). The demand for the last 13 periods has averaged approximately 103 units, which is slightly lower than the initial sample mean of 114. There are no clear seasonal shifts yet, but the fluctuation is significant (STD ~22). I will focus on the most recent 13 periods to better capture the current demand level. The shipment from P10 (131 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 14 and be visible in Period 15. Since the lead time is stable at 4, I will use 'calculate' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=13 to prioritize the actual demand observed during the game over initial samples, as the earlier samples were slightly higher.

Daily Reward (R_t): $334.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we observe a steady lead time of 4 periods based on the conclusion of orders from Periods 1 through 10. The demand remains stable around the mean of ~104 units across the first 14 periods (excluding the warm-up data provided in the prompt), though there is some fluctuation. In Period 12, we experienced a stockout because the order from Period 8 was exceptionally small (8 units) due to high inventory at that time, and the replenishment arrived just as demand spiked. Currently, 'In-transit' inventory is 408 units (comprising orders from Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14), and on-hand inventory is 58. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target should cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Mean demand (mu) from the last 14 periods is 104 units, so mu_hat for 5 periods is 520. Standard deviation is approximately 22, so sigma_hat for 5 periods is sqrt(5)*22 \u2248 49. I will use recent_N for both demand parameters to capture the current stable regime (N=10) and default for lead time as it matches the observed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean remains stable at ~104 units/period (P1-P14). Lead time consistently observed at 4 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system state shows an on-hand inventory of 55 and in-transit inventory of 402 units. Historical lead time has been consistently 4 periods (validated through Period 15 conclusion). Demand remains stable; the mean of the historical samples provided (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) is 114.4, while the mean of the 15 periods in 'Game History' (ignoring periods with stockouts for true demand estimation) is approximately 106. Since the demand shows no significant recent changepoints or seasonal shifts in the current context, I will use a recent window (N=10) to calculate both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we capture the stable mean of ~104-106 units while allowing the OR backend to set the base stock level to cover the lead time (L) plus the review period (1). With L=4, the base stock will target demand for 5 periods. The current pipeline (55 on-hand + 402 in-transit = 457) is well-aligned with a target of approximately 530 units (5 * 106).

Daily Reward (R_t): $772.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe a significant spike in demand (195 units in Period 16), which is nearly double the previous average of ~104 units. While base demand has been stable, this could be a seasonal shift or a one-time outlier. The inventory is currently low (on-hand: 8), and there are 372 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the current period's demand occurs after the order, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. To account for the recent demand spike without overreacting too aggressively until the trend is confirmed, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the increased mean and volatility. The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+L)*mean + z*sqrt(1+L)*std. Given profit $4 and holding $1, the target service level q is 0.8 (z \u2248 0.84).

Carry-over insight: Possible demand regime shift starting Period 16: demand jumped from ~104 to 195. Monitoring if this sustained increase continues.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 18. Demand has spiked significantly in the last two periods: Period 16 (195 units) and Period 17 (251 units), following a long-term average of ~104 units. This represents a significant demand regime shift that has now been sustained for two periods and is severely depleting inventory (on-hand is 0). Although promised lead time is 4, actual lead time is consistently 4. Given the stockout at Period 17 (only 62 of 251 units sold), we must aggressively increase mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent data (N=3) to cover the (L+1)=5 period window. N=3 includes Period 15 (114), Period 16 (195), and Period 17 (251), averaging ~187 units. While this may slightly over-correct if demand regresses, it is necessary to restore the service level for this high-margin (75% critical ratio) product.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: demand rose from ~104 to average ~223 over P16-P17. Service level is critical to avoid lost sales during this peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $380.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand for periods 1-15 was approximately 106 units/period, while the demand for periods 16-18 has spiked to 211.7 units/period (195, 251, 189). We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) despite recent large orders (In-transit: 717). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the shift is sustained and significant, I will use a window of the last 3 samples (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime. This will raise the base_stock to cover the (L+1) window, which is 5 periods of demand at the new higher rate. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 targets an average demand of ~212 per period, totaling ~1060 units for the coverage period.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (P16-P18): Avg demand increased from ~106 to ~212 per period. Stockouts observed in P17 and P18 due to insufficient inventory for the sudden surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has been 195, 251, 189, and 177, averaging 203 units per period (compared to the previous baseline of ~108). We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 for the last three periods) because orders placed before the shift (P13-P15) were sized for the old regime. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 880 units in-transit (orders from P16-P19). Specifically, the order from P16 (118 units) should arrive this period (P20), and P17 (194 units) in P21. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have shifted to a clearly higher demand level, I am using recent_N with N=4 to capture this new mean (avg ~203) and the increased volatility observed during the spike to ensure the OR backend sets a sufficiently high base stock to recover from the stockout and maintain the required service level.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P16-P19) confirmed: average demand increased from ~108 to 203 units/period. Significant stockouts occurred in P17-P19 as supply catches up to the 4-period lead time lag.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is now firmly established. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 213.2 units/period, compared to the baseline of ~108 units/period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since P17, we have suffered from stockouts because the supply (ordered at lower levels prior to P16) is only now arriving at the higher demand volume. The order from P17 (194 units) will arrive in Period 21 resolution, and since current on-hand is 0, we are currently service-level constrained. I will use recent_N with N=5 (P16-P20) to capture this new regime for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, and 'calculate' for L. This will set a higher base stock level to cover the (L+1)=5 periods of demand and prevent further stockouts as supply catches up.

Daily Reward (R_t): $776.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting in Period 16 is now firmly established. Average demand since P16 is approximately 216.5 units per period (P16:195, P17:251, P18:189, P19:177, P20:254, P21:238), compared to the prior average of ~108. Despite the arrival of 194 units (ordered in P17), we ended P21 with zero inventory because demand (238) exceeded supply. The pipeline inventory is high (941 units) as previous large orders are in transit. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit (given current zero on-hand), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this high-demand regime, and N=6 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this new period. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it is consistently 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (P16-P21) sustained: avg demand increased to ~216 units/period (approx +100% from baseline). Volatility (sigma) also increased significantly during this period.

The average for this new regime (N=7) is approx 222 units/period, compared to the baseline of ~108. On-hand inventory is 50, and we have 851 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The goal is to set parameters that maintain a high service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) for this higher demand level to capture lost sales, while managing the pipeline. Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current peak regime, and calculate for lead time since it has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (P16-P22) solidified: mean demand increased from ~108 to ~222 units (+105%). Volatility has also increased during this period.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 16, increasing from an average of ~108 units to ~220 units per period. The recent 8-period mean (P16-P23) is approximately 219 units. Observed lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 22, larger orders placed during the initial surge (P18 onwards) have started arriving, ending the stockout streak. However, demand remains high and volatile (std dev ~33). To maintain the required service level (target q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) and account for the (L+1) exposure period, I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 samples (N=8) to capture the current high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using N=8 to reflect the increased volatility observed since Period 16. Lead time (L) remains at the promised/calculated 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (P16-P23) remains stable at ~220 units/period (approx +100% from baseline P1-P15). Stockouts have ceased as of Period 22 due to the arrival of surge orders placed in Period 18.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the demand from P16 to P24, the mean demand is approximately 220 units per period (195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238, 250, 184, 238). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the surge, inventory levels have finally recovered from the stockout phase as orders placed during the high-demand period (starting P18) are now arriving regularly. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this specific high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the confirmed lead time of 4. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current average demand of ~220 rather than the long-term average which includes the lower demand from P1-P15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $586.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began in Period 16 is now well-established. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the average demand is 214.7 units, which is approximately double the initial baseline. Most recently, demand has fluctuated between 171 and 250 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory (98) plus in-transit stock (890) covers roughly 4.6 periods of the current average demand (214.7 * 4.6 \u2248 988 units), which is appropriate given the 4-period lead time. I will maintain the L parameter at the promised 4 periods and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect the current high-demand regime and its associated volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to maintain a high service level (~80% given the $4 profit and $1 holding cost) while accounting for the increased variance observed since the shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $167.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted from ~108 to ~215 units per period starting at Period 16. However, Period 26 showed a significant dip to 95 units, which may be an outlier or the start of a deceleration. Given the 4-period lead time, we must maintain a base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. The average demand since the surge (P16-P26) is approximately 195 units. The most recent 3 periods (P24-P26) average 168 units. I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=11, covering the surge period) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the sustained higher volume while acknowledging the recent volatility. Lead time (L) is stable at 4 periods. On-hand plus in-transit inventory is currently 1043 units, which provides a comfortable buffer above the expected demand for the next 4-5 periods (approx 1000 units), so I will rely on the OR backend's capped policy to manage the transition if demand continues to soften.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-66.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 28. Beginning inventory is high (402 units on-hand) because demand has sharply dropped in the last two periods (95 and 84) from the previous peak (~220). This suggests a potential demand regime shift downward. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The carry-over insights note a surge from P16-P23, but P26 and P27 indicate that peak may have ended. However, since the low demand has only been observed for two periods, I must stay cautious before fully reverting to the earlier baseline. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend while maintaining some safety stock. N=5 includes the end of the high regime and the start of this low regime, providing a balanced transition for the OR backend effectively managing the higher holding risk. L is set to 'calculate' as it is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift downward at Period 26: demand dropped from ~220 units (P16-P25) to ~90 units (P26-P27). Monitoring for sustainability.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward regime shift. After a peak demand phase (P16-P25) averaging ~220 units, the demand in the last three periods (P26, P27, P28) dropped to 95, 84, and 121 units respectively, averaging ~100 units/period. This level is similar to the baseline observed in P1-P15. Consequently, continuing to forecast based on the high-demand period will lead to excessive inventory and high holding costs. I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to focus only on the most recent 3 periods (P26-P28) to reflect this new (or returned) lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed at Period 26: average demand decreased from ~220 units to ~100 units (observed P26-P28), returning to levels seen in P1-P15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-198.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant downward regime shift starting in Period 26. After a high-demand period (P16-P25) averaging ~220 units, the most recent four periods (P26-P29) show a return to baseline levels, with demand values of 95, 84, 121, and 98 (average ~99.5). Currently, on-hand inventory is very high (590 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the previous peak period (orders from P23, P24, and P25 total 680 units arriving in P27, P28, and P29). With L=4, the base stock targets demand for 5 periods. At the current demand rate of ~100, we need ~500 units in pipeline/on-hand. Since current on-hand (590) + in-transit (218) already totals 808 units, we are overstocked for the current demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the new lower demand level (approx 100 units/period) and 'calculate' for Lead Time, as it has been stable at 4 periods. This will cause the OR backend to stop ordering until the excess inventory is depleted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-155.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. After a high-demand period (P16-P25 avg ~215), demand has dropped and stabilized at a lower level since Period 26 (avg ~103 over P26-P30). Currently, on-hand inventory is 623 units with 68 units in-transit (ordered P27, expected arrival P31). This total pipeline of 691 units is very high relative to the new demand level (L+1 = 5 periods, 5 * 103 = 515). To avoid excessive holding costs and allow inventory to bleed down, I am setting L to the consistent 4-period lead time and using the last 5 periods (P26-P30) to establish the new demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). The OR backend will see that the current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) significantly exceeds the calculated base stock, resulting in zero orders being placed until stocks reach more efficient levels.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P26-current) confirmed: average demand decreased from ~215 units (P16-P25) to ~103 units (P26-P30), returning to levels comparable to the original P1-P15 baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-156.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following the downturn that began at Period 26. In the most recent block (Periods 26-31), observations are 95, 84, 121, 98, 117, and 107. This yields a mean of 103.67, which aligns closely with the initial baseline of ~108. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 584 units, which is significantly above the target safety stock levels for the current demand regime (103.67 * 5 = 518.35). To address this surplus and minimize holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the lower demand environment. The OR backend will naturally reduce ordering to allow the inventory to bleed down towards the new base stock level.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level following a high-demand period (P16-P25). Since Period 26, the average demand has been approximately 105 units/period (P26-P32), consistent with the initial baseline. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on historical arrivals (e.g., P27 order arrived as expected). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 472 units, and there are no units in transit. Given the current average demand of ~105 and a (L+1) horizon of 5 periods, the target base stock is approximately 525-600 units. With 472 units on hand, the OR backend will calculate a small safety order if necessary, but the inventory level is currently healthy compared to the lower demand regime. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-surge demand stabilization starting from Period 26.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level following a high-demand period (P16-P25). Since Period 26, demand has averaged approximately 103 units per period (P26-P33), which is consistent with the initial baseline observed in P1-P15. I am choosing N=8 for 'recent_N' calculations to align with this confirmed regime (P26-P33). The lead time remains constant at 4 periods, as confirmed by all concluded shipments. On-hand inventory is currently high (370 units) due to the arrival of surge orders placed during the previous peak, but the pipeline inventory is low (78 units). With a total of 448 units (on-hand + in-transit) and a forecasted demand of ~103 per period, we have over 4 periods of coverage. I will set the parameters to reflect the current mean and volatility of this stable regime to allow the OR backend to normalize the inventory levels effectively while maintaining a high service level.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime transitioned from a high peak (P16-P25, avg ~215) back to a stable baseline (P26-P34, avg ~102). With demand now consistently lower for the last 9 periods, inventory levels that ballooned due to the previous surge's tail-end arrivals (P28-P31) are being allowed to deplete. Currently, on-hand inventory is 290 units with 176 in-transit (orders from P33 and P34). The current demand mean of ~102 leads to a (L+1) requirement of approximately 510 units to satisfy demand through the lead time of 4 periods. Since current on-hand + in-transit is 466 (290+176), a modest order is needed to reach the base stock target. I am using recent_N (N=9, covering the new regime P26-P34) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-regime period starting around Period 26, following a high-demand surge from Period 16-25. Since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 104 units per period (P26-P35: 95, 84, 121, 98, 117, 107, 112, 102, 80, 122). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 168 units, and the pipeline contains 246 units (ordered in P33, P34, and P35). To manage the current stable demand, I will use methods that capture the most recent regime (N=10) to avoid over-ordering based on the past high-demand peak, while ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). Sigma is set using recent_N to reflect current volatility levels rather than the high volatility seen during the regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $287.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stable regime following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). The current baseline, established from P26 onwards, averages 100.2 units/period (P26-P36). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 77 units, and there are 375 units in-transit (orders from P33, P34, P35, and P36). Using L=4, the coverage required is for (L+1)=5 periods of demand. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on the last 11 samples (P26-P36) to reflect this current regime. Although in-transit inventory currently exceeds the expected demand over the lead time, the capped policy will manage the order quantity to maintain the target service level as current stock is depleted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in its third regime (P26-P37) with an average demand of approximately 99 units per period, following a significant surge between P16 and P25. Current on-hand inventory is 100 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked with 386 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P33 order arrived P37). Since we are in Period 38 and the game ends at Period 50, we need to maintain sufficient inventory to cover the remaining periods while avoiding excessive holding costs. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=12) to capture specifically the current stable regime (P26-P37) and filter out the historical surge data. The backend will calculate base_stock for (L+1) periods (5 periods of demand), and the pipeline of 386 units plus the 100 on-hand is already substantial, so the capped policy will likely keep order quantities conservative to burn off the safety stock built during the transition.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a 'low' regime since Period 26, following a high-demand surge from Period 16-25. For the current period (P39), I calculate the mean demand from this stable regime (P26-P38) to be approximately 100.23 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 66 and a significant pipeline (in-transit) of 333 units (including orders from P35-P38), the total supply is sufficient to cover the expected demand for the L+1 window (~500 units). The OR backend's capped policy will manage the order size. I am using recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current stable regime and ignore the previous high-demand surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $269.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major surge from Period 16 to 25 (~215 units) but has since returned to a stable baseline of approximately 100 units per period starting from Period 26. Specifically, the average demand from Period 26 to 39 is 100.1 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P33, P34, and P35 all arrived exactly 4 periods after they were ordered). Currently, we have 55 units on-hand and 399 units in-transit. The in-transit inventory is quite high relative to current demand levels because orders placed during the high-demand period and the transition back to baseline are still arriving. To stabilize inventory and avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level, I will use a N=14 period lookback (P26-P39) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current 'low' demand regime. The OR backend's capped policy will automatically limit new orders until the existing in-transit pipeline is digested.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-regime pattern since Period 26, returning to baseline levels after a significant surge between Periods 16-25. Analysis of the most recent 15 periods (P26-P40) confirms a mean demand of approximately 102 units with a standard deviation of about 21. Lead times have remained remarkably consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 37-40. Currently, on-hand inventory is 48, and in-transit inventory is 354, which is sufficient to cover roughly 3.5 periods of demand at the current rate. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the target service level is high (80%), requiring us to maintain enough safety stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for both demand and volatility to capture the current stable regime while excluding the past surge. For lead time, I'll continue using 'calculate' as the historical consistency is high.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 26, returning to a baseline of approximately 105 units per period after a high-demand period (P16-P25). Recent demand (P37-P41) has shown a slight uptick (81, 136, 142), causing a stockout in Period 41 as on-hand inventory reached zero. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 0 units on-hand and 404 units in-transit (ordered P38-P41), I need to set parameters based on the current regime (P26-P41, N=16) to ensure the base_stock covers the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=16 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable-but-variable regime and prevent further stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs given the previous overstock in P29-P32.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a period of volatility and a temporary surge. Following the high-demand regime (P16-P25), demand returned to a baseline level similar to P1-P15. For the current period, I am calculating parameters based on the most recent 10 periods (P33-P42), as this captures the relevant stable demand pattern observed since Period 31. Recent demand averages approximately 101 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, which is concerning as lead time is consistently 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 503) includes orders from Period 39 through 42. Since we are at Period 43, the order from P39 (136 units) is expected to arrive during this period but will only be visible in the next step. To maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (target service level ~80%), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current mean demand of ~102 and its associated variance. The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P33-P38 orders).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a stable regime since Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). Calculating the mean demand since P26 (P26-P43), the average is approximately 104 units per period. This aligns with the baseline observed in P1-P15 (~108 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 14 and in-transit units at 430, the pipeline is well-stocked. The goal is to maintain the base stock level for the (L+1) = 5 period outlook. I will use recent_N with N=18 (the length of the current stable regime since P26) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring parameters reflect the most recent demand behavior while smoothing out recent fluctuations.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to the baseline regime observed in P1-P15 and P26-P31. Since Period 26, the average demand has been approximately 104.5 units per period. The recent behavior (P40-P44) shows some volatility but maintains this general mean. On-hand inventory is low (33), but there is a significant pipeline of 468 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N=19 to capture the entire current regime since the last major shift at Period 26. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the recent demand variance.

Over the last 20 periods (P26-P45), the mean demand is approximately 101.5 units, with a standard deviation of about 23 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current inventory stands at 81 on-hand and 385 in-transit (orders from P42-P45). Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level (q) is 0.8. I am using recent_N (N=20) to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, and calculate for lead time to reflect the observed stability in delivery.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a downward shift that occurred around Period 26. Since then (P26-P46), demand has averaged approximately 104 units per period, which is consistent with the initial baseline observed in P1-P15. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of shipments from Periods 33-42. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P47-P50), I am setting the lead time L to the promised 4 to ensure the pipeline covers the remaining duration. I'm using a recent_N of 21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the statistics of the current stable regime (P26 onwards), which specifically avoids the high-demand surge seen in P16-P25. The current on-hand inventory (99) and in-transit (328) are healthy relative to forecasted demand (~104/period), but maintaining a consistent order flow prevents stockouts in the final periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a stable regime that began around Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 101 units per period (calculated from P26-P47). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 80 and in-transit units at 397, the pipeline is healthy. For Period 48, I will use the recent demand history (N=22) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current stable regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5) at the optimal service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 80%). No major demand shifts or lead-time deviations are observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in its third regime (starting Period 26) following a temporary surge (Periods 16-25). Throughout the recent periods (P26-P48), demand has averaged approximately 101 units per period, which is consistent with the initial baseline of ~104 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since the current period is 49 out of 50, any order placed now will arrive in Period 53 (49 + 4), which is beyond the game's duration. Therefore, the primary objective is to manage the current on-hand inventory (135) and the incoming in-transit pipeline to satisfy demand for the final two periods (49 and 50) without incurring unnecessary holding costs for units that will arrive after the game ends. I will use 'recent_N' with N=23 (covering the start of the current stable regime at P26) to reflect the return to baseline demand levels while maintaining a safe service level for the remaining time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $359.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime following the decrease observed at Period 26. Since Period 26, the demand mean has remained approximately 100 units (avg of P26-P49 is ~101 units). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and consistent, with every order from Period 33 to Period 45 arriving exactly on time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 81 and in-transit units are 357 (covering orders from P46-P49). Using N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate as it captures the entire current stable regime while excluding the high-demand volatility of the P16-P25 period. This will help the OR backend set a base stock level that balances the $4.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost effectively for the current demand level.
