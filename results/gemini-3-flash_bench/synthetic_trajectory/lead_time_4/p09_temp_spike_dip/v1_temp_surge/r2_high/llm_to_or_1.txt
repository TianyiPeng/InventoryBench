Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips (Regular) with a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is the first period, we have no arrivals yet. Historical demand for the last five periods shows values of 131, 92, 118, 125, and 106. The mean demand is 114.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 15.3. Given the Lead Time L=4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using the default method for mu_hat will calculate (1+4) * 114.4 = 572, and sigma_hat will calculate sqrt(5) * 15.3 \u2248 34.2. This provides a baseline inventory level to start with while we await the first arrival confirmation to verify actual lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 141 units was placed. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, this order is in-transit and not expected to arrive until the resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). The current on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales of 46 units in Period 1. The historical demand data (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) averages 114.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 15.7. Since we only have 1 period of in-game history which matches the general scale of the historical samples, I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the local average while relying on the default lead time. Using N=5 for demand and sigma_hat leverages the provided historical samples for a stable baseline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) and Period 2 (149 units) are currently in-transit (total 290 units). Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations in the concludes for Period 1 and 2 are expected and do not indicate a delay yet. However, we have experienced lost sales in Period 1 and 2 because starting inventory was 0. Demand for the first two periods was 46 and 131 respectively. Including the pre-game history (P1: 131, P2: 92, P3: 118, P4: 125, P5: 106) and the game history (P1: 46, P2: 131), the mean demand is approximately 107 units per period. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 (all available data points) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure we are capturing the most relevant demand profile while we wait for arrivals to stabilize the stock.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6). Consequently, our on-hand inventory is currently 0, and all units ordered so far (141+149+157 = 447) are in-transit. The demand history shows an average of approximately 114 units per period (46, 131, 87, and we are told Period_4 demand is 125, though the conclude message for P4 isn't out yet). Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Using the mean of all available history (including the provided sample periods 1-5 which average ~114 units), the base stock should target approximately 114 * 5 = 570 units. Since we have 447 in-transit, the OR backend will order approximately 123 more units this period, ensuring the pipeline stays full. No lead time shifts or demand regime changes are confirmed yet.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible at the start of Period 6). Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 600 (the sum of orders from P1-P4: 141+149+157+153 = 600). Since no orders have concluded yet, actual lead time cannot be verified, so I will stick with the promised L=4. Demand for the last 5 periods (including historical samples) has been 131, 92, 118, 125, 106. The mean of these 5 samples is 114.4. For the inventory policy, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation ensures the forecast is tuned to the most relevant recent demand patterns. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the high profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Demand history for the last 5 periods shows values of 46 (P1), 131 (P2), 87 (P3), 130 (P4), and 105 (P5). Note: The initial demand samples provided in the prompt (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) differ slightly from the GAME HISTORY; I will rely on the GAME HISTORY mean (approx 100) for current forecasting. With L=4, the pipeline depth (1+L) is 5. Total pipeline inventory is 489 units, which covers roughly 4.89 periods of average demand. The on-hand inventory is 36. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the initial variance while respecting the confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5); Mean demand approximately 100 units/period based on P1-P5 history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3235.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe that the lead time is consistent with the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). Current on-hand inventory is low (14 units) due to a spike in demand in Period 6 (171 units), which is higher than the previous average of ~100. We have 444 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). To account for the recent demand increase while maintaining the long-term average, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (covering all completed periods) to capture the variability including the recent spike. Since lead time is stable at 4, I will use the 'calculate' method for L.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 6 (171 units vs previous avg ~105). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1689.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (based on arrivals from orders placed in P1, P2, and P3). Demand has shown some volatility: from an initial average of ~110 units (P1-P5) to a spike of 171 in P6, returning to 93 in P7. Historical demand samples provided (P1-P5) plus recent data (P6-P7) result in a global mean of ~114 units. Given the lead time (L=4), we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. On-hand inventory is 78 and in-transit is 470 (total pipeline 548). With an average demand of 114, expected 5-period demand is 570. The current pipeline is slightly below this, and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1) suggests a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the recent volatility while maintaining the lead time at the promised 'default' of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: P6 spike (171) followed by P7 moderation (93). Average demand L7 is ~114 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1469.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 4 order in Period 8. The promised lead time of 4 is reliable. Current on-hand inventory is 146, with 461 units in transit (orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). Demand over the last 8 periods has averaged 106 units (46, 131, 87, 130, 105, 171, 93, 85). However, there's a slight increase in volatility starting from Period 6. To protect against stockouts during the (L+1)=5 period lead time window, I will use recent_N for mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P4-P8) where demand has been more reflective of the current environment (avg 107.8), and use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility seen in Period 6. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the high $19 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1824.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing the lead time history: Orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have all arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods (arriving in the resolution phases of P5, P6, P7, P8, and P9 respectively). This aligns with the promised lead time. The demand history across the first 9 periods is: 46 (P1), 131 (P2), 87 (P3), 130 (P4), 105 (P5), 171 (P6), 93 (P7), 85 (P8), and 100 (P9). The mean demand is approximately 105 units/period. Period 6 showed a significant spike (171), but demand has since stabilized between 85-100. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. Current on-hand is 76, and in-transit is 536 (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). Since lead time is stable at 4, L=4 is appropriate. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture the full distribution including the P6 spike while acknowledging the recent stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all 5 received shipments (P1-P5 orders). Demand mean is stable around 105 units/period despite a one-time spike in P6.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 10). The most recent shipment (ordered in Period 6) arrived exactly as expected in Period 10. Demand has stabilized after the Period 6 spike (171), with the last four periods (P7-P10) showing demands of 93, 85, 100, and 97. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is 109.2 units per period, which is a more relevant estimator than the long-term average given the volatility seen early on. With a lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture a stable window while including the volatility from Period 6 for a safe buffer. This approach helps maintain a high service level while preventing excessive stock as we move past the early-game inventory build-up phase.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P7 order arrived in P11, taking exactly 4 periods). Since the promised lead time L=4 matches the actual observed lead time, I will use the 'default' method for L. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), the recent history (P5-P11) shows a stable mean. The demand in the last 7 periods (105, 171, 93, 85, 100, 97, 81) averages approximately 104.57 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this stable regime while filtering out the early zero-inventory bias and the one-time spike in Period 6. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect the recent volatility observed in that same period. The pipeline (In-transit: 393) and On-hand (185) are being reconciled well by the backend logic with these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods across 7 consecutive cycles (P1-P7 orders). Demand regime is stable with an average of ~105 units/period over the last 7 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 236 units with 306 units in-transit. Analysis of the historical lead times (P1 to P8 orders) confirms a consistent lead time of exactly 4 periods. The demand for the last 12 periods has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 102 units per period (sum of demands 1129 / 12), despite a single spike in Period 6 (171). The recent 7 periods (P6-P12) show a mean of 102.8 units and a standard deviation of approximately 30.7 units. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend target service level is high (approx. 95%). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability following the spike, and keep L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing chips(Regular) with a promised lead time (L) of 4. Observation of the game history confirms that the actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods for all 9 completed shipment cycles (P1-P9). Current on-hand inventory is 216, with 287 units in transit (P10-P13 orders). Demand has remained relatively stable; while there was a peak in Period 6 (171), most recent demand values have fluctuated around 100 (P9: 100, P10: 97, P11: 81, P12: 93, P13: 125). The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P4-P13) is approximately 107 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the stable regime while acknowledging slightly higher recent volatility. For lead time, I will continue with the 'calculate' method as the observed lead time is perfectly aligned with the promised 4 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Entering Period 15, the lead time is clearly established and stable at 4 periods based on 10 consecutive arrivals (P1-P10). Average demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 105 units. Recent demand (P9-P14: 100, 97, 81, 93, 125, 107) averages 100.5. Since the historical mean across all 14 periods (including the early low P1 and high P6) is roughly 105, I will use recent_N (N=9, covering P6-P14) to capture the current regime which includes the volatility observed in earlier periods. The current on-hand inventory (154) plus in-transit (379) totals 533 units. With an expected pipeline of 5 periods (L+1), and an average demand of ~105, the required base stock is approximately 525-550 units. The pipeline is healthy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2207.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we review the history up to Period 15. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods across 11 received shipments (P5-P15). Demand remains stable; the sample mean over the last 10 periods (P6-P15) is 107.5 units, which is consistent with the overall historical average of ~103 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P12-P15) show a slight uptick in demand (avg 112) compared to the previous few and the initial regime. However, given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend already targets a high service level (~0.95 quantile). The current on-hand inventory (130) and in-transit (378) sum to 508 units. Our effective lead time plus current period (L+1) is 5 periods. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~537 units. Setting L to default (4), and using a recent_N of 10 for both demand and sigma provides a balanced forecast that accounts for the slightly higher recent activity while maintaining stability. This ensures the base stock (approx 5 periods of demand + safety stock) aligns with our current pipeline of 508 units.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: The product category is 'chips(Regular)'. In the last period (P16), we observed a demand of 164, which is significantly higher than the previous average of ~105. This follows an upward trend over the last 4 periods (107, 123, 164). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With only 23 units on-hand and an increasing demand trend, we need to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to cover the (L+1)=5 period horizon. To capture the recent demand surge, I am using recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will adjust the forecast upwards while considering the higher volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand has trended upward from ~105 to an average of ~123 over the last 4 periods (P13-P16), with a peak of 164 in P16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2071.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand spiked drastically to 194 units, confirming a sustained upward trend that began around Period 13. The average demand over the last five periods (P13-P17) is approximately 142.6 units, compared to the previous long-term average of ~105. Due to this spike, the ending on-hand inventory is currently 0, although 530 units are in-transit. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To ensure the OR backend captures this recent and significant demand regime shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P13-P17). This will raise the base stock level to account for the higher mean and increased volatility, helping to prevent stockouts like the one seen in Period 17.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~105 to ~143 (+36%) over periods 13-17. High volatility observed with peak demand of 194 in P17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2603.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted upward in the last six periods (P13-P18), moving from an average of ~105 to an average of ~149 units per period. The last three periods (P16-P18) specifically averaged 180 units/period, far exceeding historical levels and leading to stockouts in P17 and P18. The current on-hand inventory is 0, with 595 units in-transit. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods. To address the higher demand and the current stockout situation, I am updating mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this higher demand regime (averaging ~149) and setting sigma_hat using the same window to account for the increased volatility (ranging from 107 to 194). This will raise the base stock level to better cover the (L+1) horizon of 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~105 to ~149 (+42%) over periods 13-18. Severe stockouts occurred in P17 and P18 due to demand exceeding supply units arriving from the previous lower-demand ordering regime.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20. Analysis of the the last 7 periods (P13-P19) confirms a significant upward demand regime shift, with demand moving from ~105 units/period to an average of ~156 units/period (125, 107, 123, 164, 194, 182, 199). Currently, the system is experiencing consecutive stockouts (P17, P18, P19) because the arriving shipments (ordered during the previous lower-demand regime) are insufficient to meet this new demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To recover and prevent further stockouts, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 to capture the entirety of this high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the current mean (~156) across the lead time + review period (L+1=5). This should aggressively pull more inventory into the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and stable: Period 13-19 average demand is 156 units/period, representing a 48% increase over the baseline of 105. High volatility persists with a peak of 199 in P19.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted starting Period 13 and has stabilized at a significantly higher level. Over the last 8 periods (P13-P20), the average demand is approximately 161 units per period, with significant volatility (peak 199, low 107). Stockouts have occurred consistently from P17 to P20 because arrivals were based on orders placed during the previous low-demand regime (~105 units/period). The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are in a high-demand regime, I am setting the lead time L to the promised 4 periods, and mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher mean demand (avg ~161) across the review and lead time periods (1+L = 5 periods). Sigma_hat is also calculated using the same N=8 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and sustained: Period 13-20 average demand is 161 units/period, a ~53% increase over the original baseline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3173.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has undergone a significant upward regime shift beginning around Period 13. Over the last 9 periods (P13-P21), demand has averaged approximately 167 units/period, compared to the original baseline of ~105. Most recently, demand peaked at 222 in Period 21. Due to the 4-period lead time, we have experienced stockouts from Period 17 to 21 because the orders placed under the old demand regime (P13-P16) were insufficient to meet the new, higher demand. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. To recover from the stockouts and stabilize the service level at the new demand mean, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the start of the shift in P13) to capture the higher mean (~167) and increased volatility. This will increase the base stock level to account for the current demand environment and existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 confirmed and sustained: Mean demand increased from ~105 to ~167 units/period (+59%) over P13-P21. Peak demand reached 222 in P21.

Recent demand samples (P17-P22: 194, 182, 199, 193, 222, 163) show a mean of 192.1, indicating that even the earlier 'recent' estimates might be conservative. I am choosing N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime. The actual lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods over 18 observed cycles, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is stabilizing after a period of stockouts, but we must maintain a high base stock (L+1 = 5 periods of cover) to satisfy the current demand level. The OR engine will use these recent stats to compute a base stock that balances high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 now fully stabilized around 190 units/period (P17-P22 average: 192).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly shifted upwards starting around Period 17, and the shift appears to have stabilized at a higher mean. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P17-P23), the average demand is 204.28 units per period, with a standard deviation of 27.9. The current situation shows a stockout in Period 23 (ending inventory 0, sold all arriving units), indicating the ordering regime is still catching up to the actual customer demand. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime while filtering out the older, lower-demand baseline. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 4 periods based on the conclusion data (P19 order arrived in P23). Using N=7 for L ensures we use the most recent confirmed lead time observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around Period 17 at a new mean of ~204 units (P17-P23 average), representing a significant and sustained increase from the original ~105 baseline.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting around Period 17, with demand consistently averaging over 190 units compared to the early baseline of ~105. Recent demand samples (P21-P24) are 222, 163, 247, and 166, which averages to 199.5. To capture this 'new normal' while accounting for recent volatility, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (covering back to Period 16, which captured the start of the breakout). Lead time has remained perfectly stable at 4 periods across all 20 received shipments, so L is set to 'calculate' to reflect this empirical reliability. Pipeline inventory is currently high (816 units), which should help alleviate the recent stockout series as these larger orders placed during the high-demand regime begin arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~200 units/period (P21-P24 avg: 199.5), representing a 90% increase from the original baseline. Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3781.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher regime. Over the most recent five periods (P21-P25), demand values were 222, 163, 247, 166, and 214, resulting in a mean of approximately 202.4 units per period. This represents a sustained shift from the original baseline of ~105. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P25 (ordered P21, lead_time=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand (214) slightly exceeding available stock (199). With a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stabilized high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to utilize the stable historical observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: P21-P25 average demand is 202.4 units/period, confirming the new baseline near 200 units. Stockouts persist when supply from the transition period (lower orders) meets current high demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1988.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 17 and has stabilized at a new, higher mean. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P17-P26), the mean demand is 181.0, though the last 5 periods (P22-P26) show a slightly lower but still volatile average of 173.8. The latest demand in P26 was 110, which is significantly below the new baseline, suggesting potential high volatility or a subtle shift. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all historical arrivals. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime while filtering out the noise of the very latest observation. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean and the substantial variance observed in this new regime, ensuring adequate service levels despite recent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2189.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 17 to a higher level. However, the most recent four periods (P24-P27) show high volatility: 166, 214, 110, and 125. The transition from Period 25 to 27 specifically shows a significant drop (214 to 125), which might indicate the 'peak' of the previous regime is cooling or simply high variance within the new regime. The current on-hand inventory is 186, with 773 units in-transit (orders from P24-P27). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profitability ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), a service-level oriented approach is still best, but we must account for the recent lower demand values when calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering if the regime is shifting again. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to cover the period from P17 onwards, capturing the high-demand regime's characteristics while acknowledging the recent dips.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1229.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a more volatile phase after a sustained high-demand period (approx. 200 units/period from P21-P25). The last three periods (P26-P28) show a sharp decline in demand (110, 125, 83), suggesting either a seasonal drop or a regime change. The average demand over the last 12 periods (P17-P28) is approximately 172 units, but the last 3 samples average only 106 units, resembling the original baseline. However, to avoid over-reacting to a potential short-term fluke while acknowledging the downward trend, I am using a recent_N window of 8 periods (average ~156 units) for mu_hat to gradually decelerate from the 200+ unit peak. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand (348) and in-transit (635) inventory relative to the recent demand dip, the OR backend will naturally reduce the order size to prevent excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift downward starting Period 26: Demand dropped from a ~200 average to ~106 average across P26-P28 (-47%). Further evidence needed to confirm if this is a permanent return to baseline or a temporary fluctuation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $872.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward shift starting in Period 26. After a high-demand regime of ~200 units/period (P21-P25), the last four periods (P26-P29) have seen demand drop to 110, 125, 83, and 71 respectively, averaging approximately 97 units/period. This represents a return to levels near the original baseline (~105). Given the current high volume of inventory (On-hand: 477, In-transit: 498) resulting from orders placed during the high-demand peak, and the clear downtrend in consumption, I am reducing mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this new lower-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages. These adjustments aim to prevent excessive holding costs while inventory levels naturally deplete to meet the current lower demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: Mean demand decreased from ~200 to ~97 units/period (P26-P29, -51%) following a peak period. Returning to baseline levels observed in P1-P12.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1020.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. After a high-demand period peaking around ~200 units (P17-P25), the demand has definitively returned to a lower baseline resembling the early periods. Over the last five periods (P26-P30), demand has averaged 95.4 units (110, 125, 83, 71, 88), which is a ~53% decrease from the previous peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high (652 units) and in-transit inventory (235 units) is more than sufficient to cover the next lead time cycle (L+1 = 5 periods) at the new mean of ~95. The current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 887) far exceeds the expected demand for the next 5 periods (~475 units), leading to high holding costs. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this downward shift, ensuring the base stock level aligns with the current lower demand and allowing the OR backend to prioritize clearing the existing surplus.

Daily Reward (R_t): $343.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted downward starting from Period 26. The average demand across P26-P31 is approximately 88.3 units/period, which is a significant drop from the previous ~200 units/period peak. This current level is closer to the initial baseline of ~105 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this new, lower demand level. On-hand inventory is currently very high (664 units) due to large orders placed during the previous high-demand regime arriving now (e.g., 263 units in P30). The OR backend will naturally reduce orders to 0 or near-0 because on-hand + in-transit (834 total) far exceeds the required base stock for this lower demand period (roughly (4+1)*88 = 440). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: Mean demand since Period 26 is ~88 units/period (P26-P31 average), returning to levels similar to the initial baseline (P1-P12).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1269.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant regime shift. After a peak period (P13-P25) where demand averaged ~200 units, it has dropped back to baseline levels starting at Period 26. The average demand from P26 to P32 is approximately 90.3 units/period (110, 125, 83, 71, 88, 53, 102). We are currently overstocked with 669 units on-hand and 63 units in-transit (reaching P33 arrival resolve) because large orders placed during the high-demand regime are still arriving. The total pipeline inventory (732) far exceeds the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (5 periods * ~90 units = 450). Therefore, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand level using the last 7 periods (N=7) to avoid further increasing the inventory surplus while the on-hand stock is depleted. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a significant downward shift since Period 26. The mean demand for the most recent 8 periods (P26-P33) is approximately 91.25 units/period, matching the initial baseline (~105) but currently trending even lower. Given the current high on-hand inventory of 644 units and the pipeline inventory having been cleared (in-transit: 0), the system is overstocked. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further accumulation of units and minimize holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (the length of the current low-demand regime) to accurately reflect the new baseline. The OR backend's capped policy should continue to result in zero orders until the on-hand inventory is depleted to levels consistent with a 5-period peak demand coverage (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean of ~91 units/period since Period 26, effectively returning to or slightly below the initial baseline levels after the high-demand peak (P17-P25).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P17-P25). The mean demand over the last 9 periods (P26-P34) is approximately 93 units/period, which is consistent with the initial baseline of ~100 units/period. Lead time is rock-solid at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 548 units with 0 units in-transit. With 548 units on hand and 0 in transit, we already exceed the base stock level needed to cover the (L+1) = 5 period lead time window (approx 5 * 93 = 465 units). The backend will likely order 0 units given the on-hand supply exceeds the safety stock targets for this lower demand regime. I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this stabilized return to baseline.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean since Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 35, the average is approximately 92.1 units/period (values: 110, 125, 83, 71, 88, 53, 102, 88, 96, 135). This aligns with the initial baseline observed in Periods 1-12. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Currently, there is a significant inventory surplus (on-hand: 413) due to previous high-volume orders arriving while demand dropped by over 50%. Pipeline inventory is currently 0 as no orders were placed in the last five periods (P30-P34). Given the current on-hand inventory of 413 and a forecast mean of ~92, we have approximately 4.5 periods of stock on hand. Since the lead time is 4 periods, we are approaching the point where new orders may be necessary to maintain the base stock level (1+L)*mu_hat. I will set L to 'calculate' to use the 4-period history, and use 'recent_10' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower-demand regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a secondary baseline regime after a large peak between Periods 17 and 25. Since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 93 units per period (last 11 periods), effectively returning to the initial baseline level (~100). The current on-hand inventory is 301 units with 136 units in transit. Since the promised and actual lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (approx 465 units). The total pipeline (301 + 136 = 437) is nearly sufficient, but since on-hand inventory is decreasing toward the 5-period requirement, I am maintaining the mu_hat based on the recent 11-period regime to ensure the OR backend orders enough to maintain this level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1699.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean of approximately 97 units/period since Period 26, following a high-demand peak. This represents a return to levels near the initial baseline (P1-P12). The lead time remains consistently reliable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set parameters that align with this current stable regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full period since the downward shift began (P26-P37), providing a robust estimate of the current mean (~97) and variance. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is perfectly consistent with history. The high on-hand inventory (201) and in-transit units (270) mean the OR backend will likely order minimally until current stocks are drawn down to the new base stock level.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower mean following a peak that ended around Period 25. Since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 91.5 units per period. The in-transit inventory of 367 reflects orders placed in Periods 36, 37, and 38, which are expected to arrive in Periods 40, 41, and 42 respectively (based on the consistent 4-period lead time). Currently, at the start of Period 39, we have 71 units on hand and 0 arrival this period (since 0 units were ordered in Period 35). To determine the Period 39 parameter, I am using the recent stable regime (P26-P38) to estimate demand. Mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=13) to capture this post-peak baseline. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=13 to reflect the current volatility levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1269.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 26 and has remained stable at a lower mean. Averaging demand from Period 26 to Period 39 (14 periods) yields approximately 92.5 units per period, which aligns with the initial baseline. Current On-hand inventory is very low (4 units). In-transit inventory (506 units) reflects orders placed between P36 and P39, which are expected to arrive starting next period (P40 order arriving P44, P36 order arriving P40). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the system is recovering from a period of high inventory (where ordering was suspended from P30-P35) and demand has stabilized at the new lower level, I am using recent_N (N=14) to capture this current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the ~92.5 mean rather than the historical high-demand peak or the very early baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at approximately 92.5 units/period (P26-P39 average), confirming a full return to baseline levels following the P17-P25 surge.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean since Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 40, the average is approximately 92.3 units per period (\u03a3=1385, N=15), with a standard deviation of roughly 22.8 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 36 order in Period 40). While on-hand inventory is low (50 units), the pipeline is healthy with 435 units (orders from P37, P38, P39, P40). Using N=15 for recent_N captures the entirety of this current stable regime post-surge. This setting will provide the OR backend with appropriate statistics to maintain a high service level while managing holding costs as the inventory refills.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~92.5 units/period since the downward shift at Period 26 (P26-P41 average is 91.8). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and reliable, as confirmed by the arrival of the P37 order exactly 4 periods later in P41. Currently, there is an inventory of 97 units on-hand and 386 units in-transit (orders from P38, P39, P40, P41). To maintain the optimal service level while reflecting this stable regime, I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16, covering the entire period since the demand reset at P26. This allows the backend to calculate the base-stock level using the mean and variance from the current stable period (approx 92 units mean). Lead time (L) remains 'default' at 4.

Recent demand in Period 42 was 154, which is higher than the current mean but within expected volatility for this SKU. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 8 periods remaining in the game (P43 to P50), I am setting parameters to maintain the current baseline. I will use recent_N with N=17 (P26-P42) to capture the stable post-surge regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time of 4.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 26 at an average of approximately 94.6 units per period (P26-P43 average), following a significant surge between Periods 17 and 25. The most recent history (P40-P43) shows a slightly higher mean of 111.75 units, but the broader post-surge window is more indicative of the return to baseline. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 7 periods remaining in the game (P44-P50) and a lead time of 4, orders placed now will arrive in Period 48, leaving only 3 periods of sales potential (P48, P49, P50) for those arrivals. Given the current on-hand inventory of 63 and in-transit inventory of 374, we have 437 units committed. Anticipated demand for the remaining 7 periods (approx 95 * 7 = 665 units) suggest we need careful replenishment to avoid stockouts in the final periods while minimizing ending inventory. I will use a recent window of N=18 (from the P26 changepoint) to capture the stabilized demand mean and variance accurately for the backend OR logic.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~95-100 units following a significant surge (P17-P25) and subsequent drop (P26-P39). The current on-hand inventory is 44 units, and 'in-transit' units (452) include orders from P41, P42, P43, and P44. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. Since the shift back to baseline in P26, the average demand (P26-P44) is approximately 91 units, but recent demand (P40-P44) shows a slightly higher average of 106 units with volatility (high of 154). I will use a recent window (N=15) to capture the stabilized post-surge demand mean and variance while ignoring the extreme peak period. This balances the risk between the high inventory levels seen previously and the need to maintain stock for the current 4-period lead time window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2451.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable at a baseline level since Period 26. Analyzing the last 20 periods (P26-P45), the mean demand is approximately 96.9 units/period. The current regime (P40-P45) shows a slightly higher mean of ~110 units, but this is consistent with historical baseline fluctuations. On-hand inventory is 0 at the start of P46, but in-transit inventory (468 units) consists of orders from P42, P43, P44, and P45 (81, 143, 143, and 101 units respectively). These are scheduled to arrive in P46, P47, P48, and P49 based on the consistently confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Since the game ends at Period 50, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 periods (recent_N=20) to capture the current stable baseline accurately. Lead time (L) remains 'default' at its promised 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 of 50. Demand has returned to a stable baseline level (avg ~105 since Period 40). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (P47) will arrive in Period 51 (47 + 4 lead resolution), which is after the simulation concludes. Therefore, these units will only contribute to holding costs at the end of P50 and won't be sold. However, there is a substantial 'In-transit' pipeline of 518 units (from orders in P43-P46) scheduled to arrive in P47-P50. With 10 on-hand and 518 in-transit, we have 528 units to cover approximately 4 periods of demand (estimated at ~100-110 units/period). This is more than sufficient. To maximize total reward, I will set parameters to stop further ordering while still providing a statistical buffer for the OR backend, ensuring we don't buy units that cannot be sold before the game ends.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized around the baseline observed in Period 40 (~92.5 units/period). Since the shift back to baseline in Period 26, the average demand (P26-P47) is approximately 93 units, though recent periods (P40-P47) show a slightly higher localized mean of about 101 units. We are in the final stages of the 50-period game (currently Period 48). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals from P36 to P43. On-hand inventory is 79 units, and 478 units are in transit. Given the high profit to holding cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend targets a high service level. I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the stabilized post-peak regime and ensure sufficient inventory for the remaining 3 periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1898.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~92.5 units per period after a significant surge between Periods 17 and 25. Since Period 26, the demand has consistently fluctuate around this lower baseline. The most recent data from the last 10 periods (P39-P48) shows an average demand of approximately 103.7 units, indicating a slight uptick or just normal variance around the baseline. Given the upcoming end of the simulation (Period 50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. The lead time remains extremely stable at 4 periods. I am setting L to 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current stabilized demand regime and its volatility (approx 103.7 mean), ensuring the backend covers the remaining 2 periods of the game (L+1 coverage is adjusted by the OR engine, but since we are at P49, orders placed now will arrive at P53, which is beyond the game end). However, to maintain regular logic, I use the most recent regime data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2203.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~95-100 units following a return to baseline levels after the Period 17-25 surge. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (Period 34-49, N=16), the mean demand is approximately 98.7 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on all recent arrivals (P36-P45 orders), supporting a (1+L) = 5 period coverage window. Current on-hand inventory is 96 units with 376 units in-transit. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock level that covers approximately 500 units (5 * 100) adjusted for volatility, ensuring high service levels while managing holding costs as we conclude the tracking period.
