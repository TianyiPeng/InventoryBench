The product 'chips(Regular)' has a historical average demand of approximately 114 units (based on 5 provided samples: 131, 92, 118, 125, 106). Since stock-out costs are high (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0, and lost sales represent missed profit), and I am starting with 0 inventory, I must order enough to cover the lead time pipeline plus current demand. Expected lead time (4) + current period (1) = 5 periods of coverage needed. Total pipeline target = 114 * 5 = 570 units. I will order 570 units now to establish the pipeline, acknowledging that the first delivery won't arrive until Period 5 (at the earliest).",

Since the current pipeline (570 units) is intended to cover the first 5 periods of demand (approx 114 * 5 = 570), and lead time is significant (4 periods), I need to maintain a rolling pipeline to cover demand for Period 6 and beyond. Looking ahead, to cover Period 6 demand (arrival from an order placed in Period 2), I need to ensure the total units (on-hand + in-transit) cover total expected demand through Period 6.

With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P45-P50), terminal inventory risks are significant since the holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit margin ($1.0). I must avoid excess inventory at the end of Period 50. Total demand for the remaining 6 periods (P45-50) is estimated at 600-660 units. Current inventory position: On-hand (35) + In-transit (490) = 525 total units. The In-transit consists of: P41 (100), P42 (150), P43 (120), P44 (120). These will arrive in P45, P46, P47, and P48 respectively. To reach Period 50 with near-zero inventory, I need approximately 630 total units (105 * 6). Current total pipeline is 525. An order of 105 units today (P45) arrives in P49. This will bring the total supply to 630 units, covering the remaining periods while minimizing end-of-game waste.",

Total inventory available for the remainder of the game (P46-P50) without a new order is 44 (on-hand) + 150 + 120 + 120 + 105 = 539 units. Expected total demand for P46-P50 (5 periods * ~105 demand) is 525 units. Since 539 units are already in the pipeline or on-hand, an additional order would likely result in unnecessary holding costs for units that won't be sold before the game ends at P50. Therefore, I will place an order of 0 to maximize profit and minimize waste.",
