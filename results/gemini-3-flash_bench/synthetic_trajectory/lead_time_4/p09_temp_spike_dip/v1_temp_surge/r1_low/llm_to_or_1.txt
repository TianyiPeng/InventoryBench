Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical data on arrivals to verify the actual lead time, so I will use the promised lead time of 4. Demand history for the first 5 periods (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) shows a mean of 114.4 and a standard deviation of 15.6. Since we are at the very beginning of the simulation, I will use these 5 available samples to set the parameters. The backend calculates mu_hat as (1+L) * mean, which for L=4 is 5 * 114.4 = 572. Similarly, sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(1+L) * std, which is sqrt(5) * 15.6 \u2248 34.88. These parameters will help the OR backend establish an initial base stock level that accounts for the lead time plus the review period demand, targeting an optimal service level balanced against the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, an order of 141 units was placed, which is now 'In-transit'. However, because the lead time is at least 1, these units did not arrive in Period 1, resulting in 0 sales for a demand of 86 (on-hand was 0). We need to maintain a pipeline that covers demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including those provided in the background data) shows values: 131, 92, 118, 125, 106. The Period 1 demand in the history was 86. The mean demand is roughly 110. For mu_hat, I will use the default method which calculated (1+L)*mean_demand. Since we have no concluded arrivals yet to suggest the lead time is different from the promised 4, I will use the default L.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. Currently, 281 units are in transit (141 from P1, 140 from P2). On-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (at L=4, the P1 order should arrive in Period 5 and be visible in Period 6). Demand for P1-P2 was 86 and 132 respectively. Historical demand samples (P1-P5) average 114.4 with a standard deviation of 16.2. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5) will be low. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the early fluctuations in the samples provided.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Consequently, our current 'on-hand' inventory is 0, and all units ordered in Periods 1-3 (totaling 425) are 'in-transit'. Since no orders have reached their promised delivery time yet, there is no evidence that the lead time is anything other than the promised 4 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) is 131, 92, 118, 125, 106. Actual demand during the game (Periods 1-3) was 86, 132, and 100. The average of all available demand samples (5 historical + 3 game samples) is approximately 111.25. Given the high parity between profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), the target service level is 50%. The OR engine will use the 'default' lead time of 4 and compute the base stock. I will use 'default' for L and mu_hat, but I'll use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=8 (the total available samples) to ensure the variance calculation include the most relevant recent data points while maintaining stability.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 (totaling 557 units in-transit). Following the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 1+4=5, meaning it will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will read at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet, which is consistent with a 4-period lead time. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 131, 92, 118, 125, 106 (average \u2248 114.4, std \u2248 15.6). However, the conclude messages show lower realized demand (86, 132, 100, 75). Since the current period is 5 and we expect the first arrival in Period 5, I will maintain the default lead time (4) and the mean demand forecast based on all available samples (Period 1-5). Use of the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate as we are still in the early phase and the observed demand is relatively stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The first order (placed in Period 1) arrived at the start of Period 5 (after 4 periods), confirming the promised lead time of 4. On-hand inventory is 35, and there is a significant pipeline of 416 units (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4). The historical demand for periods 1-5 (86, 132, 100, 75, 106) averages 99.8 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 21.3. Given the Lead Time (L) is 4, the cycle we need to cover is 1+L = 5 periods. The OR backend will use these statistics to calculate a base stock. Since the demand appears relatively stable with no clear evidence of a regime shift or seasonality yet, I will use the default method for lead time and mu_hat, but I'll use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the most recent volatility which seems slightly higher in the early stage.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived at start of P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-21.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Based on the history, the promised lead time (L=4) is being consistently met, as evidenced by Period 1's order arriving in Period 5 and Period 2's order arriving in Period 6. Currently, we have 98 units on hand and 361 units in transit (orders from P3, P4, and P6). Historical demand for the first 6 periods has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 96 units per period (86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77). Since there's no clear evidence of a demand regime shift or seasonality (no calendar dates provided), I will use the mean of all available historical samples (N=6) to estimate the forecast. The OR backend uses a service level logic where q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. At this service level, the base stock will be close to the mean demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods). My parameters ensure the engine calculates appropriate safety stock levels to cover the 5-period risk window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-108.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the last 7 periods (86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67) shows an average of 91.8 and a standard deviation of 22.4. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (matches promised). The pipeline inventory is currently 238 units (orders from P4, P6, P7), and on-hand is 175. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) = 413 units. With L=4, we need base stock to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. 5 * 91.8 = 459. Our current inventory (413) is slightly below this target. No significant demand regime shifts or lead time deviations are observed beyond the confirmed L=4. I will use 'default' for lead time and 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand parameters to capture the full observed history while being responsive to the slight downward trend in recent demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-53.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Looking at the conclude messages, orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 all arrived with exactly a 4-period lead time (e.g., P1 arrived at the start of P5, P4 arrived at the start of P9). This confirms the actual lead time L = 4. Inventory reconciliation: On-hand is 180, and in-transit consists of orders from P6 (85), P7 (21), and P8 (47), totaling 153 units. Demand history shows some fluctuations but suggests a relatively stable pattern (Historical samples: 131, 92, 118, 125, 106; Recent concluded periods: 86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67, 127). The mean of the recent 8 concluded periods is 96.25, while the earlier historical samples had a higher mean. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the actual realized demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. The OR backend uses z* where q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 (since Profit and Holding cost are both $1.0), meaning it targets the median demand to balance stockout and holding costs.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing history, the actual lead time L=4 is consistently confirmed (P1-P4 orders all arrived exactly 4 periods later). In Period 9, no units arrived because nothing was ordered in Period 5, which matches expectations. Current on-hand is 70, with 290 units in transit (ordered in P6, P7, P8, and P9). Historical demand from Period 1 to Period 9 is [86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67, 127, 110]. The mean demand is approximately 97.7. There is no clear evidence of a demand regime shift or seasonal spike yet. Since lead time is stable at 4, the default method is appropriate. For demand parameters, I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture all activity since the game began, given the variability observed (range 67-132). This ensures that base_stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'chips(Regular)' has a confirmed lead time of 4 periods based on the arrival history (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 all showed lead_time=4). The promised lead time is also 4. Current inventory shows 47 on-hand and 334 in-transit. The order from Period 7 (21 units) is expected to arrive during Period 11, the order from Period 8 (47 units) in Period 12, and so on. Historical demand has been relatively stable with a mean of ~102 units and a standard deviation of ~21 units across all 10 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the full recent history since there is no evidence of a regime shift. Setting L to 'default' matches the observed 4-period lead time. This will guide the OR backend to maintain a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (L+1), effectively balancing the high holding cost ($1.0) against the profit ($1.0).

In Period 11, we had a stockout because the small arrival from Period 7 (21 units) plus existing inventory (47 units) could not satisfy the demand of 125 units. We have 426 units in transit (ordered in Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11). Specifically, the order from Period 8 (47 units) is expected to arrive during Period 12 and be visible in Period 13. The historical demand average is approximately 102 units per period (mean of 11 samples). Given the stockout in Period 11, we must ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full recent demand distribution while respecting the stable 4-period lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. The promised lead time is 4. Concluded arrivals from periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 all confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. Note: Period 5 had an order of 0, which correctly reflects the gap in arrivals at Period 9. The current situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in Periods 11 and 12 because historical orders (from Periods 7 and 8) were too low. The demand samples provided (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) and the observed demand in the game history (ranging from 67 to 132, averaging around 104) suggest a stable demand regime. However, the OR engine needs to account for the current (L+1) window. I will use a recent window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility (N=12) and stick to the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (validated by arrivals for orders from P1-4 and P6-9). The current on-hand inventory is 25 units, with 382 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders placed in P10, P11, P12, and P13 totaling 129 + 113 + 80 + 60 = 382). Demand remains relatively stable. Over the last 13 periods (concluded data), the average demand is 106.1 units per period. Using recent_N=8 for the mu_hat calculation provides a good balance between historical context and recent stockout pressures experienced in P11 and P12. The service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, meaning base stock will target the median demand over the (L+1) horizon. Setting L=4 (default) and using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (approx 530 units) while accounting for the significant pipeline of 382 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit to holding cost ratio of 1:1, leading to a critical fractile of 0.5. This means the OR backend seeks to target the median demand (base_stock \u2248 mu_hat) to balance stockouts and holding costs. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14 arrivals) confirms an actual lead time (L) of exactly 4 periods consistently. Demand history shows relatively stable consumption: initial samples averaged ~114, and recent samples (P1-P14) average ~103. Specifically, the last 8 periods (P7-P14) show a mean of 111.4 units. Since demand is stable and lead time is reliable at 4, I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent local demand variance and mean, and use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the proven 4-period duration.

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the history (confirming the Carry-Over Insight). Demand over the last 15 periods has been fluctuating around a mean of ~105 units. However, recent demand (last 3-5 periods) suggests a slight stabilization or uptick (112, 98, 114). The on-hand inventory is 55, while 'In-transit' is 381. Looking at the history, orders from Period 12 (80 units), 13 (60 units), 14 (130 units), and 15 (111 units) are in transit (total 381). Since L=4, the Period 12 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 16. To maintain a sufficient base stock for (L+1)=5 periods of demand, I will use a recent demand window to capture current trends. Given the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the OR backend will target the median demand (z=0). I'll use N=10 to balance historical stability with recent shifts.

Daily Profit: $135.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 17. The observation from Period 16 shows a significant demand spike (195 units) compared to the previous average (approx. 100-110). While the Carry-over insight confirms lead time remains stable at 4 periods, current On-hand is 0, indicating a stockout occurred in Period 16 due to this demand surge. In-transit inventory stands at 400 units, which matches the sum of orders from P13 (60), P15 (111), and P16 (99), plus a missing shipment from P14 (130). However, looking closely at history, the order from P14 (130) should have arrived during P18. The current in-transit includes orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16. To stabilize, I will use recent_N for both demand mean and sigma to capture the recent volatility and the demand jump. N=5 is chosen to balance the pre-spike and post-spike demand levels for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. L remains default as 4 periods as consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 16 (195 units), up from a prior 10-period average of ~105 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand reached an all-time high of 251 units, following a spike to 195 in Period 16. The previous average was ~105 units. This indicates a sustained regime shift or a significant seasonal peak. My on-hand inventory is currently 0, and combined demand in the last two periods (446) has far exceeded arrivals (140). The order placed in Period 14 (130 units) is expected to arrive during Period 18, and Period 15 (111 units) in Period 19. Due to the rapid depletion and high demand trend, I need to drastically adjust the forecast (mu_hat) to capture this new level. I will use the average of the last 2 periods (approx 223 units/period) to set my explicit demand forecast for the lead time horizon (L+1 = 5 periods). Therefore, mu_hat = 223 * 5 = 1115. Lead time L is stable at 4 periods. Sigma_hat is set higher to account for the increased volatility during this spike.

Carry-over insight: Major demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-17 avg demand increased to ~223 units/period, compared to the previous baseline of ~105 units (+112%).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 with a confirmed demand regime shift beginning in Period 16. Demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 195, 251, and 189 units respectively, averaging 211.7 units. This is a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~105. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the spike outstripping recent arrivals. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To capture the new demand level while weighting recent observations most heavily, I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). Given the high demand and the 4-period lead time, we need to ensure the pipeline of 716 units and new orders satisfy the (L+1)=5 period horizon. L remains at default (4) as the observed lead times are consistently 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and sustained: P16-P18 avg demand is 211.7 units (+100% vs prior baseline). On-hand inventory depleted due to spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has been 195, 251, 189, and 177, averaging 203.0 units. This is a significant sustained increase from the previous baseline of ~105 units. Our inventory position is critical: on-hand is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts for the last four periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the stockout situation, the OR backend needs to target a base stock levels that account for this new mean and heightened volatility. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect observed stability, and mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture specifically the high-demand regime dynamics (P16-P19) while filtering out the lower historical data. This will trigger the OR engine to place larger orders to recover inventory and meet the new 200+ unit/period demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: P16-P19 avg demand is 203.0 units. Frequent stockouts since P16 due to this +93% increase vs baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 21. Demand has undergone a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. The average demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) is 213.2 units per period (195, 251, 189, 177, 254), compared to the prior baseline of ~105. This represents an increase of over 100%. Due to the 4-period lead time, we have experienced stockouts since P16 because orders placed before the spike were insufficient. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To stabilize inventory levels and meet this higher demand, I will set L to recent_N (N=5) to confirm the 4-period stability, mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher mean (approx 213.2 * 5 units), and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility in this new high-demand regime. This will raise the base stock level and help clear the backlog of lost sales once the larger orders (placed from P17 onwards) begin arriving in P21/P22.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P16-P20): Mean demand increased to 213.2 units/period, representing a sustained ~100% increase over the original baseline.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand from P16 to P21 is approximately 217.3 units (195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238), which is more than double the original baseline of ~105. We are currently experiencing stockouts (On-hand: 0) as older, smaller orders arrive and fail to meet this new demand level. The Lead Time 'L' remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals from P15-P17). To catch up and stabilize inventory, mu_hat must reflect this new demand level across the lead time + review period (5 periods total). I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the mean of this new high-demand regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed since Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P16-P21): Mean demand increased to ~217 units/period from the original ~105 units/period baseline (+107%).

The demand regime shifted fundamentally starting at Period 16. Analyzing the recent stable period (P16-P22), the mean demand is approximately 222 units per period (195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238, 250), with a standard deviation of approximately 32.7. Previous periods (1-15) averaged ~106 units. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods. Since the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, and there have been significant stockouts recently, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture only the new high-demand regime. The profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% for the base stock calculation, though the backend's capped policy will safely manage the upper bound. Setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' for N=7 correctly captures the increased volatility of the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P16-P22): Mean demand is ~222 units/period, a sustained +109% increase from the initial baseline (~106).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 23 (8 samples), the average has increased to approximately 217.25 units per period, compared to the initial baseline of ~105 units. Recent demand samples are: 195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238, 250, 184. This shift is sustained and stable. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 22 and 23). Currently, on-hand inventory is 146 and in-transit inventory is 780. The total pipeline covers roughly 4.2 periods of the new demand level. To maintain service levels under this high-demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new mean (~217) and higher volatility observed since the shift. The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+L) * mean_recent + z * sqrt(1+L) * std_recent. With L=4, this targets a safety stock based on 5 periods of demand.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a new high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 24 (9 samples), the mean is 219.5 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 30.5 units. This is a significant (+110%) and sustained increase from the initial baseline of ~105 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently low (50 units) after several periods of stockouts following the regime shift, though large orders placed during the transition are now arriving (215, 273, and 161 units are in the pipeline from recent periods). To ensure the OR backend captures this new mean and volatility correctly without being diluted by the early low-demand history, I am using recent_N with N=9 to cover the entirety of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed as long-term: average demand stabilized at 219.5 units (+110% vs baseline) with increased volatility (std dev ~31).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly starting in Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 25 (the last 10 samples), the mean demand is 214.7 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 32.5. This is a sustained +/- 100% increase over the initial baseline of ~106 units. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival messages (P17-P21 orders arriving exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is currently low (29) due to high demand, but the pipeline (In-transit: 898) is healthy, containing large orders placed during the high-demand phase (P22: 215, P23: 273, P24: 161, P25: 249). I am using recent_N=10 to capture this new regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring the base stock level (for L+1 = 5 periods) reflects the current mean of ~215 instead of the lifetime average which is pulled down by the first 15 periods. This should maintain a high service level while the OR backend manages the pipeline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly starting in Period 16. Since then (P16-P26), the mean demand has stabilized around 203.8 units per period, compared to the initial baseline of ~105. Period 26 saw a lower demand of 95, but it's too early to declare a downward shift given the holiday/event-related volatility often seen in 'chips' categories. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 149 and in-transit at 830, we are currently catching up to the backlogged demand. I am using recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime while reflecting the recent lower observation's impact on volatility. The OR backend will use these to maintain a high service level for this high-margin-to-holding-cost ratio (Profit=1, Holding=1, implied service level ~50% in base stock model, but the cap and pipeline logic protect against stockouts).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-254.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from a baseline of ~105 units to approximately 220 units. However, the last two periods (P26 and P27) have shown a sudden and sharp drop in demand to 95 and 84 units respectively. This could indicate either a standard mean-reversion, the end of a seasonal peak, or a new regime shift. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, effectively targeting the median. Our current on-hand inventory (338) and in-transit (598) are very high relative to the recent drop. To avoid excessive holding costs if this lower demand persists, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the high-demand period (P23-P25) with the low-demand period (P26-P27), allowing the policy to start cooling down while remaining prepared if the dip is temporary. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly after P26; demand dropped from a ~220 average to <100 for two consecutive periods (P26-P27), suggesting a possible end to the high-demand regime identified at P16.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. From Period 16 to 25, demand averaged approximately 219.5 units. However, since Period 26, demand has dropped significantly (P26: 95, P27: 84, P28: 121), averaging 100 units over the last 3 periods. This suggests a return to the original low-demand baseline (~105 units). On-hand inventory is currently high (378 units) with a large in-transit pipeline (437 units). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the recent drop in demand, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new lower demand regime and avoid excessive inventory accumulation. Lead time L is stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Demand returned to baseline levels, averaging 100 units (P26-P28) from a previous high of ~220.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-431.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly returned to its baseline level (approx 100-110 units/period) after a significant spike that lasted from Period 16 to Period 25. The most recent demand samples are 95, 84, 121, and 98 (P26-P29), averaging 99.5. Simultaneously, large orders placed during the high-demand regime are now arriving (273 units in P27, 161 in P28, 249 in P29), leading to a high on-hand inventory of 529 units. Given that the lead time is consistently 4 periods and the current pipeline plus on-hand inventory (529 + 188 = 717) is more than sufficient to cover demand for the next L+1 (5) periods (estimated total demand ~500), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the return to baseline demand levels. This will discourage the OR backend from placing unnecessary additional orders, helping to reduce holding costs while the excess inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand returned to baseline level of ~100 units/period (P26-P29 avg: 99.5) following the Period 16-25 spike.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that occurred between Periods 16-25 (average demand ~220) has clearly ended. Demand from Period 26 onwards has returned to the initial baseline levels, with values of 95, 84, 121, 98, and 117. The mean demand for this recent 5-period window (P26-P30) is 103 units, which is consistent with the pre-spike average of ~105. Due to heavy ordering during the high-demand period, on-hand inventory is now very high (559 units), which at current demand levels covers over 5 periods of demand. The pipeline inventory is small (41 units from P27), and no orders were placed in P28-P30. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the return to baseline demand and prevent further unnecessary ordering while the inventory is being worked down. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to its baseline level (approx. 100 units/period) following a significant 10-period spike (P16-P25). Analysis of the last 6 periods (P26-P31) shows a mean demand of 103.6 units with significantly reduced volatility compared to the spike period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 493 units with no units in transit. Given the current demand (approx. 100/period) and lead time (4 periods), the optimal 'pipeline' or base stock level should cover approximately 5 periods of demand (~500 units). As the current inventory (493) is very close to this target and the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will result in a near-zero or zero order, I will use recent_N methodology (N=6) to capture the current stable baseline regime. This will prevent over-ordering while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the current demand levels.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has returned to the baseline levels observed before the Period 16-25 spike. From Period 26 to Period 32, demand has averaged 104.9 units (95, 84, 121, 98, 117, 107, 112), which matches the initial baseline (approx. 105 units). Inventory levels are currently very high (On-hand: 381) due to large orders placed during the high-demand regime arriving after demand softened. With a lead time of 4 periods, we must set parameters that prevent further overstocking while demand remains at this lower level. I will use a recent_N of 7 for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this stabilized baseline. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully stabilized at the baseline level of ~105 units/period following the Period 26 shift (P26-P32 avg: 104.9).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has returned to the baseline level observed prior to Period 16. Analyzing the most recent period (P26-P33), the mean demand is approximately 104.5 units per period. The inventory levels are currently high (on-hand 279) due to the delayed response to the demand drop that occurred at P26. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to maintain a pipeline that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1). A base stock calculation using the baseline mean (~105) and current volatility suggests a target inventory around 525-550 units. Currently, on-hand (279) + in-transit (144) = 423 units. My parameter logic will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) with N=8 (since Period 26) to reflect the sustained return to baseline levels. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to capture current volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' as 4-period delivery is stable.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized back to its baseline level following the spike between periods 16-25. Since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 104 units per period (P26-P34 avg: 103.8), consistent with the pre-spike baseline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since my current position (On-hand 199 + In-transit 244) is 443, and the target base stock for a lead time of 4 and a target service level of 0.5 (as profit and holding cost are both $1) would be roughly (1+L)*mu = 5 * 104 = 520, I need to maintain orders to reach that level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture only the stable baseline demand since the regime change at Period 26. This filters out the high-demand volatility from the previous spike.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to its initial baseline level of approximately 105 units per period following a significant spike between Periods 16 and 25. Recent demand (P26-P35) averages 103.8 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. My strategy is to set parameters based on this stabilized 'new' baseline to avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level. Since Period 32, the backend has started ordering again (total in-transit is 310 units from orders in P32-P35), but those orders have not yet arrived due to the 4-period lead time. Order from P32 should arrive during P36 resolution. Given on-hand inventory is 77, and demand is ~105, we require the pipeline to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5). I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized back to its baseline level of approximately 105 units per period after a significant spike between Periods 16 and 25. The last 11 periods (P26-P36) show an average demand of 102.6 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by the arrival in Period 36 of the Period 32 order. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (12 units), but in-transit inventory is high (413 units), which represents orders from P33, P34, P35, and P36. To maintain stability, I will use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime post-spike, and use the promised lead time (L=4) which is consistent with historical performance.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized back to its baseline after a significant spike that ended around Period 26. Since then, the mean demand has hovered around 100-105 units per period. The recent N (P26-P37) mean is approximately 98.4. On-hand inventory is currently 75, with a pipeline of 384 units scheduled to arrive (orders from Periods 34, 35, 36, and 37). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to maintain the baseline forecast (mu_hat) using the recent stable period (N=12) and keep sigma_hat calibrated to recent volatility to ensure sufficient stock without over-ordering, especially since the pipeline is quite full compared to the target base stock (approx 500-600 units).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 105 units since Period 26. Specifically, the last 13 periods (P26-P38) show a mean demand of 101.8 units. The high-demand spike observed between P16 and P25 has concluded, and we are back to a baseline regime. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in P36, P37, and P38 (all showing lead_time=4). On-hand inventory is currently low (43 units), but there are 319 units in transit, which should cover the next several periods of demand. I will use recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable post-spike regime, and L=default (4) since the observed lead time matches the promised lead time.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stabilized baseline regime since Period 26, following a high-demand spike between Periods 16-25. Analysis of the last 14 periods (P26-P39) shows an average demand of approximately 101.6 units per period, which aligns with the initial baseline observed at the start of the simulation. I will use N=14 for the demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stable post-spike behavior. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (e.g., Period 35 order arrived at Period 39). Current on-hand inventory is low (28), but we have a healthy pipeline of 389 units. The chosen parameters aim to maintain a high service level for the current 102 units/period demand while managing holding costs as the inventory stabilizes.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to and stabilized at its baseline level of approximately 105 units per period since Period 26. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (Periods 33-40), the average demand is 100.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed deliveries (P32-P36 all arrived with lead_time=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 21 units and there are 342 units in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, P40), which roughly covers the next 3.4 periods of demand at the current rate. To maintain optimal stock levels and account for the (L+1) planning horizon, I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand profile, while using the calculate method for L to ensure the backend uses the proven 4-period lead time.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stable baseline regime since Period 26, following a temporary high-demand spike. Analyzing the last 15 periods (P26-P41), the average demand is approximately 105.1 units per period with a standard deviation of 25.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on recent arrivals (P36, P37, P40, P41 \ubaa8\ub450 ordered + 4 periods). We are currently at Period 42 with 0 on-hand inventory due to a slightly higher-than-average demand of 142 in Period 41. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 periods (N=15) to cover the current stabilized regime and filtering out the older high-demand noise. This ensures the base stock calculation effectively covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at its baseline level since Period 26, averaging approximately 105 units per period. I am currently in a stockout situation (on-hand inventory = 0) at the start of Period 43, with the most recent demand (P41-P42) showing high variability (142 then 79 units). The pipeline (in-transit) is 492 units, which is quite high relative to the average demand. According to the 4-period lead time, orders from Period 39 (136 units) should arrive during Period 43, Period 40 (82 units) during Period 44, Period 41 (137 units) during Period 45, and Period 42 (137 units) during Period 46. This inflow of roughly 492 units over the next 4 periods should satisfy the next 4 periods of demand (estimated at ~420 units total). Since the OR backend uses a capped policy (base_stock - pipeline), setting parameters that reflect the current stable regime (N=17 for demand samples P26-P42) will prevent excessive ordering while ensuring the pipeline covers the expected lead-time demand. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 105 units since Period 26, following a significant high-demand regime. Recent demand (P39-P43) has shown slightly more volatility with values ranging from 79 to 142. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (14 units) due to a stockout in Period 42. In-transit inventory stands at 380 units, which represents just under 4 periods of future demand (380 / 105 \u2248 3.6 periods). To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the current low on-hand stock, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable regime since Period 26 (N=18 periods). This ensures the base stock calculation covers demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to its baseline level following a significant spike between Periods 16 and 25. Since Period 26, the average demand has been approximately 104 units per period. In the last 10 periods (P35-P44), the mean demand is 107.1 with a standard deviation of 29.5. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P46-P50), the primary objective is to maintain service levels while minimizing ending inventory. Currently, on-hand inventory is 31 and in-transit is 426. Orders from P41-P44 (totaling 426 units) are expected to arrive in P45-P48. Specifically, the order from P41 (137 units) is due this period (P45). Given the proximity to the end of the simulation, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable baseline (recent_N=19, covering the period since the last regime shift at P26) to avoid over-ordering as the game concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable at the baseline level of ~105 units/period since Period 26. Analyzing the last 20 periods (P26-P45), the mean demand is approximately 101.5 units with a standard deviation of about 24.5 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P46-P50), we must ensure that any order placed now (which arrives in P50) covers the final period's demand without creating excessive ending inventory, as the game ends at the conclusion of P50. Current on-hand is 77 and total in-transit is 343 (arriving in P46, P47, P48, P49). Total supply available for the remaining 5 periods is 77 + 343 = 420 units. Expected total demand for the next 5 periods is roughly 5 * 105 = 525 units. This indicates a slight deficit (~105 units) to finish the game. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current stable regime's statistics accurately. Lead time (L) remains 'default' (4).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a baseline of ~105 units per period following the high-demand regime that occurred between Periods 16-25. Since Period 26, demand has consistently averaged ~103 units. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 88 units and the pipeline inventory is 294 units (total stock position 382). With 5 periods remaining in the simulation and a lead time of 4, the target inventory position needs to cover the remainder of the simulation carefully to balance service levels against potential terminal holding costs. Specifically, the base stock formula should target roughly (L+1) periods of demand, which at 103 units/period is ~515. However, since there are only 4 periods left to order (P47, P48, P49, P50), and the simulation ends at P50, I will set mu_hat based on the stable regime since P26 (N=21 periods) to ensure the OR backend maintains this baseline. Volatility has also normalized, so I will use the recent_N method for sigma_hat as well.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a baseline of ~105 units since Period 26, following a temporary high-demand regime. Analysis of the last 20 periods (P28-P47) shows a mean demand of 101.3 units with a standard deviation of 25.1. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, as evidenced by the arrival of shipments from P40-P43 exactly 4 periods later. Currently, we have 30 units on-hand and 402 units in-transit. Given that the simulation ends at Period 50 and we are currently at Period 48, orders placed now (P48) with a 4-period lead time will not arrive before the game concludes (arrival would be during P52 resolution). Therefore, the L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat parameters are set to maintain the stabilized baseline forecast for the internal backend logic, although subsequent ordering is unlikely to impact final results.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units per period following the high-demand regime that ended at Period 26. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P39-P48), the average demand is 97.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27.7. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only two periods remaining in the game (P49 and P50), and an on-hand inventory of 91 units plus a large in-transit pipeline of 358 units, we are significantly overstocked relative to the remaining expected demand (~200 units total). The current pipeline alone covers more than 3 periods of demand. To minimize holding costs in the final transition while ensuring availability for the current period, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 10-period window to accurately reflect the current stable baseline. The OR backend's capped policy will naturally limit further ordering given the high pipeline-to-base-stock ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable at the baseline level (approx. 104 units/period) since the regime shift back in Period 26. Looking at the last 15 periods (P35-P49), the mean demand is approximately 101.4 units with a standard deviation of 26.3. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages (e.g., P45 order arrived in P49 resolution). Inventory is currently at 35 units on-hand with 351 units in-transit, which aligns with covering the lead-time window of (L+1)=5 periods. I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable baseline variability while excluding the historical spike period (P16-P25).
