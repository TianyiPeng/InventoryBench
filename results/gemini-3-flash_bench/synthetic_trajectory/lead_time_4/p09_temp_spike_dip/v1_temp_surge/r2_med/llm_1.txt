Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 575. I need to ensure coverage for (L+1) = 5 periods. Total demand expected for Periods 1-5 (using a conservative average of ~100) is roughly 500 units. My existing pipeline (575) already covers the likely demand through the arrival of the next order. However, since On-hand is 0 and I have already missed sales in Period 1 (sold 0 due to 0 inventory), I am in a stockout situation until the first shipment arrives. Placing more orders now won't fix the immediate stockout but ensures continuity.

My current pipeline already exceeds the expected demand for the lead time coverage window (598 > 525). To avoid excessive holding costs (which are $1/unit compared to $4 profit), I will order a maintenance quantity of 100 units to keep the pipeline balanced for Period 20, as the earlier surplus will gradually diminish.",

  "rationale": "The demand regime is currently stable at approximately 100-110 units per period (the average for Periods 40-46 is ~104). The business is in Period 47 of 50, which is critical for inventory management. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 47 will arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends). Therefore, any order placed now will only incur holding costs or settle pipeline without affecting sales. The current pipeline consists of On-hand (119) and In-transit (375). Breaking down the In-transit: Period 43 order (125) arrives P47, Period 44 order (125) arrives P48, Period 45 order (125) arrives P49, and Period 46 order (0) arrives P50. Total units available for the remaining 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50) = On-hand (119) + P43 arrival (125) + P44 arrival (125) + P45 arrival (125) = 494 units. Expected demand for 4 periods \u2248 420-440 units. Since the available stock covers all remaining demand and any further orders cannot arrive before the game ends, I will place an order of 0 to maximize profit and minimize final holding costs.",

Period 48 (Period_48) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are currently in Period 48 of 50. The game ends after Period 50, meaning we only need to satisfy demand for Periods 48, 49, and 50. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Orders placed today (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (48+4), which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, any order placed now will only incur costs and serve no purpose for fulfilling demand. Current on-hand inventory is 170 units. Recent demand (Periods 44-47) has averaged 89.5 units per period. With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), total expected demand is approximately 270 units. We have 170 units on hand and 250 units in-transit. The arrivals scheduled for Period 48 (ordered P44) and Period 49 (ordered P45) will satisfy the remaining demand. No further orders are needed.",

Since the game ends at the conclusion of Period 50, any order placed now (Period 49) would arrive in Period 53 (49 + 4), which is past the game's horizon. Consequently, any units ordered now will only incur procurement costs without any possibility of being sold to generate profit. The current total pipeline consists of 189 units on-hand and 125 units in-transit (ordered in Period 45, expected to arrive in Period 49 conclusion/visible Period 50). This total of 314 units is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining two periods (Avg ~100/period). Ordering more would only decrease the total reward.",

For the final period, the primary goal is to minimize ending inventory (to avoid unnecessary holding costs) while still meeting demand for the current period.

On-hand inventory is currently 193 units, and the established demand regime is approximately 100 units/period (average demand for Periods 41-49 is ~105 units). Since on-hand inventory (193) is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the final period, and there is no future periods to stock for, the optimal order quantity is 0.",
