Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.00 and a holding cost of $1.00. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no prior history or carry-over insights to suggest a lead time deviation or a regime shift, I will use 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. The backend will calculate the mean (114.4) and standard deviation (16.27) based on the 5 available historical samples (131, 92, 118, 125, 106). With L=4, the review+lead window is 5 periods. The base stock level will be set to cover demand over those 5 periods plus a safety stock buffer calculated from the service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an initial order of 141 units was placed. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, this order is in-transit and not expected to arrive until the arrival phase of Period 5 (becoming visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in 46 lost sales in Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 samples averaged 114.4 units, but the actual realized demand in Period 1 was 46. Given the low sample size (1 period of realized game history vs 5 historical samples), I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical data (the 5 provided samples + 1 game period) to calculate the base stock. The OR backend will use the promised lead time L=4 and calculate mu_hat as (1+4)*mean(demand) and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+4)*std(demand). The in-transit 141 units will be subtracted from the target base stock to determine the next order.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Our promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. As per the mechanics, orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) and Period 2 (155 units) are currently in-transit and are not expected to arrive until the resolution phases of Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. This explains the current 0 on-hand inventory and the 'sold=0' status despite demand. Total in-transit is 296 units. Demand history shows Period 1 (46), Period 2 (131), and provided historical periods 1-5 (~92-131). The mean of the visible 7 samples (including Game History) is approximately 107. Since we are in the early phase and still within the first lead-time window, I will use 'default' (promised L=4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the most relevant recent variance and mean.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. No inventory has arrived yet because the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). We are currently experiencing stockouts (sold=0) due to 0 initial on-hand inventory. Demand over the first 3 periods reflects the provided samples (Period 1: 46 (actual) vs 131 (sample estimate), Period 2: 131, Period 3: 87). The historical demand samples provided in the prompt (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) suggest an average demand of ~114 units/period. The pipeline (in-transit) of 458 units corresponds to the sum of orders from P1-P3 (141+155+162). I will use the default promised lead time (L=4) and calculate the demand parameters based on the most recent 5 samples provided in the prompt context to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Total in-transit inventory is 560 units. Current on-hand is 0, resulting in lost sales for periods 1-4. Historical demand for periods 1-4 was [46, 131, 87, 130], with an average of 98.5 units. The seed data for periods 1-5 [131, 92, 118, 125, 106] shows a slightly higher average of 114.4 units. Combining these, the overall average demand is approximately 107 units. Since there is no clear trend or seasonality yet, I will use all available samples (9 total) to calculate the forecast. For L, I retain 'default' (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest otherwise. mu_hat will be set to (1+L) * mean across all samples to ensure the base stock covers the lead time plus the current period (5 periods total). sigma_hat will also use the default calculation across all samples to capture historical volatility.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed in Period 1) arrived at the end of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 131, 92, 118, 125, 106 (average \u2248 114.4). Note: The 'sold=0' in Periods 1-4 was due to zero arrival/on-hand inventory, not lack of demand. Current on-hand is 36, and in-transit (pipeline) is 450 (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). Given the stable demand pattern and confirmed lead time, I will use the default lead time and recent_N for demand statistics (N=5) to capture the base demand level. The OR engine will use these to maintain a base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $664.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms this: Period 1's order arrived in Period 5 (L=4) and Period 2's order arrived in Period 6 (L=4). Using L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current on-hand is low (20), but in-transit is high (375). Total inventory (395) covers roughly 3.4 periods of recent average demand (~115). Demand over the last 6 periods suggests a mean around 111.6 and std around 40. However, Period 6 saw a jump to 171. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the recent trend without overreacting entirely to the Period 6 spike, while using L=4 (default) as it is consistently confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $283.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages for Period 5 (P1 order), Period 6 (P2 order), and Period 7 (P3 order). Demand has been relatively stable with an average around 109 units (P1-P7). In-transit inventory is 390 (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), and on-hand is 89. Given the consistency of lead time and demand, I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the local mean and variance. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $234.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). On-hand inventory is 106 units. The pipeline (In-transit) is 429 units, comprising orders from P5 (31), P6 (80), P7 (177), and P8 (141). Demand has been somewhat volatile recently, with a sharp spike in Period 6 (171) followed by a return to lower levels (93, 85). Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. The 8 historical demand samples are: 131, 92, 118, 125, 106 (from prompt), 46, 131, 87, 130, 105, 171, 93, 85 (from history). Wait, the prompt lists 5 samples and the history lists 8 conclude messages. Combining all available demand data (P1-P8 conclude: 46, 131, 87, 130, 105, 171, 93, 85) results in a mean of ~106. Since demand is currently fluctuating but not showing a distinctive new regime shift yet, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and average demand Level (~107.8). L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the observed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time (Confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 9). Inventory currently sits at 37 units on-hand with 513 units in-transit. Over the last 9 periods, demand has shown some volatility but no clear trend shift, averaging approximately 113 units per period (Avg of P1-P9: 113.1). To ensure the OR backend captures the most relevant demand profile, I am using a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to encompass all realized demand data since the game start. This covers the (L+1) horizon (5 periods) and accounts for the initial stockouts. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4) * mean(last 9 samples), providing a base stock level that targets an 80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (Periods 5 through 10), matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows a mean of 111.4 units across the first 5 samples and a mean of 109.2 units for the last 5 samples (Periods 6-10). The demand appears relatively stable with no clear regime shift or seasonal trend evident from the period numbers (Period_1 to Period_10). On-hand inventory is low (20 units), but we have 477 units in-transit. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The backend will use the base-stock policy to calculate the order. I will use 'calculate' for L to leverage the confirmed 4-period lead time, and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available demand data, as there is no significant evidence of a shift in the demand distribution.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory arrived as expected (Period 7 order arrived in Period 11). Current on-hand is 116 units with 396 in-transit (orders from periods 8, 9, 10, and 11). Demand has stabilized after an early spike in Period 6. The last 5 periods (Period 7-11) show an average demand of 91.2 units (93, 85, 100, 97, 81), which is lower than the initial average. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent lower volatility and mean demand, while keeping L as 'default' (4 periods). The target base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods. With \u03bc \u2248 91, the backend will target a base stock around 455 units. Pipeline (396) + On-hand (116) = 512, which is slightly above target, likely leading to a small or zero order this period to bleed off excess inventory and minimize holding costs.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 13. Based on the delivery history (Periods 5 through 12), the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Therefore, L=4 is reliable. Demand history shows a stable pattern with minor fluctuations. The demand for the last 12 periods (P1-P12) shows a mean of approximately 101.5. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 100, 97, 81, 93, 101.5 implied) is relatively stable around the 90-100 range. Current on-hand inventory is 164, and in-transit inventory is 255. Total pipeline (419) comfortably covers the expected demand over the lead time (L+1=5 periods). I will use mean values derived from the last 8 periods (since the initial stock-out period ended) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the backend maintains the target service level (q = 0.8) while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14. Historically, the lead time has been consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and observation of arrivals through Period 13). Demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 9-13), demand has been 100, 97, 81, 93, 125, averaging approximately 99 units per period. Prior samples (Period 1-5 and history) suggested a slightly higher average around 110-115, but the recent 5-period window reflects the most current trend. We have 154 units on hand and 290 units in transit (ordered in Periods 10-13). Total pipeline inventory is 444. Using L=4, the base stock targets the next 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average of ~100 and a standard deviation roughly around 15-20, the base stock would be around 500-600. The OR backend will calculate the specific base stock using our parameters. I'll use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior while maintaining stability. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed historical performance.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current context is Period 15. Historical analysis shows lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by all arrivals from Period 5 through 14). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable. Calculating the demand over the last 10 periods (Periods 5-14) shows a mean demand of 104.8 and a standard deviation of 26.6. Our current on-hand inventory is 91 with 329 units in-transit. The total pipeline + on-hand is 420. Based on a lead time of 4 (requiring coverage for 1+L = 5 periods), 5 periods of average demand (5 x 104.8) equals 524 units. With current inventory at 420, we are slightly below the target base stock level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most stable demand regime since the initial stock-up phase. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $428.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) appears stable, oscillating between ~80 and ~130 units. The mean demand of all historical samples (Periods 1-15) is approximately 105 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by all concluded shipments (P1 to P11). Currently, we have 64 units on-hand and 382 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, and P15). With a lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Given the stable demand pattern, using all historical samples (N=15) provides a robust estimate for mean and variance. The OR backend will use these to calculate the base stock and place a replenishment order if the target level exceeds the pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $256.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked to 164 units (the highest observed), leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0, sold only 64). Crucially, the order placed in Period 12 (141 units) did not arrive in Period 16 as expected based on the confirmed 4-period lead time. This suggests either a lead time delay or a lost shipment. I am currently holding 0 on-hand inventory with 515 units in-transit (P12: 0, P13: 150, P14: 83, P15: 149, P16: 133). Note: The P12 order was actually 0 units, which explains the 'arrived=0' in Period 16 (it wasn't a lost shipment, just a zero-order). The mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 107.5. To recover from the stockout and account for the recent demand spike, I will use a 5-period window for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the higher recent demand average (~122) and increase sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. I will maintain L=4 as the promised and previously observed lead time remain consistent.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 18. Analysis of the game history confirms a recurring lead time (L) of 4 periods. However, there is a critical delivery disruption: the order placed in Period 12 (ordered=0) would have arrived in Period 16, resulting in 'arrived=0'. This left the system with 0 on-hand inventory, causing stockouts in Period 16 (demand 164, sold 64) and Period 17 (demand 194, sold 150). The order from Period 13 arrived in Period 17 as expected. Demand has shown a recent increase: the last three periods (P15-P17) had demands of 123, 164, and 194, significantly higher than the previous average of ~100. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this upward shift and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the higher volume and current stockout situation. L remains at the promised 4 periods as evidence suggests shipping continuity has resumed (P13 order arrived on time).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 15: average demand increased from ~100 to ~160 (+60%). Stockout occurred in Period 16-17 due to a zero-order in Period 12 arriving in Period 16.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19. Historical demand data shows a clear regime shift starting around Period 15, moving from an average of ~100 to ~166 over the last four periods (164, 194, 182, and the previous 123 in P15). This represents a significant upward trend. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on consistently observed arrivals (P1-P3, P5-P11, P13-P14). We are currently experiencing stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0 for three consecutive periods) because the supply pipeline (specifically the zero-order from P12 arriving in P16 and the relatively low arrivals in P17-P18) was insufficient for this new demand level. Specifically, the P15 order (149 units) is expected to arrive in P19 resolution phase, but with current demand averaging ~170, we are at high risk of continued stockouts. To rectify this, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the higher mean of ~166. I am using recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat as well to account for the increased volatility in this new regime. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the promised 4 periods remains accurate.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a significantly higher demand regime that started around Period 15. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 172.4 units per period, compared to the earlier baseline of ~100. Due to a zero-order in Period 12 and the subsequent jump in demand, we have experienced stockouts from Period 16 through Period 19. Inventory on-hand is currently 0, with 700 units in-transit. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To recover from the stockouts and meet this higher demand (approx. 862 units for the L+1 window of 5 periods), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand mean, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: average demand for P15-P19 is 172 (previously ~100). Persistent stockouts from P16-P19 due to the combination of a missed order in P12 and the sharp demand increase.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 15. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P15-P20) is approximately 175.8 units, a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~100. Due to a zero-order in Period 12 and this sudden surge, we have faced persistent stockouts since Period 16. In Period 20, we received the order from Period 16 (133 units), but it was insufficient to cover the demand of 193. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains stable and confirmed. Our goal is to set parameters that recognize this new demand regime (mu_hat) and account for the pipeline inventory (787 units in transit from P17-P20) to eventually recover from the stockout. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current high-demand mean and standard deviation for the period (L+1=5). This will push the OR backend to target a higher base stock appropriate for the ~176/period demand level.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime shift (starting Period 15) has stabilized at a significantly higher level. Calculating the average demand from Period 15 to Period 21: (123+164+194+182+199+193+222)/7 \u2248 182.4. This is much higher than the previous average of ~100. Despite a healthy in-transit pipeline (786 units), the system is currently at 0 on-hand inventory and has experienced stockouts for six consecutive periods because the orders arriving now were placed before or during the early stages of this demand spike. To ensure the OR backend creates a sufficient base stock to cover the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 7 samples (N=7). This accurately reflects the new mean (~182) and higher volatility observed during this high-demand phase. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 15-21 average demand is 182.4 units, representing an 82% increase from the initial baseline.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 15 is well-established, with average demand between Periods 15 and 22 being approximately 180 units. This is a significant increase from the initial baseline of ~100. We have successfully recovered from the stockout phase thanks to the arrival of the Period 18 order (202 units) in Period 22, resulting in a current on-hand inventory of 39 units. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the current in-transit pipeline (770 units) is robust and reflects previous high ordering decisions (P19=217, P20=220, P21=147, P22=186), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the start of the high-demand regime at P15) to maintain a consistent base stock. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the increased volatility of this new regime.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 15. In the last 9 periods (P15-P23), the average demand has risen to approximately 199.2 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~100. Recent demand data (P21-P23) shows even higher values (222, 163, 247), reinforcing this sustained higher level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 9 units on hand and a high pipeline of 701, the system needs to maintain high base stock levels to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the ~200 unit/period consumption rate. I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture this higher mean demand and increased volatility since the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 confirmed and sustained through Period 23: average demand increased from ~100 to ~199 (+99%). Recent volatility has also increased significantly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $601.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 15. The average demand for the most recent 10 periods (P15-P24) is approximately 185.3 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~100 units. Recent periods (P21-P24) show high volatility with demand values of 222, 163, 247, and 166. To capture this new 'high demand' regime while accounting for the increased variance, I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the period after the shift. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival of the Period 20 order in Period 24. With an on-hand inventory of 63 and in-transit of 728, the pipeline is substantial, but given the 4-period lead time and the current demand average of ~185, we must maintain a high base stock to avoid repeating the stockouts seen between P16 and P21.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~100 to ~185 (+85%) through Period 24. Increased demand volatility also observed in this period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 15. The average demand from Period 15 to Period 25 is approximately 188.5 units. Recent demand has been particularly high (214 in Period 25, 247 in Period 23), leading to a stockout at the end of Period 25 (ending inventory 0). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant in-transit orders (782 units), the goal is to maintain a base stock level that covers 5 periods (L+1) of high demand. Given the increased volatility and recent demand spikes, I will use a recent window (N=11, covering the start of the regime shift) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the higher mean and the increased variance observed in this new regime, helping to prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1.0 holding cost against the $4.0 profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly around Period 15. Prior to Period 15, the average demand was approximately 100 units. From Period 15 to the present (Period 26), the mean demand has risen to approximately 185 units, though recent periods (P24-P26) show high volatility with values ranging from 110 to 214. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods based on 'Period 26 conclude' which confirms the arrival of the Period 22 order. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=12) to capture this higher demand regime that started at Period 15 while reducing the impact of the lower pre-shift data. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=12) to account for the increased volatility observed in the new regime. This approach helps the OR backend project a requirements level that covers the higher average demand and the increased uncertainty, reducing the risk of further stockouts while accounting for the current in-transit pipeline of 818 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 15, moving from a mean of ~100 to a higher plateau. Recent demand (P23-P27) has fluctuated, showing both high spikes (247 in P23) and more moderate values (125 in P27), leading to an average of ~172 over the last 5 periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 857 units. Given L=4, the base stock targets a window of (L+1)=5 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=13) covers the post-shift regime starting at P15 to capture the sustained higher volume while smoothing recent variance. Similarly, sigma_hat uses recent_N to reflect the increased volatility observed since the shift. This strategy maintains high service levels for the more expensive stockout cost relative to holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the inventory position is 880 units (263 on-hand + 617 in-transit). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The demand history shows a notable regime shift around Period 15. Prior to Period 15, demand averaged ~100. From Period 15 to Period 25, demand surged to an average of ~195, causing significant stockouts. However, demand in the last three periods (P26-P28) has dropped significantly to 110, 125, and 83 respectively (average 106). This suggests either a return to the old mean or high volatility. Given the 'chips(Regular)' description and the timing, the P15-P25 surge may have been a seasonal peak or promo that has now ended. I will use recent_N with N=14 for mu_hat (covering the high period and the recent drop) to provide a balanced forecast that doesn't overreact to the last 3 low samples but acknowledges the demand reduction. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=14 to capture the high volatility seen during the regime transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease: After a surge (P15-P25 avg ~195), demand has dropped to an average of ~106 over the last 3 periods (P26-P28). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-109.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted downwards starting Period 26. After a high-demand period (P15-P25 avg ~195), the last four periods (P26-P29) have seen an average demand of 97.25 units (110, 125, 83, 71). This is back to the baseline level observed before Period 15. The inventory position is currently high (On-hand: 393, In-transit: 476) due to the heavy ordering during the recent high-demand regime arriving just as demand dropped. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent excessive holding costs given the high inventory and lower demand, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand regime. This will significantly lower the base stock level, likely resulting in zero or minimal orders until the inventory position normalizes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 26-29 average demand is 97.25 units, returning to near the initial baseline (approx. 100).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-175.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly shifted into a lower regime since Period 26. The average demand for the last five periods (P26-P30) is approximately 95.4 units, which is a significant drop from the high-demand regime observed from P15-P25 (avg ~199). Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 527 units, and in-transit inventory is 254 units (orders from P27, P28, and P29). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory levels and the return to baseline demand, I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower demand environment (Period 26-30). This will allow the OR backend to significantly reduce the base stock level, helping to draw down the excess on-hand inventory and minimize future holding costs while still meeting the lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed and sustained: P26-P30 average demand is 95.4 units, returning to original baseline levels (~100).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-350.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly shifted back to a lower regime. Between periods 15-25, the average demand was approximately 190. However, starting from period 26, demand has significantly dropped. The last 6 periods (P26-P31) show demand values of 110, 125, 83, 71, 88, and 53, averaging 88.33. This confirms the demand regime decrease noted in previous insights, with the current level returning to (or slightly below) the initial baseline of ~100. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 562 and an in-transit pipeline of 166 units total (728 units total coverage), we are heavily overstocked for the current demand level. The OR backend needs to recognize this new, lower demand mean (approx. 88-90) to avoid further inflating inventory and incurring excess holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this specific post-surge regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-158.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime that matches the initial baseline (approx. 100 units/period) following a significant peak between Periods 15 and 25. Specifically, the average demand over the last 7 periods (P26-P32) is approximately 90.3 units. The 'On-hand' inventory is currently very high at 566 units, which is enough to cover over 6 periods of demand at the current rate. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and the current demand rate, the OR backend needs to avoid placing unnecessary orders to minimize holding costs. Setting mu_hat to a recent_N of 7 captures the lower demand regime, and since on-hand + in-transit (566+60=626) far exceed the required base stock for a 5-period window (~450-500 units), the backend will naturally zero out the order.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime after a significant peak between Period 15 and Period 25. Since Period 26, demand has averaged 90.1 units (P26-P33), which is very close to the initial baseline of ~100. Currently, the system has a high on-hand inventory of 538 units with 0 units in-transit. With an average demand of ~90 units and a lead time of 4 periods, the required base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) is approximately 450-500 units. Since on-hand inventory (538) already exceeds the expected demand over the lead time plus current period, the priority is to allow inventory to deplete to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to reflect the current stabilized lower demand regime and use the default lead time (4) which remains consistent.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime consistent with the initial baseline (~100 units/period) following a surge between periods 15 and 25. Specifically, the average demand from Period 26 to 34 is approximately 90.6 units. Currently, the system has a high on-hand inventory of 442 units and 0 in-transit. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Expected demand over 5 periods at the current regime is ~450 units. Since on-hand (442) + in-transit (0) is very close to this requirement, the OR backend will naturally scale back ordering to avoid excess holding costs, especially given the $1/unit holding cost versus $4/unit profit. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this stable, lower demand regime starting from Period 26. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime after the surge from Period 15-25. Since Period 26, demand has returned to an average of approximately 92.4 units per period (P26-P35 avg). Currently, on-hand inventory is 307 units, which is quite high compared to this demand level. With a promised lead time (L) of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 periods * ~93 units = 465 units. The current pipeline (on-hand 307 + in-transit 52 = 359) is slightly below this target. However, because the starting inventory in recent periods was extremely high (over 500), '0' orders were correctly placed in P30-P34 to burn off excess stock. In P35, a small order of 52 was placed. Given the stability of the current demand regime (return to baseline), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this 'new' low-demand period (P26-P35). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has returned to its baseline level (averaging approx. 95-103 units since Period 26). Specifically, the average of the last 11 periods (P26-P36) is approximately 103 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 195, with 188 units in transit (ordered in Periods 35 and 36), totaling a pipeline of 383 units. To maintain the base stock level for (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current baseline, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture this stable regime since Period 26. This ensures the backend calculates the base stock based on the most recent behavior while accounting for lead time L=4.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units following a high-demand period (P15-P25). Since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 93 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 95 units, and there are 324 units in-transit (ordered in P35, P36, and P37). These orders (52, 136, 136) are expected to arrive in Periods 39, 40, and 41 respectively. Because the system is currently overstocked from the previous peak, I am using a recent_N strategy (N=12, covering the post-peak period) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring parameters reflect the returned-to-baseline demand level (~100) and preventing excessive reordering while current in-transit stock arrives.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 38. The demand regime returned to a baseline of approximately 100-110 units around Period 26 and has remained there, with the last 10 periods averaging 97.5 units. The primary concern is the supply gap: despite a promised lead time of 4 periods, no shipments have arrived in the last 5 periods (P34-P38). The last received shipment was ordered in Period 29 (arrived P33). We have 433 units in transit, corresponding to orders placed in P35 (52), P36 (136), P37 (136), and P38 (109). If the lead time remains 4 periods, the P35 order should arrive in Period 39 resolution phase (visible in P40). However, the absence of arrivals in P34-P38 (where P30-P34 orders were expected) suggests those orders were likely lost or the lead time has significantly drifted. Given that P30-P34 orders were for 0 units (except P31-P33 which were also 0), the 'arrived=0' messages are expected. The next real arrival test is the P35 order. I will use recent_N (N=13, from P26 onwards) to capture the current stable demand regime (avg ~104) while maintaining L at default (4) to ensure the base stock covers 5 periods of demand (approx 520 units). This should trigger an appropriate order to refill the pipeline against the current on-hand zero state.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units per period following a temporary surge from Period 15-25. After a period of high on-hand inventory (P29-P34), inventory has depleted to 0. An arrival of 52 units in P39 was insufficient to meet demand (67), resulting in a stockout. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to set parameters that return inventory to a level covering demand over (L+1) periods (approx 500 units) minus current in-transit (490 units). Based on the return to the baseline demand regime since Period 26, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (P26-P39) to prioritize the current stable state over the previous surge.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has returned to its initial baseline levels of approximately 100 units per period, following a significant spike from Period 15 to Period 25. Specifically, the average demand over the last 15 periods (P26-P40) is ~93 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from P35 and P36 arriving exactly 4 periods later in P39 and P40. Current inventory state: On-hand is 46, and In-transit is 396. The 396 in-transit units include orders from P37 (136), P38 (109), P39 (109), and P40 (42). These are scheduled to arrive in P41, P42, P43, and P44 respectively. Using recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the stabilized 'low' demand regime (avg 92.93, std 21.64) while providing sufficient samples for a reliable estimate. This approach helps the OR backend avoid ordering excess stock given the high pipeline and modest demand.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized back to its original baseline levels of approximately 100 units per period, following a significant surge between Periods 15 and 25. Specifically, the average demand over the last 10 periods (P32-P41) is 99.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 19 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since P30, ordering has resumed after clearing excess inventory from the previous surge. Currently, the system has 95 units on-hand and 346 units in-transit (orders from P38, P39, P40, P41). To maintain the target service level given the current stable demand and predictable 4-period lead time, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this stable regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This aligns the base stock with (1+L) periods of expected demand while accounting for recent variance.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units following a significant surge between Periods 15-25. Since Period 26, demand has returned to this baseline (P26-P42 average is approximately 96 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 35, 36, 37, and 38. The current on-hand inventory is 50 units with 339 units in-transit (orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42). I will set L to 'default' (promised LT=4) and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=18 to capture the stable regime starting from Period 26. This compensates for the high-demand outlier period while ensuring enough stock to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~106 units following the drop from the P15-P25 surge. Demand in the most recent period (P43) was 116, with a 5-period average (P39-P43) of 102.6 units. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (43 units), and there is a total in-transit of 373 units (from orders in periods 40, 41, 42, and 43). To maintain the desired service level (calculated as q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) while demand remains in this baseline regime, I will use recent_N (N=14) to capture the behavior since the last regime shift at Period 30. This provides a stable estimate of both mean and volatility while excluding the high-demand surge period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units following the surge seen between Periods 15-25. The most recent demand samples (P40-P44) are 90, 87, 154, 116, and 84, giving a mean of 106.2. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is very low (1 unit) after satisfying Period 44 demand. There is a large pipeline of 472 units, with arrivals of 86, 102, 143, and 141 expected over the next four periods. Since the current demand regime has been stable since Period 26, I will use recent_N with N=19 (P26-P44) to capture the current volatility and mean accurately while staying responsive to the most recent baseline. This balanced approach helps the OR backend maintain a safe service level without over-ordering as the game nears its end (Period 50).

The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to the baseline levels observed before the Period 15-25 surge. Since Period 30, demand has averaged approximately 104 units per period (P30-P45). The current on-hand inventory is 0 due to a sell-out in Period 45 where demand (129) exceeded starting inventory (87). Current in-transit inventory is 459 units, which includes orders from Period 42 (102 units, expected arrival P46), Period 43 (143 units, expected arrival P47), Period 44 (141 units, expected P48), and Period 45 (73 units, expected P49). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (P46) will arrive in Period 50. I will use a recent_N of 15 for demand parameters to capture the settled baseline since the last regime shift (approx. P31 onwards) and continue using the calculate method for lead time as it remains consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around the 100-unit baseline following the spike between periods 15 and 25. Over the last 15 periods (P31-P46), the average demand is approximately 101 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (31 units), and there is a large pipeline (463 units). Using 'recent_N' with N=15 for mu_hat captures the current regime's average (~101) while remaining responsive to the recent volatility seen in the last few weeks (sigma_hat with N=15). This setting helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding over-ordering as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $196.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units following the decline from the Period 15-25 surge. Based on data from Period 40 to 47, the average demand is approximately 101.8 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. Current inventory position: On-hand (100) + In-transit (394) = 494 units. Given that the total demand for the remaining 3 periods is expected to be around 300 units (3 * 100), we are currently in an over-supplied state relative to the game's end. Any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4), which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, the OR backend should ideally place a zero order to avoid further holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 (covering the current stable period since P40) to provide the most accurate description of current demand, while the high pipeline inventory will naturally suppress new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $289.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units following the downward shift confirmed around Period 31. Recent demand (P44-P48) has been 84, 129, 71, 74, 106, averaging 92.8 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only two periods remaining in the simulation (P49 and P50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory and associated holding costs. Current inventory position (On-hand: 135, In-transit: 318) is extremely high relative to the remaining expected demand (~200 units). The OR backend's inventory balancing logic will likely result in a zero order given that pipeline inventory alone (318) significantly exceeds the base stock requirements for the remaining horizon. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (covering the stable regime since P31) to provide the backend with the most accurate recent demand distribution for its final calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $397.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized back to its original baseline levels after a significant surge between Period 15 and Period 25. Since Period 26, the average demand has been approximately 98.7 units per period (P26-P49). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, with the most recent shipment from P45 arriving on time in P49. Currently, on-hand inventory is 87 units and in-transit inventory is 340 units (orders from P46, P47, P48, P49). To maintain optimal service levels while minimizing holding costs (given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio), I will use the recent demand trend (last 24 periods since the regime decrease) to set parameters. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current stable demand mean of ~100 rather than the high-volatility surge period.
