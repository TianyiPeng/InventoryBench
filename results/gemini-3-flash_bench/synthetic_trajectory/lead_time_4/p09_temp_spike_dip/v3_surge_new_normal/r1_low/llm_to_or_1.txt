Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we have no inventory on-hand or in-transit. The goal is to establish an initial position based on the provided historical demand samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59). The average demand of these samples is 115.4, and the standard deviation is approximately 35.6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is the first period and we have no arrival data yet, I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'default' demand parameters (which utilize all available samples). This will set a base stock level to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). High holding costs ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0) result in a critical ratio of 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target a base stock near the median (z=0) to balance overstock and stockout risks.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 176 units based on the OR backend's default logic (pipeline to cover lead time). However, we started with 0 inventory and there were no arrivals in Period 1 (as expected, since the promised lead time is 4 periods). As a result, the 88 units of demand in Period 1 were lost. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 176 units in transit. Since we only have one complete demand observation (Period 1 demand = 88) and the provided historical samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the local average while the pipeline fills. For lead time, I will stick to the default promised lead time of 4 periods until we observe actual arrivals to calculate any drift.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we are facing a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. Two orders were placed in Periods 1 (176 units) and 2 (159 units), totaling 335 units in-transit. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, we do not expect the first order to arrive until Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Demand for the first two periods was 88 and 79 (avg \u2248 83.5). The provided historical demand samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) show significant volatility (mean \u2248 115, std \u2248 36). Using the historical samples (N=5) provides a more robust forecast than the two specific game periods observed so far. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this broader historical variance while maintaining the promised lead time L=4 to ensure the base stock calculation covers 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Periods 1-3, we have placed orders totaling 488 units (176, 159, 153), all of which are currently in-transit. Because the lead time is 4, the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales as demand has been occurring (88, 79, 121 in P1-P3). Historical demand samples are 146, 110, 112, 150, 59. The mean of these 5 samples is 115.4. Since we are in the initial phase and waiting for the first lead-time cycle to complete, I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the average of the available samples. N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat covers all provided samples to establish a baseline forecast until arrivals begin.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (176 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (Arrival = Period N+L). We will only see confirmation of this arrival in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all demand has been lost so far. Total in-transit is 497 units (176+159+153+9). Demand samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) show a mean of 115.4. However, the 'conclude' messages show demand values of 88, 79, 121, 103, which differ from the samples provided in the prompt's historical data section. I will prioritize the historical data samples provided in the prompt (avg ~115) while noting the variability. Since no orders have concluded yet, I stick to the promised lead time L=4. I will use recent_N for demand to capture the most recent fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is accurate; the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (a lead time of 4). Demand data for the first 5 periods (including actual demand from conclusion messages) is: 88, 79, 121, 103, 111. The mean demand is approximately 100.4. Currently, we have 65 units on hand and 321 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4 since P5 was an order of 0). The pipeline is quite full: 65 (on-hand) + 321 (in-transit) = 386. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. At an average of ~100/period, required stock is ~500. The OR backend uses base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Since holding cost equals profit ($1 each), the critical ratio q = 0.5, meaning z=0 and base_stock should target mu_hat. I will set mu_hat using the mean of the 5 available samples (100.4 * 5 = 502) and sigma_hat using the standard deviation across those 5 samples (~16.3 * sqrt(5) \u2248 36.5). Using 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat will calculate these over all samples, which is appropriate as no clear regime shift is observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Reviewing the game history, orders from Period 1 and Period 2 arrived exactly 4 periods later (arrived in P5 and P6 respectively), confirming the actual lead time matches the promised lead time (L=4). Demand has been relatively stable: historical samples show a mean of ~114 (calculated from samples P1-P5 provided in prompt and actual demand from history P1-P6). Looking at the recent samples (P3-P6: 121, 103, 111, 130), the average is approximately 116. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, meaning the base stock policy will naturally lean towards the mean. With 94 units on hand and 316 in transit (orders from P3, P4, and P6), we have significant coverage. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the most relevant demand volatility and mean while smoothing out the early noisy samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-25.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Reviewing the 'conclude' messages: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 (L=4), Period 2 order arrived in Period 6 (L=4), and Period 3 order arrived in Period 7 (L=4). The lead time appears stable at the promised 4 periods. For demand, the available samples are: 88, 79, 121, 103, 111, 130, 111 (average ~106). Since there is no strong evidence of a regime shift or significant seasonality for 'chips(Regular)' at this stage, I will use a conservative approach. I'll select L=4 (default) and use the last 5 periods (Periods 3-7) to estimate demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), as the early periods (1-2) had slightly lower demand. N=5 covers a stable period of demand between 103-130. The backend will calculate base_stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. With 136 on-hand and 297 in-transit (Total pipeline: 433), and an average 5-period demand of ~530, the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Looking at historical arrivals (Periods 5-8), the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (matches promised). Total Pipeline (In-transit) is 421 units (orders from P5: 0, P6: 154, P7: 134, P8: 133). On-hand inventory is 44 units. Total demand across 8 periods (average ~105.4) and the specific historical samples provided (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) show significant variance. However, the last 4 periods' demand (111, 130, 111, 101) average 113.25. Given the relatively stable demand and confirmed lead time L=4, I will use recent_N (N=8) for demand forecasting to capture the overall volume while acknowledging the early-game noise. The critical task is to maintain a base stock that covers demand over (L+1) = 5 periods. 421 (in-transit) + 44 (on-hand) = 465 units total coverage. 465 / 5 = 93 units/period, which is slightly below the recent mean of ~113. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to stabilize the forecast.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed across 4 consecutive arrivals from P5-P8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, current on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 9. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being observed (confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-8). Following this pattern, the order placed in Period 5 (0 units) should have arrived in Period 9, which it did (arrived=0 found in Period 9 conclude). The order from Period 6 (154 units) is expected to arrive during Period 10, becoming visible in Period 11. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 484 units, consisting of orders from Periods 6 (154), 7 (134), 8 (133), and 9 (63). Demand has shown a noticeable drop in the most recent period (P9: 56) compared to the prior average (~100-110). However, one sample is insufficient to declare a regime shift. I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the recent mean of ~100 units/period while being slightly responsive to the latest dip. With L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+4)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat yields (1+4) * 102.2 = 511. Looking at the OR backend logic, base_stock will be calculated relative to the pipeline (484).

Daily Reward (R_t): $154.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 10. The 'conclude' message for Period 10 confirms that the order from Period 6 arrived with a lead time of 4 periods (arrived in P10). However, the order from Period 5 (ordered 0 units) resulted in no arrival in Period 9, causing the stockout. The average demand across the last 10 periods is approximately 110.3 units. I am setting L=4, which is consistent with all observed arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10). I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the stable yet variable demand observed so far. This approach aims to replenish stock while accounting for the 4-period lead time and the high-variance demand (sigma_hat), ensuring the pipeline inventory (355 units) is factored into the next order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Current on-hand is 25, with 373 units in transit. Historical demand is relatively stable but showed a significant drop at Period 5 (59) and a peak at Period 10 (156). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on multiple arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11). Since the promised lead time is 4, using 'default' or 'calculate' for L is appropriate. For demand, the last 7 periods (P5-P11) represent the 'in-stock' phase where demand is more accurately captured (mean ~111). I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture this stable regime, as the initial 4 periods had no inventory and demand data might be less reliable for forecasting actual sales capacity. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 6 through Period 12 shows a stable mean of approximately 116 units per period (Avg of P6-P12: 156, 109, 103, 56, 156, 109, 103 - Note: P9 demand was 56, slightly lower, but the overall range is consistent). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (ordered P6 arrived P10, P7 arrived P11, P8 arrived P12). Order from Period 9 (63 units) remains in transit and is expected to arrive in Period 13. Current pipeline is 395 units, which includes orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12. With an expected demand over the lead time (L=4) plus current period (total 5 periods) of roughly 580 units, I will use a 7-period demand window to capture recent variation while smoothing the P9 dip. L is set to default (promised 4).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (validated by arrivals from periods 1-4 arriving in periods 5-8, and periods 6-9 arriving in periods 10-13; Period 5's order was 0). Demand analysis: The initial sample set (P1-P5) had a mean of 107.4. Recent demand (P6-P13) shows a stable mean of approximately 112.4. There is no significant evidence of a regime shift, though P5 and P9 showed minor anomalies which were likely stockouts (P9 sold=44, demand=56). The current on-hand inventory is 26, and in-transit is 430 units. Given L=4, the coverage required is for (L+1)=5 periods. Using recent demand (last 8 periods) captures the most relevant variance and average for the current inventory position. The OR backend will use these values to maintain a base stock that balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a ~50% service level/median demand coverage).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (On-hand: 0). The demand over the last several periods (P10-P14) has averaged around 111.4 units, which is significantly higher than the training data suggests. Our lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, meaning we must plan for (1 + L) = 5 periods of demand. Currently, we have 486 units in transit, which should arrive over the next 4 periods (P15-P18). Specifically, the order from P11 (152 units) is expected to arrive during P15. To restore a healthy inventory buffer and account for the recent demand volatility (standard deviation ~25), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and variance to capture the current high-demand regime. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed around P10: mean demand increased to ~111 units compared to early periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, confirmed lead time remains 4 periods based on repeated 'conclude' messages. Demand Analysis: The carry-over insight noted a regime shift around Period 10 to ~111 units. Checking the most recent demand (P11-P15): 109, 103, 92, 97, 128 (Mean = 105.8). This aligns with the previous shift. I will use recent_N with N=6 (covering P10-P15) to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 405) plus on-hand (24) is 429. Expected demand over (L+1) = 5 periods is ~530. The OR backend needs parameters representing the (L+1) horizon. Setting L to default (4) and using recent_N=6 for demand statistics to sustain the current service level without over-adjusting to single-period spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $179.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed a massive demand spike to 263 units, causing a stockout. This is significantly higher than the previously established mean of ~111. This may be a outlier or the start of a new high-demand regime/volatility shift. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With L=4, my parameters need to cover demand for Period 17 plus the 4-period lead time (total 5 periods). Given the recent volatility, I will use recent_N (N=7, covering Period 10 to 16) to capture the higher average and increased standard deviation caused by the recent spike, ensuring the OR backend sets a higher base stock to protect against further stockouts without over-ordering excessively if the spike was an outlier. On-hand is currently 0, but in-transit is high (392), and we expect arrivals from orders placed in Period 13 (98 units) during Period 17.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Significant demand spike observed in Period 16 (263 units), representing a 2.3x increase over the previous mean. Strategy adjusted to use recent_N=7 to capture this increased volatility.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observed a continuing high demand of 223 units, following a peak of 263 units in Period 16. This confirms a significant upward demand shift. The mean demand for the last 3 periods (P15-P17) is ~205 units, compared to the previous mean of ~111. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 529 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the backend policy is based on (1+L) periods, we must set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a shorter window (N=3) to aggressively capture this new high-demand regime and minimize stockouts. We use method 'recent_N' for both to ensure the backend uses the most recent high-volume samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: mean demand increased from ~111 to ~243 (average of P16-P17).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. The average demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) is approximately 244 units (263, 223, 245), a sharp increase from the previous mean of ~111. I am currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) because historical orders were based on the lower demand regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the current demand skip is sustained over 3 periods, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the OR backend's base-stock level to the new high-demand environment (~1220 units target for L+1). This will trigger larger orders to refill the pipeline and meet the new 240+ unit/period demand level.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. The average demand for the most recent four periods (P16-P19) is approximately 237 units (263, 223, 245, 218), which is more than double the previous regime. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand inventory has been 0 for the last four periods) because incoming shipments were based on the old, lower demand mean. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To adapt to this higher demand and increased volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4. This ensures the OR backend uses the current high-demand mean of ~237 to calculate the base stock level (target pipeline inventory), accounting for the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5) to recover from current stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~111 to ~237 (+113%) based on 4 periods of consistent high demand (P16-P19).

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16. The average demand for P16-P20 is approximately 239.2 units, a substantial increase from the previous mean of ~111 units. Despite being in an out-of-stock (OOS) state due to the lag between the demand spike and the lead time for larger orders to arrive, heavy orders (ordered P17: 235, P18: 319, P19: 277, etc.) are in the pipeline. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the order from P17 (235 units) is expected to arrive during P21. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 1045 units in-transit. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (N=5 corresponds to the length of the new high-demand regime P16-P20) and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the elevated demand and volatility. Lead time L is held at 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 4-period actual lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $235.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16. Over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), demand has averaged approximately 253.3 units (263, 223, 245, 218, 247, 324), which is more than double the previous mean of ~111. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts for the last 6 periods due to this surge. While lead time remains stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals from P5-P21), the in-transit pipeline (961 units) consists of orders placed during the ramp-up (P18: 319, P19: 277, P20: 214, P21: 151). To capture the current high-demand state and its increased volatility (std dev of P16-P21 is ~38.5), I am using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set the base stock level (mu_hat) to cover approximately 5 periods of demand (L+1) at the new average rate, ensuring the backend places an order sufficient to recover from stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 further confirmed: mean demand (P16-P21) is 253 units with increased volatility (std ~39). Sustained stockouts since P16 due to delayed catch-up of in-transit inventory.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The demand from Period 16 to Period 22 has averaged approximately 251 units (263, 223, 245, 218, 247, 324, 239). Standard deviation during this high-demand period is approximately 36. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Although we finally ended a period with positive on-hand inventory (80 units) due to a large arrival from Period 18, we must maintain high parameters to ensure we cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5). Using recent_N=7 for demand capture (P16-P22) ensures we base our forecast and safety stock on the current high-demand distribution rather than historical low-demand periods. This helps the OR backend compute a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean (~251) and the higher volatility seen recently.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from ~111 units/period to an average of ~251 units/period over the last 8 periods (P16-P23: 263, 223, 245, 218, 247, 324, 239, 248). The most recent two periods (P22-P23) have finally seen ending on-hand inventory stabilize above zero (80 and 109 respectively) as the high-volume orders placed during the initial spike began arriving. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the sustained new average and the need to maintain enough stock to cover the 5-period cycle (L+1), I will use the recent 8 periods to calculate the demand mean and standard deviation. This N=8 specifically targets the start of the current high-demand regime to ensure the OR backend's base stock calculation reflects the current market volume and volatility (std ~29).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~111 to approximately 253 units per period. In the most recent 9 periods (P16-P24), demand has been consistently high: 263, 223, 245, 218, 247, 324, 239, 248, 244. The average demand in this new regime is 250 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 32 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 79 units with 932 units in-transit, indicating that the system is finally catching up with the demand surge. I am using recent_N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this current sustained demand level and volatility while ignoring the outdated lower demand data from early periods. This should maintain a high service level without excessive over-ordering as the pipeline fills.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: mean demand stabilized at ~250 units (P16-P24) compared to the previous ~111 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from ~111 units to a sustained mean of ~251 units (calculated from Period 16 to Period 25). Recent demand values (P23: 248, P24: 244, P25: 263) confirm this higher level. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all observed arrivals. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 25, though there is a substantial in-transit pipeline of 1021 units. To maintain the 50% service level target (implied by the $1 profit/$1 holding cost ratio where q = 0.5 and z* = 0) while accounting for the current high-demand regime and volatility (std ~30-40), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=10 to precisely capture the Period 16 onward behavior. This ensures the base stock reflects the (L+1) period demand requirement of ~1255 units total.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-68.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand dropped significantly to 119 units, compared to the sustained ~250 average observed since Period 16. This could signal a potential demand regime shift or a one-off fluctuation. However, given the high in-transit inventory (951 units) and the current on-hand inventory (187 units), there is a substantial amount of stock incoming to cover future demand even if it returns to the ~250 level. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To avoid over-ordering during this potential transition/dip, I am using recent_N=11 for mu_hat (covering Period 16 to Period 26) to capture the shift from the high-demand regime toward the current lower observation, while maintaining recent_N=11 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen during this period. This approach will naturally lower the base stock level considering the recent low demand point while keeping a buffer for volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-146.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the significant demand spike from Period 16 to Period 25 (average ~250 units), the demand in the last two periods (Period 26: 119, Period 27: 135) has sharply declined, returning to levels near the pre-spike average of ~111. This indicates the high-demand regime has likely ended. However, to avoid an immediate over-correction leading to stockouts if this is just a temporary lull, I will use a balanced window (recent_N=5) for demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculation. This N=5 captures the drop while still accounting for the possibility of moderate demand. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (281) with a large in-transit pipeline (781), so the OR backend will naturally reduce the order size to avoid excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed at Period 26: Demand dropped from ~250 units (P16-P25) to ~127 units (P26-P27), indicating the end of the high-demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-307.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 26 is now confirmed by three consecutive periods of lower demand (119, 135, 110), averaging approximately 121 units. This is a significant drop from the high-demand phase (P16-P25) which averaged ~250 units. To prevent excessive inventory accumulation and minimize holding costs\u2014especially since current on-hand inventory (417) and in-transit units (535) are already very high\u2014I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3. This specifically captures the current low-demand environment. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand decreased from ~250 units to ~121 units (P26-P28) based on 3 consecutive periods of lower demand.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 26, moving from a high average of ~250 units (P16-P25) to a lower level of ~121 units (P26-P29). We have 4 consecutive periods (P26, P27, P28, P29) with demand values of 119, 135, 110, and 128 respectively, which confirms this new regime. On-hand inventory is currently high (529 units) with 295 units still in-transit, totaling 824 units available compared to a projected 5-period demand (L+1) of roughly 600 units. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for this current lower-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to match the current demand profile. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-477.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 26, moving from ~250 units to a significantly lower range. For the last 5 periods (P26-P30), demand has been 119, 135, 110, 128, and 144, resulting in a mean of 127.2 units. This shift is now clearly sustained over 5 periods. I am setting N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new lower demand environment. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high (621 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the previous high-demand peak (P22-P26). With a current pipeline of only 59 units (from P27) and no new orders placed in P28-P30, the on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 periods of demand at the current rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to allow the existing overstock to deplete while the OR backend calculates the base stock against the new, lower mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand stabilized at ~127 units (P26-P30) following the end of the high-demand spike (P16-P25).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean of approximately 121 units since Period 26, following the end of a high-demand spike (P16-P25). Currently, on-hand inventory is 601 units with zero in-transit, as previous large orders placed during the high-demand period have arrived and cleared the pipeline. Given the current demand (avg ~121) and the holding cost, the inventory is already significantly higher than needed for a 5-period horizon (L+1). I will use a recent_N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current lower demand regime (P26-P31) and ensure the OR backend minimizes further ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from Period 26, following a significant high-demand spike (P16-P25). The mean demand over the last 7 periods (P26-P32) is approximately 120 units, a sharp drop from the ~250 units seen during the spike. With 475 units currently on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, the system is overstocked relative to current demand (475 / 120 \u2248 4 periods of supply). No orders have been placed since Period 28 as the system works through this excess inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current lower demand regime and its associated volatility, ensuring the base stock calculation aligns with the current market state while the backend's capped policy manages the overstock situation.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). The mean demand for this recent period (P26-P33) is approximately 118 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 372 units, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 126 units (the order placed in P33). At the start of P34, we must account for the current period's demand plus the demand over the 4-period lead time. With an average demand of ~118, the total requirement for (1+L) = 5 periods is roughly 590 units. Total inventory positions (372 + 126 = 498) are slightly below this level. I will use recent_N=8 to capture the current stable demand mean and variance since the drop-off at P26, allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate top-up.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 26. Analyzing the most recent stable window (P26-P34), the average demand is approximately 116 units with a standard deviation of about 21. Currently, on-hand inventory is 274 and in-transit is 218, totaling 492 units. With a lead time of 4 and estimating for the current decision period (1+4=5 periods), the expected total demand requirement is approximately 580 units (5 * 116). Our pipeline is slightly below this, which is why the OR backend will likely place a small order. I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower demand regime (P26-P34). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: mean demand established at ~116 (P26-P34) compared to previous high-demand spike.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime starting from Period 26, following a significant spike from Periods 16-25. Since Period 26, demand has averaged approximately 117 units per period (P26-P35). Current on-hand inventory is 143 units, with 305 units in-transit (orders from P33, P34, P35). Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this stable post-spike regime (P26-P35). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals, so L is set to default. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine the order needed to reach the base stock level while accounting for the high in-transit pipeline.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~120 units since Period 26. Specifically, the mean demand from P26 to P36 is 118.4 units. We are currently in a transition phase regarding inventory. A large block of orders (P28-P32) was zeroed out to burn off the excess stock accumulated after the high-demand spike (P16-P25). Consequently, the current on-hand inventory is low (14 units), and 'In-transit' reflects orders placed from P33 onwards. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with historical observations. To maintain a stable supply and respond to the current regime, I am using recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering the post-spike period since P26). This will ensure the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current demand level of ~120 units/period across the lead time plus review period (L+1=5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 26 from a high spike (~250 units) to a lower, stable regime. For the most recent period (P26-P37), the mean demand is approximately 120 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a slight stockout in Period 37 when demand (144) exceeded available stock (140). The pipeline inventory (452 units) contains orders from Periods 34, 35, 36, and 37. To maintain the inventory balance and respond to the current demand regime (~120 units/period), I am using L=4 and setting mu_hat based on the last 12 periods (N=12) to reflect the post-spike stabilization. Sigma_hat is also set using the same period to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly starting at Period 26, stabilizing around a mean of ~121 units (P26-P38: 119, 135, 110, 128, 144, 79, 126, 103, 98, 131, 129, 144, 109). The previous high-demand spike (P16-P25) has ended. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because arrivals from orders placed during the transition (P28-P32 were 0 orders) have created a gap. However, the pipeline is full with 511 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N=13 for demand parameters (the length of the current regime from P26 to P38) to accurately reflect the current mean (~121) and the observed variance, ensuring the OR backend targets a level that covers current demand without over-ordering as the massive pipeline begins to arrive.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 26 continues to hold, with an average demand of approximately 119 units over the last 14 periods (P26-P39). Recent demand (P36-P39) has been 129, 144, 109, and 107. Although there are stockouts, these are due to the transition period where no orders were placed (P28-P32) rather than a shift in lead time. Review of 'Period 37/38/39 conclude' messages confirms lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant in-transit inventory (512 units), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 to represent the current stable regime since the last major shift. sigma_hat will also use N=14 to capture the volatility of this specific regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime from Period 26 onwards. Analyzing the most recent data (P26-P40), the mean demand is approximately 123 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 20. The current status shows 0 inventory on-hand, which is concerning as arrivals have been just under the realized demand, leading to stockouts in P37-P40. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since my current in-transit (455 units) needs to cover 5 periods (L+1), and the expected demand over (L+1) is approximately 615 units (123*5), the inventory position is slightly low. I will set mu_hat to capture the average demand of this identified regime (N=15, from P26 to P40) and use the same window for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. This should trigger appropriate orders to rebuild a small buffer and meet demand requirements.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~123 units since Period 26. Specifically, over the last 15 periods (P26-P41), the demand has fluctuated between 79 and 149, with a recent mean of approximately 123. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Currently, we have 10 units on-hand and 470 units in-transit. The OR backend needs to maintain a pipeline inventory that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=15 for mu_hat (covering the post-spike stability period) and sigma_hat will provide a robust estimate of the current demand regime. The high in-transit (470) compared to our expected needs (~600) suggests the backend will continue to place orders to maintain this safety stock level.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following the high-demand spike (P16-P25). Analysis of the last 17 periods (P26-P42) shows an average demand of approximately 124 units. Most recently (P37-P42), demand has averaged 132 units, showing slightly higher but consistent activity compared to the early periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 18 units on-hand and 445 units in-transit, the inventory position is primarily protected by the pipeline. To minimize the risk of periodic stockouts (observed in P37-P40) while avoiding the excessive holding costs seen around P30, I am using recent_N=10 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable mean (~128) and recent_N=10 for volatility (sigma_hat) to account for the consistent variability in this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 43, the mean demand is approximately 122.9 units with a standard deviation of approximately 18.9 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a total pipeline (in-transit) of 512 units. Specifically, orders from P40 (82 units), P41 (149 units), P42 (126 units), and P43 (155 units) are outstanding. The order from P40 is expected to arrive during P44. Since the recent demand regime is stable, I will use recent_N=18 (covering Period 26 to 43) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this post-spike behavior accurately. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at the current rate (~615 units), balancing the high holding cost ($1.0) against the lost profit ($1.0).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 26. Since Period 35, the mean demand is approximately 125 units (P26-P44 average is ~123). Recent periods (P40-P44) show slight volatility with demand values of 149, 124, 143, 108, and 147. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand exceeding the small arrival of 82 units in Period 44 (which was the order from Period 40). However, there is a substantial in-transit pipeline of 526 units (orders from P41, P42, P43, and P44). The OR backend's capped policy will account for this pipeline. To best capture the current stable but slightly volatile demand, I will use a recent_N of 19 (P26 to P44) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-spike stabilization period clearly, ensuring the base stock level covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~131 units since the regime shift at Period 26 (calculated as the average of P26-P45). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, with arrivals exactly matching the 4-period promise. Despite recent stockouts in P43 and P44 due to demand volatility, the current in-transit inventory (465 units) is significant, representing approximately 3.5 periods of average demand. The backend OR logic must balance the current on-hand inventory (23 units) and this large pipeline against a stabilized demand forecast. I will use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current post-spike regime, capturing the average demand of ~131 and its associated volatility to ensure adequate service levels as we approach the end of the game (P50).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P26 remains stable at ~131 units (avg P26-P45), following the high-demand spike of P16-P25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the current regime that started at Period 26. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 46 is approximately 131 units (N=21). The lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the most recent arrivals (P37-P42 all arrived with L=4). On-hand inventory is low (7 units) and there is a healthy pipeline of 466 units. Given the remaining 4 periods in the game (ending at Period 50), orders placed now (P47) will arrive at the start of Period 51 (after the game ends). However, to maintain the base stock logic for the final operational days and ensure the service level is met for the remaining periods (P47-P50), I will use the established regime parameters. N=21 is chosen for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the stable period since the last major shift at P26.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable since the regime shift at Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 130 units (mean of P26-P47 is ~125.7). Recent demand in Period 47 was 117. Total on-hand inventory is 45 units, and in-transit inventory is 458 units (orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the game is nearing its end (Period 48 of 50), the pipeline inventory of 458 units is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (average demand 130 * 3 = 390). Any significant additional ordering at this stage would likely result in unnecessary holding costs, which are $1.0/unit (equal to the profit/unit), negatively impacting the total reward. I will maintain the stable demand parameters using the recent_N method (N=22 to encompass the stable regime since P26) to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation reflects the current environment, while the high in-transit balance will naturally limit new orders via the capped policy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. Period 50 is the final period. The demand regime identified in Carry-Over Insight P46 has been stable since P26, with a mean of approximately 131 units. Looking at the last 10 periods (P39-P48), the average demand is 126.6 units with a standard deviation of 16.7. The Lead Time is confirmed to be 4 periods. Since the next order (placed now in P49) would arrive in Period 53 (49+4), which is beyond the game end date (P50), this order will not be sold and will only incur holding costs. However, the system's objective is to maximize profit across all periods, and the OR backend uses the base-stock policy to calculate orders relative to the 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit). Currently, 'on-hand' is 28 and 'in-transit' is 477, totaling 505 units. With current demand around 130 per period, we have enough inventory to cover P49 and P50 demand (~260 units). I will set parameters to reflect the current stable regime (N=20 for mu_hat to include the stable P29-P48 period) while ensuring the OR backend acknowledges the 4-period lead time. No new significant patterns or regime shifts are detected.

Daily Profit: $116.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable following the shift at Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 131 units (Period 26-49). Recent demand observations (P47-P49: 117, 113, 133) align with this average. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed. Current inventory status shows 0 units on-hand and 501 units in-transit. The in-transit inventory covers the expected demand for the lead time duration (131 * 4 = 524 units), suggesting that the pipeline is nearly sufficient but needs to maintain the base stock level. I will use recent_N=24 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stats since the P26 regime shift, ensuring the OR backend targets the ~131 mean and current volatility to maintain service levels without excessive holding costs.
