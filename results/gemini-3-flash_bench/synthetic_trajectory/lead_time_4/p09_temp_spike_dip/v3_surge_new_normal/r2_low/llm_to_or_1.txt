Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory for chips(Regular). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods indicates an average demand of 115.4 units per period (146, 110, 112, 150, 59). However, Period 5 shows a significant drop (59), which might indicate a regime shift or a random fluctuation. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's base-stock logic will aim for a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), meaning base_stock \u2248 mu_hat. To ensure we cover the risk while acknowledging the recent drop, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full historical context provided, while using the 'default' lead time (4 periods). This will calculate mu_hat as (1+4) * 115.4 = 577.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 176 units based on a promised lead time of 4. As expected, these units have not arrived yet (Current on-hand: 0). The demand in Period 1 was 140, resulting in 140 lost sales. Historical demand across Periods 1-5 (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) shows an average of ~115 units per period. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using all available historical samples (5 total), the mean is 115.4 and the standard deviation is 35.8. I will use the 'default' methods for now to anchor the forecast on the provided history, as there is not yet enough conclusive evidence for a regime shift from just one period of play.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Observations from Period 1 and 2 show 0 starting on-hand inventory and 0 arrivals, resulting in 0 units sold despite demands of 140 and 136. This is consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods, meaning the first order (Period 1) is not expected to arrive until the resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). The In-transit total of 349 units reflects the orders from Period 1 (176) and Period 2 (173). Demand samples show some volatility (146, 110, 112, 150, 59). Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using all available demand samples (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate as we have no confirmed regime shift yet. I will set L to 'default' as no arrivals have concluded to suggest otherwise.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The on-hand inventory remains 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (176 units), Period 2 (173 units), and Period 3 (180 units) are currently in-transit and are expected to arrive in Periods 5, 6, and 7 respectively (assuming the promised lead time of 4 is accurate). Since no orders have concluded yet, we cannot verify the actual lead time. Historical demand for the first three periods was 140, 136, and 92. The demand sample provided in the prompt suggests Period 4 demand is 150 and Period 5 is 59. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to the profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5 (1/(1+1)), which means we aim to meet the median demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent average demand (approx 122.6) while maintaining the default lead time estimate of 4.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 (total 614 units). Based on the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (176 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced lost sales because arrivals haven't started yet. Demand has shown a downward trend: 140, 136, 92, 58. The samples provided in the prompt (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) also reflect significant volatility and a recent drop. Given the L=4 and the recent low demand of 58-59, I will use a conservative recent_N approach. I'll set N=4 to capture the recent mean but keep the default lead time (L=4) as no orders have concluded yet to prove a shift in actual lead time. This will help the OR engine set a base stock that accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Based on history, the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the lead time (L) is exactly 4 periods as promised. The demand for the first 5 periods has been fluctuating but generally steady with an average of approximately 108.8 units (140, 136, 92, 58, 118 - though I will use the provided sample data for statistical accuracy: 146, 110, 112, 150, 59). On-hand inventory is 58, and there are 438 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4). With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Using the mean of the provided samples (approx 115.4), the target base stock should be around 577 units. Given the in-transit and on-hand inventory (438+58=496), the OR engine needs parameters that reflect this steady but slightly volatile demand. I will use the default method for lead time as 4 is confirmed, and recent_N for demand to capture the most relevant recent levels.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Promised lead time is 4. Historical conclusion data from Period 5 and 6 confirm that orders placed in Period 1 and 2 arrived exactly with a lead time of 4. Current on-hand inventory is 125, with 313 units in-transit (orders from Periods 3, 4, and 6). Demand samples (140, 136, 92, 58, 118, 106) show some volatility but no clear regime shift yet, though the most recent sample in Period 5 (59 units) was a significant outlier/dip compared to early periods. However, the game history demand reports (140, 136, 92, 58, 118, 106) average approximately 108.3. Since L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+4)=5 periods of demand. Using all samples (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate as there isn't enough evidence for a sustained shift yet. The OR backend will calculate base_stock based on profit/holding cost ratio (critical ratio q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5) and current pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-113.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have an on-hand inventory of 209 units and 237 units in-transit. Looking at the 'conclude' messages for Periods 5, 6, and 7, we confirm the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (matches promised). Historical demand over the first 7 periods shows a mean of approximately 106.5 units/period (140, 136, 92, 58, 118, 106, 96). However, there's a noticeable drop in the last set of samples compared to the initial ones. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for demand forecasting (mu_hat) to capture the overall average while acknowledging the volatility. Since the promised lead time of 4 is being met precisely, I will use the 'default' lead time method. For sigma_hat, N=7 is also appropriate to capture the variance across the available history. The inventory level is currently healthy, and the pipeline (237 units) covers the next several periods of expected demand, so the OR backend will likely place a modest order to maintain the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-50.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistent for the first four orders (Periods 1-4). Demand samples (Periods 1-8) are: 140, 136, 92, 58, 118, 106, 96, 122. The mean demand is approximately 108.5, and the standard deviation is approximately 27.6. Recently (Periods 5-8), demand has stabilized slightly with an average of 110.5. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). The OR backend uses this to set the base stock level. Currently, on-hand (172) + in-transit (239) = 411 units. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. 5 * 110 \u2248 550 units. While the 'cap' mechanism might limit the order to avoid overstocking due to the high holding cost relative to profit, setting mu_hat based on recent performance ensures we don't under-order if a slight upward trend continues.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (consistently observed for orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 61 units. Average demand over the last 9 periods is approximately 108.8 units, while recent demand (last 5 periods) is 110.6 units, suggesting a stable demand regime around 110. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (L=4). The pipeline contains orders from Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9. Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect the order from Period 6 (48 units) to arrive during Period 10, followed by Period 7 (104 units) in Period 11. Although Period 9 showed 'arrived=0', this is consistent with L=4 as the order placed in P5 would arrive in P9 (but P5's order was 0). We should maintain a base stock that covers L+1=5 periods of demand (~550 units). With current on-hand (61) and in-transit (371), total inventory position is 432 units, meaning an additional order is likely needed to cover the lead-time demand plus safety stock. I will use recent_N=9 for demand to smooth out the noise while staying responsive to the observed range.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Analysis of past 'conclude' messages confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). At Period 10, the order from Period 6 arrived exactly as expected (lead time 4). However, there was no shipment placed in Period 5 (ordered=0), which explains the arrived=0 in Period 9. The current demand over the last 10 periods has been relatively stable with no clear seasonal signal given the generic 'Period_X' labels. Mean demand across the 10 samples is 107.3, with a standard deviation of approximately 24. Since there's no major regime shift detected, using the full historical sample (recent_N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to smooth out volatility while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time (L=4).

In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5-P8 and P10-P11). One shipment from Period 5 is notably missing (it should have arrived in P9), suggesting it was lost. This loss caused on-hand inventory to drop to a low of 18 units. Current pipeline inventory is 416 units. Demand over the last 11 periods has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 107 units per period. Since the most recent 6 periods (P6-P11) show a tighter demand range around 105 units, I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. I will use 'calculate' for the lead time L, as the observed data confirms the promised 4-period lead time. The goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the 5 periods (L+1) required to bridge the lead time gap, accounting for the single lost shipment already reflected in the lowered pipeline/on-hand totals.

Carry-over insight: Shipment ordered in Period 5 (0 units ordered) resulted in no arrival in Period 9 as expected, but more importantly, the system is now stabilized around a lead time of 4. Stock levels are low (18) due to the delayed/lost coverage from the P5-P6 period transition.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of approximately 104 units per period (mean of last 12 periods is 104.1; mean of last 5 periods is 96.2). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by recent arrivals (P6, P7, P8 orders all arrived with exactly a 4-period lead time). Period 9 showed 0 units arrived because 0 units were ordered in Period 5, which confirms there were no disruptions, just a gap in ordering. On-hand inventory is currently low (32) because of that Period 5 gap, but 'In-transit' is 420, covering the next 4 periods of expected demand (~400 units). I will use a window of 8 periods for demand forecasting (recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture recent stability while filtering out early noise. This balances the service level against holding costs by ensuring the base stock accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-54.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a significant decrease in Period 13 (demand=55) compared to the long-term average (approx. 104). The mean demand over the last 5 periods is 86.8. The lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the Period 13 arrival (ordered Period 9). On-hand inventory is 109, and in-transit inventory is 350. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the OR engine targets the median demand to minimize total cost. To account for the recent drop in demand while maintaining responsiveness, I will use recent_N (N=5) for the mean and standard deviation to recalibrate the pipeline target.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 13: demand dropped to 55, bringing the 5-period average to 86.8 compared to the initial 110+ range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-25.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Between Periods 1-12, average demand was approximately 104 units. However, in the three most recent periods (13-15), demand dropped to 55, 98, and 59 (mean = 70.6). This represents a marked decrease of ~32%. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (123) and substantial units in-transit (238), the current pipeline is likely over-supplied for this lower demand regime. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus the OR backend on the current lower demand level and prevent excessive ordering while the inventory burns down. Sigma_hat is also adjusted to recent volatility to reflect this new state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand dropped from ~104 to ~71 starting Period 13 (-32% change sustained for 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-54.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 13 is well-established. Over the last three periods (P13-P15), demand has been 55, 98, and 77, resulting in a mean of 76.67. This is significantly lower than the initial average of ~104. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals through Period 15 (85 units ordered in P11 arrived in P15). Currently, on-hand inventory is 131 and in-transit is 169. With a lead time of 4, the target window is (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the recent demand mean (~77), the base stock target would be around 385 units. Current pipeline (131+169=300) is below this. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand and reduced volatility observed in the new regime. This will help the OR backend adjust the base stock downward without over-ordering into a high holding cost situation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $222.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked unexpectedly to 305 units, far exceeding the recent average of ~71 and the available inventory. This resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The in-transit pipeline (162 units) consists of orders from P13 (62 units) and P15 (16 units), plus the fresh order from P16 (84 units). Following the lead time pattern of 4 periods, the P13 order is expected to arrive during the next period (P17). However, the massive demand spike in P16 suggests a potential shift in demand regime (either a one-time event or a new high-demand period). To protect against further stockouts while acknowledging the recent shift, I will use a mix of strategies: maintaining the confirmed L=4, but increasing the demand forecast (mu_hat) by using an EWMA with a higher weight (gamma=0.3) to respond to the 305-unit signal without overreacting if it was an outlier, and using recent_N for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike in Period 16 (305 units) disrupted the low-demand regime (~71) previously identified; monitor for sustained high volume.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a significant demand spike that started in Period 16 (demand increased from ~70 to over 300). Period 16 demand was 305 and Period 17 demand was 322. This suggests a new high-demand regime, possibly seasonal or promotional. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts in the last two periods. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since we need to cover the current period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1=5 periods), and current demand is averaging ~313 over the last 2 periods, I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide aggressive coverage. sigma_hat is also increased to account for the high volatility observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime shift confirmed: Demand surged from avg ~71 to ~313 starting Period 16 (+340% increase), sustained for 2 periods. Significant stockouts occurring.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Evidence: Period 16 demand (305), Period 17 (322), and Period 18 (219). The previous average was ~71, now it is ~282 over the last 3 periods. We are experiencing stockouts (Period 16, 17, and 18 ending inventory at 0; no arrivals in Period 18). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods based on historical consistency. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Current on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 933. Expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 1410 (282 * 5). Using the high-demand regime for mu_hat (N=3) and sigma_hat (N=3) to aggressively stock up and recover from the stockout. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is currently holding.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime shift clearly sustained (3 periods): Period 16-18 average demand is 282, vs previous ~71 (+297% increase). Monitoring for persistence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has been 305, 322, 219, and 194, resulting in an average of 260 units per period. This is a massive shift from the previous low-demand regime (~71). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts for four consecutive periods. There is significant pipeline inventory (1290 units), but the arrivals for Period 16 (84 units), Period 17 (409 units), Period 18 (424 units), and Period 19 (373 units) are still in transit and won't arrive for a few more periods. For Period 20, we need to maintain a high base stock to satisfy this new demand level. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand volatility and mean. Lead time L is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime shift confirmed (4 periods): Period 16-19 average demand is 260 units (vs previous ~71), with significant volatility (std ~64). Pipeline is heavy but arrivals are delayed by the 4-period lead time.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 21. A major high-demand regime shift was confirmed starting in Period 16, with demand averaging approximately 255 units over the last 5 periods (305, 322, 219, 194, 235), far exceeding the previous low-demand regime of ~71. Due to the confirmed 4-period lead time, the system has been stocking out since Period 16 because the small orders placed during the low-demand period (P10-P15) are only now arriving. Large orders placed starting in Period 17 (409 units) are scheduled to arrive from Period 21 onwards. The pipeline inventory is very high (1216 units) because of these massive orders. I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-demand sustained regime (P16-P20). This balances the need to cover the recent surge while preventing excessive ordering, as the pipeline is already substantial and the backend OR logic will subtract this from the base stock. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 4-period reality.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime shift confirmed and sustained (5 periods, P16-P20): Average demand is 255 units (std 54), marking a permanent shift from the previous ~71 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 22. The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16, moving from an average of ~71 to approximately 245 units over the last 6 periods (P16-P21). The most recent period (P21) showed a demand of 195, following a series of very high demand values (305, 322, 219, 194, 235). On-hand inventory recovered to 214 units thanks to the arrival of the Period 17 order (409 units). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the high demand mean, I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the current sustained high-demand environment while responding to the recent slight softening in demand compared to the initial peak of 322. L is kept at 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the history.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P21) validated: 6-period mean demand is ~245 units with high volatility (std ~50). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is firmly established (Period 16 to Period 22). The 7-period mean demand since the spike is approximately 238.8 units (305, 322, 219, 194, 235, 195, 252), with a standard deviation of 45.4. Recent arrivals (409 units from P17 and 424 units from P18) have replenished on-hand inventory to 386 units, addressing the previous stockouts. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+L=5) periods of high demand. Using a recent window (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current high-demand, high-volatility environment better than the total sample average. On-hand + In-transit (386 + 587 = 973) is well-positioned to cover the next 4-5 periods of demand (~1200 units needed), requiring the OR backend to modulate orders to maintain this balance without excessive holding costs.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that started in Period 16 is sustained, though recent values show a slight moderation compared to the initial peak. For periods 16-23, the mean demand is approximately 242 units with a standard deviation of 51. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The large orders placed during the stockout phase (P17, P18, P19) are now arriving, significantly increasing on-hand inventory (548) and pipeline (471). To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level for this high-demand period, I will use recent_N (N=8, covering the entire high-demand regime) for both demand mean and volatility. This balances the initial surge (300+) with the more recent stabilization (~210-250 range).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P23) mean stabilized at ~242 units with standard deviation ~51. Total inventory position is now robust after recovering from stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-84.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher level since Period 16. Analyzing the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the mean demand is approximately 241 units with a standard deviation of 51. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 321 units and in-transit is 651 units, totaling a pipeline of 972 units. For a lead time of 4, the OR backend requires parameters covering 5 periods (L+1). With an average demand of 241, we expect 1205 units of demand over the next 5 periods. Using recent_N=9 for both Mu and Sigma will capture this high-demand regime while allowing the backend to calculate the base stock and cap appropriately based on the profit and holding cost ($1.0 each, implying a 50% service level target).

Daily Reward (R_t): $208.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is sustained. Demand from Period 16 to Period 25 (last 10 periods) shows a mean of approximately 246.4 units with a standard deviation of 48.7. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since my target is to set parameters for the OR backend for Period 26, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this high-demand segment specifically. This period (P25) saw a drop in on-hand inventory to 86 due to high demand (294), but the pipeline remains very healthy (826 in-transit) with upcoming arrivals from ordered quantities of 145 (ordered P22), 257 (ordered P23), and 190 (ordered P24) expected over the next few periods. Setting N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the base stock calculation reflects current high volume and volatility rather than the historical lows.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift starting from Period 16. Analyzing the high-demand regime (Periods 16-26), the mean demand is approximately 235 units, though we observe a significant drop in Period 26 (113 units). Despite this single-period drop, the overall regime remains much higher than the pre-Period 16 average. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1001 units combined with 'On-hand' inventory of 118 creates a substantial pipeline position relative to the expected lead-time demand plus safety stock (approx. (4+1)*235 = 1175). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 11 periods (N=11) to capture the current high-demand regime while including the recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-85.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a potential cooling off from the extremely high-demand regime (P16-P25 average ~245) noted in previous carry-overs. Demand in Period 26 was 113 and Period 27 was 145. However, since this is only a 2-period signal, I must remain cautious. The high-demand regime from P16 onwards (12 samples available) remains the most reliable anchor for the stock levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 230 and in-transit is 797, creating a total inventory position of 1027. This covers roughly 4-5 periods of demand at the high-regime average (approx 240 units/period). I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the full 'high-demand' regime (P16-P27) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring we cover the (L+1)=5 period horizon while being sensitive to the high volatility observed during this phase.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a high-volume regime since Period 16, though recent volatility is high (P26: 113, P28: 184). The mean demand over the last 13 periods (P16-P28) is approximately 223 units, which is a significant increase from the early game but slightly lower than the peak period average (~250). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 236 and in-transit is 715, totaling 951 units available or arriving. This covers roughly 4.2 periods of the current average demand (223), which is close to the expected lead time (L=4) plus current period coverage (L+1=5). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 to capture this sustained high-demand regime while filtering out the early low-demand data. Sigma_hat will also use N=13 to reflect current volatility. Lead time L will remain at the default promised value of 4, consistent with observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P16 (P16-P28) stabilized at approximately 223 units/period (std ~65), representing a sustained high-demand state compared to pre-P16 levels.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of approximately 218 units since the surge began in Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 14 periods (P16-P29), the average demand is 218.4 with a standard deviation of 66.8. The current on-hand inventory is 337 units, and there are 648 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (std ~67) and the current period (30/50), maintaining a safe inventory level is critical to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs. I will use the recent_N method with N=14 to capture this sustained high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time as it has been consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-497.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown a decline in the most recent periods (P26-P30), with values of 113, 145, 184, 133, and 80. This is a significant drop from the P16-P25 average of ~240 units. The 5-period average (P26-30) is now 131 units, suggesting a new transition or cooling off from the high-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Inventory levels (On-hand: 577, In-transit: 429) are currently very high relative to this new demand level, as they were built up for the previous high-demand regime. Using N=5 for mu_hat will allow the OR backend to quickly adjust the 'base_stock' target downwards to reduce holding costs, while N=10 for sigma_hat provides enough volatility context to prevent drastic undershooting if this is just a temporary lull.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 26: average demand decreased from ~242 to 131 (-46%) over the last 5 periods (P26-P30).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-468.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 26. While the previous regime (P16-P25) averaged ~242 units, demand over the last 6 periods (P26-P31) has dropped to an average of 122.6 units (113, 145, 184, 133, 80, 81). Current on-hand inventory is 549 units, which is quite high relative to this new demand level. In-transit inventory is 376 units (orders from P28, P29, P30), which will arrive over the next three periods. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4) and the current inventory position (total pipeline = 549 + 376 = 925), the system is overstocked for the current demand rate (~123/period). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this downward shift and sigma_hat similarly to reflect current volatility. This will allow the OR backend to significantly reduce order quantities until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting P26 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~242 to ~123 (-49%) over the last 6 periods (P26-P31).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 26. While the Period 16-25 window saw average demand of ~240 units, the last 7 periods (P26-P32) have averaged 123.1 units per period (113, 145, 184, 133, 80, 81, 126). This represents a decrease of approximately 49% from the previous high-demand regime. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory (531 units) and in-transit inventory (268 units), the total inventory position (799 units) is far in excess of the projected demand for the (L+1)=5 period lead time window (approx. 5 * 123 = 615 units). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the current lower demand level and minimize further accumulation of holding costs, while maintaining the L parameter at its stable value of 4.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted downwards starting around Period 26. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P26-P33) is approximately 114 units, a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime of ~223 units. Current on-hand inventory is 565 units, which covers nearly 5 periods of the current average demand. With an additional 101 units in-transit (ordered P30) arriving in Period 34, the total inventory position is 666 units. Given the lead time (L=4) and review period, the total exposure period is 5. Total exposure demand (5 * 114 = 570) is currently exceeded by the inventory position. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect this lower demand regime and prevent overstocking, while maintaining sigma_hat based on the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting P26 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~223 to ~114 (-49%) over the last 8 periods (P26-P33).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 34 (9 samples), the mean is approximately 114 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 32 units. The current on-hand inventory is 520 units, and there are no units in-transit. Given a lead time (L) of 4, the demand coverage required is for (L+1) = 5 periods. At a mean of 114, the expected demand over the next 5 periods is 570 units. Since current inventory is 520, the system is nearly balanced with existing stock. I will use a recent_N approach (N=9) to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that prevents excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the current 114-unit average demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-298.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has settled into a new lower-demand regime starting from Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 35, the average demand is approximately 125 units per period (113, 145, 184, 133, 80, 81, 126, 133, 146, 111). This is a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime (~223-242 units). Current on-hand inventory is high at 409 units, while the in-transit inventory is 114 units, totaling 523 units. With an expected demand of ~125 and a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods, which requires a base stock of roughly 625 units. Since we are already at 523, the OR backend will order a small amount to reach the target service level. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower/stable demand regime since P26. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P26 (P26-P35) stabilized at approximately 125 units/period (std ~30), down from the ~223 units observed in the previous high-demand state.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 36, the mean demand is approximately 125 units with a standard deviation of roughly 24. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. My strategy is to align the OR parameters with this current regime (N=11) to maintain an appropriate service level while managing holding costs, as on-hand inventory is currently high (282 units) relative to the current demand levels. There are no arrivals in Period 35 and 36 because the orders placed in Periods 31-34 were all 0, fitting the adjustment to the previous overstocked state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-112.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 26 and has remained stable. For the last 12 periods (P26-P37), the average demand is approximately 125.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30.5. Given the current on-hand inventory of 197 and a large in-transit pipeline of 345 units (total inventory position = 542), the system is currently overstocked relative to the new demand level (Base Stock for L=4 is roughly 627, but we must account for the 1-period reporting delay). Order arrivals (from P35-P37) should begin appearing in the next few periods. I will use the recent_N method with N=12 to capture this sustained lower-demand regime (P26-P37) and maintain L=4 (calculated) to synchronize with the observed lead time stability.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26, with a confirmed mean of approximately 125 units per period and a standard deviation of 30. During Period 38, we observed a demand of 131, consistent with this current regime. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Our 'In-transit' inventory is 413 units, which is quite high relative to current demand needs, but we must account for the fact that the 'In-transit' figure on the snapshot includes the order just placed in the current period's backend logic. Examining history, orders from P35-P38 (114, 103, 128, 68) are arriving over the next 4 periods. With on-hand inventory sitting at 66 and average demand at 125, we are entering a phase where arrivals from the orders placed after the 'zero-order' streak (P31-P34) are critical to prevent stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 (covering P26-P38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current stabilized demand level of ~121 units/period while ignoring the high-demand volatility of the P16-P25 era.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 26 at an average of approximately 115-125 units per period, following a significant drop from the high-demand regime (>220). The last 5 periods (P35-P39) show demand values of 111, 127, 85, 131, and 115, resulting in a mean of 113.8. Current inventory status reveals On-hand: 65 and In-transit: 434. The in-transit inventory is high because orders from Periods 36, 37, 38, and 39 (totaling 434 units) are expected to arrive in Periods 40, 41, 42, and 43 respectively, based on the confirmed lead time of 4. We use recent_N=14 to capture the stable demand since Period 26 while excluding previous volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 26, following the high-demand surge seen between Periods 16-25. Analysis of the most recent 15 periods (P26-P40) yields a mean demand of approximately 117 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 27. The most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) show an average of 113.6, confirming this stability. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 58 and 443 units in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40), the current pipeline is sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon ((L+1) = 5). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 periods (N=15) to capture the current stable regime while providing enough sample size for a reliable volatility estimate, as the previous high-demand regime is no longer relevant for forecasting.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in the lower-demand regime established around Period 26. Since Period 35, the demand has averaged approximately 114.3 units per period (P35-P41), showing significant stability compared to the previous surge above 200. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P39-P41 arrivals confirm this), meaning a (L+1) = 5 period outlook is required. Current on-hand inventory is 87, and in-transit inventory is 421 (sum of orders from P38, P39, P40, P41). Total inventory position is 508. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat (covering the stable period since P35) will capture this lower mean (~114) and prevent over-ordering as the system stabilizes from the previous stockout-recovery oscillations.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 26, settling into a regime with a mean of approximately 120 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 42) was 143, while the last 5 periods averaged 121.4. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is low (12 units) despite a large pipeline (401 units). However, looking at the in-transit schedule: orders from P39 (135), P40 (112), P41 (106), and P42 (48) are expected to arrive in Periods 43, 44, 45, and 46 respectively. I will use the recent_N method (N=17, covering P26 onwards) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime and its volatility (approx 120 mean, 20-30 std). Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 4-period lead time.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 26, following several shifts. The current mean demand for the period P26 to P43 (18 samples) is approximately 119 units with a standard deviation of 22 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 53, and the in-transit inventory is 432. Since 432 units are already in the pipeline (covering orders from P40, P41, P42, P43) and the base stock for a (L+1)=5 period lead time at 119 units/period would be around 595 plus a safety buffer, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order. I will use recent_N with N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stable post-spike regime starting at P26. Lead time L is set to 'default' (4 periods), which matches observed history.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime starting from Period 26. Since Period 36, the average demand has been approximately 114 units (P36-P44 average is 114.1), which is a significant drop from the high-demand state seen in earlier periods. The lead time remains extremely stable at exactly 4 periods, which is consistent with the promised lead time. Currently, we have 47 units on hand and a large pipeline of 434 units. However, looking at the order schedule, we are entering the arrival window for orders placed in P41 (106 units) and P42 (48 units). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (recent_N=10) to capture this stable, lower-demand regime while maintaining a responsive buffer for the high volatility observed in this SKU. The target base stock focuses on the (1+L) = 5 period horizon.

For the last 20 periods (P26-P45), demand has averaged approximately 116 units with a standard deviation of 21. For the most recent 10 periods (P36-P45), demand averaged 112.2 units with a standard deviation of 17.8. Given this stability, I will use recent_N with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it captures the current behavior accurately while smoothing out minor fluctuations. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (validated through P41's arrival in P45). With On-hand at 23 and In-transit at 414, the total inventory position is 437, which currently covers approximately 3.9 periods of demand. Using recent_N=10 allows the OR backend to maintain a safe stock level centered around the current 112-unit mean, ensuring service levels are met without excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 116 units per period over the last 11 periods (P36-P46), following the significant drop observed after P26. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout in P46 where demand (106) exceeded starting inventory + arrivals (71). However, the in-transit pipeline is substantial at 505 units. With 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), orders placed now will arrive in P51, which is outside the game horizon. Therefore, any order placed in Period 47 will incur holding costs if it arrives, but cannot contribute to more revenue within the game's 50-period limit. The current pipeline (orders from P43-P46) is expected to arrive in P47-P50. Specifically, P43 order (166) arrives in P47, P44 order (114) in P48, P45 order (86) in P49, and P46 order (139) in P50. This pipeline (505 units) against expected remaining demand (~464 units) is sufficient to cover the rest of the game with minimal risk of further stockouts. I am setting parameters to reflect the current demand regime (recent_N=11) to ensure the backend logic has an accurate view of demand, but the lead-time and current stockout state shouldn't trigger massive unnecessary orders given the game end is near.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 26, with a current mean of approximately 121 units and a standard deviation of 22 units over the last 15 periods (P33-P47). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50), and on-hand inventory sitting at 15 units with 406 units in-transit, the pipeline is significantly overburdened relative to the remaining time. Specifically, an order placed now (P48) with a 4-period lead time would not arrive until Period 52, which is beyond the game's conclusion at Period 50. Since the goal is to maximize reward (Profit - Holding Cost), and no further orders will arrive within the game's horizon to satisfy late-game demand beyond what is already in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect current demand and maintaining the actual lead time of 4. The capped policy in the OR backend will naturally limit excessive ordering given the large in-transit balance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The current demand regime for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable since Period 26, with a mean demand of approximately 116 units and a standard deviation of about 20 over the last 23 periods (P26-P48). However, very recent demand (last 3 periods: 106, 151, 126) shows slightly higher activity (avg 127). The on-hand inventory is very low at 3 units, but there is a substantial pipeline of 445 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we expect the order from Period 45 (86 units) to arrive during Period 49 (becoming visible at P50). To ensure we cover the remaining game periods (P49 and P50) while balancing holding costs and stockout risks, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=23 to capture the full stability of the current regime starting at P26. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime starting from Period 26. Analyzing the most recent data (P26-P49), the average demand is approximately 119 units with a standard deviation of roughly 22 units. While there have been minor stockouts in P46 and P49 due to tight inventory levels, the underlying demand pattern remains stable. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since this is the final period (P50), the goal is to set parameters that reflect the current regime while maintaining the lead time logic. I will use a recent_N of 24 to cover the entire stable regime since P26, which provides a robust estimate of both mean and variance for the backend to calculate the final order, considering the large in-transit pipeline of 517 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P26 (P26-P49) stabilized at approximately 119 units/period (std ~22). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.
