The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be available for sale in Period 6. The OR algorithm recommends ordering 176 units based on the historical demand samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59), which have a mean of approximately 115.4. Given the long lead time (L=4), we must cover at least 5 periods of demand (L+1). The OR recommendation of 176 units seems conservative relative to the sum of historical demand over 5 periods (~577 units), but the OR cap formula is designed to smooth initial orders when pipeline inventory is zero. However, since we start with zero inventory and have a 4-period wait, we need to begin building the pipeline immediately. I will follow the OR recommendation of 176 as a starting point to avoid excessive holding costs if demand remains low (like the most recent sample of 59), while acknowledging that subsequent orders will be needed to fully satisfy the 5-period demand window.",

Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) average ~115. Recent realized demand in Period 1 (140) and Period 2 (136) is slightly higher than the historical average, but consistent with the 'Regular Chips' category. 3. Inventory Strategy: We are currently stocking out (sold 0 in P1, P2) because we started with 0 inventory and the lead time is long. We must maintain a consistent pipeline to cover demand once arrivals begin. Total pipeline (in-transit) is 352. Target inventory for (L+1) = 5 periods at ~135 demand/period is ~675 units. 4.

Neither of these covers the new demand regime (~280-300 units), guaranteeing stockouts for the next two periods. \n5. **OR Recommendation Critique**: The OR recommends 0 units because the massive order placed in P18 (1100 units) satisfies its pipeline requirements even with the demand surge.

Strategy: The total pipeline (898) sufficiently covers the next 4 periods of demand at the current average (221 * 4 = 884). OR recommends 0 because the pipeline is full relative to historical averages. However, since we are currently at 0 on-hand and P27 demand occurs before the P23 order arrives, we will likely stock out again in P27. Since the next 4 periods of arrivals are already committed (898 units), and ordering now (P27) only impacts P31, adding more units now while holding 898 in the pipeline risks high holding costs if demand doesn't spike. I will follow the OR recommendation of 0 to allow the pipeline to clear.",

The recent 5-period average (P41-P45) is 116.8 units. The game ends at Period 50, so we have 5 periods of demand remaining (P46, P47, P48, P49, P50). \n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand inventory is 121. In-transit inventory consists of: P42 (90), P43 (147), P44 (90), and P45 (116), totaling 443 units. \n4. **End-of-Game Strategy**: \n   - Current available/pipeline inventory = 121 + 443 = 564 units.\n   - Total expected demand for the remaining 5 periods (assuming ~120 units/period) = 600 units.\n   - An order placed now (P46) with a 4-period lead time will arrive in Period 50. It can only satisfy demand in Period 50.\n   - If I order the OR recommendation (129), my total supply would be 564 + 129 = 693 units against a total demand of ~600 units. \n   - Since holding cost is $1.0 and profit is $1.0, ending with excess inventory is costly. I want to minimize ending inventory while meeting demand.\n   - Expected stock before P50 arrival: 564 - (120 * 4) = 84 units. P50 demand is ~120.\n   - Shortfall for Period 50 is roughly 36 units (120 - 84). \n   - However, the OR recommendation is 129, which is safe.

The initial high-demand spike (P16-P25) has settled into this moderate baseline. \n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand inventory is 105 units. In-transit inventory is 433 units (Orders from P43: 147, P44: 90, P45: 116, P46: 80). \n4. **Upcoming Arrivals**: P43's order (147 units) is expected to arrive during P47, making it available for P48. \n5. **OR Recommendation Evaluation**: The OR recommendation is 152 units. However, looking at the pipeline: Total Inventory (On-hand 105 + In-transit 433) = 538 units. At an average demand of 115, this covers roughly 4.7 periods. Since there are only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47, P48, P49, P50), ordering 152 units would likely result in excess ending inventory and high holding costs. \n6. **Strategy**: The game ends at Period 50. Any order placed now (P47) will arrive at the start of Period 51 (after the game ends) because lead time is 4. Therefore, any order placed in P47, P48, P49, or P50 will only incur costs without the possibility of being sold. My goal is to satisfy remaining demand with what is already on-hand and in-transit.",

Therefore, ordering more units now is ineffective as it only incurs holding costs for current in-transits while providing no revenue opportunity before the game ends.

No orders were placed in Periods 47, 48, or 49, creating a potential stockout gap in the pipeline for Periods 52-54. Since the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, an order placed now in Period 50 will arrive during Period 54 (visible in Period 55). Recent demand (P26-P49) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 121 units per period. The OR recommendation is 238 units. Considering the current on-hand inventory and the single pending shipment of 80 units, the total inventory available to cover the lead time (4 periods) and the next period is only 144 units, which is far below the expected demand of ~600 units (5 * 120). However, since this is the final period (Period 50), any order placed now will not arrive until Period 54, and its impact on the total reward depends on whether units sold in future periods (if the game continued) or ending inventory costs are the priority. In a fixed 50-period horizon, orders placed in Period 50 usually do not arrive in time to be sold. However, standard competitive play requires maintaining the policy.
