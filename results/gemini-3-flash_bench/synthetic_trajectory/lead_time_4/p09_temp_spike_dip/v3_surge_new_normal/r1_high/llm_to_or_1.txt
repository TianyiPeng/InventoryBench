Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no history of actual arrivals or concluded periods, I will use 'default' for the lead time parameter. Historical demand data for the first 5 periods (including several future-dated labels provided in the prompt) shows values: 146, 110, 112, 150, 59. The mean of these 5 samples is 115.4. Given the lead time L=4, the coverage period is L+1=5. For mu_hat, I will use the 'explicit' method to set a safe initial base stock based on the average demand across the coverage window ((1+4)*115.4 = 577). For sigma_hat, I will use 'explicit' to provide an initial volatility estimate based on the standard deviation of the samples (approx 35.6) scaled by sqrt(5), which is approx 79.6. This ensures the first order covers the expected lead time demand plus a safety buffer.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 174 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4 periods. As per the game mechanics, the arrival of this order is expected in Period 1+4=5. Consequently, the current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced a stockout in Period 1 (demand was 88, sold was 0). The demand for the first 5 periods (including historical samples provided in the prompt) has been 146, 110, 112, 150, and 59 (average around 115). Period 1's actual demand in the history log was 88. Given the lead time of 4, our 'time-to-protect' is 1+L = 5 periods. I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to allow the OR backend to utilize the provided historical demand samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59, 88) to set the base stock level. The pipeline of 174 units is already in transit to cover future periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. For chips(Regular), on-hand inventory is currently 0 with 342 units in-transit (orders from Period 1 and Period 2: 174 + 168). The promised lead time is 4 periods. This means the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 6 start observation. Demand for the first two periods was 88 and 79. My goal is to ensure the pipeline covers the required safety stock for L+1 periods (5 periods total). Historical demand samples provided (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) show significant variability with an average of 115.4. However, observed demand in the game so far (88, 79) is lower than the historical mean. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'default' demand parameters (which utilize the full historical sample set) to maintain a conservative buffer until more game-specific data points are collected to confirm a downward shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (174, 168, and 162 units respectively) are currently in-transit and are not expected to arrive until Periods 5, 6, and 7 based on the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have recorded lost sales because no stock has arrived yet. Historical demand for the first 3 periods was 88, 79, and 121 (mean ~96). The input data shows additional historical samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59), suggesting a higher mean around 114 across all samples. Since we have not yet observed any 'conclude' messages with actual arrival data, I will stick to the promised lead time (L=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available historical sample data (default) to capture the overall demand distribution until a clear regime shift is observed in the actual execution periods.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (at the start of Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 658 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4). Demand for the first 4 periods was 88, 79, 121, and 103 (Avg ~98). The inventory is currently 0 because all arrivals are still in transit according to the L=4 timeline. Since no orders have concluded yet, we cannot verify if the actual lead time differs from the promised lead time. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (N=4) to capture the initial behavior and 'default' for lead time as there is no evidence yet to suggest a deviation from the promised L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2046.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (Period 1) arrived exactly as promised in Period 5 (L=4). Analysis of historical demand: Periods 1-5 demand were 88, 79, 121, 103, 111. Mean = 100.4, StdDev = 16.96. The environment provides 'historical demand data' (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) which differs from the 'game history' demand. I will prioritize the 'game history' demand (recent 5 samples) as it reflects the actual realized demand in the simulation. Currently, we have 63 units on-hand and 484 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4). With L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Mean demand across 5 periods \u2248 502 units. Current pipeline (63 + 484 = 547) slightly exceeds this, but we must maintain service levels as stockouts occurred in P1-P4 due to the lead time. I will use recent_N=5 for demand and lead time to capture the localized mean.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand stable around mean 100.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The carry-over insight confirms a lead time (L) of 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). In-transit inventory includes orders from P3 (162 units), P4 (154 units), and P6 (18 units), totaling 334 units. Demand history (samples: 146, 110, 112, 150, 59, and recent actuals 88, 79, 121, 103, 111, 130) shows some volatility but centers around a mean of approximately 109 over the last 6 periods. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent behavior during the lead-time initialization phase. Setting L to 4 reflects the confirmed lead time. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that accounts for 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 152 units on hand and 310 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in Period 4 and 6/7). The promised lead time (L=4) has been confirmed as accurate through historical conclusions (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand has been relatively stable, oscillating around a mean of ~106 units per period (sample mean: 106.1). There is a slight upward trend in recent samples (130 for P6, 111 for P7 compared to the initial samples), but not yet enough sustained evidence for a regime shift. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 (all concluded demand samples) to capture this mean while setting L to 'default' as it matches observed reality.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 1 through 4. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 105 units over the last 8 periods. There is no evidence of seasonality or regime shifts yet. Calculation for mu_hat: Using the mean of all 8 historical demand samples (approx 105.5) multiplied by (1+L) where L=4, which equals 527.5. For sigma_hat, the historical standard deviation is approximately 17.5; multiplying by sqrt(1+L) \u2248 2.23 gives ~39. I will use 'default' for L (promised = 4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the full stable sample set after the initial warmup.

Daily Reward (R_t): $915.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the current on-hand inventory is 149 units. History shows a promised lead time of 4 periods, which has been consistent (confirmed by Period 5-8 arrivals). Period 9 saw 0 arrivals because no order was placed in Period 5 (ordered=0). The current in-transit pipeline (384 units) consists of orders from Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9 (18 + 138 + 135 + 93 = 384). Demand has been relatively stable, though Period 9 showed a lower demand of 56. Averaging all available demand samples (88, 79, 121, 103, 111, 130, 111, 101, 56) yields a mean of ~100. Using L=4, the coverage needed is for (L+1)=5 periods. 5 * 100 = 500 units. My total position (on-hand 149 + in-transit 384) is 533 units, which is slightly above the expected base stock level. I will use the default lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=9 (all available history) to capture the stable mean while acknowledging the recent lower demand point.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Over the last 10 periods, the observed demand for chips(Regular) has averaged approximately 105.6 units per period, with a standard deviation of roughly 28 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion messages for periods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10), though the order from Period 5 (ordered = 0) correctly resulted in no arrival at Period 9. The current inventory status shows a very low on-hand balance of 11 units, but a large pipeline (in-transit) of 417 units. Based on 4-period lead time, we expect the order from Period 7 (138 units) to arrive in the current Period 11 (visible next period). Given the stable demand pattern and consistent lead time, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the demand behavior since the first stock arrival, which better reflects the actual sales environment compared to the initial zero-sales periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of 110.8 over the last 11 periods. Period 9 was an anomaly with no arrival (an order was placed in P5 but was for 0 units), but the lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11). I will use recent_N=6 for demand forecasting (\u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302) to capture the stable behavior since arrivals began in Period 5, while L is set to 'calculate' based on the highly consistent 4-period lead time. With on-hand at 40 and a large in-transit pipeline (445), the system is well-covered, but maintaining the policy parameters ensures we buffer against the observed demand volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 26).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory is 72 with 476 units in-transit. A review of history confirms the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 arrived exactly 4 periods later). Period 5 had no order, hence the arrival gap in Period 9. Demand remains relatively stable. Average demand over the last 12 periods is approximately 105.75, which aligns with the carry-over insight of 'stable around mean 100'. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time (L) to utilize the stable observed lead time of 4. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the stable mean across all observed periods while allowing for slight fluctuations. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=12 to estimate volatility based on the existing sample set.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the game history (Orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, and P9 all arrived with exactly a 4-period lead time). There was a zero-arrival at P9 due to an order size of 0 at P5, which is consistent with the logic. Demand has been relatively stable, though it shows moderate volatility (range 56-156). I will use L=4 (promised). For demand, the most recent 5 periods (P9-P13) show an average of 112.4, which is slightly higher than the overall average but reflects current conditions. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent variance and avoid being over-reactive to earlier periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status is 27 units on-hand with 525 in-transit. The history confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (consistently observed in all 10 completed arrivals). Demand analysis: Over the first 14 periods, the mean demand is approx. 104 units. There was a notable outlier in Period 10 (156), but the subsequent periods (11-14: 109, 103, 92, 97) show demand has returned to the previous stable regime near 100. I will use N=10 for demand mean (mu_hat) to capture the recent stability while including enough data for robustness, and N=14 for sigma_hat to ensure volatility from the Period 10 spike is accounted for in the safety stock calculation. Lead time is stable at 4.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed consistent lead times of 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5-P8 and P10-P15). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable. Calculating the mean demand over the last 15 periods (since P1 conclude) gives approximately 105 units per period. The recent sample from P15 (128 units) is slightly higher but within normal variance. We face a potential stockout risk as on-hand inventory is 65 while average demand is 105. However, there are 427 units in-transit (orders from P12-P15), which represents roughly 4 periods of demand coverage. Since L=4, we must cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 captures the most stable recent demand regime (avg ~107). sigma_hat with N=10 accounts for the moderate volatility observed recently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4389.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed a significant demand spike of 263 units, causing a stockout (on-hand is now 0). This is more than double the historical average of ~110. While one data point is not yet a 'sustained shift', the product is 'chips(Regular)', and such spikes often indicate a seasonal event or promotion. We must protect against further stockouts. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. My pipeline inventory is 409 units (ordered in P13, P14, P15, P16). Based on the lead time of 4, the order from P13 (73 units) is expected to arrive during P17. To account for the potential new high-demand regime, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 (capturing the spike) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect the increased volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1387.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we are facing a significant demand spike that began at Period 16 (demand increased from ~100 to 263 and 223). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to stockouts. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with game history (all arrivals from P1..P13 have tracked to exactly 4 periods). Since the demand regime shifted at P16, I am using a recent history of N=2 (P16 and P17) to calculate the new mean and volatility. Mean demand for the last 2 periods is 243. Lead time L=4 implies a planning horizon of (1+L)=5 periods. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 5 * 243 = 1215. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(5) * std(263, 223) \u2248 2.236 * 28.28 \u2248 63.2. This high base stock will help recover from the current stockout and match the elevated demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: mean increased from ~105 to 243 (+130%). Consistent lead time of 4 periods confirmed through Period 17.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are in a high-demand regime that started at Period 16. The demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 263, 223, and 245, averaging approximately 243.6 per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, despite a shipment of 120 units arriving in Period 18, because it was immediately consumed. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P14 order arrived in P18). To capture the 2.3x increase in demand compared to the initial regime (~105), I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation, which covers (L+1) or 5 periods of demand, reflects the current average of ~1218 units (5 * 243.6) plus a safety buffer for the increased volatility observed in this new regime.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that started at Period 16. Analyzing the last 4 periods (P16-P19), the average demand is approximately 237 units per period, a significant increase from the earlier average of ~105. We are currently facing stockouts with 0 on-hand inventory because the orders placed during the low-demand regime are insufficient to cover the new demand level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the regime shift has lasted for 4 periods (N=4), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this sustained higher demand and its volatility. For lead time, I will continue using 'calculate' as the historical lead time of 4 is stable. This approach signals to the OR backend that it needs to maintain a much higher base stock to account for the (L+1) = 5 periods of elevated demand (~1185 units), helping to recover from current stockouts.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, the average demand was approximately 105 units. Since Period 16, the demand has spiked to a much higher level, with the last 5 periods (P16-P20) averaging 239.2 units (263, 223, 245, 218, 247). This level of demand has consistently drained on-hand inventory, resulting in stockouts because supply (lead time = 4) has not yet caught up with the new demand regime. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 16 order in Period 20. I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the properties of this new high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers 5 days of demand (L+1) at this higher rate. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is currently holding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4864.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing demand from P16 to P21, the mean has risen to approximately 253 units (263, 223, 245, 218, 247, 324). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and sales have been lost for several consecutive periods due to stockouts, even with arrivals occurring on the promised lead time of 4 periods. The carry-over insight confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods. I will set L to 4 manually to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) = 5 periods. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=6 (the length of the high-demand regime) to capture the current average demand of ~253 units per period. For sigma_hat, I'll also use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the increased volatility observed in this new regime (notably the spike to 324 in P21).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean increased from ~105 to ~253 (+140%). High demand persists through Period 21 with increased volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 22 (7 samples), the mean demand is approximately 251.3 units (calculated from: 263, 223, 245, 218, 247, 324, 239). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (Periods 18 through 22 all show a lead time of 4). Consequently, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 to capture the elevated demand since the shift. I am also using 'recent_N' with N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility observed during this high-demand period. This ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for the new demand level and the total 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, demand averaged ~105 units. Since Period 16 (Periods 16-23), the average demand has risen to approximately 251 units (263, 223, 245, 218, 247, 324, 239, 248). Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods, as evidenced by all recent 'conclude' messages (P14-P19 orders all arrived with exactly 4 periods lead time). Current on-hand inventory is 80 units, and there is a significant pipeline of 1059 units in transit to cover the lead time. Given the sustained higher demand over the last 8 periods, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture this new regime while ignoring the lower historical demand. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, the mean demand was approximately 105 units. Since Period 16 (Periods 16-24), the mean demand has increased to 250 units (263, 223, 245, 218, 247, 324, 239, 248, 244) with an observed standard deviation of approximately 30 units during this 9-period high-demand regime. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent and reliable, as evidenced by the last several 'conclude' messages (Periods 22, 23, and 24 all confirmed lead_time=4). To set the OR parameters, I will use a window of the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture this new 'high demand' state while excluding the earlier 'low demand' data. This will set mu_hat roughly at (1+L)*250 and sigma_hat at sqrt(1+L)*30, allowing the OR backend to maintain inventory levels appropriate for the current demand level without being pulled down by the historical low-demand period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 25 (10 periods), the mean demand is approximately 251.4 units/period (263, 223, 245, 218, 247, 324, 239, 248, 244, 263). The standard deviation for this specific period is approximately 30 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (Periods 22-25 consistently show 4-period lead times). I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime specifically. On-hand inventory is low (15) due to recent high demand, but there is significant in-transit inventory (1086) which should eventually cover the pipeline. Setting parameters based on this recent high-demand regime will allow the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock for the 5-period window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2048.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant shift. From Period 1 to 15, the mean demand was ~105. Starting at Period 16, demand jumped significantly. Demand samples from Period 16 to 25 were consistently high (ranging from 218 to 324, mean ~255). However, Period 26 showed a sharp drop to 119. This drop could be a return to the baseline or a temporary fluctuation. Given the sustained high demand over the previous 10 periods, I will treat Period 26 as an outlier for mean estimation but acknowledge the increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime while including the recent drop. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=11) to account for the significantly higher variance observed in the last two weeks compared to the early periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2187.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant regime shift. From Period 1 to 15, the average demand was approximately 105. Starting Period 16, demand surged to an average of approximately 250 units, persisting through Period 25. However, in the most recent two periods (P26, P27), demand has dropped significantly to 119 and 135 units respectively. Given this recent drop, I must determine if this is a temporary fluctuation or a return to earlier levels. Looking at Period 28's current context, I see 378 units on hand and 863 in transit. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the high demand regime lasted for 10 periods and the current drop has only lasted 2, I will use a N=12 window for mu_hat to capture the high demand regime while starting to incorporate the recent decline. This balances the risk of another spike against the holding cost of the current high inventory. Sigma_hat is set with N=12 to reflect the high volatility experienced during the high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 26: demand dropped from ~250 units to ~127 units (-49%) for two consecutive periods after a 10-period high-demand phase.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. From Period 16 to 25, demand averaged ~250 units. Starting at Period 26, demand dropped to ~121 units (values: 119, 135, 110). This lower demand state has now persisted for 3 periods, confirming a sustained shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals). Current on-hand inventory is high (505 units) and in-transit is also substantial (742 units). To prevent excessive holding costs during this lower demand phase, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the new average (~121 units/period). I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this new regime for both mean and volatility while keeping L at the confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 26: mean decreased from ~250 to ~121 (-52%) based on Periods 26-28. High inventory levels relative to new demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1823.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 26. For the last four periods (P26-P29), demand has been 119, 135, 110, and 128, resulting in a mean of approximately 123 units per period. This confirms the exit from the high-demand phase (avg ~250) back to a level similar to the initial periods (avg ~105-110). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, we have an on-hand inventory of 609 units and 510 units in transit (from orders in P26, P27, P28). This pipeline is significantly oversized for the current demand regime (Total Supply ~1119 vs Demand across L+1 periods ~615). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the 123-unit mean, and sigma_hat with recent_N=4 to capture the current lower volatility. This will signal the OR backend that we have a massive surplus, likely resulting in zero or minimal new orders until the inventory is digested.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2007.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 26. For the last five periods (P26-P30), demand has averaged 127.2 units, a significant drop from the prior High Demand regime (~250 units). Due to large orders placed right before the shift (P22-P26) now arriving, on-hand inventory has ballooned to 729 units with another 246 in-transit. Total inventory (975) far exceeds the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (5 periods * ~127 = 635). To minimize holding costs while the excess clears, I am setting parameters based on the new stable regime (N=5 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302) and keeping L at the confirmed 4 periods. The OR backend's capped policy will naturally result in zero or minimal orders until the inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 26: Mean decreased from ~250 to 127.2 (-49%) based on Periods 26-30. Previous volatility has stabilized alongside the lower mean.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 31 (6 samples), the mean is 119.17 units (119, 135, 110, 128, 144, 79). This confirms the 'low demand' regime shift noted in previous carry-over insights. Currently, there is a very high on-hand inventory of 780 units and 116 units in-transit (ordered Period 28, scheduled to arrive in Period 33). Given that the demand across the review and lead time (1+L = 5 periods) is approximately 600 units (5 * 120), and we have nearly 900 units in total inventory, the OR backend's capped policy will correctly result in zero orders. I am setting L to 4 as it has been consistently observed. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 to reflect the most recent demand regime (starting Period 26). I will use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the current volatility of this new regime, which appears lower than the high-demand phase (Periods 16-25).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a new, lower regime starting at Period 26. Since Period 26, the demand values have been 119, 135, 110, 128, 144, 79, and 126. The average demand for this most recent 7-period window is approximately 120.1 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is 770 units, and there are 0 units in-transit (as all orders through Period 28 have arrived). Given a (L+1) coverage requirement (where L=4), our required base stock is approximately 5 * 120.1 = 600.5 units (plus a safety stock buffer). Since our on-hand inventory (770) already exceeds the required levels for the next 5 periods, the OR backend logic will naturally minimize ordering. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this lower demand regime accurately and prevent unnecessary over-ordering while maintaining a healthy service level, allowing current excess inventory to deplete.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26, following a mid-game spike. Over the last 8 periods (P26-P33), mean demand is approximately 118 units per period, a significant drop from the ~250 units seen previously. Current on-hand inventory is 667 units with zero units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4), the inventory needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current mean of ~118, the target base stock is roughly 590-650 units (depending on safety stock). Since current on-hand inventory (667) already exceeds this requirement, no new orders are necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime (using recent_N=8) and rely on the OR backend's capped policy to maintain zero orders until inventory levels normalize. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1293.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 26, dropping from a high of ~250 units to a stable mean of approximately 114 units (based on the last 9 periods: 119, 135, 110, 128, 144, 79, 126, 103, 98). The inventory levels are currently very high (On-hand: 569) compared to this new demand level, which justifies the decision to stop ordering (ordered=0 in recent periods). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the data from this new regime (N=9) to allow the OR backend to properly calculate the required base stock. Since on-hand inventory (569) is significantly higher than the expected demand over the lead time (approx 114 * 5 = 570), the OR engine will likely continue to order 0 or very small amounts, helping to reduce holding costs while maintaining a high service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2051.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 26. Since then (Periods 26-35, a 10-period window), demand has averaged approximately 119.3 units per period (119, 135, 110, 128, 144, 79, 126, 103, 98, 131). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory (438 units) and the current low demand regime, we are still carrying excess stock from the previous high-demand phase (Periods 16-25). The base stock target for a (L+1)=5 period horizon at ~120 units/period is roughly 600 units. The current total pipeline (on-hand 438 + in-transit 85 = 523) is close to this target. I will use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the current stabilized demand regime (avg ~120) and the observed volatility in this period. This will allow the OR engine to gradually normalize inventory levels while maintaining a safe service level for the $19 profit margin.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 26 and has remained stable. For the last 11 periods (P26-P36), the mean demand is approximately 118.4 units with a standard deviation of about 20.3 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since P29, no additional orders were placed until P35 to bleed off excess inventory accumulated during the previous high-demand regime. Currently, On-hand (309) + In-transit (222) = 531. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~592 units. The OR backend will compute the base stock based on the recent stable demand of the last 11 periods. I am setting N=11 to isolate the current demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods throughout the history.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 26 and has remained stable through Period 37. Analyzing demand from Period 26 to Period 37 (12 samples), the average demand is approximately 122 units per period. The on-hand inventory has finally worked down from its peak to 165 units. There is a significant in-transit pipeline of 353 units (orders from P35, P36, and P37). Given a lead time of 4 periods, these units will begin arriving at P39. Following the (L+1) principle (4+1=5 periods), we must account for demand over the current and lead-time periods. Using 122 as the mean demand, total expected demand over 5 periods is 610. Current total inventory (On-hand + In-transit) is 165 + 353 = 518. We need the OR backend to maintain this stock level relative to the recent mean (N=12) and volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following a significant drop from the high-demand phase (Periods 16-25). For the current period (P39), I am using the last 13 samples (Periods 26-38) to define the current demand regime, yielding a mean of approximately 124.9 units per period. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (56 units) while in-transit inventory is high (506 units), reflecting orders placed recently (P35-P38) to replenish stock as the massive surplus from the previous regime was liquidated. No shipments arrived in Periods 33-38 because no orders were placed in Periods 29-34. The first of the new replenishment orders (P35) is expected to arrive in Period 39. To ensure the OR backend aligns with this stable lower-demand regime while accounting for recent variability, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following a significant drop from the high-demand phase. Analyzing demand from Period 26 through Period 39 (N=14), the mean demand is approximately 119.5 units per period. The inventory levels have finally normalized after the surplus from the previous regime was liquidated. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 34 units, and there are 528 units in-transit (orders from P36-P39). I will use recent_N (N=14) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime's mean and volatility. This helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost, while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~121 units since Period 26. Lead times are consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 39 and 40 (orders from P35 and P36 arriving with L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (22 units), but there is significant in-transit inventory (492 units) that will arrive over the next few periods (orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40). Specifically, 131 units are expected to arrive in Period 41, 153 in P42, 107 in P43, and 101 in P44. I am using recent_N with N=15 for mu_hat (covering the stable period since the last regime shift at P26) and for sigma_hat to accurately capture the current demand distribution. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while the in-transit inventory prevents over-ordering.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26, following a high-demand period. Analysis of the last 16 periods (Period 26-41) shows a mean demand of approximately 121.5 units with a standard deviation of 19.3. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 39, 40, and 41). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (29 units) and pipeline inventory is 514 units. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for current period + 4 periods (L+1=5). At a mean of 121.5, expected demand over 5 periods is ~607.5. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 543 units, suggesting a slight under-stock relative to the target base stock. I will use 'recent_N' for both demand parameters with N=16 to capture the stable behavior of this current regime and 'default' for L to use the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime after the high-demand period (P16-P25). Since Period 26, the mean demand is approximately 124 units (calculated from Periods 26-42). The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 39 units and in-transit is 493 units, which includes orders from Periods 39, 40, 41, and 42 (107, 101, 153, and 132 respectively, totaling 493). The system is in a steady state. I will use a recent_N of 17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire post-P26 regime (Period 26 to 42 is 17 samples), providing a stable forecast that aligns with the current observed demand levels and volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a new regime starting at Period 26, following a high-demand phase. Analysis of the last 18 periods (P26-P43) shows a stable mean of approximately 123.4 units per period with relatively consistent volatility. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by recent arrivals (P39-P43 all confirmed a 4-period lead time). On-hand inventory is currently low (38 units), and while there are 536 units in-transit, the OR backend needs to maintain the base stock level across the (L+1) horizon (5 periods) to prevent stockouts, especially given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 to capture this stable post-shift regime precisely, and 'default' for L as the lead time is reliably 4.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 26 remains stable, with an average demand of approximately 125 units per period. Period 44 saw a slight stockout with 147 units of demand and 139 units sold/available, ending with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the Period 44 conclusion regarding the Period 40 order). Recent demand (Periods 39-44) has been 107, 149, 124, 143, 108, 147, averaging 129.6 with moderate volatility. I will use recent_N (N=19, covering the regime since Period 26) to stabilize the forecast (mu_hat) and risk assessment (sigma_hat), ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. The in-transit pipeline of 538 units includes orders from Periods 41-44, which are expected to arrive in Periods 45-48. Setting L to default (4) as it matches historical performance.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following a major drop from the mid-period peak. Analyzing the most recent 20 periods (Period 26 to Period 45), the average demand is approximately 126.8 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 18.5. This represents a sustained regime with 20 data points. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P35 through P41. Inventory levels are currently low (on-hand 27), and we experienced a slight stockout in Period 44 (8 units lost), so maintaining a sufficient base stock is prioritized. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture this current regime's mean and variance precisely for the OR backend, ensuring the (L+1) coverage window is appropriately stocked for the remainder of the game (ending Period 50).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable since Period 26, following a downward shift from the previous high-demand regime. Analyzing demand from Period 26 to Period 46 (n=21), the mean is approximately 125.6 units per period with a standard deviation of about 18.0 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (Periods 39-46). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (17 units), but there is significant in-transit stock (525 units) reflecting orders from Periods 43-46 (150, 103, 147, 125). Given the stable regime, I will use recent_N=21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand patterns while maintaining the promised lead time L=4. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers 5 periods (L+1) of demand at the new, lower mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2173.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in the third regime (starting Period 26), with a mean of approximately 125 units per period. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. As we are approaching Period 48 of 50, effectively entering the 'end-of-game' phase, the current strategy is to maintain a stock-to-demand ratio that covers the combined review and lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Current on-hand is 50, and 522 units are in-transit, which is more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods (48, 49, 50). Specifically, orders from Period 44 (103 units), 45 (147 units), and 46 (125 units) are expected to arrive in Periods 48, 49, and 50 respectively. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=23 (covering the start of the current regime in Period 26) to reflect the contemporary stable demand while avoiding the high-demand volatility of Periods 16-25.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 26, following a significant drop from the high-demand regime of Periods 16-25. Analysis of the last 23 periods (P26-P48) reveals a mean demand of approximately 124 units with a standard deviation of 17.5. Recent observations show slightly higher demand (mean of 129 over the last 10 periods), which is more relevant for current steering. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 2 periods remaining (P49 and P50), and an on-hand inventory of 40 plus a substantial pipeline of 533 units (including orders from P45-P48 arriving in P49-P52), there is virtually no risk of stockout. The backend will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=23) to reflect the current regime while capturing sufficient variance history. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=23 to ensure the inventory policy accounts for the stability seen in this phase. Lead time remains 'default' (promised 4) as observations confirm this is accurate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2473.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 26, following a high-demand phase. Analyzing the last 20 periods (Periods 30-49), the average demand is approximately 121 units per period with moderate volatility. The actual lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals through Period 49. Currently, on-hand inventory is 54 and in-transit inventory is 495, totaling 549 units. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock targets a 5-period window (L+1). A mean of ~121/period suggests a pipeline demand of ~605 units. With 549 units currently in the system, and considering the profit margin ($19) vs holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=20 to capture the current stable demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'default' for lead time since it aligns with the promised 4 periods.
