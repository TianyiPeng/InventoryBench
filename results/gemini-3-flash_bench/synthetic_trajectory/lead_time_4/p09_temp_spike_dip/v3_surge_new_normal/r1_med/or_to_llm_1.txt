Looking at the five historical demand samples provided (146, 110, 112, 150, 59), the mean demand is approximately 115.4 units per period. The OR algorithm recommends an order of 176 units based on a base-stock policy (L=4). Since this is the first period and we have no stock or pipeline, we need to establish the initial pipeline to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). 176 units is slightly above the historical mean of 115 but aligns with the OR's capped policy accounting for safety stock.

Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order (promised lead time 4) has not arrived. Demand in Period 1 was 88 units, which resulted in 88 lost sales since on-hand inventory was 0. \n2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples provided are [146, 110, 112, 150, 59]. Period 1's actual demand was 88. The OR baseline uses these averages. \n3. Lead Time Inference: The promised lead time is 4. An order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive at the start of Period 6 (visible in Period 6 conclude, decisionable in Period 7). We currently have 176 units in transit. \n4. Strategy: To cover demand during the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5 periods total), we need enough inventory to satisfy about 5 * 115 (avg demand) = 575 units. Currently, we have 0 on-hand + 176 in-transit = 176 pipeline. The OR recommended 168 additional units to bring the pipeline closer to its target (base stock). \n5. Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 168 is sound for building the pipeline to cover the long lead time.

Because it takes 4 periods to arrive (L=4), I need to cover demand for Period 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (L+1 + current = 5 periods of demand) to ensure I don't stock out when the pipe empties. 3.

OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 162 units, calculated using a L=4 assumption. 5.

However, looking at the history, arrivals appear at the start of N+1 (e.g., P1 order placed P1, lead time 4 means arrival in P5, visible at P6 start). Wait, correction: The P1 order arrived DURING P5 resolving phase and was visible in P5 conclude. Therefore, P5 order (placed P5) should arrive during P9 and be visible in P9 conclude. Since P9 conclude shows arrived=0, the P5 order (0 units) was effectively skipped. The P6 order (103 units) is expected to arrive during P10. 2. Inventory Analysis: Current on-hand is 92. In-transit consists of orders from P6 (103), P7 (139), P8 (109), and P9 (95), totaling 446. 3.

The OR estimate uses all history and suggests a base stock level that targets covering (L+1) periods. 4. Strategy: The OR recommends 43 units.

Expected arrivals are P19: 93, P20: 133, P21: 186, P22: 240. \n4.

This might indicate the end of the high-demand regime or a temporary dip. \n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand inventory is 121.

Over the next 5 periods (L+1), if demand is 250, we need 1250 units. If demand revert to 120, we need 600 units.

The P32 order (264 units) is expected to arrive in Period 36 conclude (visible in P37), which will prevent a stockout. The OR recommendation of 256 units is based on a base-stock policy. Given that total pipeline inventory + on-hand is 485 units, and our expected demand over the lead-time horizon (L+1 = 5 periods) is approximately 600 units (120 * 5), we need more coverage to maintain safety stock and avoid the stockouts experienced during the previous regime shift.

Total remaining supply (23 on-hand + 350 in-transit) equals 373 units. This creates a slight projected deficit of 17 units by the end of Period 50. Since new orders placed today will not arrive until Period 52, they cannot satisfy demand or increase total reward within the game's horizon. However, the OR recommendation is 240 units.
