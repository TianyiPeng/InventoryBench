Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 82, 89, 65, 106, 136. There is a clear upward trend in the demand samples (mean = 95.6, std = 27.2). For Period 1, we must set parameters for the OR backend to place the initial order. Given the promised lead time L=4, the coverage required is for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using all available samples (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is the most reliable approach to capture the starting demand level and variance. I will use 'default' for L since no arrivals have occurred to suggest a drift from the promised 4 periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 140 units, but since the lead time is at least 1 (promised 4), they have not arrived yet. Consequently, starting on-hand was 0 and we sold 0 despite a demand of 108. Total in-transit is 140. Given the demand history (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) from the provided samples and the observed demand of 108 in Period 1, the average demand per period appears to be around 97-100. Since we have very few historical observations within the game sequence (only Period 1's 108), I will use the provided historical demand samples (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) plus the recent P1 data. The mean of samples [82, 89, 65, 106, 136, 108] is ~97.7. For Period 2's parameters, I'll rely on the default method which uses all available samples to estimate mu and sigma, as no regime shift is yet confirmed after only one period of gameplay. The OR backend will use L=4 to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (1+L) of demand (~488 units).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (140 units) and Period 2 (139 units) are still in transit and are not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively, consistent with the L=4 promise. Our current on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as the initial demand (108 in P1, 144 in P2) could not be met. Historical demand samples (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) show an average of roughly 95.6. However, the observed demand in the first two active periods (108, 144) suggests a possible upward trend or higher mean than the initial samples indicated. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Using the mean of the 5 historical samples plus the 2 observed game periods (total 7 samples) gives an average of ~104. Since we have very few data points and are currently stocking out, I will use a conservative approach. I'll set L to default (4) as there is no evidence yet of lead-time deviation. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher demand signals (106, 136, 108, 144) more effectively than the full history, helping the OR backend raise the base stock level to mitigate future stockouts once the pipeline starts arriving.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (totaling 442 units) are currently in-transit and have not yet arrived, which is consistent with the promised lead time (first arrival expected in Period 5). There is currently zero on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales for periods 1-3. Demand has been significantly higher than the initial historical samples (averaging 131.3 units/period vs the early samples 1-5 average of 95.6). To capture this higher demand regime and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the upward shift, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to prioritize the recent observations (108, 144, 142). For the lead time L, I will use the promised 'default' of 4 as we have not yet observed any 'conclude' messages to verify or contradict it.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: actual demand in periods 1-3 (avg 131) is ~37% higher than initial historical samples (avg 96).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 (total 607 units in-transit). Following the 'Period Execution Sequence', the order placed in Period 1 (140 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (Period 1 + 4 = Period 5). This arrival will only be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Currently, on-hand is 0, resulting in lost sales for periods 1-4. Demand history: initial samples (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) avg=95.6; game history actual demand (108, 144, 142, 84) avg=119.5. The recent demand shows higher volatility and a higher mean than the starting samples. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this shift in the game history. Lead time L=4 is consistent with the promised lead time as no orders have yet had the chance to conclude (P1 order is due this period).

Carry-over insight: Demand mean in active game (P1-P4) is 119.5, approximately 25% higher than the provided historical pre-game average of 95.6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-30.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we finally observe the first arrival: 140 units ordered in Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4. The current on-hand inventory is 85 units, with a large pipeline of 467 units (orders from P2, P3, and P4). Demand has shown significant volatility: periods 1-3 averaged ~131, while periods 4-5 averaged ~70 (84 and 55 respectively). Combining the pre-game samples (Avg 95.6) with the active game samples (Avg 106.6) gives a grand mean of approx 101. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand over (L+1) periods. Since we have a massive pipeline of 467 units against an expected demand of ~505 units over the next 5 periods, and demand seems to be cooling down from the initial spike, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the latest downward trend and prevent over-ordering while the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: P1-P3 avg 131 vs P4-P5 avg 69.5. Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. The environment confirmed a lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). This means we have orders from P3 (163 units) and P4 (165 units) currently in transit, expected to arrive in P7 and P8 respectively. The current on-hand inventory is 130 units. Historically, demand has shown high variance: Periods 1-3 averaged 131.3 units, while Periods 4-6 averaged 77.7 units. The overall average for all 11 samples (5 pre-game + 6 in-game) is approximately 97.5. Given the high volatility and equal profit/holding cost ($1.0 each), the OR backend will target a 50% service level (z=0). To stabilize the forecast against recent fluctuations, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 (covering all in-game data) for both demand and volatility. This balances the initial high demand with the more recent lower demand, preparing for a mean of ~105 per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-65.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, and P3 all taking exactly 4 periods). Demand remains volatile: following a high-demand start (P1-P3 avg 131), the recent periods (P4-P7) show a mean of 86.75 (84, 55, 94, 114). The initial historical pre-game samples (P1-P5) averaged 95.6. Currently, we have 179 units on-hand and 230 units in-transit (orders from P4 and P7). To avoid excessive holding costs (which equal profit), we must calibrate carefully. I will use the last 7 samples (P1-P7 of the active game) to estimate demand mean and volatility, as the early high demand and subsequent dip provide a more comprehensive view of the current volatility than the static pre-game data. With L=4, the coverage required is for 5 periods. A base stock calculation using recent_N=7 for both mean and sigma balances the risk between stockouts and high holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time consistency: P1-P3 orders all arrived with lead_time=4 periods. Demand regime stabilized to a lower mean of ~87 units over the last 4 periods compared to the initial 131 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-244.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 9. Analysis of lead times (P1-P4 orders) confirms a consistent lead time (L) of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (294 units) because the large orders placed during the initial high-demand phase (P1-P4) are now arriving while demand has cooled. Recent demand (P4-P8) has averaged 79.4 units, significantly lower than the P1-P3 average of 131 units. To avoid excessive holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I am switching to a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~79). For L, I will use 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand has dropped from ~131 (P1-P3) to ~79 (P4-P8), a decrease of ~40%. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-68.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the current observation shows an on-hand inventory of 181 and 186 units in-transit. Reviewing the history, orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 all arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods (arriving in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8 respectively). No order was placed in Period 5 or 6, explaining the 'arrived=0' in Period 9 and the current state. The order from Period 7 (65 units) is expected to arrive during Period 11 (this period's resolution). Demand analysis: The initial high demand (P1-P3 avg: 131) has shifted. The demand from P4 to P9 averages ~85 units (84, 55, 94, 114, 50, 113). While P9 showed a slight recovery (113), the overall trend over the last 6 periods suggests a lower mean than the start. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime (~85/period). L is stable at 4. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=6 to reflect current volatility. Profit/Holding ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will target using these parameters.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are analyzing the 'chips(Regular)' SKU. The on-hand inventory is 110 units with 244 units in transit. Reviewing the arrival history (P5, P6, P7, P8), the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand patterns show a shift; while the first three periods averaged 131, the last seven periods (P4-P10) have averaged 83. The most recent demand (P10) was 71. Given this stabilization at a lower mean compared to the very early game, I will use a recent window for calculations. For L, 'calculate' is appropriate as observed lead times are stable. For mu_hat, I will use N=7 to capture the demand regime since Period 4 (average ~83). For sigma_hat, N=7 will also be used to reflect the recent volatility profile. These parameters will help the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while avoiding excessive holding costs from the earlier higher-demand estimates.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 68 units, with 240 units in-transit. A lead time of 4 periods is well-established, with the Period 7 order arriving exactly on Period 11 as expected (leat_time=4). Demand remains in the stabilized lower regime identified around Period 9. Over the last 8 periods (P4-P11), mean demand is approximately 85.8 units, while the most recent 3 periods (P9-P11) average 97 units. Given the lead time (L=4) plus the current review period (1), we must cover 5 periods of demand. The 240 units in transit consist of orders from P8 (121), P10 (58), and P11 (61). We use N=8 for mu_hat to capture the current stable regime while smoothing recent variations, and N=8 for sigma_hat to reflect the observed volatility in this regime. This ensures a balanced safety stock against the holding cost, which is equal to the profit ($1).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current context shows that actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals from periods 1-4, 7, and 8). Demand has undergone a regime shift. Initially, P1-P3 saw high demand (avg 131), while P4-P12 have averaged 88.7. The most recent demand (P11-P12) shows a slight uptick to ~108. Given the profit ($1) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the critical ratio is 0.5, implying a target service level where on-hand inventory should closely match demand to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set lead time to 4 (promised). For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 9 periods (P4-P12) to capture the current stable regime (N=9, avg = 88.7). For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use N=9 to account for the current regime's variance, helping the OR backend appropriately buffer against the moderate fluctuations seen in the last few cycles.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: P4-P12 mean is 88.7 units, significantly lower than P1-P3 (131). Lead time consistency confirmed at 4 periods across 6 distinct arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU transitioned to a stockout situation (ending inventory 0) due to a spike in demand (149 units), which exceeded the on-hand inventory (79 units). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical evidence. To manage the current stockout and the observed demand volatility (recent demand has fluctuated between 50 and 149), I am using L=4 (promised/observed). For mu_hat, I am selecting N=10 to capture the recent lower-demand regime (mean ~94.6 for P4-P13) which is more representative than the initial high-demand burst in P1-P3. Using N=10 for sigma_hat captures the recent increase in volatility (std ~29.5) to ensure the safety stock is sufficient to prevent further stockouts during this in-transit heavy phase (365 units currently in the pipeline).

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Stockout occurred in P13 (demand 149 units vs 79 on-hand). Demand volatility has increased recently (P10-P13 range: 71-149).

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 units on-hand. The last period saw a demand of 64 units, but only 58 were available (the arrival from Period 10). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the P10 order arriving in P14. Since P4, demand has shown a lower mean (avg ~90) compared to P1-P3, but with significant volatility (recent spike to 149 in P13). Our pipeline inventory is currently 416 units, with expected arrivals in P15 (ordered P11, 61 units), P16 (ordered P12, 122 units), P17 (ordered P13, 124 units), and P18 (ordered P14, 109 units). Our current strategy must address the recent stockouts and volatility while forecasting for the L+1 window (5 periods). I will set L to 'calculate' as it matches the observed 4-period lead time. I will use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat to capture the regime established since P4 (avg ~90) while being slightly more aggressive to recover from stockouts. Sigma_hat will use N=5 to capture the recent increase in demand variance (range 64-149).

Carry-over insight: Sustained stockout condition in P13-P14 due to demand volatility (P13 demand was 149, 1.6x the recent average). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation (on-hand inventory = 0) despite recent arrivals, caused by a spike in demand in Period 13 and a subsequent delay in inventory recovery. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 4, demand has transitioned to a lower but volatile regime. The mean demand for the last 12 periods (P4-P15) is approximately 92 units. However, recent demand (P11-P15) shows higher volatility (range 64-149). To recover from the stockout and handle this volatility, I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the current regime's mean (\u03bc\u0302) and standard deviation (\u03c3\u0302). Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as the 4-period lead time is stable and well-documented in the arrival history.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains elevated (Period 13 demand was 1.6x the regime average), causing a 3-period stockout from P13-P15. Inventory recovery is pending arrival of orders from P12 onwards.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system has finally recovered from the 3-period stockout (P13-P15) with the arrival of 122 units from P12 (lead_time=4). On-hand inventory is now 99 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods across all observed arrivals. Demand recently showed high volatility, specifically a large spike in P13 (149) followed by a sharp drop in P16 (23). The average demand from P4 to P16 is approximately 87 units, while the more recent window (P10-P16) averages 88.7. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the recent low demand outlier in P16, I am using a recent window for mu_hat (N=13, covering the stabilized regime from P4 onwards) and a more focused window for sigma_hat (N=7, covering P10-P16) to capture the increased variance seen in the last few periods. This approach balances the long-term regime mean with current volatility levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 16 demand (23) is the lowest recorded, contrasting with the spike in Period 13 (149).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that on-hand inventory has recovered to 167 units after a period of stockouts, thanks to the arrival of 124 units (ordered in P13). Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P11 arrival in P15, P12 in P16, P13 in P17). Demand continues to show high volatility: a massive spike in P13 (149) followed by a low in P16 (23) and P17 (56). Given this volatility, calculating parameters based on the most recent regime (starting from the shift in P4) is appropriate. Since P4, demand has averaged ~84 units with significant variance. I will use recent_N with N=14 (P4 to P17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized but volatile regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5 periods of coverage).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-244.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are observing a significant drop in demand over the last three periods (Period 16: 23, Period 17: 56, Period 18: 16), which contrasts sharply with the earlier regime average of ~89 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is ~51.2 units, but the last 3 periods specifically average only ~31.6 units. This suggests a potential demand regime shift toward lower volume or high variance volatility. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (7 consecutive arrivals confirmed L=4). On-hand inventory is currently high (260), and with 148 units in-transit, we are well-covered for the next 4 periods even if demand reverts to the long-term average. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough sensitivity to previous higher-demand periods for safety, and stick with the calculate method for L as the lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift suspected at Period 16: Mean demand decreased from ~89 (P4-P15) to ~32 (P16-P18), a drop of over 60%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-246.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, we are observing a significant and sustained demand regime shift. For Periods 1-15, the average demand was approximately 101 units. However, starting at Period 16, demand has dropped sharply: P16 (23), P17 (56), P18 (16), and P19 (29), resulting in a four-period average of approximately 31 units. This represents a ~70% decrease compared to the previous regime. Lead times remain stable at precisely 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P17, P18, and P19). Current on-hand inventory (275) plus in-transit stock (104) total 379 units. At the current low demand rate (~31/period), this inventory covers over 10 periods, which is significantly more than the L+1 (5) periods required. Therefore, my priority is to lower the base stock level by using a 'recent_N' approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new low-demand environment and prevent further accumulation of units that incur a $1/unit holding cost, while maintaining the established lead time L=4.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift confirmed at Period 16: Mean demand decreased from ~101 (P1-P15) to ~31 (P16-P19), a drop of approx 70%. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 21. We are in a confirmed low-demand regime that started at Period 16. The mean demand for P16-P20 is approximately 37.2 units (23, 56, 16, 29, 61), which is a ~60% drop from the previous average of ~90-100. Current on-hand inventory is 277 units, and in-transit is 41 units (ordered in P18). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since L=4, the base stock targets needs to cover L+1=5 periods. At the current mean of ~37, the required inventory is ~185 units. With 277 on-hand, we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand, which will incur high holding costs ($1/unit). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (P16-P20) to reflect this new lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend's capped policy stops further ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand from P1 to P15 was approximately 97 units, whereas the average demand from P16 to P21 has dropped to approximately 32 units. This represents a 67% decrease in demand. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 263 units with 41 in-transit, totaling 304 units of pipeline inventory. Given the new demand regime (avg ~32), the current inventory covers nearly 10 periods of demand, significantly exceeding the (L+1)=5 period requirement. Consequently, no new orders are necessary. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods across all 13 observed arrivals. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 (the length of the new low-demand regime from P16-P21) to allow the OR backend to adjust to the lower demand and prevent excessive holding costs. L is set to 'calculate' as the history confirms stable lead times.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean demand decreased from ~97 (P1-P15) to ~32 (P16-P21), a drop of over 60%.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. The mean demand for the last 7 periods (P16-P22) is 38.1 units, compared to the previous regime (P1-P15) which averaged 97.4 units. This is a sustained reduction of approximately 60%. Currently, on-hand inventory is 236 units with 0 units in-transit. Calculated lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. Given the current on-hand stock (236) relative to the new demand mean (~38/period), the inventory covers over 6 periods of demand (L+1 = 5). No new orders are needed at this stage to avoid further increasing holding costs, as profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), requiring a balanced service level (50% target). I will use the last 7 periods to reflect this new low-demand regime and maintain L at the consistent actual lead time of 4.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. The mean demand for Periods 16-23 is approximately 39.5 units, which is a substantial drop from the previous average of ~97 units (P1-P15). This represents a decrease of roughly 60%. Currently, on-hand inventory is 208 units, and there are no units in-transit. With the current low-demand regime, the target base stock (calculated as (L+1) * mean_demand) is approximately (4+1) * 39.5 = 197.5 units. Since the current on-hand inventory (208) already exceeds this requirement and there is no pipeline inventory, there is an overstock situation relative to the new demand level. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across 11 arrivals. To prevent excessive holding costs while the inventory naturally depletes through sales, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the low-demand regime (P16-P23). The OR backend will likely recommend ordering 0 units due to the high on-hand inventory relative to the new demand forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-130.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift first detected at Period 16 remains highly significant. Since P16, demand has consistently been lower (P16-P24 mean: 37.1) compared to the historical average (P1-P15 mean: 98.7). Current on-hand inventory is 169 units with zero units in-transit. Given the low demand environment and 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (suggesting a 50% target service level), the OR backend's goal is to minimize excess stock. The current inventory (169) is more than sufficient to cover 5+ periods of demand at the current rate (~37 units/period), as Lead Time (L=4) plus current period (1) requires 5 periods of cover (approx 185 units, but our on-hand is already close to that and we want to avoid further accumulation given the high holding cost). I will use N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture only the recent low-demand regime (P16-P24), which will naturally suppress new orders until inventory levels drift lower.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-107.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is well-established, with mean demand dropping approximately 70% from ~100 units to ~36 units (average of P16-P25 is 36.5). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory (138) plus in-transit (17) totals 155 units. Given the low demand environment, this inventory level covers more than 4 periods of expected demand (36.5 * 4 = 146). To determine OR parameters, I specify L=4 (promised and observed). For mu_hat, I use N=10 (covering the low-demand regime since P16) to focus the forecast on the current pattern. Similarly, for sigma_hat, I use N=10 to reflect the volatility of this specific regime. The high carry-over inventory will naturally prevent the backend from placing large new orders until stocks deplete closer to the base stock level, which aligns with minimizing holding costs in a low-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context shows a mix of the low-demand regime starting at Period 16 (avg ~35) and a sharp spike in Period 26 (demand=112). This spike significantly impacts the current on-hand inventory (26 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., Period 22 arrival). Given that on-hand (26) plus in-transit (45) equals 71 units, and the expected demand over (L+1)=5 periods based on the most recent 11 periods (P16-P26: avg 43.5) is approximately 218 units, a substantial order is needed to prevent depletion. I will use the recent_N method for both mean and volatility to prioritize the data since the regime shift at P16, setting N=11 to reflect the current period 16-26 environment while capturing the recent spike's volatility contribution. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a service level target of 0.50 (median-based base stock), but the backend OR policy will naturally manage this balance.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand spike (112) deviates from the low-demand regime established in Period 16 (which averaged ~32 units). Monitoring for a potential return to higher demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, a stockout occurred (demand 42 vs on-hand 26) as inventory was exhausted following the Period 26 demand spike (112), which significantly depleted stock from the low-demand regime. Current on-hand is 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The demand regime from P16-P27 (excluding the P26 outlier) averages ~39 units. Given the recent spike in P26 and the stockout in P27, I am adjusting mu_hat to capture the most recent 12-period average (P16-P27) which is approximately 45 units per period. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to reflect this lower-demand regime while accounting for the spike's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Stockout occurred in Period 27 due to the combination of the Period 26 demand spike (112) and zero arrivals. The demand regime since P16 averages 45 units/period (N=12).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) following a demand spike in Period 26 (112) and Period 28 (108), which disrupted the low-demand regime observed since Period 16. Over the last 13 periods (P16-P28), demand has averaged approximately 48 units, but with significant volatility (std dev ~33). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on historical arrivals (orders from P17, P19-P24 were never placed, and P25-P28 are still in transit). With 217 units in-transit (P25: 17, P26: 28, P27: 92, P28: 80), the pipeline should cover future demand once arrivals resume. To address the recent volatility and return to a higher demand baseline, I am setting mu_hat using the last 13 periods (N=13) to capture the shifted mean (~48) and using recent_N for sigma to account for the increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Demand volatility remains high; two spikes (>100) in the last 3 periods have ended the stable low-demand regime (~32) observed between P16-P25. Current 13-period mean (P16-P28) is ~48 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The low-demand regime observed from Period 16 to 25 (averaging ~32 units) has definitively ended, replaced by an era of higher volatility and spikes. Over the last four periods (P26-P29), demand has been 112, 42, 108, and 52 respectively, resulting in a mean of 78.5 units. The system is currently in a stockout condition (On-hand: 0) because orders were curtailed during the low-demand period and the recent spikes (~110 units) depleted remaining stock. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To restore service levels while facing this increased volatility, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current upward trend in demand. For sigma_hat, I am using a longer window (recent_N=14) starting from the Period 16 regime shift to capture the full scope of current volatility, protecting against the observed spikes of >100 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility shift confirmed: After a stable low period (P16-P25 avg ~32), demand has increased and become highly volatile (P26-P29 avg ~79), with frequent spikes exceeding 100 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) following a demand regime shift and high volatility. From Period 26 to Period 30, demand has averaged 77 units (112, 42, 108, 52, 71), a significant increase from the previous low-demand regime of ~32 units (P16-P25). Two spikes >100 units in the last 5 periods have exhausted safety stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals for orders from P25 and P26). I will now set parameters to account for this higher volatility and higher mean. For mu_hat, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this new high-demand regime (avg ~77). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N of 5 to account for the increased standard deviation (approx 29 in this period). For L, I will use the established consistency of 4 periods via 'calculate'. These settings help the OR backend calculate a higher base stock to recover from the stockout and buffer against current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase/volatility confirmed from P26: 5-period mean is 77 units (compared to previous regime of 32), with frequent spikes >100 causing stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly since Period 26. Previously (P16-P25), the mean was ~32 units. From P26 to P31, the 6-period mean has increased to ~75 units (112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64), characterized by high volatility (standard deviation ~26). Based on this 6-period regime, I am setting the forecast (mu_hat) using the last 6 samples. The lead time (L) remains consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by recent arrivals (P25 and P26 orders arriving in P29 and P30 respectively). The sigma_hat is also adjusted based on the recent 6-period volatility to ensure the service level is maintained against the frequent demand spikes (>100). The current on-hand inventory is low (28), but we have a large in-transit pipeline (293 units) which includes significant orders from P28 (80), P30 (130), and P31 (58).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase/volatility confirmed from P26: 6-period mean is 74.8 units (compared to previous regime of ~32), with demand range of 42-112.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again starting around Period 26. While Periods 16-25 averaged ~32 units, the last 7 periods (P26-P32) have averaged 74.57 units (112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93) with significant volatility (std dev ~26). Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat captures this new higher mean. Standard lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is used for L. Sigma_hat is set to the standard deviation of this recent period (~25.7) scaled by sqrt(1+L) to account for the increased volatility and prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 27-30. On-hand inventory is low (15), so leaning on the significant in-transit pipeline (267) and updated demand parameters is necessary to recover service levels to the target critical fractile (0.5 for $1 profit/$1 holding cost).

The demand regime shifted again around Period 26. While Periods 16-25 averaged ~32 units, demand since Period 26 (N=8) has averaged ~75.4 units with significant volatility (std dev ~22). This has led to recurrent stockouts (on-hand is currently 0). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival from Period 29 in Period 33 conclude. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to capture this new, higher volatility demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent, but the 'calculate' method allows the backend to utilize the history of observed lead times (consistently 4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 26: 8-period mean is 75.4 units (vs. previous ~32), characterized by higher volatility (range 42-112).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 26, moving from a low-demand phase (~32 units) to a higher and more volatile phase. Over the last 9 periods (P26-P34), the average demand is 77.7 units (112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93, 69, 88), which is a significant increase. The standard deviation has also increased due to spikes as high as 112 and 108. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P25-P30 orders all arrived at L=4). I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this current regime's mean and volatility, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for both the higher average and the increased risk of stockouts observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand regime since P26 (N=9) has stabilized at a higher mean of ~78 units (previously ~32) with consistent volatility (range 42-112).

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime starting at Period 26. Since P26 (N=10), the mean demand is 79.1 units (112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93, 69, 88, 92), significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime of ~32 units. Volatility remains notable with a range of 42 to 112. Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all observed arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is very low (8 units), but in-transit inventory is high (289 units), which represents approximately 3.6 periods of demand coverage. To account for the shifted demand mean and the need to maintain service levels while managing high holding costs (equal to profit), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the current regime characteristics. Lead time L is set to calculated to reflect the stable history of 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 26 from a low average of ~32 to a higher, more volatile state. From Period 26 to Period 36 (N=11), the mean demand is 77.0 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.7. Recent demand (P34-P36: 88, 92, 64) remains consistent with this higher volume. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after a minor stockout in Period 36, meaning the system is reliant on incoming 'In-transit' units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P25-P32 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). To capture the current regime while buffering against the observed volatility (range 42-112), I will use recent_N with N=11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'calculate' method for L to reflect the stable 4-period lead time history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P26 (N=11) is stabilized at mean 77.0 units, significantly higher than the P16-P25 regime (mean ~32).

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 26. Since then (P26-P37), the mean demand has stabilized at 77.0 units per period (N=12), which is much higher than the previous low-demand regime (mean ~32). This recent regime also exhibits higher volatility, with demand ranging from 42 to 112 units. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods across all observed arrivals. As we are now in Period 38 out of 50, I will use a window of the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture this current regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to prevent the stockouts seen earlier in the game while managing holding costs. On-hand inventory is currently 50, and 283 units are in-transit, which aligns with the lead time and recent order sizes.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand regime shifted again at Period 26, moving from a low-demand phase (~32 units) to a higher and more volatile phase. Over the last 13 periods (P26-P38), mean demand is approximately 75.3 units with a standard deviation of 22.1. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is low (13 units), but there is a significant pipeline (296 units) following recent orders. I will use recent_N=13 for both demand and volatility to capture this current regime and ensure the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) exposure period (5 periods). Using N=13 covers the entirety of the current regime starting from Period 26.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at a significantly higher mean compared to the P16-P25 interval. Over the last 14 periods (P26-P39), the average demand is 76.9 units. In the most recent 5 periods (P35-P39), the average is slightly lower at 75.4 units, but volatility remains present with demand ranging between 56 and 94 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P35, P36, P37, P38, and P39). I will use a recent_N of 14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized higher-demand regime while allowing the OR backend to account for the observed volatility. The on-hand inventory is low (14), but there are 270 units in-transit, with 99 units expected to arrive in Period 40 (ordered P36), which should resolve the immediate tightness.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P26 (N=14) remains stabilized at a mean of ~77 units with significant volatility (range 42-112). Lead time remains reliably at 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been settled in a higher-demand state since Period 26. Analyzing the last 15 periods (P26-P40), the mean demand is approximately 77.2 units per period with a standard deviation of about 20.3. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 34 units with a substantial pipeline of 272 units. Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which corresponds to a base stock targeting the mean demand over the review and lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture this current regime's mean and volatility, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the sustained higher volume and variability observed since the P26 shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at a significantly higher mean compared to the previous Period 16-25 dip. In the last 16 periods (P26-P41), the mean demand is approx 78.5 units, with a notable range of 42 to 112. The most recent demand (Period 41) was 93, resulting in a stockout as on-hand inventory was only 89. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level target q is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand over the protection interval (L+1). I will use a recent_N of 16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-volatility regime (starting P26) while ignoring the irrelevant low-demand period earlier. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1=5) at current consumption rates.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains focused on the post-Period 26 shift. Since Period 26 (N=17 periods), the mean demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at 76.8 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0 units. Recently, demand has shown some fluctuations (e.g., 93 in P41, 45 in P42), but the overall average is consistent with the 'Period 40' carry-over insight. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival pattern observed (P37 and P38 orders arrived exactly after 4 periods). With only 2 units on-hand and 343 units in-transit, there is a risk of a minor inventory gap if demand spikes significantly before the next batch arrives. I will use the recent_N method with N=17 to capture this stabilized regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L as it remains reliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 26, with a 18-period mean of approximately 77 units (P26-P43) and continued volatility (range 42-112). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 310 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which the backend's base-stock formula will aim for. To provide the best forecast, I am using recent_N (N=18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-demand, high-volatility regime that started at Period 26. This allows the backend to calculation a base stock that accounts for both the average demand and the significant variance observed lately.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 up to Period 44 (N=19), the mean demand is approximately 78.4 units with a standard deviation of 19.4. The lead time has consistently stayed at 4 periods throughout the game history, confirmed by the most recent arrivals. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 16 units and a pipeline inventory of 280 units (orders from P41 to P44). The replenishment strategy will focus on this stable but volatile regime to ensure sufficient stock for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), especially given several recent stockouts where demand slightly exceeded on-hand supply. I am setting N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the entirety of the current high-demand, high-volatility regime that started at Period 26.

Daily Profit: $73.00, Daily Holding Cost: $22.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 26, characterized by a mean of approximately 77 units with significant volatility (range 42-112). Current on-hand inventory is 22 units, and there are 288 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the game is approaching its end (Period 46 of 50), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 20 periods (N=20), which covers the current regime. This ensures the base stock reflects the current demand average (~77) and its volatility, aiming to maintain a service level that balances the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has remained consistent with a mean of approximately 77 units and a observed range between 42 and 112. The most recent demand (Period 46) was 60, continuing this trend. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. Current On-hand is 56 and In-transit is 266 units. Orders placed in Period 47 will arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends). Therefore, any order placed now will not contribute to units sold and will only incur holding costs if the backend OR logic forces an arrival, or simply represent wasted pipeline. However, the OR backend requires parameters to function. I will use 'recent_N' with N=21 (from P26 to P46) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stabilized higher-demand regime accurately. For L, I use 'default' (4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the game (Period 48 of 50). The demand regime has been stable since Period 26 with a mean of approximately 77 units and a standard deviation of about 19 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the game ends after Period 50, any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4), which is after the simulation concludes. Therefore, placing a large order now is unnecessary and would only result in holding costs for ending inventory, which are not offset by revenue in this framework. However, the OR backend always applies a 'cap' and a base stock calculation based on the provided parameters. To minimize excess ordering while ensuring we don't stock out in the very final periods (49 and 50), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable N=22 regime (P26-P47) to reflect current demand accurately. The current on-hand (14) plus in-transit (286) is 300 units, which more than covers the expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (~231 units). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=22 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain statistical consistency with the active regime while knowing the backend will naturally limit orders as the pipeline is full.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The demand regime starting since Period 26 has been consistently higher and more volatile than the mid-game period (P16-P25). Over the last 10 periods (P39-P48), mean demand is 82.9 units (range 45-143). Period 48 experienced a demand spike of 143, resulting in a stockout (ending on-hand 0). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals. The current pipeline (in-transit) is 294 units. To handle the high demand volatility and recent spike while aiming to recover inventory for the final period, I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current mean of ~83 units per period. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=10) to reflect the increased volatility (std dev ~27.5). This approach helps ensure we cover the risk of further demand spikes in the final period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-volatility regime since Period 26, following a low-demand period (P16-P25). Over the last 24 periods (P26-P49), the mean demand is approximately 76.5 units, which is significantly higher than the ~32 units seen previously. We observe frequent spikes (e.g., Period 48 demand of 143), which often lead to stockouts because the OR engine's default cap is quite restrictive. Lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods throughout the entire history. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (19), but in-transit (326) covers approximately 4.2 periods of mean demand. To stabilize against the high volatility and frequent spikes shown in recent history, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=24 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current regime's mean (~76.5) and the higher standard deviation caused by the spikes, ensuring the OR backend's base-stock level is sufficient for the (L+1) = 5 period outlook. L remains at the promised lead time of 4.
