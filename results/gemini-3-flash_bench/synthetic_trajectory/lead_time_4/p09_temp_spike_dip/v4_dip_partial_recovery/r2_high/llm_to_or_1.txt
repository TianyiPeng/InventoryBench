Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no units in transit. The product is 'chips(Regular)' which typically has a steady demand but can be influenced by social gatherings or events. Looking at the five historical demand samples (82, 89, 65, 106, 136), the mean is 95.6 and the standard deviation is approximately 26.7. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Given that we have no information on actual lead time shifts yet, I will use the default promised lead time. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), since the last two samples show a significant upward trend (106 and 136), using a simple 'default' mean (all samples) might under-forecast. However, with only 5 samples and being at the start of the game, 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available) captures the current distribution effectively. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) accounts for the recent volatility while providing some safety buffer. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using these parameters to achieve a critical ratio (q) of 19/(19+1) = 0.95 service level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 140 units was placed. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, demand was 108 units, but since there was no on-hand inventory, sales were 0. The current in-transit is 140 units. The historical demand for this SKU (chips(Regular)) over the last 5 periods (including samples provided in the prompt) is 82, 89, 65, 106, 136, and the actual Period 1 demand observed was 108. The mean of all samples (82, 89, 65, 106, 136, 108) is approximately 97.6. Since L=4, the base stock should cover 1+L=5 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' method for L. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand fluctuations (avg of last 5: 89, 65, 106, 136, 108 = 100.8). This leads to a mu_hat of approx 504. The OR backend will calculate the order based on (mu_hat - in-transit).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. According to the execution sequence, orders from Period 1 and 2 has not arrived yet (they are in-transit). Physical demand in P1 (108) and P2 (144) resulted in 0 sales because starting on-hand was 0 and arrivals haven't started. The historical samples provided (P1: 82, P2: 89, P3: 65, P4: 106, P5: 136) seem to contradict the 'Period conclude' demand figures (P1: 108, P2: 144). I will prioritize the 'conclude' message data as it reflects the actual game engine's resolution. Demand is significantly higher than the initial samples suggest (Avg of 108 and 144 is 126). I'll use L=4 (promised). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=2 to capture this higher demand trend. Since we only have 2 data points from the conclude messages, I will set N=2 (though the prompt suggests a min of 3 for sustained signals, the discrepancy with the seed samples is large enough to warrant an immediate adjustment to avoid stockouts once shipments arrive).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (totaling 450 units in-transit), but since the lead time is 4, the first order (from Period 1) is not expected to arrive until the arrival phase of Period 5. Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory for Periods 1-3, resulting in 0 units sold despite a total demand of 394 units. Historically, demand for the first 5 samples provided (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) averages 95.6, but the observed demand in the game (108, 144, 142) suggests a higher actual demand regime (avg ~131) or a positive trend. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=3 to capture this higher recent demand level, and 'default' for lead time as there is no evidence yet to contradict the promised 4-period window.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4. No orders have arrived yet (P1 order was placed in Period 1, and according to the rules, L=4 means it should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and be visible in Period 5's conclude message, which I will see at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 615 units in transit (orders from P1-P4). Historical demand data provided in the prompt (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) differs significantly from the 'conclude' message demand (108, 144, 142, 84). I will prioritize the 5 'Historical Demand Data' samples provided (Mean=95.6) as the primary baseline, but acknowledge recent volatility. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I'll use the promised lead time (default) and recent demand (recent_N=5) to set the base stock level to capture the recent upward trend in the 5 samples provided.

Daily Reward (R_t): $960.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, the first order placed in Period 1 (140 units) arrived in Period 5 conclude (lead time = 4 periods), which matches the promised lead time. However, due to zero starting inventory and the lead time delay, demand was completely lost in Periods 1-4. The ending inventory in Period 5 is 85 after satisfying 55 units of demand. Current in-transit inventory is 570 (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5: 142+168+165+95=570). Historical demand shows: 82, 89, 65, 106, 136 (from samples) and realized demand in game history: 108, 144, 142, 84, 55. This yields a total mean demand of approximately 101.1 over 10 observations. There is a slight downward trend in the last few periods (84, 55), but given it's early and the variance is high, I will use all 10 available samples for stability. L=4 is confirmed. The backend should handle the pipeline of 570 units against the calculated base stock.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Promised lead time (L) is 4. Observations from Period 5 and Period 6 conclude messages confirm the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 133, and in-transit is 428 (orders from P3, P4, P5). Demand history shows a shift: early samples (P1-P3) averaged ~131 units, while recent samples (P4-P6) averaged ~78 units. Given this significant drop, I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand estimation to avoid over-ordering, as the early high demand is currently inflating the global mean. This uses the recent downward trend to stabilize inventory and reduce holding costs. The safety stock (sigma_hat) will also be calculated based on the recent 3 periods to reflect the current volatility (std dev of 84, 55, 94 is approx 19.6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1979.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical observations (Period 5, 6, 7) confirm that orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 arrived exactly after 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 187 with 260 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 4 and 5). Demand samples show a shift: Periods 1-3 averaged ~131 units, while Periods 4-7 averaged ~87 units. Demand in the most recent period (P7) was 114, suggesting the lower demand period might be stabilizing or reverting. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting (mu_hat) to capture the recent lower demand trend while acknowledging the variation. For lead time (L), I will stick with the promised 'default' as it is being consistently met. Sigma_hat will use all available history (default) to ensure a robust safety stock given the volatility (84 to 144 range).

Carry-over insight: Lead time is stable at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7). Recent demand (P4-P7) is notably lower than initial samples, averaging ~87 vs initial ~131.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical 'conclude' messages for Period 5, 6, 7, and 8 confirm the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (order P1->arrived P5, P2->arrived P6, etc.). Demand has shown a significant downward shift starting around Period 4. The initial three periods (P1-P3) averaged 131 units, while the subsequent five periods (P4-P8) averaged 79.4 units. Period 8 demand was particularly low at 50 units. With current on-hand inventory at 302 and in-transit at 241, we have a total pipeline of 543 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) captures the current lower demand regime (~79.4 per period) better than the long-term average, preventing excessive overstocking while maintaining a high service level (calculated q = 19/20 = 0.95).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 4: Mean decreased from 131 to ~79 (-39%) over the last 5 periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 10. We have observed demand for 9 periods. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in periods 5 through 9. Comparing early demand (P1-P3 avg: 131.3) with recent demand (P4-P9 avg: 85), there is a clear regime shift toward lower demand starting around Period 4. The current inventory position is strong: on-hand is 284, with 146 in transit (ordered in P8, expected in P12). Total pipeline + on-hand is 430. Given the recent average demand of ~85, the expected demand over the (L+1)=5 period horizon is approximately 425. Since our current inventory position covers this, the OR backend logic (base stock - pipeline) should naturally result in a low or zero order. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the shift that began in Period 4, and recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this new regime. Lead time remains at the default (promised) value of 4.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a stabilized lead time of 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 9. Although Period 10 recorded no arrival, it corresponds to Period 6 where 0 units were ordered, making this consistent with expectations. The demand regime shift identified in Period 9 remains active; demand from Periods 4 to 10 averages ~83 units, significantly lower than the initial three periods which averaged ~131. Specifically, recent demand (P8: 50, P9: 113, P10: 71) fluctuates but follows the lower mean. With an on-hand inventory of 213 and 243 units in-transit (orders from P8 and P10), the current pipeline is substantial relative to the revised demand forecast. I will continue using N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime (P4-P10), and use 'calculate' for lead time as the observed 4-period lead time matches the promised duration.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are evaluating the demand for 'chips(Regular)'. The promised lead time is 4. Historically, arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 confirmed an actual lead time (L) of exactly 4 periods. Since Period 9, no new arrivals have been recorded because orders from Periods 6 and 7 were 0, and the order from Period 8 is expected to arrive in Period 12 (to be seen in Period 13's conclude message). The demand regime shifted around Period 4. Pre-shift (P1-P3) demand average was ~131. Post-shift (P4-P11) demand average is ~86. The last 3 periods (P9-P11) averaged 97. Given the consistency of the lower demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the demand since the shift (P4-P11). While there's a slight uptick in the last few periods (113, 71, 107), it remains well below the initial peak. I will set L to 'default' as the lead time is stable at 4. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent_N (N=8) to reflect the current demand regime and avoid over-ordering based on the high early samples.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 142 units with 272 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the arrival in Period 12 (ordered in Period 8, lead_time=4). Historical demand from Period 4 onwards shows a stable regime compared to the initial high variance. Calculating from Period 4 to Period 12 (9 samples), the mean demand is approximately 88.7. Using a recent window of N=9 allows the OR backend to compute parameters based on this stabilized demand level while ignoring the non-representative early startup samples. The pipeline (272) and on-hand (142) totals 414 units, which covers nearly 4.6 periods of the current mean demand, positioning the stock level appropriately given the 4-period lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are facing an out-of-stock situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods (validated in P5-P12). The order placed in Period 9 (95 units) should have arrived in Period 13, but the history shows 'arrived=0' for that period. However, checking Period 9's 'conclude' message, it shows the P5 order arrived then. Re-evaluating history: P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8, P5 arrived P9. This confirms a 4-period lead time. However, there were no orders placed in P6 or P7, which explains zero arrivals in P10 and P11. An order of 146 was placed in P8 and arrived in P12 (L=4). No order was placed in P9. Thus, P13's zero arrival is expected. The next expected arrival is from the P10 order (97 units), which should arrive during Period 14. Demand has been volatile: P10-P13 demand was 71, 107, 110, 149. This indicates a significant upward shift from the previous regime (~79). The mean of the last 4 periods (P10-P13) is 109.25. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this increasing trend and ensure the base stock is calculated using the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: mean increased from ~79 to ~109 (+38%) over the last 4 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Reviewing the history, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P12 and P14). Current on-hand inventory is low at 33 units, but we have 459 units in-transit. Demand analysis: Previous insights noted a regime shift at Period 10. Checking demand from P10 to P14 (71, 107, 110, 149, 64), the average is 100.2. The previous demand sample (P1-P5) from the user prompt (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) averaged 95.6. The game history shows more volatility. Given the shift at P10, I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this most recent level (avg ~100). The lead time L is stable at 4. Sigma_hat should also reflect the recent volatility seen in the last 5 periods (std of 71, 107, 110, 149, 64 is approx 33). This parameter set allows the OR backend to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the current demand mean and variance over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 12, 14, and 15. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 10; the average demand for the last 6 periods (P10-P15) is approximately 100 units (71, 107, 110, 149, 64, 97). This is higher than the previous regime (~79) but lower than the very first samples. To prevent further stock-outs and account for the 4-period lead time plus the decision period (total 5 periods of demand), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 6 periods (N=6). This addresses the current upward shift in demand while maintaining a buffer for the lead time. Sigma_hat is also adjusted to reflect the volatility in this recent period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $339.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we analyze the current state of 'chips(Regular)'. Lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods, with the P12 order arriving exactly in P16 (L=4). Demand analysis shows a volatile recent period: the mean demand since Period 10 (the most recent regime shift identified in carry-over insights) is approximately 94 units (P10-P16: 71, 107, 110, 149, 64, 97, 23). However, the drop to 23 units in P16 is a significant outlier compared to the previous six periods. Using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=7, covering the regime since P10) captures the current mean of ~94 while the backend's L+1 multiplier integrates future expectations. With on-hand inventory at 98 and a large in-transit pipeline of 491 units (covering orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16), we are well-positioned. The current pipeline (491) already exceeds the likely base stock requirement (~94 * 5 = 470 plus safety stock), so the OR backend will likely order minimally or nothing this period. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect the identified regime shifts while smoothing out the P16 outlier.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 18. Analysis of the demand history shows several shifts. The most recent demand regime shift was identified at Period 10, but looking at the last few periods (P14-P17: 64, 97, 23, 56), demand is showing high volatility with a recent decline (average ~60). The 'In-transit' pipeline is currently 372 units, which is quite high compared to the recent demand average of ~60-80 units/period and a lead time of 4. With on-hand inventory at 164 and enough in-transit to cover multiple periods, the primary goal is to avoid overstocking and high holding costs. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P14-P17). I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=8 (covering P10-P17) to capture the current mean more accurately (~83.8), and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the recent fluctuating demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 16: demand dropped significantly (avg 39.5 over P16-P17 vs avg 109 previously). Monitoring for sustained lower demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 19. A significant downward demand shift was noted starting Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (P16-P18), demand values were 23, 56, and 16, averaging 31.67 units. This is a sharp decline from the previous regime (P10-P15) which averaged ~105. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P18 conclusion showing the P14 order arrived on time). Current inventory levels are high: On-hand is 310 and In-transit is 241 (total pipeline of 551). Given the current demand average of ~32, this stock covers over 17 periods, far exceeding the 5-period window (L+1) required. To prevent further unnecessary holding costs while this low-demand regime persists, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current mean of ~32 (mu_hat for L+1 would be ~160). This will signal the OR engine to stop ordering until the current surplus is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: Mean decreased from ~109 to ~32 (-70%) based on P16-P18 data. Inventory levels are currently in a significant surplus due to this drop.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 19 (23, 56, 16, 29), the average has dropped to approximately 31 units per period, representing a ~70% decrease from the previous regime (~109). Currently, the system has a massive surplus with 416 units on-hand and 106 units in-transit (arriving between Periods 20-22), while expected lead-time demand is only around 155 units (5 * 31). This surplus will likely prevent any new ordering for several periods. I am setting L to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistently 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this low-demand regime (Periods 16-19) and prevent the OR backend from inflating the base stock based on historical highs. The priority is to exhaust the current excess inventory to minimize holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $732.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P16-P20) has shifted to a significantly lower mean: (23+56+16+29+61)/5 = 37 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 427 units, with 34 units in-transit (ordered P17 and P18). Total inventory available (461) is extremely high relative to the current demand regime. With an expected demand of ~37/period and a lead time of 4, the target pipeline inventory (L+1 periods) should be around 185 units. Since 461 >> 185, no new orders are required, and we should focus on reducing the surplus. I am setting L to 'calculate' based on consistent historical 4-period lead times, and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this newest, lower demand regime (P16-P20). The high inventory level is a result of large orders arriving from the previous high-demand regime (avg ~109) just as demand plummeted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: Mean decreased from ~109 to ~37 units based on P16-P20 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-150.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in a low-demand regime that started at Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to 21 (6 periods) is 40.0 units (23, 56, 16, 29, 61, 14). We currently have an on-hand inventory of 416 units and 31 units in-transit (due from Period 18). Total pipeline inventory is 447 units. Given the new mean demand of ~40 units and a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods, which is approximately 200 units. The current stock is more than double the required base stock. I will use N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this recent low-demand regime. This will result in a much lower base stock target, causing the OR backend to place zero orders until the current surplus is naturally depleted, thereby minimizing holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the lower demand volume.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-inventory state (379 units on-hand) due to a sharp demand decrease that began in Period 16. Demand for the most recent 7 periods (P16-P22) has averaged 45.4 units (23, 56, 16, 29, 61, 14, 68), which is a significant drop from the previous regime (avg ~109). Given the current on-hand inventory of 379 units and a demand average of ~45, we possess over 8 periods of supply. The OR backend will naturally suppress ordering because the pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) significantly exceeds the calculated base stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to reflect the new lower demand level accurately and minimize further stock accumulation and holding costs.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a period of sustained low demand that began at Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 23 is approximately 40 units (23, 56, 16, 29, 61, 14, 68, 28). There is a significant inventory surplus with 351 units on hand and 0 in-transit. With an average demand of ~40 and a lead time of 4 periods, we require a pipeline coverage of roughly 200 units ((L+1)*mu), meaning the current 351 units are more than sufficient to cover demand for the next several periods without further ordering. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. To allow the OR backend to naturally stop ordering until inventory levels normalize, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 8 periods (since P16) to accurately reflect the current lower demand regime.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. Analyzing the recent 9 periods (P16-P24), the demand values are [23, 56, 16, 29, 61, 14, 68, 28, 39], resulting in a local mean of approximately 37.1. This is substantially lower than the pre-Period 16 average of ~109. Currently, on-hand inventory is 312 units with zero in-transit, while demand is averaging ~37 units per period. With a lead time of 4, the target pipeline (L+1 periods of demand) is approximately 185 units (5 * 37). The current stock clearly exceeds this requirement, so the goal is to prevent any further ordering until the surplus is depleted. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9) to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend correctly identifies the overstock situation and maintains zero orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, decreasing from an average of ~109 units to an average of ~38.7 units (observed mean of P16-P25 is 36.5). Since this drop, we have accumulated a massive inventory surplus (281 units on-hand) relative to the current demand levels. There are no orders in-transit, as lead times are stable at 4 periods and the last order placed was in Period 18. Given the current on-hand inventory of 281 units and an average demand of ~37 units, the current stock covers approximately 7.6 periods, which is significantly more than the (L+1) = 5 periods needed for the base stock policy. I will continue using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this lower demand regime (P16-P25). The OR backend's capped policy will correctly result in zero orders until the inventory level drops below the calculated base stock. No new regime shifts are detected beyond the sustained low demand identified in Period 21.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1959.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. The most recent shift occurred at Period 16, where demand dropped significantly. From Period 16 to Period 25, demand averaged approximately 36 units. However, Period 26 saw a sharp spike to 112 units. Given the high on-hand inventory (169 units) relative to this recent average and the spike, no new orders are necessary from a baseline perspective, but we must set parameters that reflect the current volatility. I am using recent_N=11 (Periods 16-26) to capture the lower demand regime while including the recent spike to provide a safer buffer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The high on-hand inventory will likely result in a calculated order of 0 by the OR backend, which is appropriate given the surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed in Period 26 (112 units) following a low-demand regime (avg ~36 units P16-P25). Monitoring if this indicates a new upward shift or a one-off outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $671.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a low-demand regime (avg ~36 units) from Period 16 to 25, followed by a sudden spike to 112 in Period 26 and 42 in Period 27. Period 26 appears to be a transitory spike rather than a sustained regime shift, as Period 27 returned to a level closer to the low-demand average. Current on-hand inventory (127) plus in-transit (92) equals 219 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 28 through Period 32 (5 units). Taking a conservative approach, I will set mu_hat based on the last 12 periods (P16-P27) which captures both the low period and the recent spike (average ~42 per period). This results in a mu_hat of approx 210 (5 * 42). Since total pipeline inventory is already 219, the OR backend will likely order minimal amounts or zero, which is appropriate given we are working down the previous surplus while protecting against the recent volatility. L is set to calculate as lead times have been consistent at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in Period 26 (112) did not immediately sustain in Period 27 (42); however, it raised the trailing 12-period average to ~42 units, signaling slightly higher volatility than the prior low-demand static phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2033.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context shows a volatile shift. After a long period of low demand (avg ~37 units), we've seen spikes in Period 26 (112 units) and Period 28 (108 units), suggesting a return to a higher demand regime similar to the Period 10-15 era (~109 units). Current on-hand inventory is low (19 units) with 181 units in-transit (orders from P27 and P28). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the service level requirements (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Averaging the demand from the last 13 periods (P16-P28) gives ~45 units, but the last 3 periods average ~87 units. To be safe against a sustained recovery while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this upward movement quickly. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility seen in recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 26: demand has spiked twice (112 in P26, 108 in P28) signaling a potential return to a higher mean (avg ~87 over P26-P28) compared to the previous low-demand regime (avg ~37).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has undergone a confirmed upward shift starting from Period 26. Demand values in the last four periods are 112, 42, 108, and 52, resulting in an average of 78.5 units. This is significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime of ~37 units (P16-P25). Consequently, the system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (L=4). To account for the new regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the current mean of 78.5 across the lead time + review period (1+L=5), totaling approximately 392.5. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 4 periods to reflect the heightened volatility associated with this shift. Recent orders (P27-P29) of 92, 89, and 140 are in-transit and will help alleviate the stock-out once they arrive starting Period 31.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: mean increased from ~37 to ~79 (+113%) based on P26-P29 data.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone another regime shift starting at Period 26. After a long low-demand period (avg ~37 units), demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) has averaged 77 units (112, 42, 108, 52, 71), confirming a shift back to a higher mean. Currently, inventory is critically low (0 on-hand) and demand is being lost, despite a large in-transit pipeline (460 units). The first of these newer orders (placed P27) is expected to arrive during the next period (P31), with confirmation visible in P32. To align the OR backend with this new higher-demand regime and the stable lead time of 4, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (regime length) and maintain the default lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1188.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 26. Analyzing data from P26 to P31 (112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64), the average demand is 74.8 units per period, which aligns with the previous insight of an increase to ~79. This is a significant jump from the prior low-demand regime of ~37. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P27 order arrived in P31). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (28 units) with a large in-transit pipeline (411 units) resulting from the aggressive ordering in P28-P30 to secure the new regime level. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using N=6 (P26-P31) to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term average. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine if further ordering is needed to maintain the target service level given the high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean increased from ~37 to ~75 (+102%) based on P26-P31 data.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 26. Since then, demand samples have been: 112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93. The mean demand for this recent regime (P26-P32, N=7) is approximately 77.4 units per period, which aligns with the previous insight of ~75-79 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P27 and P28 orders arrived exactly at P31 and P32). On-hand inventory is low (24 units), but in-transit inventory is high (364 units), covering the next few periods. I will continue using N=7 for mean and standard deviation to capture the current high-volatility, higher-demand environment while ensuring the OR backend targets the (L+1) horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1216.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 26. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 33 is approximately 76 units (112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93, 69). This is a clear increase from the previous low-demand regime (~37 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in P31, P32, and P33. To calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 (the length of the current regime P26-P33) to capture this new mean and higher volatility (range 42 to 112). This will set the base stock to cover expected demand over the lead time (4) plus the current period (total 5 periods). Current on-hand (95) and in-transit (324) are being factored in by the OR engine to ensure service levels are met while managing the holding cost of $1.0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 26 to 33 has stabilized at a higher mean of ~76 units, with increased volatility compared to the P16-P25 period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 26 from a low of ~37 units to a higher mean. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 34 (112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93, 69, 88), the mean is approximately 77.6 units. This shift is sustained over 9 periods, confirming a new regime as noted in carry-over insights. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P31-P34 arrivals confirm L=4). I will use the recent N=9 samples for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stable higher-demand regime and its associated volatility. The inventory position (On-hand: 146 + In-transit: 242 = 388) is being reconciled against this forecast to ensure adequate service levels for a lead time of 4 plus the current period (L+1=5).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward at Period 26 and has remained stable through Period 35, with an average demand of approximately 78 units over the last 10 periods (P26-P35: 112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93, 69, 88, 92). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 97 units on-hand and 289 in-transit, there is sufficient inventory to cover the lead time + review period (5 periods) based on the current mean. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized higher demand regime while smoothing out the increased volatility observed since Period 26. The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock and order amount based on these parameters, accounting for the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 26 to 35 stabilized at a mean of ~78 units, significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime (avg ~37).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at a significantly higher level compared to the previous low-demand phase (P16-P25). Analysis of the last 11 periods (P26-P36) shows a mean demand of approximately 78.4 units, with notable volatility (ranging from 42 to 112). Current on-hand inventory is 75 units, but there is a large pipeline of 342 units in transit, including orders from Periods 33-36. I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture this current regime's mean and standard deviation. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P31-P36). The inventory position (on-hand + pipeline) is currently around 417 units, which is sufficient for approximately 5+ periods of demand at the current average rate. Setting parameters to reflect this recent regime will allow the OR backend to maintain an appropriate service level while accounting for the increased volatility.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 26 and has remained relatively stable. Over the last 12 periods (P26-P37), the average demand is approximately 76.5 units. The most recent 5 periods (P33-P37) average 73.8 units, suggesting the ~76 unit mean identified in previous insights is still the most reliable anchor. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With 119 units on hand and 297 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P34, P35, P36, P37), the target is to maintain a base stock that covers demand across the lead time + 1 review period (5 periods). I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the behavior of the current regime since Period 26, which balances the higher volatility seen recently with the stabilized mean.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 26 into a higher regime compared to the previous low-demand phase (P16-P25). Over the last 13 periods (P26-P38), the mean demand is approximately 75.5 units, which is significantly higher than the previous average of ~37. Looking at the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38), the average is 74.2 units (88, 92, 64, 56, 71), confirming this stability. Lead times remain consistent at the promised 4 periods, with confirmation from every recent arrival (P31 through P38). Currently, on-hand inventory is 105 units and in-transit is 286 units. Given the lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an expected demand of ~75/period, the target inventory level (base stock) follows the logic (1+L) * mean. Using recent_N=13 for mu_hat captures this entire post-spike regime starting from P26, providing a stable forecast for the OR backend. Sigma_hat also uses N=13 to account for the increased volatility seen in this regime compared to the previous static period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a stable regime since Period 26, after a significant increase from the previous low-demand phase. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 39, the mean is approximately 77.2 units per period (samples: 112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93, 69, 88, 92, 64, 56, 71, 94). The most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) show a slightly higher average of 77.2, maintaining this level. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, and 39, all showing exactly 4 periods. With L=4, we must account for 5 periods of demand (L+1). My parameters use the evidence of this stable regime (N=14) to set the base stock. The current on-hand inventory is 101 and in-transit is 262, totaling 363 units. Given the mean demand of ~77, the total pipeline coverage is roughly 4.7 periods, which aligns well with the L+1 requirement.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 26 and has remained stable through Period 40. Analysis of the demand from Period 26 to Period 40 shows a mean of ~78.8 units per period (total 1182 over 15 periods). The most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) average ~72.8 units, suggesting a slight cooling but remaining significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime (avg ~37). I will use N=15 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized higher regime since Period 26. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the conclusion of orders from Periods 27 through 36. Inventory is currently well-managed with on-hand (117) and in-transit (267) totaling 384 units, which is approximately 4.9 periods of supply at the current demand rate. This supports a safety stock level that buffers against the observed volatility while minimizing holding costs.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized. For the last 16 periods (P26-P41), the average demand is 79.25 units. While there is minor variation, this mean is significantly higher than the P16-P25 low-demand period (avg ~37) and consistent with recent observations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P41 (ordered P37, lead_time 4). On-hand inventory is 79 units, with 289 units in-transit (orders from P38-P41). I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 16 periods to capture this stabilized regime (N=16), and use the same window for sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility in this period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained regime since Period 26, following a significant increase from the previous low-demand period. Over the last 17 periods (P26-P42), the average demand is approximately 78.1 units. Specifically, looking at the most recent 5 periods (P38-P42), demand has been 71, 94, 79, 93, 45, averaging 76.4 units, which aligns with the P26 regime shift insight of ~78 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals from P31 through P42. Currently, there are 80 units on-hand and 340 units in-transit (orders from P39, P40, P41, P42). Given the lead time (L=4) and review period (1), we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Using N=17 for mu_hat captures the entire current regime starting at P26. For sigma_hat, N=17 is also used to capture the volatility of this specific regime, which is higher than the previous static phase.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime that began at Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 43, the mean is approximately 76.8 units per period. The most recent demand (P39-P43) averages 76.8 units as well, confirming this stability. There are no signs of upcoming seasonal spikes or major calendar events in the provided context for Period 44. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 70 and In-transit inventory at 312, the total pipeline is 382. Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). A base stock calculation using the mean of approximately 77 units suggests a target level around 385 units. Since the current pipeline is 382, a small order is expected. I will use a recent_N of 18 (covering the entire current stable regime from P26-P43) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since the regime shift at Period 26, maintaining an average of approximately 78 units per period (P26-P44 average is ~77.8). In the most recent 5 periods (P40-P44), the mean has been slightly lower at 75.6 units, but still consistent with the post-P26 regime. Lead time remains reliable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (most recent arrival P44 from P40 confirm L=4). Pipeline inventory is healthy at 286 units, and on-hand inventory is 85. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend naturally targets a high service level. I will use recent_N with N=19 (the length of the current stable regime from P26 to P44) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility while excluding the historical low-demand period (P16-P25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1298.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime that began at Period 26. Since Period 34, the mean demand is approximately 75.5 units (calculated from Period 34 to 45). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 89, In-transit: 295) are sufficient to cover demand during the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), but consistent ordering is required to maintain the base stock level against the steady demand. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=20 to capture the stabilized behavior of the current regime while filtering out the drastic low-demand period (P16-P25) as much as possible, as the last 20 periods cover P26 through P45. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher-mean and higher-volatility state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1014.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has remained stable with a mean of approximately 76.5 units. Over the last 10 periods (P37-P46), the average demand is 72.2 units. The on-hand inventory is currently at 126 units, and there are 268 units in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we are ordering against a window of L+1 = 5 periods. With a profit of $19/unit and a holding cost of $1/unit, the OR backend targets a high service level (approx. 95%). Using recent_N=21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the higher-demand regime starting at P26 while filtering out the previous extreme low-demand period (P16-P25). Lead time (L) remains calculated as it has been consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1396.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 26 has remained stable. Over the last 22 periods (P26-P47), the average demand is approximately 75.3 units. In the more recent 10-period window (P38-P47), the average is 74.3 units, confirming stability. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 3 decision cycles remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50), and 285 units already in-transit (plus 86 on-hand), the current pipeline is sufficient to cover expected demand for the remaining periods (approx 75 per period * 3 = 225 units). I will maintain the stable parameters using the last 20 periods as the regime window to ensure the OR backend manages the transition to the game end without over-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2700.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant spike in Period 48 (143 units), whereas the average mean since Period 26 has been approximately 78 units. The recent samples (P40-P48) average roughly 79 units, but volatility has increased significantly with this latest observation. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 17 and in-transit at 278 units, we need to ensure the pipeline covers our lead time (4) + review period (1) = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=23 for mu_hat (covering the regime from P26 to P48) ensures the mean is anchored in the current higher-demand phase (~78 units), while sigma_hat will be set via recent_N to capture the increased variance seen in the recent history, especially after the P48 spike. This balanced approach will maintain service levels without over-ordering if P48 was an outlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 48 (143 units), significantly above the established mean of ~78 units. Monitoring if this is a new upward shift or a temporary spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1257.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 48 (143 units) was a significant outlier compared to the Period 26-47 average of ~78. Period 49 showed a return to a more standard level (68 units). I am calculating the regime mean for P26-P49 (excluding the P48 spike to avoid over-ordering, but acknowledging the volatility) which is approximately 78.5 units. With lead time stable at 4 periods, I need to cover demand for (1+L)=5 periods. The current on-hand (35) plus in-transit (309) totals 344 units. At a mean of ~78.5, 5 periods of demand is ~392 units. The OR backend will calculate the base stock. I will use a recent_N of 24 (Period 26 to 49) to capture the current stable regime while incorporating the recent high volatility of P48 into the sigma calculation. This ensures the service level is maintained despite the recent spike, while the mu remains anchored to the confirmed regime mean.
