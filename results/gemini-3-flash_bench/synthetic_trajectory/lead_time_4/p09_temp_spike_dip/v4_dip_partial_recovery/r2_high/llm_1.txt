The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive during Period 5 and be available for demand in Period 5, with confirmation visible at the start of Period 6. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over 5 periods is 82, 89, 65, 106, 136, averaging approximately 96 units per period. To maximize the reward, I must cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 4+1 = 5 periods). A simple base-stock calculation (Average Demand * 5) suggests a need for roughly 480 units. However, given the upward trend in the last two historical samples (106, 136), I will lean slightly higher to ensure a high service level while managing holding costs. I will place an initial order of 500 units to establish a pipeline that covers the lead time duration.",

Our current inventory position is: On-hand (0) + In-transit (500) = 500 units.

The Carry-over Insight from Period 29 suggests a return to ~100 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is low at 47 units. The Lead Time is confirmed at 4 periods, meaning we must cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand (Periods 30-34). Total pipeline requirement for 5 periods at ~100 units/period is 500 units. Current pipeline is On-hand (47) + In-transit (350) = 397 units. We need approximately 103 additional units to cover the pipeline based on the 100-unit forecast. However, I will order slightly more to build a small safety buffer given the recent high demand spikes (112, 108) and the consequence of stock-outs.",

Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (P45) will arrive in Period 49 (P45+4), leaving only 2 periods of sales (P49 and P50) for that specific shipment to satisfy. Orders placed after P46 will not arrive before the game ends. Recent demand (P26-P44) has averaged approximately 76 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 113. Total in-transit is 360 units, scheduled as follows: P45 arrival (80 units from P41), P46 (80 from P42), P47 (100 from P43), P48 (100 from P44). Total inventory available to cover periods P45 through P48 is 113 (on-hand) + 80 + 80 + 100 + 100 = 473 units. Expected demand for these 4 periods (76 * 4) is 304 units, leaving ~169 units on hand at the start of P49. To cover the final two periods (P49 and P50), we need approximately 76 * 2 = 152 units. Since the projected starting inventory for P49 is already 169, we are well-covered for the remainder of the game. I will place a small order of 50 units to ensure a safety buffer for the final two periods without incurring excessive holding costs, as there is no value in having inventory left after P50.",

In-transit inventory consists of: P42 order (80), P43 order (100), P44 order (100), and P45 order (50), totaling 330 units. The P42 order will arrive in Period 46, creating a total available pool of 200 units for P46 demand. Estimated demand for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50) is approximately 375-400 units (5 * 75-80). Total inventory (on-hand 120 + in-transit 330) equals 450 units. This is sufficient to cover all remaining periods and likely results in a small surplus (roughly 50-75 units) by the end of Period 50.

Orders placed now (P47) will arrive at P51 (during the Arrival Resolution of P51), which is after the game concludes.

My primary objective is to maximize total reward by meeting demand while minimizing ending inventory in the final period (Period 50). The game ends at the conclusion of Period 50. Due to the 4-period lead time, any order placed now (Period 49) would arrive in Period 53 (49 + 4), which is well beyond the game's horizon. Even an order placed in Period 46 would only arrive in Period 50. Currently, On-hand inventory is 119 units. There are 50 units in-transit (ordered in Period 45), which are scheduled to arrive during Period 49's arrival resolution phase and will be available for demand in Period 50. Total inventory available for the remaining two periods (49 and 50) is therefore 119 + 50 = 169 units. Historical demand in the current regime (since Period 26) averages approximately 80 units per period, though Period 48 saw a spike to 143. Even with a high-end estimate of 100 units/period, 169 units is sufficient to cover the estimated 160-200 units of demand for the remaining two turns, or at least to satisfy Period 50. Since new orders cannot arrive before the game ends, the optimal action is to order 0 units to avoid unnecessary costs and potential holding costs on any theoretical arrivals (though they wouldn't arrive anyway).",
