Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. I have no historical observations or concluding messages to review yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The provided demand history for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 5 periods shows an upward trend (82, 89, 65, 106, 136), with an average demand of 95.6. To ensure sufficient stock covering the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. The backend will calculate the mean and standard deviation based on all available samples. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no in-transit units, the backend will trigger an initial order to reach the calculated base stock level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 140 units was placed. The promised lead time is 4 periods, so this order is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at Period 6). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 140 units in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 108. Historical demand samples (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) show a mean of 95.6. The Period 1 demand of 108 is consistent with this range. Since we have no observed arrivals yet, I will use 'default' for lead time. For demand forecasting, I will use 'default' (all samples) to establish a baseline mean and variance, as there is not yet enough evidence of a sustained regime shift.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Evaluation of the history shows that orders placed in Period 1 (140 units) and Period 2 (139 units) are currently in-transit, totaling 279 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Given the sequence rules, an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 4 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. The current demand is showing an upward trend (P1: 108, P2: 144) compared to the initial historical seed (82, 89, 65, 106, 136). The average demand of all 7 available points is approximately 111.4. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and the lead time is long (L=4), we must set parameters that allow the backend to maintain a base stock covering (1+L) = 5 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' method for L (relying on the promised L=4) and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the recent higher demand readings while the sample size for the current regime is still developing. I will use N=5 for demand and volatility to weight recent observations more heavily.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 have not yet arrived, which is expected as the first order (Period 1) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5 (L=4) and becomes visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible at Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales, which is unavoidable given the lead time. Demand history shows 108, 144, and 142 for the first three periods. The provided additional historical samples (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) suggest a baseline, but the actual observed demand in-game (averaging 131.3 over 3 periods) is higher. Since we have only 3 periods of in-game data, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this slightly higher demand trend while waiting for the pipeline to arrive. I will stick with the promised lead time (L=4) until evidence suggests otherwise.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and be visible in Period 5's conclude message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Therefore, on-hand remains 0 because the first order hasn't arrived yet. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 82, 89, 65, 106, 136 (averaging ~95.6). However, the game history shows 'demand' in the conclude messages as 108, 144, 142, and 84, which are higher than the provided sample set. Using the conclude message demand data (Avg ~119.5), there is no clear trend yet, only volatility. I will use recent_N to capture the available history. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I'll maintain the default lead time settings as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a drift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, the first order placed in Period 1 (140 units) arrived in Period 5 conclude (visible at the start of Period 6), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory is now being replenished, with 85 units on-hand and 524 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). The historical demand for periods 1-5 shows a mean of 106.6 units (108, 144, 142, 84, 55). However, there is a visible downward trend or shift in the last two periods (84 and 55). Since we have 5 periods of data available, I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand to capture the full recent history while acknowledging the variability. With L=4, the backend will calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat across (L+1)=5 periods of demand. The in-transit pipeline (524) plus on-hand (85) total 609 units, which covers expected demand for nearly 6 periods at the current average, so the OR backend will likely temper new orders via the cap and stock-on-hand logic.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $246.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand history (Periods 1-6) shows values of 108, 144, 142, 84, 55, 94. The first two orders (from Periods 1 and 2) arrived exactly with the promised lead time of 4 periods (arriving in Periods 5 and 6 respectively). There has been a noticeable drop in demand starting from Period 4 (averaging ~78 units/period in the last 3 periods) compared to the initial 3 periods (averaging ~131 units/period). This suggests a possible demand regime shift or a post-launch stabilization. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 'In-transit' is currently 385 units (orders from Periods 3, 4, and 5). With on-hand inventory at 130 and the pipeline well-stocked, the OR backend needs accurate demand estimates to avoid over-ordering during this lower-demand phase. I am setting L to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the more recent, lower demand trend (Periods 4, 5, 6) while still maintaining a reasonable sample size for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: mean decreased from ~131 to ~78 (-40%) across 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $277.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from Period 1, 2, and 3 all arriving exactly 4 periods later. The recent demand history (Periods 4-7) shows values of 84, 55, 94, and 114 (average ~87). While the carry-over insight noted a decrease starting at Period 4, the last two periods (94 and 114) suggest demand may be recovering or stabilizing higher than the immediate post-drop lows. As we are currently carrying significant on-hand inventory (179) and have 222 units in-transit (from orders in Periods 4 and 5), we need to avoid over-ordering. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the lower regime since Period 4, but will use all available samples for volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure sufficient safety stock. Setting L to 'default' or 'calculate' is appropriate given lead time stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovering post-drop: Periods 6 and 7 (94, 114) represent a potential return toward the lifetime mean (98) compared to Periods 4 and 5 (84, 55).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-94.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Looking at 'Period 8 conclude', the order from Period 4 arrived after exactly 4 periods (promised lead time is 4). On-hand inventory is high at 294 units due to the arrival of previous large orders (165 units) and a recent dip in demand (Period 8 demand was only 50). History shows demand fluctuates significantly: Periods 1-3 averaged ~131, Periods 4-5 dropped to ~70, and Periods 6-7 recovered to ~104, before dropping again in Period 8. Given the volatility, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current variability and mean, which includes the recent recovery and the latest dip. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The goal is to set a base stock that accounts for (L+1)=5 periods of demand. With On-hand (294) + In-transit (145) = 439, we are likely well-covered, but providing the OR backend with representative stats will ensure the right buffer for future cycles.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: recent 5-period mean is 83.4 with high variance (STD ~25), contrasting with early period mean of 131. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods across 4 observations.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 238 units, and arrivals have consistently followed the promised lead time of 4 periods. The demand history shows significant volatility: an initial high mean (~131), a sharp drop in Periods 4-5 (~69), and a recent fluctuation between 50 and 114. The most recent demand (Period 9) was 113, following 50 in Period 8, suggesting that demand is not settled in a low regime but remains highly variable around a lifetime mean of 96 units. Given the lead time is 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With 238 on-hand and 97 in transit (from Periods 8 and 9), our pipeline is 335. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters (covering Periods 5-9) captures the most recent mean of 85.2 and correctly accounts for the high observed standard deviation (approx 28) to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level despite the recent volatility.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 167 with 234 units in-transit. History confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods based on 5 consecutive arrivals (P1-P5 orders all arrived with L=4). Demand remains volatile but shows no new structural shift; the mean of the last 7 periods (P4-P10) is 83 units, while the lifetime mean is 94.4 units. Since the backend algorithm targets (L+1) periods of demand coverage and L=4, we must cover 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current lower-demand regime (post-Period 4) while accounting for the recent high variance (standard deviation remains significant). This approach prevents over-ordering in response to the initial high-demand periods (P1-P3) and balances the relatively high holding cost ($1) against the profit ($4).

Current Period is 12. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods (based on concludes from P5 through P9). The 'chips(Regular)' demand shows high variability but no permanent regime shift back to the high levels of P1-P3 (mean ~131). The recent 8-period mean (P4-P11) is 86. Demand in P11 was 107, following 71 in P10, suggesting a fluctuating but relatively stable average around 90. Inventory is currently declining (OH: 60) with a large pipeline (297). The system is expecting arrivals from orders placed in P8 (arriving P12), P9 (arriving P13), etc. Using N=8 for mu_hat to capture the post-initial-drop period (P4-P11), providing a balanced forecast of approximately 86 per period. Sigma_hat is also set to Recent_N (8) to reflect the recent volatility. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 38 and in-transit is 330. Demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 8-12) has averaged 90.2 (50, 113, 71, 107, 110), while the lifetime mean is approximately 99. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (ordered Period 8, arrived Period 12). Since the promised lead time is 4, L+1 = 5. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (since Period 8) to capture the current demand level of ~90/period, resulting in a target pipeline coverage of approximately 450 units. While in-transit (330) and on-hand (38) total 368, the OR backend's capped policy will adjust the order to reach the base stock level calculated from these parameters. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 captures the current volatility (std ~26.7) which is slightly higher than the lifetime average, ensuring a safety stock that accounts for recent demand swings.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean stabilized around 90 units/period over the last 5 periods (P8-P12). Lead time continues to be consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory was exhausted (sold 47 out of 149 demand), making current on-hand 0. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (458 units) includes orders from Periods 10 (137), 11 (63), 12 (121), and 13 (137). The order from Period 10 is expected to arrive during Period 14 (making it visible in the P14 conclude message), providing 137 units to meet demand. Demand has shown high volatility recently with P13 spiking to 149. To account for this volatility and the recent stock-out, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (Periods 8-13) to capture the trend of recovering demand (mean ~100) and its significant variance, while keeping L at the calculated average of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 13 (demand=149) resulting in a stock-out; the 5-period demand average from P9-P13 has risen to ~110 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $183.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent (Period 10 order arrived in Period 14). We currently have 73 units on hand and 429 units in transit. Demand has been volatile: after a spike to 149 in Period 13 which caused a stock-out, it dropped to 64 in Period 14. Over the last 7 periods (P8-P14), the average demand is approximately 102 units. Given the lead time (L=4), we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A safety stock is necessary to buffer against the observed volatility (demand ranging from 50 to 149). I will use a recent_N of 7 to capture the current demand regime which averages ~102, as using a longer history would include the early high-demand period (~130) or the mid-period slump, neither of which reflect the current fluctuating state. This will set mu_hat to (1+4) * 102 = 510.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 13 (149) vs Period 14 (64). The 7-period average (P8-P14) has stabilized around 102 units/period, suggesting a moderate recovery from the P4-P5 lows but still below the P1-P3 highs.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 39 units on-hand and 404 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since the lead time is stable, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. On the demand side, there has been significant volatility recently, with a sharp spike in Period 13 (149) followed by lower values (64 and 97). The last 8 periods (P8-P15) show demand values of 50, 113, 71, 107, 110, 149, 64, and 97, averaging 95.1 units. This 8-period window captures the recovery from the mid-game slump while accounting for current variance. I'll use recent_N with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a robust forecast that balances the high peak (149) and low trough (64) seen recently, ensuring the base stock level (for L+1 = 5 periods) is sufficient to handle current variability without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility stabilized around a mean of ~95 units over the last 8 periods (P8-P15) with no new sustained regime shifts detected; lead time remains strictly 4 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, current on-hand inventory is 137 with 376 units in-transit. Demand in Period 16 was exceptionally low (23), significantly below the recent mean (~95-100). Looking at the history, lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and recently by the arrival of P12's order in P16). The 5-period average demand (P12-P16) is 88.6, while the 10-period average (P7-P16) is 92.8. Given the carry-over insight from P16 that demand has stabilized around ~95 units, I will use recent_N with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent low demand with the volatility observed over a slightly longer window, helping to maintain a safe but not excessive inventory level given the 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility without a sustained regime shift. Over the last 10 periods (P8-P17), demand has averaged 84 units per period (sum=840), though it remains erratic (ranging from 23 to 149). Based on this, I am setting N=10 for mu_hat. This balances the higher initial demand (P1-P3) against the more moderate recent performance. Sigma_hat is set using default to capture the long-term volatility and maintain a sufficient safety stock. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods; although P14-P17 show relatively high inventory levels, this is a result of large orders placed during the stock-out in P13 (arriving now in the pipeline). Using recent_N for L ensures the backend utilizes the observed stability of L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-246.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe high on-hand inventory (310) which is sufficient to cover multiple periods of demand. Over the last 11 periods (P8-P18), the demand mean is approximately 91 units/period, but recent volatility is high: P16-P18 demand values are 23, 56, and 16, significantly lower than the preceding mean. This recent slump (3-period average of ~32) suggests a potential downward shift or a normal but extreme variance swing. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains perfectly stable in the physical arrivals observed (P1-P14 orders all arrived with L=4). I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=11) to capture the post-drop stabilization mean (~91) while the OR backend accounts for the increased variance seen in the recent low-demand periods. With high on-hand and in-transit (158), the OR capped policy will naturally limit new orders to minimize holding costs given the current inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand deceleration observed in P16-P18 (mean ~32) compared to the P8-P15 mean of ~102; monitoring to see if this represents a new sustained low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-203.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained low-demand regime. Demand over the last four periods (P16-P19) has consistently been low (23, 56, 16, 29), with a mean of approximately 31 units per period. This is a significant drop from the previously established mean of ~102. On-hand inventory is very high (319 units), which is sufficient to cover approximately 10 periods of demand at the current rate. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and low current demand, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand environment and prevent the OR engine from ordering more, thus mitigating excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 16: Mean demand decreased from ~102 to ~31 (-70%) over the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-107.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As confirmed in the Period 20 carry-over insight, the demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant downward regime shift starting around Period 16. The average demand over the last five periods (P16-P20) is 37 units (23, 56, 16, 29, 61), a sharp decrease from the previous average of ~102 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 351 units, which is approximately 9-10 periods of supply given the new demand regime. With an additional 27 units in-transit (ordered in P17, P18), the total pipeline and stock are far in excess of the desired base stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the consistent 4-period observations. mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the low-demand regime (5 * 37 = 185), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility within this low-demand phase. These parameters will signal the OR backend that no new orders are necessary until the inventory is drawn down.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is approximately 33 units (23, 56, 16, 29, 61, 14), which is a 70% decrease from the previous average of ~102. The current on-hand inventory (343) is extremely high relative to this new demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and low demand, I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new low-demand regime. This will prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary new orders while we burn through existing stock (on-hand + 21 in-transit), minimizing holding costs which are significant at $1.0/unit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a low-demand regime that began around Period 16. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 7 periods (P16-P22) has averaged 38.1 units/period (23, 56, 16, 29, 61, 14, 68), which is a significant drop from the previous average of ~102 units. The on-hand inventory is currently very high (296 units) due to the arrival of orders placed before this regime shift. Since the promised lead time (L=4) requires us to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1), and 5 periods at the current mean (~38) equals roughly 190 units, our current 296 units significantly exceeds the required base stock. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this lower demand regime and variance. This will prevent the OR backend from placing more orders until the inventory level drops, minimizing further holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P16-P22) mean stabilized at ~38 units/period, confirming a long-term shift from previous levels of ~100.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (P16-P23) shows a significant decrease in mean demand, now stabilized around 38 units/period (P16-P23 average is 39.5, with P23 at 28). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 268 units with zero in-transit. Given L=4, the pipeline should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~40, the required base stock is approximately 200 units (plus safety stock). Since current on-hand (268) significantly exceeds the projected 5-period demand (even with high volatility), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8 to capture the full recent low-demand regime since P16) to ensure the OR backend recognizes the lower demand level and avoids over-ordering, while maintaining L at calculate to reflect the stable observed 4-period lead time.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume regime since Period 16. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P16-P24) is approximately 37 units per period, which is significantly lower than the early game average. Currently, on-hand inventory is 229 units with zero in-transit shipments, as all previous orders (up to Period 18) have arrived. Given the lead time (L) of 4 periods and a period of consideration (L+1=5), the total demand coverage needed is approximately 185 units (5 * 37). Since current on-hand inventory (229) exceeds this requirement, the OR backend will correctly skip ordering. I will set the L parameter to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time observed consistently. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the current low-demand regime statistics since the shift at Period 16, ensuring the base stock level reflects the new market reality and avoids over-ordering while holding costs are high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-74.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 25 (the last 10 periods), the mean demand is approximately 36.5 units per period (23, 56, 16, 29, 61, 14, 68, 28, 39, 31). This is a substantial decrease from the earlier periods where demand averaged over 100 units. My carry-over insights confirm this shift stabilized around ~38 units. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 198 units with no units in transit. Given the current demand mean (~37) and a lead time of 4 periods, we expect to consume roughly 185 units over the next 5 periods (L+1). Since current on-hand inventory (198) already covers this expected demand, the OR backend policy (base stock minus pipeline) will correctly result in zero orders per the cap mechanism, which is appropriate to reduce holding costs. I will set L to 4 as observed lead times have been consistent, and use the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $362.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~102 to a significantly lower mean. While the regime from P16-P25 averaged approximately 38 units/period, Period 26 saw a sharp spike to 112 units. This spike suggests either high late-regime volatility or a potential mean reversion. To account for this, I am using recent_N with N=11 (covering the entire low-demand period from P16-P26) to capture the current average including the recent spike. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods throughout the game history. On-hand inventory is 86 units with 21 units in-transit (ordered P26). With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (P27-P31). The current inventory position (86 + 21 = 107) relative to the recent mean (~44.7 * 5 = 223.5) indicates we need to place additional orders. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 ensures the OR backend recognizes the lower demand baseline while respecting the increased volatility from the P26 spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Volatility increase in low-demand regime; Period 26 demand (112) is 3x the P16-P25 average (38).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a low-demand regime starting from Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 45 units/period (calculated over P16-P27). While Period 26 saw a spike to 112, Period 27 returned to a more moderate 42. I am setting N=12 for mu_hat to capture this entire low-demand regime (P16-P27). Standard lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 44 and in-transit is 113 (Total pipeline = 157). Given L=4, the base stock targets demand for (L+1)=5 periods. 5 * 45 = 225 units. The backend will subtract the current pipeline (157) from this base stock and apply the ordering cap to ensure we don't over-order if volatility is high, while maintaining a high service level (z* for 4:1 profit/holding ratio is ~0.84).

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Low-demand regime (P16-P27) stabilized with mean ~45, despite a single outlier spike in P26 (112). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a low-demand regime (P16-P28) with a mean demand of approximately 45 units/period, despite recent volatility (P26: 112, P27: 42, P28: 108). Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 0) following a stock-out in Period 28. In-transit inventory is 202 units, consisting of orders from P26 (21), P27 (92), and P28 (89). With a stable lead time of 4 periods, the P26 order is expected to arrive in Period 30. To cover the lead time (L=4) plus the review period (1), we need to maintain a base stock for 5 periods of demand. Using the last 13 periods (P16-P28) as the relevant regime (N=13), the mean demand is ~45 units. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=13 to stabilize against the recent spikes while respecting the overall lower demand regime. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-demand regime since Period 16, though it exhibits significant volatility (e.g., P26=112, P28=108 compared to P21=14). The average demand over the last 14 periods (P16-P29) is approximately 51 units/period. The current status shows on-hand inventory is 0 for the past two periods due to recent demand spikes, and the system is currently stock-out. In-transit inventory is high (302 units), but these orders (placed P26-P29) are not scheduled to arrive until P30 (today), P31, P32, and P33 respectively, given the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods throughout the entire history. Using a recent_N of 14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current lower-demand regime while accounting for the high volatility seen in recent spikes, helping the OR backend adjust for the stock-out and expected arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P29) mean has moderately increased to ~51 units/period (from ~38) due to high-volatility spikes in P26 and P28.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-volatility, low-to-medium regime following a significant drop around Period 16. In the most recent 15 periods (P16-P30), the mean demand is approximately 49.7 units, though volatility remains significant (standard deviation approx 27), evidenced by recent spikes in P26, P28, and P30. We are currently experiencing stock-outs due to this volatility and a period where no orders were placed (P19-P25). However, a significant pipeline of 281 units is in transit, with the first major replenishment (92 units from P27) expected to arrive in Period 31. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all observed arrivals. To account for the increased volatility and the recent drift in the mean (P16-P30), I will use a recent_N of 15 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), which captures the entire current low-demand regime. This balances the need to cover recurring spikes while recognizing the lower overall demand level compared to the start of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 16. Initially, this was a drop to ~38 units/period (P16-P25), but more recently (P26-P31), the mean has increased to ~75 units/period due to several high-demand spikes (112, 108, 71, 64). I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this recent upward trend and increased volatility while staying sensitive to the overall lower demand level compared to the start of the game. Lead time is consistently behaving at exactly 4 periods (P26 order arrived P30, P27 order arrived P31). With 28 units on hand and 215 in-transit (covering orders from P28, P29, and P31), the pipeline is reasonably full, but given the recent demand spikes and stock-outs in P28-P30, I need the OR backend to maintain a buffer. Setting N=6 for both mu and sigma captures the current 'higher-than-bottom' volatility regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: mean increased from ~38 to ~75 (+97%) over the last 6 periods with high volatility.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime starting around Period 26, after a prolonged low-demand period (P16-P25). The mean demand over the last 7 periods (P26-P32) is approximately 78.8 units (112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93), which aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 32. In-transit inventory is high (249 units), but significant demand recovery and the relatively high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.8) require maintaining higher base stocks to prevent stockouts like those seen in P28-P30. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. I am setting L to default (4), and using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this recent regime shift while accounting for the high volatility (STD ~26.5) observed in these recent samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~38 to ~79 (+107%) over the last 7 periods (P26-P32) with sustained high volatility.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new higher-demand regime starting around Period 26. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P26-P33) is approximately 76.4 units. The volatility (standard deviation) in this recent regime is approximately 25.8. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 26 through 29. Inventory position currently consists of 55 units on-hand and 272 units in-transit (orders from P30 to P33). To ensure we cover demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods) while accounting for the recent regime shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 samples (recent_N=8). This captures the higher mean (~76) compared to the previous low-demand state (~38), which minimizes stock-out risk while the backend OR logic balances the holding costs.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new high-volatility regime starting at Period 26, after a prolonged low-demand period (P16-P25). Over the last 9 periods (P26-P34), the average demand is approximately 82.5 units/period (total 743 units). The most recent demand was 88, following a sequence of 69, 93, 64, and 71, reinforcing this shift. The inventory position is currently strained with 0 units on-hand and 375 units in-transit. Lead time is reliably 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals in P30-P33). Because demand is volatile and we are frequently hitting 0 inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the recent 9-period average (N=9) to cover the current regime (1+L)*82.5. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=9) to capture the higher variance observed since P26, helping the OR backend adjust the base stock to maintain a sufficient service level against these spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~38 to ~82.5 (+117%) over the last 9 periods (P26-P34) with sustained high volatility.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 26. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P26-P35) is approximately 84 units per period, with high volatility (ranging from 42 to 112). Current on-hand inventory is 0, following a period of stock-outs, despite 408 units being in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the current demand regime shows sustained higher demand compared to the P16-P25 low, but remains highly volatile, I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this newer, higher-volume, high-variance state. This will ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the ~84 unit mean and allows for a sufficient buffer against the frequent demand spikes observed recently.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 26, moving from a low-demand phase (avg ~38) to a higher, more volatile phase. Over the last 11 periods (P26-P36), the mean demand is approximately 81.3 units per period. In the most recent 5 periods (P32-P36), the mean is 75.2, but given the earlier spikes and stock-outs (P28, P30, P34, P35), a longer lookback is safer for capturing volatility. I will use N=11 (P26-P36) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this sustained higher-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on multiple recent confirmations (P30, P31, P32, P33, P35, P36). The inventory position shows 317 units in-transit, which are needed to cover the current cycle as we have had multiple periods with zero ending inventory recently.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P26-P36) mean stabilized at ~81 units/period, representing a sustained +110% increase from the P16-P25 low-demand regime.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 26 and has stabilized at a higher mean. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 37, the mean is approximately 81.5 units per period. Although the last two periods (P36: 64, P37: 56) are lower than the average, they follow several high-demand periods (P34: 88, P35: 92), suggesting continued high volatility rather than a new downward trend. The Lead Time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 126 and in-transit at 250 (orders from P34, P35, P36, P37), we are well-positioned to cover the next 4 periods of demand (estimated at ~407 units including current period). I will use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the state of the current regime (P26-P37) accurately, allowing the OR backend to maintain a high service level while the pipeline inventory is absorbed.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 26 and has stabilized at a higher mean compared to the P16-P25 low. Over the last 13 periods (P26-P38), the mean demand is approximately 78.5 units/period. The most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) show a mean of 74.2, suggesting the 'recent_N' approach with N=13 is appropriate to capture the current regime's behavior while smoothing out high volatility. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P36, P37, and P38 all arrived with exactly a 4-period lead time). On-hand inventory is currently healthy (158 units), and the pipeline (193 units) is sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time. Parameters L=4, mu_hat (using N=13 to cover the whole current regime), and sigma_hat (N=13) will allow the OR backend to maintain an optimal base stock for this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $253.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~80 units/period since Period 26. Recent demand from P36-P39 was 64, 56, 71, and 94, averaging 71.25. The transition from the low-demand regime (P16-P25) to this current regime (P26-P39) is well-confirmed. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P35, P36, P37, P38, and P39). Currently, on-hand inventory is 123 with 202 units in-transit (orders from P36, P37, P38, P39). Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=14 (P26-P39) captures this stabilized higher demand regime accurately. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=14 to reflect the volatility observed in this specific regime. This strategy ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock sufficient to cover demand over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volatility regime beginning at Period 26, with the mean demand over the last 15 periods (P26-P40) being approximately 78.5 units. The most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) show an average demand of 73.8, while the last 10 periods (P31-P40) average 78.5. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 37 that the mean is sustained around 81, though slightly cooling recently. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P32, P33, P34, P35, and P36 exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 76, and there are 270 units in transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40). I will use recent_N with N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-volatility regime (P26-P40) and set L to 4 manually to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the proven stable lead time. This will help the OR backend maintain a sufficient service level for this volatile demand while managing holding costs.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 26 and has stabilized at a mean of approximately 81 units/period (P26-P41), showing high volatility but no clear new trend. Recent demand (P36-P41: 79, 71, 94, 79, 93) confirms this higher level compared to the previous low-demand period. Lead time remains exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods, with every order since P26 arriving exactly on schedule. Currently, on-hand inventory is 39 units and in-transit is 292. My objective is to maintain a base stock that covers demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). With a mean of ~81 and significant volatility (std ~18), the OR backend's service-level logic will aim for a base stock around 500-550 units to avoid the stockouts seen in P34-P35. Setting mu_hat using the last 16 periods (regime since P26) ensures we capture the current stabilized mean accurately.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, with a mean demand of approximately 81 units per period and sustained high volatility. Recent periods (P37-P42) show demands of 56, 71, 94, 79, 93, 45, which aligns with this mean. The current on-hand inventory is 40 units, and the pipeline inventory is 343 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the target service level is 80%. I will use the recent_N method (N=17, covering P26-P42) to capture the current demand mean and volatility, which will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for both the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (5 periods) and the necessary safety stock to handle the observed variance. This approach ensures we maintain availability while managing holding costs as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime starting from Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 43, the average demand is approximately 76.7 units per period with a standard deviation of about 19.3. The most recent demand (P43) was 76, very close to this average. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by multiple recent arrivals (P39-P43). Current on-hand inventory is 32, and in-transit inventory is 312. Given the (L+1) lead time window (5 periods), the expected demand is roughly 384 units. Pipeline (312) + on-hand (32) = 344, which is slightly below the required base stock for this regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 (the length of the current regime from P26-P43) to capture these stable demand statistics while ignoring the previous low-demand regime. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current mean and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P26-P43) has a stable mean of ~77 units/period and remains highly volatile (STD ~19). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

For Period 45, on-hand inventory is 47 units and in-transit is 287 units. The OR backend uses these parameters to set a base-stock level that covers inventory needs for L+1 periods (5 periods). Given the regime stability since P26, I use N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations (P26 to P44) to capture the current mean and variance accurately while ignoring the previous low-demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $240.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime established at Period 26, with a mean demand of approximately 77 units and significant volatility (STD ~19). Recent demand observations (P40-P45: 79, 93, 45, 76, 85, 73) yield a mean of 75.2, which is consistent with the established regime. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 52, In-transit: 296) are being managed against this demand profile. For Period 46, I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the current stable regime (P26-P45) and default methods for L and sigma_hat, as the lead time is stable and the default standard deviation calculation over the full history effectively accounts for the current volatility profile (sqrt(1+L) * 31.8 \u2248 71), providing a robust safety stock for this high-margin item ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, high-volatility regime since Period 26, with a mean demand of approximately 77 units per period and a standard deviation of about 19. Recent demand (P44: 85, P45: 73, P46: 60) continues to align with this expectation. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), the objective is to maintain sufficient inventory to satisfy remaining demand while avoiding excessive holding costs at the end. My target is to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using N=21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the entire current regime starting from P26. The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+4) * mean + z * sqrt(1+4) * std, which appropriately buffers against the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $264.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a regime starting from Period 26, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 77 units per period and a standard deviation of roughly 19. My current on-hand inventory is 48, with a significant pipeline of 289 units (orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 43 order in Period 47. With the game ending at Period 50, orders placed now (Period 48) will arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game's horizon. However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage the current state. I will use the recent_N method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable regime (P26-P47, N=22), and remain with the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Profit: $492.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, demand spiked significantly to 143, which is nearly double the recent mean (~77). This exhausted all on-hand inventory, resulting in an ending inventory of 0. We are entering the final two periods of the simulation (Period 49 and 50). The current demand regime starting from Period 26 has maintained a mean of approximately 77 units with high volatility (Standard Deviation ~20). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (Period 49) with a 4-period lead time will NOT arrive before the game concludes. Therefore, the priority is to manage the 291 units already in-transit and the 0 on-hand units to maximize profit over the final 2 days. The OR backend needs to recognize the current demand level to properly calculate base stock, but the final order will be heavily capped by the pipeline and time horizon logic. I will use 'recent_N' with N=23 (covering P26 to P48) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility accurately.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: High demand spike (143) observed, significantly above the regime mean of ~77; however, this is a single-point outlier in an otherwise stable high-volatility regime.

Daily Profit: $272.00, Daily Holding Cost: $19.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $253.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting P26) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 77 units and a standard deviation of 19. Period 48 showed a significant spike (143), which caused a brief stock-out, but Period 49 demand (68) suggests a return to the regime mean. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains highly reliable based on the 'conclude' messages from Periods 5 through 49. For the OR parameters, I am using N=24 for mu_hat (P26 to P49) to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime. I am setting sigma_hat using the same window to ensure the service level accounts for the observed volatility (including spikes like P48), and L is set to 'calculate' as the lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the history.
