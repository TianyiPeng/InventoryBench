Recent demand has trended upward (106, 136), suggesting a possible shift or high variance. \n4. Strategy & OR Reconcile: The OR recommends 0 units. This is because the pipeline (537) far exceeds the base-stock requirement for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (5 * 96 = 480). However, since we haven't seen a single arrival yet, and the lead time is long (4 periods), we must ensure we don't stock out if demand remains at the higher level of 130+. \n5.

Projected arrivals are: P11 (80 units from P7), P12 (85 units from P8), P13 (145 units from P9), and P14 (54 units from P10).\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P9: 77, P10: 72) has dropped significantly compared to the earlier average of ~115 (P1-P8). This suggests a demand regime shift downwards. The OR recommendation (61 units) reacts to this by capping the order.\n4. **Strategy**: The pipeline (364) + current on-hand (94) = 458 units. At a recent demand average of ~75/period, this covers roughly 6.1 periods. The goal is to cover L+1 = 5 periods. However, the holding cost is high ($1.0 vs $1.0 profit), making the critical fractile 0.5. This means the target inventory level should be closer to the median demand rather than holding excessive safety stock. \n5. **Adjustment**: The OR suggestion of 61 units is based on the full history.

Crucially, the order from Period 42 (68 units) is expected to arrive in Period 46. The current 'In-transit' of 256 units comprises orders from Period 42 (68), Period 43 (30), Period 44 (30), and Period 45 (128).

The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 84 units. Since the game ends at Period 50, we only have 4 more ordering opportunities (P46, P47, P48, P49). Any order placed today (P46) arrives in P50. Our goal is to cover demand for the remaining periods while managing the pipeline.

Orders in transit are from Period 43 (30 units), Period 44 (30 units), Period 45 (128 units), and Period 46 (128 units), totaling 316 units. Demand has been volatile recently (76, 137, 94, 39), with an average around 86 units over the last 4 periods. However, the game ends at Period 50. Orders placed now (Period 47) will arrive in Period 51 (47 + 4), which is after the game concludes. Therefore, any order placed now will incur costs without contributing to satisfied demand or rewards. My goal is to maximize total reward by the end of Period 50. Since I have 316 units arriving before the end of the game (30 in P47, 30 in P48, 128 in P49, 128 in P50), and on-hand is 29, the total available inventory for the remaining periods (47, 48, 49, 50) is 345 units.
