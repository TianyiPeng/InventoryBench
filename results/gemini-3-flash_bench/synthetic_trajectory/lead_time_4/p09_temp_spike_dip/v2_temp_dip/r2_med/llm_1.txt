Historical demand for the 5 periods provided is [118, 130, 72, 58, 121], which results in an average demand of approximately 100 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since I start with 0 On-hand and 0 In-transit, I need to place an order that covers the inventory needs for the current period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). My cumulative demand target for these 5 periods is approximately 500 units (5 * 100). Ordering 500 units immediately will build the pipeline to satisfy future demand once the shipment arrives in Period 5. Although I will incur lost sales during the first 4 periods while waiting for the lead time, I must initiate the pipeline now.",

Total inventory on hand (66) + expected arrivals over L periods (200+110+110+110 = 530) equals 596 units. To cover P45 through P49 (L+1 periods) at an average demand of 110/period, we need ~550 units. However, given the game ends at P50, and lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (P45) arrives in P49. Orders placed after P46 will not arrive before the game ends. I will place a moderate order to ensure coverage for P49-P50 while being mindful of the 50-period cap.",

The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual performance (P38-P41 orders all arrived in 4 periods). We are currently in Period 46, with the game ending at Period 50. This means orders placed now (P46) will arrive in Period 50 (P46+4), which is the final period. Orders placed after today (P47 onwards) will not arrive before the game ends. Inventory assessment: On-hand (138) + In-transit (440) = 578. Expected demand for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50) is approximately 110 * 5 = 550 units. With 578 units in the pipeline, we are already covered for the remainder of the simulation.

The current inventory status is: On-hand = 129, In-transit = 330 units. The pipeline consists of: P43 order (110) arriving in P47, P44 order (110) arriving in P48, P45 order (110) arriving in P49, and P46 order (0) arriving in P50. Total units currently in or entering inventory before the game ends = 129 (on-hand) + 110 (P43) + 110 (P44) + 110 (P45) = 459 units. Total expected demand for Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50 is approximately 113 * 4 = 452 units. As the 459 units already committed to arrival perfectly cover the expected demand through the end of the game (P50), no further orders are required.

At Period 50, any units ordered will only arrive in Period 54 (given the established 4-period lead time). This means any order placed now will arrive after the game has concluded and cannot be sold to generate profit. However, these units would incur unnecessary ordering complexity and provide no return. More importantly, the current inventory on-hand is 186 units. Based on the stable demand regime of ~105 units (confirmed in Period 41 insights and supported by recent demand of 119, 101, 81, and 91), the 186 units on-hand are more than sufficient to cover the final period's demand (Period 50), which occurs after this decision.
