Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical performance data yet, although we have 5 pre-game demand samples. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will naturally target a high service level. The initial demand samples [118, 130, 72, 58, 121] show a mean of 99.8 and a standard deviation of 31.9. Since this is the very first decision, I will use 'default' methods which will utilize all available demand samples and the promised lead time of 4. This ensures that the base stock level targets (1+L) = 5 periods of demand. No lead time shifts or losses can be detected yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 154 units was placed. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect it to arrive until Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 start observation). We started with 0 inventory, and Period 1 demand was 114, resulting in 114 lost sales. Current demand history (including the Period 2 observation from the pre-prompt) shows five data points: 118, 130, 72, 58, 121. The mean demand is 99.8 with a standard deviation of approximately 32. Since we are in the very early stages of the game and have not yet observed any arrivals to verify actual lead time, I will stick to the promised lead time and utilize all available demand samples to establish a baseline. The OR backend will calculate a base stock level to cover the lead time + current period (L+1 = 5 periods) based on these statistics.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 and P2 are still in transit (305 units total). With a lead time of 4, the first arrival (from P1) is expected in Period 5 (L=4 means arrival in N+L). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as demand occurred (114 in P1, 117 in P2). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including those provided in the dataset) are 118, 130, 72, 58, 121. The mean demand is approximately 100. Since we have no arrivals yet, we cannot infer an actual lead time shift; we must stick to the promised lead time of 4. I will use the default method for L and sigma_hat, and use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand context (the 5 samples provided in the prompt) to guide the base stock calculation: (1+L) * mean.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 are still in transit and have not yet arrived (this is expected as L=4 means the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 5 and be visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales as demand (114, 117, 103) exceeds availability. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the first 5 samples (including the user-provided pre-history) is 118, 130, 72, 58, 121, with an average of approximately 100 units. Since we have no confirmed arrival data yet, I will use the promised lead time (L=4). To set parameters for the OR backend, I will use 'default' or 'recent_N' methods. Given a slight downward trend in the very recent demand samples (72, 58) but a high last sample (121), I will use all 5 available samples to stabilize the forecast, as no clear sustained regime shift is yet evident.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4. According to the sequence: an order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (4 periods later: 1+4=5). Since we are currently in the decision phase of Period 5, we have not yet observed the arrival of the Period 1 order (which will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 593 units in transit (orders from Periods 1-4). Demand has been relatively stable with a mean of ~100. Based on the 4-period lead time, we must cover demand for the current period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Current demand samples: 114, 117, 103, 106. Mean is ~110. Standard deviation is low (~6.5). I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4) and use all available historical samples for demand and sigma, as no regime shift is detected yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2486.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our history shows the order from Period 1 arrived at the conclusion of Period 5 (arrived=154, lead_time=4), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. We currently have 22 units on hand and 456 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Historical demand across the first 5 periods is: 114, 117, 103, 106, 132 (Mean \u2248 114.4, Std Dev \u2248 11.4). Since demand appears relatively stable with a slight uptick in Period 5, I will use all 5 samples to forecast. The OR backend needs parameters representing demand over the review + lead time window (L+1 = 5 periods). Current pipeline (456) + On-hand (22) = 478. The expected demand over the next 5 periods is approximately 572 units. The default methods will capture these statistics well, as there is no clear regime shift yet.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived conclusion of P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The inventory cycle has stabilized with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6). Currently, we have 93 units on-hand and 452 units in-transit (P3, P4, P5, P6 orders). Historical demand mean for P1-P6 is approx 108.7 units per period. The standard deviation is approx 17.5. With L=4, the coverage needs to span 5 periods (L+1). mu_hat should reflect 5 * 108.7 \u2248 543.5. sigma_hat should reflect sqrt(5) * 17.5 \u2248 39.1. Using 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat accounts for all observed demand data while remaining responsive. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is now being consistently met.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals in Period 5, 6, and 7 (all ordered 4 periods prior). Demand over the first 7 periods has shown some variability but no clear regime shift yet, with a mean around 103 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 163, and there is a significant pipeline of 373 units (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). Given the lead time (L=4), we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Total pipeline plus on-hand is 536 units. Average demand for 5 periods is approximately 515 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it aligns with observed data, and 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture all completed demand observations while allowing for future flexibility if a shift occurs.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised (orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 all arrived with exactly a 4-period lead time). Demand has been relatively stable with a slight downward trend in the last few periods (Period 5-8 mean is 98 vs overall mean of 104). The current position (on-hand 199 + in-transit 286 = 485) is healthy. Since we have passed the initial stock-out phase and inventory is now flowing regularly, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to capture the most recent average (N=4 corresponds to the periods where stock was actually available to meet demand). I'll stick with the default lead time (4) as it is verified.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1324.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 10, we observe a stable demand pattern with a mean of approximately 99 units over the first 9 periods. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as evidenced by arrivals from orders placed in P1 through P5). The current on-hand inventory is 139 units, with 379 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Using L=4, the base stock targets a 5-period window (L+1). My current pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 518 units. Given the calculated mean demand of ~99, the expected demand over 5 periods is ~495. The OR backend uses a high service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), which justifies a base stock slightly above the mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full observed history of demand, as there are no clear regime shifts detected yet. I'll stick with the promised (and confirmed) lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1494.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 11 shows on-hand inventory of 197 and in-transit of 296. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P1-P6 orders all arrived with L=4). Demand seems relatively stable but slightly lower recently. Using all 10 periods of demand data (avg ~100) to set the base stock level. The backend logic will use L=4, meaning mu_hat and sigma_hat should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Profit of $19 vs $1.0 holding cost yields a service level (q) of 0.95, which the backend will use to calculate the safety stock. Since the lead time is stable at 4, 'default' (using promised=4) or 'calculate' is appropriate; I will use 'calculate' to rely on the consistent history of observations. For demand, I'll use 'default' (all samples) as there is no strong evidence of a regime shift yet, just normal variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1660.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (matches promised). Since P5, the demand has entered a lower regime compared to the initial samples. The average demand from P6 to P11 is approximately 87.3 units, whereas the overall average (including initial samples) is around 99.8. To avoid excess holding costs (164 units on-hand plus 326 in-transit), I will use the recent 6 periods (P6-P11) to estimate demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This aligns the base stock calculation with the most recent observed consumption pattern while acknowledging the 4-period lead time. Pipeline inventory is currently 326, and on-hand is 164, totaling 490 units, which is sufficient for roughly 5+ periods of current demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: average demand decreased from ~115 to ~87 (-24%) sustained through Period 11.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (Periods 5-12) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 6, there has been a sustained demand regime shift; average demand from P6 to P12 is approximately 90 units (80, 72, 110, 77, 89, 96, 99), compared to the earlier average of ~115 (P1-P5). Applying the base stock logic (L+1 demand coverage), we need to cover demand for 5 periods. Using recent_N starting from Period 6 (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this lower demand regime and its associated volatility. The current inventory position (On-hand: 124, In-transit: 267, Total: 391) is sufficient but must be maintained against this lower avg demand. The backend's critical ratio (19/20 = 0.95) will ensure a high service level while the 'recent_N' approach reduces unnecessary holding costs by adjusting the target stock levels downward.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting at Period 6. From Period 1 to 5, average demand was approximately 114, while from Period 6 to 13, it dropped to 88.5. Choosing N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat targets this more recent, stable regime. The lead time has consistently held at 4 periods across all 9 concluded orders (P5 through P13), confirming the promised lead time is accurate. I will use 'calculate' for L to leverage this historical consistency. The Current state shows on-hand inventory of 149 and in-transit of 261. Given a lead time of 4, the ordering logic needs to cover demand for periods 14-18. Using the recent average (~89/period), total needs for (L+1) are roughly 445 units. With 410 units already in physical or pipeline inventory, the OR backend will calculate the appropriate top-up order while balancing the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which favors a higher service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1507.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 6. From Period 6 to Period 14 (9 periods), the demand has averaged approximately 87.1 units per period (80, 72, 110, 77, 89, 96, 99, 85, 86). The standard deviation during this same period is approximately 11.5. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 14). Since L=4, the backend needs to cover 5 periods of demand (1+L). I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this lower demand regime and its associated volatility. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 127, In-transit: 276, Total position: 403) are significantly higher than the expected demand over the lead time (approx 5 * 87 = 435), meaning the OR backend will likely place a small or zero order to reduce holding costs while maintaining a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2460.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The demand regime shift noted in Period 12 (dropping from ~115 to ~87) has shown signs of volatility in the most recent periods, specifically Period 15 which saw a spike to 134 units. Over the last 10 periods (P6-P15), the average demand is approximately 95 units with a standard deviation of about 19. Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A base stock calculation using mu_hat and sigma_hat should account for this. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime and its volatility. This balances the lower average observed since Period 6 with the recent spike in Period 15, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level for this high-profit (19:1 profit-to-holding ratio) item.

Daily Reward (R_t): $714.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe a critical situation: the order placed in Period 12 (0 units) should have arrived at the conclusion of Period 16, but the 'Period 16 conclude' message shows arrived=0. However, because the ordered amount was 0, this 'zero arrival' is expected and does not necessarily indicate a lost shipment or increased lead time. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistently observed in all prior arrivals (P5-P15). Current on-hand inventory is 46 units. Recent demand (P12-P16) has averaged 88.8 units, which is consistent with the regime shift identified in Period 12 (avg ~87). Period 16 showed a significant dip to 40, but this is treated as variance within the lower-demand regime. For OR parameters, I will use L=4 (promised/observed). I will set mu_hat using the last 11 samples (P6-P16) to capture the current lower-demand regime (avg ~87.8 * 5 = 439) and sigma_hat using the same period for variance. This balances the risk of a stockout against holding costs in a lower-demand environment.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 6 from architectural levels of ~114-117 down to ~87. However, more recently (Periods 16-17), demand has dropped significantly to 40 and 33. I will monitor this drop to see if it sustains. Lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods, but an anomaly occurred in Period 16 where the expected shipment from Period 12 (order=0) resulted in no arrival, as expected. The shipment from Period 13 arrived in Period 17. The current on-hand inventory is 117 with 377 in transit. Given the recent demand drop, I will use recent_N (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the shift towards lower demand values (approx average 80) while acknowledging the very low recent samples. This helps prevent excessive over-ordering if the current drop to ~30-40 is the new normal, while maintaining enough stock if demand reverts to previous regime levels around 90.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift at Period 16: demand dropped from ~90 average to ~36 average over the last two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1144.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history indicates a significant shift. While Period 12 carry-over noted a drop to ~87, the most recent three periods (P16-P18) show a deeper drop in demand (40, 33, 67), averaging approximately 46.7 units per period. I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new, lower demand regime and avoid excessive inventory accumulation. Lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals from P1-P11, P13, and P14 orders. The missing P12 order (ordered P12, expected P16) is noted but in-transit levels (341) plus current on-hand (129) are sufficient to cover the current demand forecast across the lead time despite the potential loss.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand decreased from ~90 to ~47 (-48%) based on P16-P18. Order from Period 12 (0 units) is technically missing but has no impact on stock levels; Order from Period 12 was for 0 units anyway.

Daily Reward (R_t): $709.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Comparing the historical demand patterns: Period 1-5 (avg ~114), Period 6-15 (avg ~94), and Period 16-19 (40, 33, 67, 46 - avg 46.5). This represents a nearly 50% drop from the previous stable range. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P15 order arrived at P19 conclude). The order from P12 for 0 units explains the 'arrived=0' at P16 conclude. Currently, on-hand inventory is 165 and in-transit is 259 (orders from P16, P17, P18). Given the new demand regime (approx 46.5 units/period), the pipeline of 424 units is enough to cover over 9 periods of demand. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to account for the current low-demand regime and prevent over-ordering while maintaining a high service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost). Sigma_hat will also use the last 4 periods to capture current volatility.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the focus remains on the demand regime shift that began in Period 16. The average demand has dropped significantly from ~90 down to an average of 49.6 units over the last five periods (P16-P20: 40, 33, 67, 46, 62). Current on-hand inventory is 226, and there are 136 units in-transit (orders from P17, P18). Considering the lead time is 4, the order placed today will arrive in Period 25. The total pipeline covers 5 periods of demand (P21-P25). Given the current average demand of ~50, 5 periods would require ~250 units. We already have 226 + 136 = 362 units in the system. Consequently, no new order is expected to be placed by the OR backend. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples to reflect this lower demand regime and use the calculated lead time which remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand decreased and stabilized at ~50 units (based on P16-P20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1381.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level following a regime shift around Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 21 is approximately 55.5 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 234 units, and there are 43 units in-transit (ordered in Period 18). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the current inventory levels, the pipeline plus on-hand (277 units) is significantly higher than the expected demand over the next 5 periods (roughly 277-280 units). The stock level is currently high enough to incur holding costs without immediate risk of stockout. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect this lower demand regime and L to default (4) as lead times have consistently been 4 periods. Since the inventory is already above the likely base stock target, the backend capped policy will likely order zero, which is appropriate.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 7 periods (P16-P22), the average demand is 53.2 units, which is significantly lower than the preceding regime (~90 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 22 (P18 order arrived on time). Currently, the on-hand inventory (237) and in-transit units (72) total 309 units. Given the lower demand and a lead time of 4 periods, this inventory level already covers nearly 5.8 periods of demand (309 / 53.2), which is higher than the standard (L+1)=5 target. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to reflect this established lower demand and sigma_hat with recent_N=7 to capture recent volatility. L is set to default as the promised 4 periods remains accurate.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 16. The average demand for the most recent 8 periods (P16-P23) is approximately 52.37 units. The current on-hand inventory is 191 units, and the in-transit pipeline is 99 units (orders from P22 and P23). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the low demand regime, the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs. The OR engine parameters are set using 'recent_N' for demand (N=8) to capture the current regime more accurately, while maintaining a standard lead time setting.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 through Period 24 (9 samples), the mean is approximately 55.3 units per period (40, 33, 67, 46, 62, 85, 40, 46, 79). This is a notable decrease from the prior regime (P6-P15) which averaged ~87. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P13, P14, P15, P16, P17, and P18). There is a slight concern with the gaps in arrivals in P23 and P24 (orders from P19 and P20), but since those order quantities were 0, no stock was expected to arrive. The current on-hand inventory (112) and in-transit (136) are relatively high compared to the current demand levels (~55/unit). I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the current demand regime (P16-P24) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using default for L (promised lead time of 4) is appropriate as the observed lead times have consistently matched the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime center (P16-P24) at ~55 units per period; previously ~87 units (P6-P15).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 55 units per period. In the most recent period (P25), observed demand was 0, which may be a reporting lag or a temporary outlier, but it contributes to high on-hand inventory levels (112 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity (222) combined with current 'On-hand' (112) totals 334 units, which covers approximately 6 periods of demand at the current average (55 units). I will use recent_N (N=9, covering P16-P24 plus the P25 0-demand outlier for conservative estimation) to reflect this lower demand regime. Since inventory is currently high relative to the lower demand, the OR backend's inventory position logic (base_stock - pipeline) will likely result in a small or zero order this period, effectively balancing the service level against holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2096.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown high volatility recently. After a stabilization period (P16-P24) at an average of ~55 units, the demand in P26 spiked to 114 units, similar to the initial high-demand regime (P1-P5). While P25 showed 0 demand, P26 suggests a potential return to higher volume or high variability. The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since P22's order arrived in P26, we expect orders from P23, P24, P25, and P26 to arrive in P27, P28, P29, and P30 respectively. However, P23 and P24 resulted in 'arrived=0' in their respective conclusion cycles (visible in P24/P25 starts), though this is consistent with lead time = 4. I will use recent_N=11 (P16-P26) for demand to capture the current lower-average but high-variance regime, ensuring the base stock level accounts for the recent 114-unit spike while avoiding over-ordering based on the older ~90+ average.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased at Period 25-26: P25 demand was 0, followed by P26 demand of 114, breaking the previous stable regime of ~55 units (P16-P24).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1843.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (Ending Inventory = 0 in Period 27) with a stockout of 3 units in the last period. Demand has transitioned into a highly volatile regime: after a stable period of ~55 units (P16-P24), demand spiked to 114 and 100 in the last two periods (P26-P27), following a zero-demand outlier in P25. This suggests a new high-demand regime or significant volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P26 and P27). I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent surge (avg ~71.3 including the 0, but the trend is upward) and to ensure the base stock levels react quickly to the stockout. The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+L) * avg_demand + safety_stock, which needs to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime or high volatility detected starting Period 25: Demand sequence 0, 114, 100 suggests a shift away from the previous ~55 unit average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $703.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has transitioned from a low-demand regime (~55 units, P16-P24) into a significantly higher demand regime starting at Period 26 (Demand: 114, 100, 117). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) and lost significant sales in Period 28 (Demand 117, Sold 37). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (373 units) is substantial, but current demand suggests a baseline of ~110 units per period. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the recent regime shift, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 (covering the high demand periods P25-P28, average ~83 including the outlier 0, or P26-P28 average ~110). Since the last 3 periods specifically show consistent high demand, I will focus on the most recent shift (N=4) to capture the upward trend and increase orders to fill the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: average demand increased from ~55 to ~110 units (based on P26-P28), returning to levels seen in the first 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1134.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted back to a high-volume regime starting at Period 26. Historical samples for the first 5 periods averaged ~115, and the most recent demand sequence (P26-P29) is 114, 100, 117, 61, averaging ~98 units. This is a clear increase from the previous regime (P16-P25) which averaged ~55 units. To capture this shift without overreacting to the single lower data point in Period 29, I am using recent_N with N=4 to anchor \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to this new high-demand period. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 25 order in Period 29. The current on-hand inventory is low (25 units) and we have experienced stockouts in Periods 27 and 28, so maintaining a responsive base stock level is critical to recovering service levels while managing the high holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: average demand increased from ~55 to ~98 units (P26-P29). Demand levels now mirror the initial P1-P5 volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $608.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted back to a high-volume regime starting at Period 26. The average demand over the last five periods (P26-P30) is approximately 105 units ([114+100+117+61+133]/5 = 105), which is significantly higher than the previous low-volume regime (~55). I am currently stock-out (on-hand: 0) and have lost sales in the last four periods due to insufficient inventory. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To recover, I need to set mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period average (N=5) to capture the increased demand volume. Given the high service level required (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use the recent volatility (N=5) for sigma_hat to ensure the base stock is high enough to minimize further stockouts while waiting for the in-transit inventory (553 units) to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: average demand increased from ~55 to ~105 units (based on P26-P30), necessitating a return to higher base stock levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1574.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 26 is now firmly established. Over the last 6 periods (P26-P31), demand has averaged 101.5 units (114, 100, 117, 61, 133, 84), which is a significant increase from the previous regime of ~55 units (P16-P24). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P27, P28, P29, P30, P31 all showing lead_time=4). Current on-hand inventory is low (22), and while there is a significant in-transit pipeline (520), the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock level that reflects this higher demand regime. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-volume state (starting from P26) while ignoring the lower historical demand. This ensures the service level remains high enough to meet the ~100 unit/period demand without over-ordering based on the even higher initial P1-P5 volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1044.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted back to high volume starting Period 26. Since Period 26, the demand values have been 114, 100, 117, 61, 133, 84, and 62, averaging approximately 95.8 units per period. This aligns with the initial Period 1-5 volume (~114 units) more closely than the interim low-demand periods. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-volume regime. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 28 order in Period 32. On-hand inventory is 134, and in-transit is 407 (consisting of orders from P29-P32 totaling 507, but subtracting the 100+ units arrived in P31-P32). Setting N=7 ensures the backend uses the stabilized mean and variance of this new phase to maintain a high service level while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high-demand regime from P26-P32: avg demand ~96 units, returning to early-game (P1-P5) levels.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 26, returning to a higher average of approximately 96 units per period (P26-P33), compared to the previous low of ~55 (P16-P24). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 251 and in-transit at 273 (total position 524), we are well-covered given my forecast of ~96 units/period. The pipeline inventory includes large orders from P30 (98 units), P31 (73 units), P32 (61 units), and P33 (41 units). I will use recent_N for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=8 (the duration of the current high-demand regime from P26-P33) to ensure the OR backend captures this sustained resurgence in demand while maintaining the necessary service level.

The average demand from Period 26 to Period 34 is approximately 98 units per period (N=9). This volume is consistent with the initial demand seen at the beginning of the simulation (P1-P5). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 30 order in Period 34. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 256 and the in-transit inventory is 214. Total pipeline inventory (470) is sufficient to cover approximately 4.8 periods of demand at the current average. To maintain optimal service levels while avoiding excessive holding costs (especially with a profit/holding cost ratio favoring high service levels), I will base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the last 9 periods (P26-P34) to capture this higher-demand regime accurately.

Carry-over insight: Current high-demand regime (P26-P34) average demand is ~98 units, mirroring P1-P5 levels.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 26 from a low average (~55 units) back to a high average (~96-98 units), mirroring the initial periods. Over the last 10 periods (P26-P35), average demand is approximately 97.4 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P31 order arrived at P35 conclusion). Current On-hand inventory is 277 units with 228 units in-transit (orders from P32, P33, P34, P35). Total pipeline is 505 units. Given the high stock level relative to current demand, I will continue using the recent_N method (N=10) to capture this established high-demand regime while allowing the OR backend to normalize the inventory levels through its optimization logic.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 26, increasing from an average of ~55 units to ~91 units (P26-P36). This high-demand environment (~91 units/period) is consistent and sustained over the last 11 periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P32 order arriving at the end of P36). The inventory position (On-hand: 244, In-transit: 204) is robust. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=11 captures this new regime effectively, while the previous 5 periods (P1-P5) and the current regime (P26-P36) suggest similar demand distributions (~95-100 mean). I will continue using recent_N (N=11) to align with the post-Period 26 shift evidence.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P26-P36) average stabilized at ~91 units per period, consistently higher than the P16-P24 regime (~55 units).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 26. Since Period 26, the average demand has been approximately 91 units per period (P26-P37), which is a significant increase from the previous regime (P16-P24 avg ~55 units) and closely resembles the initial periods of the game. Recent demand values (P31-P37: 84, 62, 58, 93, 52, 94, 62) show continued volatility but maintain this higher average level. The lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 33 order in Period 37. On-hand inventory is healthy (223), and in-transit inventory (255) includes orders from periods 34, 35, 36, and 37. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full extent of this current regime (from Period 26 to 37). Lead time L will remain at the promised/observed value of 4.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 38, the mean demand is approximately 91.5 units per period, which is significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime (~55 units). Recent demand in Period 38 was 105, and Period 36 was 94, reinforcing this higher level. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods (P34 order arrived at the end of P38). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=13 to capture the entirety of this current regime (Periods 26-38). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current volume and volatility. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1996.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 26, returning to a higher average similar to the start of the game. For the current window (P26-P39), the average demand is approximately 91.5 units per period. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. With 132 units on-hand and 290 in transit (orders from P36, P37, P38, and P39), the pipeline total is 422 units. Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At an average of ~92 units/period, the base stock targets ~460 units. Setting L=4, mu_hat with recent_N=14 to capture this sustained high-demand regime, and sigma_hat with recent_N=14 to account for the increased volatility observed since Period 25. This ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level for the current volume.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at a higher level than the previous trough, with an average demand of approximately 90 units per period (P26-P40 average is 89.3). Lead times have remained remarkably consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 65 units with 373 units in-transit. I am maintaining the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation based on the recent 'high demand' regime (since Period 26, N=15) to ensure the base stock levels are calculated against the current consumer behavior. This allows the OR backend to maintain sufficient safety stock for the ~90 unit/period demand while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 38. From Period 26 to 37, demand averaged ~91. However, the last four periods (38-41) have seen demands of 105, 112, 104, and 129, increasing the mean to ~112.5. This upward trend suggests a higher volume regime, potentially approaching early-game levels of ~115. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (28 units), but a large pipeline (388 units) exists. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the Critical Ratio is ~0.95, favoring higher stock levels. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike while maintaining safety stock against the observed increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 38: average demand increased from ~91 to ~112 units (+23%) across the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1501.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a higher-volume regime since Period 38, with the last five periods (P38-P42) averaging approximately 115.8 units. The order placed in Period 38 (51 units) arrived in Period 42, but was insufficient to meet the demand of 129 units, resulting in a stockout (ending on-hand inventory = 0). Since the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, I must ensure the base stock levels are calculated using this higher recent demand average to recover inventory and meet future demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike (105, 112, 104, 129, 129). This provides a demand forecast and safety buffer adjusted for the current ~116 units/period pace, which is significantly higher than the previous regime of ~91 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 38: average demand increased from ~91 to ~116 units (+27%) based on P38-P42.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1970.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 38. The average demand from P38 to P43 is approximately 114 units per period (105, 112, 104, 129, 129, 104), which is a notable increase from the previous regime average of ~91. On-hand inventory is critically low (6 units) following a stockout in Period 42. While 'In-transit' is 496, the lead time is consistently 4 periods. The arrivals for the next few periods are expected from orders placed in P40 (120 units), P41 (107 units), P42 (132 units), and P43 (137 units). To ensure we meet this higher sustained demand level and recover safety stock, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current high-demand regime (P38-P43). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to reflect the recent volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at 'default' (4) as arrivals have been consistent with the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38 confirmed: average demand increased to ~114 units (P38-P43), requiring higher base stock levels to prevent stockouts.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 38, with average demand increasing from ~91 to ~114 units. Over the last 7 periods (P38-P44), demand has been consistently high (105, 112, 104, 129, 129, 104, 84), averaging approximately 110 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this current high-demand state. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by consecutive arrivals (P38, P39, P40 arriving exactly 4 periods after ordering). Pipeline inventory is high (488 units in-transit against 42 on-hand), but elevated demand requires maintaining a base stock level that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5). Sigma_hat is calculated using the same recent window to capture current volatility.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards at Period 38, with average demand stabilizing around 114-116 units per period. Evaluating the most recent 8 periods (P38-P45), the mean demand is 112.5 units, which is significantly higher than the previous regime (~91 units). The lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the game (P46-P50), and a 4-period lead time, any order placed now (Period 46) will arrive in the final period (Period 50 resolution). My current on-hand inventory is low (21 units), but there is a large pipeline (457 units) arriving over the next 4 periods (scheduled arrivals from orders placed in P42, P43, P44, and P45). To avoid excessive holding costs in the final period while ensuring demand is met, I will maintain the current demand forecast of ~114 units per period. I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime starting at Period 38.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 38 remains stable, with an average demand of approximately 114 units (P38-P46 average is ~113 units). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P47-P50), our priority is to maintain sufficient stock to meet this high demand while accounting for the 4-period lead time. Current on-hand inventory is low (34 units), and we have a large pipeline of 464 units. Given the lead time is 4, an order placed now in P47 would arrive in the resolution phase of P51, which is outside the 50-period horizon. Therefore, this is the final decision period where orders might typically be considered, but since the lead time exceeds the remaining game duration, our task is to ensure the backend parameters reflect the current demand regime and lead time for any final automated adjustments. I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime since Period 38.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1849.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 38 remains stable around a high mean of approximately 113.8 units (calculated from Period 38 to 47). Lead times are consistently 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (48, 49, 50), the primary goal is to maintain enough stock to meet demand without over-ordering, as any units ordered now will arrive in Period 52 (outside the game window). However, the OR backend's logic requires a base stock level that covers (L+1) periods. Since current on-hand is 70 and in-transit is 449, total pipeline is 519. Given L=4, the base stock target for 5 periods of demand at ~114/period is roughly 570 units plus a safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this current high-demand regime (P38-P47) accurately for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the backend calculates an appropriate order to cover the remaining periods while accounting for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 38 is stable at an average of ~114 units per period (P38-P47).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 38 remains stable, with an average of approximately 114 units per period (N=11). The inventory position consists of 101 units on-hand and 430 units in-transit. Lead times are consistently 4 periods. Since Period 49 is the penultimate period (50 periods total) and current in-transit inventory already covers demand for the next 4 periods (430 units / 114 avg \u2248 3.77 periods), plus the 101 on-hand units, the system is well-stocked for the final resolution. I will continue using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to reflect the stable Period 38-48 regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a base stock that accounts for this sustained higher demand level while balancing the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1643.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 38. From Period 38 to Period 49, the average demand is approximately 107.5 units per period. The last five periods (P45-P49) show a slightly lower but consistent average of 104 units. Given this stability, I am using N=12 for mu_hat (covering the regime from P38 onward) to capture the current mean demand accurately. The actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The on-hand inventory is 86 units, and the pipeline (in-transit) is 429 units. Since the backend base stock covers L+1 (5) periods, a mu_hat based on the last 12 periods (~107.5 * 5 = 537.5) minus pipeline (429) and on-hand (86) leaves room for a small order. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to reflect the current regime's characteristics.
