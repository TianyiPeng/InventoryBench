To maintain a safety buffer and account for the fact that the first 500 units won't arrive until Period 5 (leaving 4-5 periods of demand to cover), I will place an additional order to ensure a continuous pipeline once the initial stock arrives and begins to deplete.

(c) Lead Time: The promised lead time is 4 periods. My Period 1 order (500 units) is expected to arrive during Period 1+4 = Period 5. This arrival will first be visible in the Period 6 start observation. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: Currently on-hand is 0, because the lead time hasn't elapsed. In-transit is 620 (500 from P1 + 120 from P2). I need to cover demand until the next order I place today (P4) arrives in P8. This means covering demand for P4, P5, P6, P7, and P8 (5 periods). (e) Order Logic: Total inventory needed for 5 periods @ 111/period = 555 units. I already have 620 units in-transit, which covers this target. However, since the P1 order (500) only arrives in P5, and I have 0 on-hand, I am currently out of stock and will remain so until the P5 arrival resolution.

  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained an elevated regime since roughly Period 41, with recent demand figures of 129, 129, 104, 84, and 128 (averaging ~115 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to several periods of stockouts caused by demand exceeding previous order commitments. In-transit inventory consists of: P42 (158), P43 (110), P44 (190), and P45 (130), totalling 588 units. The order from P42 is expected to arrive during Period 46 (observed P47 start), which will finally alleviate the stockout. To maintain coverage for the L+1 window (5 periods) at the current average demand (~115 * 5 = 575), plus a small safety buffer for the high variance (max 134 historically), the pipeline should target ~650-700 units. Total pipeline (OH 0 + IT 588) is 588. Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive in time to be sold (P46 order arrives P50, P47 order arrives after the game ends). Therefore, this is the final useful order. I will order 130 to ensure the final arrival in Period 50 is sufficient to meet demand and maximize terminal profit.",

Total expected inflow for the remainder of the game is 110 + 190 + 130 + 130 = 560 units. Total expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (P47-P50) at a rate of ~116/period is 464 units. Including current on-hand of 39, we have 599 units available to meet ~464 units of demand.

Therefore, new orders placed at this stage will not arrive in time to satisfy demand and will only incur potential costs or represent wasted capital without benefit. Current on-hand inventory is 48 units, and the pipeline (in-transit) contains 450 units. The scheduled arrivals are: Period 48: 190 units (from P44), Period 49: 130 units (from P45), Period 50: 130 units (from P46). This pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~120 units per period for the final three periods (Total required ~360 vs Total available 48 + 450 = 498).
