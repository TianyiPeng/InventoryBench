Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no in-transit units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the total lead time (L+1) is 5 periods, and we have 5 historical samples [118, 130, 72, 58, 121], I will use all available historical data to establish the initial baseline. The average demand is 99.8 units per period, and the standard deviation is 32.7 units. The OR backend needs parameters to cover the demand over (L+1) periods. Since we have no observation of actual lead time yet, I will use the promised lead time of 4. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% for the base stock calculation, though the OR engine also applies a safety stock cap at 95% service level. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full historical distribution provided.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 154 units based on the initial demand samples (mean ~100) and the promised lead time of 4 periods. The Period 1 conclude message shows demand was 89, but since we started with 0 on-hand inventory and the order hasn't arrived yet (expected arrival in Period 5), we sold 0 units. This is the intended behavior given the lead time. Demand history (Periods 1-5 from instructions plus the actual Period 1 observation of 89) shows a mean around 98. Since there is no evidence yet to deviate from the promised lead time or the historical demand distribution, I will use default settings to allow the OR backend to calculate base stock using all available samples and the promised lead time of 4. This will cover the lead time + current period (L+1 = 5 periods) of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For the 'chips(Regular)' SKU, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 301 units in transit (ordered in Period 1: 154, Period 2: 147). The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, we should not expect the Period 1 order to arrive until the Period 4 arrival resolution phase, making it visible at the start of Period 5. Consequently, we have had 0 sales in Periods 1 and 2 despite demand (89 and 41 units respectively), resulting in lost sales. The demand history (Period 1: 118, Period 2: 130, Period 3: 72, Period 4: 58, Period 5: 121) provided in the prompt suggests a mean demand of approximately 99.8 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this initial demand profile. For Lead Time, I will stick with the promised 'default' (4) as we have not yet reached the arrival window for any orders placed during the game.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (154 units), Period 2 (147 units), and Period 3 (80 units) are all still 'In-transit', which is consistent with the promised lead time (P1's order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in Period 6's start). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales for the first three periods. Historical demand for the first three periods was 89, 41, and 91. Including the provided pre-game samples (118, 130, 72, 58, 121), the mean demand per period is approximately 90. Since no orders have arrived yet, we have no data to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods. I will use the 'default' lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (N=8) to capture the demand variance, as the current demand pattern appears relatively stable around the mean of 90, despite the zero-inventory stockouts in the early periods.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (4 periods later: 1+4=5). Since we just read the 'Period 4 conclude' message, we have not yet seen the result of Period 5's arrivals. Therefore, no orders are officially 'overdue' yet according to the visibility rules. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because arrivals from Period 1 onwards are still in transit. Historical demand for the 5 periods provided (89, 41, 91, 95, and 121 from the prompt text) shows a mean of 87.4 and a standard deviation of 29.4. I will use the 'default' methods to allow the backend to use all 5 samples for its forecast, as no clear demand regime shift or confirmed lead-time drift is yet visible (the first arrival confirmation should appear in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order from Period 1 arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming the lead time is exactly 4 periods (as promised). Current on-hand inventory is 57 units, with 299 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Historical demand for the first 5 periods has been [89, 41, 91, 95, 97], which averages 82.6 units per period. The provided sample data [118, 130, 72, 58, 121] shows slightly higher volatility but a similar scale. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), meaning the OR backend will aim for the median demand over the lead time + current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since we have no evidence of a regime shift yet, I will use all available historical data (N=5) to stabilize the forecast, as there is significant variance in the initial samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-12.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The inventory on-hand is 108 units, and we have 209 units in-transit. Based on the conclude messages from Period 5 and 6, orders from Period 1 and 2 arrived with an actual lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time (L=4). Therefore, we expect orders from Period 3 (80 units) to arrive in Period 7, Period 4 (69 units) to arrive in Period 8, Period 5 (3 units) in Period 9, and Period 6 (57 units) in Period 10. The historical demand for periods 1-5 provided in the prompt (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) differs slightly from the game history demand observations (89, 41, 91, 95, 97, 96). Using the game history as the most reliable recent context, the demand has stabilized around ~94 units per period over the last 4 periods (P3-P6). I will use L=4 and recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this stable demand regime to ensure our pipeline is appropriately filled without over-ordering, especially since holding costs equal the profit margin ($1.00).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Demand regime stabilized near ~94 units/period (P3-P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand samples (excluding early game noise/zeros) show consistency: P3: 91, P4: 95, P5: 97, P6: 96, P7: 112. The mean of the last 5 periods (P3-P7) is 98.2. Although P7 saw a jump to 112, we need more evidence to call it a regime shift; however, a slight upward trend is noted. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 229, and on-hand is 76. Total inventory = 305. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. 5 * 98.2 = 491. Pipeline is currently below the target level to cover lead time demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand stabilized after the initial periods, and 'calculate' for L as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean stabilized at ~98 units over the last 5 periods (P3-P7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, and P4). On-hand inventory is 55 units, and 272 units are in-transit (orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). Demand has stabilized after the initial noisy start. Looking at Periods 3 through 8, the demand samples are [91, 95, 97, 96, 112, 90]. The mean of these last 6 periods is 96.83. This represents a stable regime compared to the early volatility. I will use recent_N with N=6 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand mean and variance. Since the lead time is consistently 4, I will use the default promised lead time of 4. This approach ensures the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (~484 units) while accounting for the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50%.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at ~97 units/period over last 6 periods (P3-P8). Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a stockout in Period 9 (ending inventory 0, 83 units of unmet demand) because the arrival from Period 5 was very small (3 units). Demand spiked to 141 in Period 9, but the average demand over the last 7 periods (P3-P9) is approximately 103.7 units, showing relatively stable volatility outside of the P9 spike. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and 379 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9), we must ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use the recent 7-period demand average (~103.7) to set mu_hat, which equals 518.5 for 5 periods. I'll use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean shifted slightly upward to ~104 units/period (P3-P9) following a spike in Period 9. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after two periods of stockouts (P9, P10). Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 10 (P6 order arrived in P10). Demand and Lead Time analysis: Average demand over the last 8 periods (P3-P10) is 103.25 units. There was a significant spike in P9 (141), which caused a stockout. My objective is to provide parameters that allow the OR backend to replenish stock sufficiently to cover the lead time + current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Setting L to 4 (promised/actual). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current stable demand regime while including the recent volatility. Sigma_hat will also use N=8 to reflect the increased variance from the P9 spike and ensure a high enough service level to avoid further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Stockout occurred in P9 and P10 due to demand spike in P9 (141) exceeding supply; demand mean (P3-P10) is 103.25.

We are currently recovering from stockouts in Periods 9 and 10, which were caused by a sudden demand spike in Period 9 (141) and low arrivals from earlier small orders. The current on-hand inventory is 11 units. Demand over the last 9 periods (P3-P11) averages approximately 101.5 units, though the volatility is significant due to the P9 spike. To ensure high service levels and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the 4-period lead time, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture the current demand regime (averaging ~101.5 per period, totaling 507.5 over L+1 periods). I will use sigma_hat with recent_N=9 to capture the increased variance from the P9 spike. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is currently accurate.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean stabilized at ~101.5 units/period over the last 9 periods (P3-P11). Recovering from stockouts; inventory levels are lean.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is recovering from a series of stockouts in Periods 9, 10, and 12, primarily driven by demand spikes (141 and 153 units) exceeding available levels. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods. Since Period 3, the demand mean has been approximately 106.7 units per period, but the recent Period 12 spike to 153 units suggests higher volatility or a shift. To stabilize service levels and recapture lost sales, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=10 (covering Period 3 to 12) to capture the current regime which averages ~106.7 units/period, resulting in a base stock target covering 5 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to reflect the increased volatility seen in recent spikes (P9 and P12).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in P12 (153 units), contributing to a third stockout in 4 periods. Mean demand from P3-P12 is 106.7 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently recovering from a series of stockouts (P9, P10, P12, P13) caused by a recent upward shift in demand and the consistent 4-period lead time. Demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) has averaged 122.6 units, significantly higher than the earlier ~97-100 unit regime. Specifically, P12 and P13 saw high demands of 153 and 130 respectively. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline (418 units) consists of orders from P10 (134), P11 (58), P12 (82), and P13 (144). The P10 order (134 units) is expected to arrive this period (P14), followed by a relatively small delivery in P15 (58 units). To ensure we capture the new higher demand level and build enough safety stock to prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the recent average of ~123 units per period. I am also using recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed in the last 5 periods (std dev ~26). Lead time (L) is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average increased from ~100 to ~123 units/period (+23%) over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), characterized by higher volatility and multiple stockouts.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward starting around Period 9. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P9-P14) is approximately 118.5 units, compared to the earlier average of ~94 units. There is also increased volatility (standard deviation ~23 in the recent regime). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P10 arrived in P14). The system has experienced multiple stockouts (P9, P10, P12, P13) because the OR backend was lagging behind this regime shift and higher volatility. To stabilize the service level and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high holding cost (equal to profit), I am focusing on the most recent 6-period demand window (N=6). This provides a more accurate mu_hat for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods) and captures the increased sigma_hat needed to handle the higher variance seen in Period 9 and Period 12.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 9: Average increased from ~94 to ~118.5 units/period (+26%) with increased volatility (sigma ~23).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 9. Over the last 7 periods (P9-P15), the demand has averaged approximately 112 units per period, with significant volatility (std dev approx 26). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since P9, the system has experienced multiple stockouts (P9, P10, P12, P13) because the inventory levels haven't adequately cushioned against the demand spikes. Current on-hand is low (11 units). Setting L to the promised 4 periods is accurate. For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 7 to capture the higher mean (112 * 5 = 560) of the new regime. For sigma_hat, a recent_N of 7 captures the increased volatility to increase the safety stock and prevent further stockouts in this higher-demand environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-7.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals from P1 through P12). Recent demand history shows a period of high volatility and stockouts (P9-P13), followed by a significant cooling in P14-P16 (97, 84, and 43 units respectively). Specifically, the demand of 43 in P16 is the lowest since P2. This suggests either a new low-demand regime or high volatility following the previous spike. Given the recent history of stockouts, I need to balance the risk of another spike against the high holding cost (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0 results in a critical ratio of 0.5, meaning we target the median). I will use a recent_N window for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focusing on the last 8 periods (P9-P16) to capture the higher mean and volatility seen in the 'post-spike' era while still acknowledging the recent drop. This N=8 covers the transition from high to low demand. L is set to 'default' as the promised 4 periods matches observed reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains highly volatile; P16 observed a significant drop to 43 units, the lowest since P2. Recent 8-period mean (P9-P16) is 104.6 units/period.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the high-demand regime from Periods 9-13 (~123 units) has shifted to a lower, more volatile regime. The last two periods (P16 and P17) saw demand drop significantly to 43 and 39 units respectively, marking a sharp contrast to the triple-digit demand seen earlier. Current on-hand inventory (155) and in-transit (331) are substantial compared to the recent demand volumes. To avoid excessive holding costs while still protecting against the previous high volatility, I am using a recent_N of 9 (P9-P17) to capture both the peak and the recent drop, resulting in a balanced mu_hat estimate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to let the pipeline inventory deplete naturally to match the current lower demand trend without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Significant drop in demand observed (P16: 43, P17: 39) compared to P9-P13 average of 123.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-167.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly shifted downward starting at Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 18 is 53.33 units (43, 39, 78), which is a sharp decline from the previous high-volatility regime (average ~118). Period 18 showed a slight recovery to 78, but it remains below the previous long-term averages. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (245) and substantial in-transit stock (164), and the current holding cost equaling profit ($1.0), the priority is to avoid overstocking while demand finds its new floor. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this lower demand regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect current volatility. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by recent history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Average decreased from ~118 to ~53 units/period (-55%) based on P16-P18 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-262.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is now firmly established. Demand has consistently dropped from an average of ~118 units/period (P9-P15) to approximately 53.25 units/period (P16-P19: 43, 39, 78, 43). On-hand inventory is currently high (305 units) relative to this new demand levels, largely due to late-arriving large orders placed before the shift. Pipeline inventory is low (61 units), which is appropriate given the surplus. I will continue to use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand regime (P16-P19), which will prevent over-ordering while the system burns through excess inventory. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand decreased from ~118 to ~53 units/period (-55%) confirmed over 4 periods (P16-P19 observed values: 43, 39, 78, 43).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-263.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 16. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20) is 50.8 units (43, 39, 78, 43, 51), significantly lower than the previous regime (~118 units). The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 314 units, which is approximately enough to cover 6 periods of the current average demand. With an additional 1 unit in-transit (ordered in P18), the total pipeline is 315. The OR backend's target base stock for L=4 (covering 5 periods) at mean=50.8 would be roughly 254 units + safety stock. Since current inventory (314) exceeds the required levels for the current low-demand regime, the system should naturally stop ordering. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this lower-demand state and allow inventory to bleed down, minimizing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-200.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly starting around Period 16. Over the last six periods (P16-P21), the observed demand values are 43, 39, 78, 43, 51, and 57, resulting in a mean of 51.83. This is a sustained drop compared to the previous regime (~118). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 257) are very high relative to this new demand level, as they were ordered based on the previous higher demand forecast. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. With a target base stock of (L+1)*demand_mean = 5*52 = 260, my current total position (257 + 1 = 258) is effectively at the target. No new large orders are needed until inventory depletes further. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect this lower, stable regime and prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a modest safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: Average decreased from ~118 to ~52 units/period (-56%) sustained over 6 periods (P16-P21). Lead time consistent at 4 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 16 and has remained consistently lower (average ~50 units/period) for the past 7 periods (P16-P22). Current inventory is very high (On-hand: 216) compared to this new demand level, especially since the holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit ($1.0). The system needs to burn through excess inventory. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am using recent_N for both demand (N=7 to capture the low-demand regime since P16) and lead time (N=10 to reflect the stability across the game history). This will generate a low base stock, allowing the on-hand inventory to satisfy demand while avoiding unnecessary new orders.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 23 (8 samples): 43, 39, 78, 43, 51, 57, 42, 80. The average for this period is 54.125 units with a standard deviation of approximately 15.6. This is a clear shift from the previous average of ~118. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical conclusions (P18 arrived P22). On-hand inventory (136) plus in-transit (37) equals 173 units. With the current demand average, this covers approximately 3.2 periods of demand. Since the promised lead time is 4, we need to maintain coverage for L+1 (5) periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current lower-demand regime while allowing for the recent slight uptick observed in Period 23. This helps the OR backend reset the base stock level to reflect the current lower average demand and avoid excessive holding costs from the previous high-demand regime units clearing out.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: Average decreased from ~118 to ~54 units/period based on P16-P23 data (8 samples). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 16. Analyzing demand from P16 to P24 (43, 39, 78, 43, 51, 57, 42, 80, 34), the average is approximately 51.9 units per period. The standard deviation over this same 9-period window is ~16.5. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 102 and in-transit is 119, totaling 221 units of pipeline inventory. A base stock level targeting (L+1) periods of demand would be approximately 5 * 52 = 260 units. I will use the last 9 samples (since the Period 16 changepoint) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the need to maintain enough stock for the lower demand regime while avoiding excessive holding costs given the lean profit-to-holding-cost ratio (1:1).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 16, decreasing from an average of ~118 to approximately 54 units per period. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the mean demand is 53.9 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14.8. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on historical arrivals (e.g., P18 order arrived P22). Currently, on-hand inventory is 34 units and in-transit is 158 units (orders from P22, P23, P24, and P25). To maintain optimal service levels given the lower but stable demand and high volatility, I will use a recent 10-period window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the current regime post-shift while providing enough data to account for the observed volatility (34 to 80 units). Setting L to the promised 4 periods remains appropriate as the pipeline is flowing correctly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: Average decreased from ~118 to ~54 units/period based on P16-P25 data (10 samples). Standard deviation in this new regime is approx 15 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the inventory hit 0 due to an unexpected demand spike of 106 units. The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16 from ~118 down to a mean of ~54. However, Period 26 shows that volatility remains high (standard deviation approx 23 based on recent samples). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to focus on the low-demand regime established from P16-P26 (11 samples) to set the mean forecasting, but use a slightly larger N for sigma to capture the volatility that caused the recent stockout. With 232 units in-transit and 0 on-hand, we need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The current pipeline (232) vs. expected demand (5 * 54 = 270) suggests we are slightly under-provisioned given the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Demand regime shift at Period 16 (mean ~54) continues, but high volatility remains (observed 106 in P26). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again. From Period 16-25, the average demand was approximately 54 units. However, in Periods 26 and 27, we saw a sudden spike (106 and 125 units respectively), echoing the volatility seen in Period 12-13. The system is currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) and has faced missed sales in the last two periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent spike, using a simple long-term average (recent_N with large N) will underestimate current demand. I will focus on the most recent 5 periods (P23-P27) to capture this upward movement (mean ~83 units), while acknowledging the high variance (sigma needs to be robust). Setting L to 4 as confirmed by recent history. The pipeline inventory (257) is substantial, but on-hand is zero, requiring the OR engine to maintain a higher base stock to cover (L+1) periods of this newly volatile demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike detected at Period 26: Demand increased from ~54 to ~115 average over P26-P27. Standard deviation has increased significantly in this new phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has undergone another regime shift starting at Period 26. After a period of low demand (~54 units/period from P16-P25), the last three periods have seen a significant spike with demand values of 106, 125, and 107 (averaging ~113 units). This mirrors the high-demand phase observed around Period 9. The inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 0) with a stockout occurring in P28, despite arrival of stock. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent (P24 order arrived in P28). To address the new high-demand regime and prevent further stockouts, I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the last 3 periods (N=3) which represent this new phase. Sigma_hat is also calculated based on this recent volatility (N=3) to provide a sufficient safety buffer. Lead time L is maintained at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 26: Average increased from ~54 to ~113 units/period (+109%) over P26-P28. Volatility remains high.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 26, moving from a low-demand phase (~54 units/period) back to a high-demand phase. The last four periods (P26-P29) show demands of 106, 125, 107, and 116, resulting in an average of 113.5 units/period. The system is currently in a series of stockouts due to this rapid increase, with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To address the new regime, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand mean and volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the consistent 4-period lead time observed in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Average demand increased from ~54 to ~114 units/period (based on P26-P29: 106, 125, 107, 116).

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 26, moving from a low of ~54 units/period back to a high-demand phase. The observed demand values for Period 26-30 are 106, 125, 107, 116, and 117. This confirms a new sustained average of approximately 114 units per period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P26 order arrived in P30). Currently, we are experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand inventory has been 0 since P26) because the pipeline inventory ordered during the previous low-demand regime was insufficient to cover the sudden spike. To address this and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the P26-P30 shift) to capture the higher mean. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the current volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (4 periods). This configuration will allow the OR backend to calculate a higher base stock level appropriate for the ~114 units/period regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Average demand increased from ~54 to ~114 units/period (based on P26-P30: 106, 125, 107, 116, 117). This shift caused a series of stockouts from P26-P30 due to insufficient pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward significantly starting at Period 26. The mean demand from Period 26 to Period 31 is approximately 120 units (106, 125, 107, 116, 117, 148), representing a sharp increase from the previous regime's mean of ~54. This shift has resulted in six consecutive periods (P26-P31) of stockouts because the pipeline inventory initiated during the low-demand phase was insufficient. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P27 order expected to arrive in P31 resolution, visible in P32 start; P22->P26, P23->P27, P24->P28, P25->P29, P26->P30, P27->P31). I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this new high-demand state (~120 units/period * 5 periods = 600) and increasing sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed (ranging from 106 to 148). The goal is to aggressively rebuild inventory and maintain a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean increased from ~54 to ~120 units/period (based on P26-P31: 106, 125, 107, 116, 117, 148). This has caused a prolonged stockout and requires higher base stock levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 26 is now firmly established. Over the last seven periods (P26-P32), demand values are 106, 125, 107, 116, 117, 148, and 98. This results in a mean of approximately 116.7 units per period and a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. This is a significant increase from the previous low-demand regime (~54 units). Although Period 32 saw a Slight dip to 98, the overall trend suggests a sustained high-demand level requiring structural adjustments to the base stock. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 28 order in Period 32. To stabilize inventory and prevent further stockouts, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this new regime while ignoring the previous low-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~54 to ~117 units/period based on P26-P32 data (7 samples). Standard deviation in this regime is approximately 16.5.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 26, moving from a low of ~54 units/period to a sustained higher level. Based on data from Period 26 to Period 33 (8 samples: 106, 125, 107, 116, 117, 148, 98, 114), the mean demand is approximately 116.38 units/period. The standard deviation in this current regime is roughly 15.5 units. The actual lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the most recent arrivals (Orders from P28 and P29 arrived at P32 and P33, respectively). I will use N=8 for 'recent_N' to capture this current demand regime (P26-P33) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~54 to ~116.4 units/period based on P26-P33 data (8 samples). Volatility remains moderate with sigma ~15.5.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 34 (9 samples: 106, 125, 107, 116, 117, 148, 98, 114, 122), the mean is 117.0 units per period. The standard deviation for this specific period is approximately 14.8. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the history (e.g., P30 order arriving at the end of P34). Therefore, L is set to the promised 4 periods. mu_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=9) to capture this established higher demand level (averaging ~117/period), which ensures the base stock (covering L+1 periods) is approximately 5 * 117 = 585 units. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=9) to reflect current volatility. The current pipeline (on-hand 67 + in-transit 393 = 460) is below the required base stock, so the OR backend will trigger necessary orders to replenish and maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 confirmed stable: Mean ~117 units/period, Sigma ~15 over 9 periods (P26-P34). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 26, following a significant increase. The mean demand from Period 26 to Period 35 is approximately 117.1 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 15.8. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on recent arrivals (P27-P31 orders arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 89 units, and in-transit is 408 units. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, though the OR backend's inventory cap policy provides additional protection. I will use a recent_N approach for both demand mean and volatility to capture this current regime (N=10), while keeping the lead time at its calculated average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-44.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 113.8 units/period over the last 11 periods (P26-P36). This follows a period of significant volatility and a previous low-demand regime. The standard deviation focused on the current regime (P26-P36) is approximately 22.1, reflecting both the high-demand spikes (e.g., P31: 148) and recent cooling (P36: 67). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is accurately captured by the 'calculate' method. Current on-hand inventory (111) and in-transit units (393) are healthy, totaling 504 units, which covers approximately 4.4 periods of demand at the current average. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=11) to capture the current regime's higher mean, and explicit for sigma_hat to provide a conservative buffer against the observed volatility in this phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 confirmed stable: Mean ~114 units/period, Sigma ~22 over 11 periods (P26-P36). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 114 units and a standard deviation of about 22, as observed over the last 12 periods (P26-P37). Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of orders from P28 through P33. The current on-hand inventory (98) plus in-transit (357) totals 455 units. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. A base stock target using a mean of 114 would be around 570 units. My parameters (L=4, mu_hat=recent 12, sigma_hat=recent 12) allow the OR backend to target this level. The OR backend's cap mechanism will naturally regulate the order to prevent excessive holding costs while recovering from previous stockouts.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 26, following a major upward shift. Analysis of the 13 periods in this regime (P26-P38) shows a mean demand of approximately 112 units per period (sum of P26-P38 is 1454/13 \u2248 111.8). Volatility in this period remains moderate to high, with a range between 67 and 148. The last three periods (P36, P37, P38) showed demand of 67, 95, and 108, which is slightly below the regime average but within expected variance. Currently, there is 102 units on-hand and 333 units in-transit (orders from P35, P36, P37, and P38). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P34 order arrived in P38). To maintain adequate service levels while avoiding excessive holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will set the demand forecast based on the last 13 periods (recent_N with N=13). This captures the current regime's average and variance accurately for the OR backend's base-stock calculation.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) starting at Period 26 is stable with a mean of approximately 113.6 units/period and a standard deviation of ~19.5 (calculated over P26-P39). Recent demand (P36-P39) has been 67, 95, 108, 126, showing a slight recovering trend but remaining within the expected volatility range. The on-hand inventory (101) plus pipeline inventory (316) is 417 units. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 * 113.6 = 568 units. Our current inventory position (417) is below this target, primarily because the OR engine's 'cap' mechanism likely limited orders during the transition. I will continue using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (P26-P39) to anchor the backend to the current regime while capturing the actual observed volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has remained relatively stable with a mean of approximately 113.3 units/period (based on P26-P40) and moderate volatility. Historical lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current 'On-hand' is 51, and 'In-transit' is 374 (consisting of orders from P37: 46, P38: 88, P39: 108, and P40: 132). The next arrival in Period 41 resolution will be the 46 units from Period 37. To maintain a consistent service level and account for the (L+1)=5 period horizon, I will use recent_N for both demand mean and sigma based on the current regime starting at P26 (N=15). This ensures the OR backend captures the current stable but higher-than-previous demand level while managing holding costs effectively.

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized since Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 41 (16 samples), the mean is approximately 108.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 19.8. Recent demand in Period 41 was lower (78), but the overall regime remains much higher than the low-demand period (P16-P25). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P37 order arrived in P41). Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 457, and on-hand is 19. My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (1+L) at a high service level since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), leading to a critical ratio of 0.5 (though the OR backend targets the optimal q). I will use N=16 for the current regime starting at P26 to stabilize parameters after the recent fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 confirmed stable over 16 periods: Mean ~108 units/period, Sigma ~20. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 26 remains stable. Analyzing the last 17 periods (P26-P42), the mean demand is approximately 107.5 units with a standard deviation of roughly 21 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by recent 'conclude' messages (P38 order arrived in P42). On-hand inventory is currently low (12 units), while the pipeline is substantial (437 units). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 captures this stable regime effectively. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), balancing the high holding cost (equal to profit) with the need to avoid the stockouts observed in the P26-P31 window.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 26, following a major shift. Over the last 18 periods (P26-P43), the mean demand is approximately 107.5 units per period with a standard deviation of about 21.3. Recent demand (P41-P43) has shown some downward fluctuation (78, 95, 63), but given the historical volatility (e.g., P31 demand of 148), a conservative approach focusing on the established post-P26 regime is best. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 40-43. On-hand inventory is 57, and pipeline (In-transit) is 420. The current pipeline is healthy, but we must maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 to capture the full scope of the current stable high-demand regime, ensuring enough inventory to meet demand peaks while acknowledging the high holding cost relative to profit (1:1 ratio, implying a 50% service level target in the base stock formula).

The mean demand for the last 19 periods (P26-P44) is approximately 104 units. To avoid overreacting to the two most recent low demand points while acknowledging the downward trend in the rolling average, I will use recent_N with N=19 to capture the entirety of the current stable regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory of 129 units and pipeline of 338 units are healthy, so no aggressive ordering is required to prevent stockouts at this stage.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a stable regime since Period 26, characterized by a mean of approximately 108 units and a standard deviation of 20 (based on the observation over 16+ periods as of Period 42). Recent demand data (P41: 78, P42: 95, P43: 63, P44: 60, P45: 130) shows continued fluctuation around this mean. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P41 order arriving in P45). With on-hand inventory at 128 and 257 units in-transit (P42-P45 orders), the pipeline is healthy. I will continue to use the stable regime starting from P26 (N=20 samples) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects both the current mean (~105-110) and the observed volatility to maintain the service level while managing holding costs.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a stable regime since Period 26, following a significant upward shift. Analyzing the last 21 periods (P26-P46), the mean demand is approximately 106.8 units per period with a standard deviation of about 21.6. In the most recent 10 periods (P37-P46), the mean has been 93.9 units, reflecting some recent lower-demand observations (63, 60, 97) mixed with higher values (130, 124). For the final stages of the game (ending at Period 50), I need to ensure sufficient stock to meet this average demand while accounting for the 4-period lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 99 and in-transit is 326. The in-transit inventory consists of orders from P43 (91), P44 (50), P45 (48), and P46 (137). Since we are at P47 and the game ends at P50, orders placed now (P47) will arrive in P51 (after the game ends). Therefore, the L parameter and the mu_hat/sigma_hat parameters for this specific period primarily serve to satisfy the OR backend's logic, but the actual 'final order' will be determined by the base stock relative to the pipeline. I will use the established regime mean (since P26) to maintain a consistent service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 26, following a significant increase. Analysis of the the last 22 periods (P26-P47) shows a mean demand of approximately 106.8 units per period. Recently (P42-P47), demand has shown some volatility (95, 63, 60, 130, 97, 122), but maintains the overall regime average. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50), I need to ensure sufficient inventory to cover the remaining demand while avoiding excessive holding costs at the end. Current on-hand is 68, and in-transit is 330 units (representing orders from P44-P47). The total pipeline plus on-hand (398 units) already covers roughly 3.7 periods of demand at the current mean. L is set to 4 (default), and I will use the established regime mean (~107) and sigma (~22) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method (N=22) to ensure the OR backend has the most accurate long-term regime stats.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has remained stable with a mean of approximately 106 units/period (calculated from P26 to P48: total 2445 units over 23 periods). The lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods throughout the game history. In Period 49, we are at the penultimate decision phase (Period 50 is the final period). The current 'In-transit' inventory is 407 units, which includes orders from P45 (48 units), P46 (137 units), P47 (95 units), and P48 (127 units). These orders are scheduled to arrive in periods 49, 50, 51, and 52 respectively. However, the game ends at Period 50. Inventory arriving in Period 51 and 52 will not contribute to sales or profit. With 'On-hand' at 38 and an arrival of 48 units expected this period (from P45), we will have 86 units to satisfy P49 demand. The order from P46 (137 units) will arrive in Period 50. Combined, this pipeline is sufficient to cover demand for the final two periods without incurring excessive holding costs for units that arrive after the game ends. I will maintain L at 4, set mu_hat using the stable regime from P26 (N=23), and use recent standard deviation for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend's base stock calculation remains aligned with current requirements, while the 'In-transit' level already significantly exceeds remaining demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 26, with a mean demand of approximately 108 units and a standard deviation of 20 units. Period 49 saw a slight stockout (demand 119 vs available 86), resulting in 0 on-hand inventory leading into Period 50. The in-transit inventory is 433 units, which includes orders from Periods 46 (137), 47 (95), 48 (127), and 49 (74). These are expected to arrive in Periods 50, 51, 52, and 53 respectively. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since this is the final decision period (Period 50), the goal is to set parameters that provide adequate coverage for the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 5), while noting that the back end capped policy will limit the final order size based on the observed mean and variance.
