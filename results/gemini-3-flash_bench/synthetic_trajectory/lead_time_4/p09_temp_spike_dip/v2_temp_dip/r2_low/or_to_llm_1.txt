However, this arrival will only be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 521. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging ~110 units (P1:114, P2:117, P3:103, P4:106, P5:121). The OR recommendation is only 1 unit because it sees a massive pipeline (521) relative to its calculated base-stock. However, we must ensure we don't stock out while waiting for arrivals. The P1 order (154) should arrive in this period's resolution. If it does, we have enough for roughly 1.5 periods. If it is delayed or lost, we are at risk. Given lead time is 4, we are ordering for Period 9. Total pipeline (521) covers nearly 5 periods of demand (~500 units).

The OR recommendation of 115 is calculated using a broader historical mean which likely overestimates current needs due to high demand early in the game.

Therefore, the pipeline (On-hand + In-transit) of 328 units must cover demand for the current period (P37) plus the lead time (P38-P41), totaling 5 periods of demand. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has stabilized after the P28 reversal. For the last 10 periods (P27-P36), mean demand is 85.3 units.

Confirmation will appear in Period 47.\n2. **Inventory Analysis**: Current on-hand is 17. In-transit pipeline consists of orders from Periods 42, 43, 44, and 45 (60, 110, 110, 120 units respectively). Total pipeline: 400. Total inventory + pipeline = 417.\n3. **Demand & OR Analysis**: Recent demand (Periods 39-45) averages ~113 units per period. The OR recommendation of 26 units is extremely low because it is capped and likely penalizing for a large pipeline (400 units). However, the system is currently stock-out sensitive; we have 17 units on-hand and 60 arriving this period (available for the next decision). Demand in Period 46 will likely consume current stock + arrival, leaving a very low starting point for Period 47.\n4. **Strategy**: With only 5 periods remaining (46-50), we must avoid over-ordering which results in significant holding costs at game-end. However, we need to cover the final periods. Given the 4-period lead time, an order placed today (P46) arrives in P50. Orders for P47-50 will not arrive. Thus, P46 is the LAST order that will arrive. \n5. **Calculation**: Expected demand for periods 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 (5 periods) is approximately 5 * 113 = 565 units. Total stock + pipeline is 417. Shortfall to cover until P50 is 148 units. I will order 130 units to ensure we satisfy demand while mitigating the risk of ending with high inventory, especially since standard holding costs ($1) equal the profit per unit.",

Any order placed now in Period 47 would arrive in the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 51 (47 + 4 = 51). Because the game concludes at the end of Period 50, an order placed now will never arrive within the playable timeframe and would only incur costs without the possibility of being sold. Our current in-transit inventory of 470 units consists of orders from Periods 43 (110 units), 44 (110 units), 45 (120 units), and 46 (130 units). These are expected to arrive in Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50 respectively, which is sufficient to cover the remaining demand (averaging ~115-120 units/period).

This confirms the regime shift noted in Period 43. \n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand inventory is 9 units. The in-transit pipeline of 360 units consists of orders from P44 (110), P45 (120), and P46 (130). Note that the P44 order (110 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P48), and the game ends at P50. \n4. **End-of-Game Strategy**: Since we are at Period 48 and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game end date (Period 50). Therefore, ordering more units now is useless as they will never arrive to satisfy demand or generate profit, but would technically be considered in-transit or potentially incur costs in a real scenario. However, in this mechanic, the primary goal is to satisfy remaining demand with existing pipeline. \n5. **Adjustment**: The OR recommendation of 78 units does not account for the fact that the game ends in 2 periods. I am overriding the OR recommendation to 0 because any new order will arrive too late.",

Periodic demand has stabilized at ~118 units since Period 39. Period 49 is the second to last period (t=49 of 50). My decision for Period 49 must account for demand in Period 49 and Period 50. Since the game concludes after Period 50, any order placed now (Period 49) with a 4-period lead time would arrive in Period 53, which is outside the simulation window. Therefore, the order quantity for Period 49 should be 0, as it will never arrive to provide value.
