Currently, there are 452 units in transit (P8: 119, P9: 87, P10: 136, P11: 110). 2. **Inventory Status**: On-hand inventory is critically low (6 units). However, the P8 order of 119 units arrives this period, meaning ~125 units will be available to meet P12's demand. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand from P5 to P11 is approx. 103 units/period (total 725 over 7 periods). There was a spike in P9 (141) followed by more standard levels (100, 89). 4. **OR Recommendation Reconcile**: The OR recommendation is 72 units. The OR's base-stock calculation considers the 5-period window (L+1). Total pipeline (including arriving today) + On-hand = 458 units. Estimated demand for 5 periods is ~515 (using mean ~103). The OR is likely capping its order because the pipeline is relatively full compared to its calculated base stock. 5. **Adjustment**: Given the P5 shipment was lost (95 units never arrived), we suffered stockouts in P9 and P10.

Historical demand since the shift (P25-P28) is 68, 106, 125, and 107 (average ~101). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts in P27 and P28. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods. The pipeline (In-transit) consists of 370 units: Period 25 (10), Period 26 (80), Period 27 (139), and Period 28 (141). Following the execution sequence, the P25 order (10 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 29, and the P26 order (80 units) in Period 30. Therefore, projected inventory for the next two periods is very low (10 units for P29 demand, 80 units for P30 demand), ensuring continued stockouts. To protect against future demand during the lead-time window (P29-P33), we need to cover roughly 5 periods of demand (~500 units). Total current inventory (On-hand 0 + Pipeline 370) = 370.

The total units available to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) is 158 + 342 = 500 units. If demand averages 100, we need 500 units. If it averages 90, we need 450.

The 'high regime' shift identified in P32 (avg ~123) seems to have cooled slightly or became more volatile, but remains significant compared to the P21 low. \n4. **Upcoming Arrivals**: The P42 order (85 units) arrives in P46, and P43 (95 units) arrives in P47. \n5. **OR Recommendation Evaluation**: The OR recommendation is 134 units. However, looking at the game end (P50), we only have 4 periods remaining. Any order placed now (P46) arrives at the start of P50 (lead time 4). This will be the FINAL order to arrive before the game ends. \n6. **Strategy**: We need to cover demand for P46, P47, P48, P49, and P50. Total demand expected (5 periods * ~100 avg) = 500 units. Total inventory available (On-hand 114 + Pipeline 273) = 387 units. To reach 500 units by P50, we need approx 113 more units. Given the game ends at P50, ordering too much leads to high ending inventory (holding costs) while ordering too little leads to lost profit.

Based on a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, the P44 order (51) will arrive during P48, P45 (42) during P49, and P46 (120) during P50. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been volatile but averages around 100 units (last 5 periods: 63, 60, 130, 97, 122; avg=94.4). The total available inventory to cover the remaining periods (P48, P49, P50) is 75 (on-hand) + 51 (arriving P48) + 42 (arriving P49) + 120 (arriving P50) = 288 units. Total expected demand for P48-P50 is approximately 100 * 3 = 300 units. Strategy: As the simulation ends at P50, and any order placed now (P48) with a 4-period lead time would not arrive until P52 (beyond the game's horizon), placing an order provides no benefit but would likely incur unnecessary holding costs or represent wasted capital if the game evaluates final stock.

Because the lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods (as noted in the carry-over insights and historical arrival data), any order placed in Period 49 will not arrive until Period 53 (49 + 4 = 53). Since the game ends at Period 50, an order placed now will incur costs if it relates to any long-term obligation, but more importantly, it will not arrive in time to satisfy demand for the final two periods (Period 49 and Period 50). Looking at the inventory state: we have 46 units on-hand. In-transit arrivals for Period 49 (ordered P45) and Period 50 (ordered P46) are expected to be 42 and 120 units respectively, based on the history. Specifically: Period 49 arrival resolution will bring the Period 45 order (42 units); Period 50 arrival resolution will bring the Period 46 order (120 units). These arrivals, combined with the current 46 on-hand, are sufficient to cover demand for the remaining two periods without additional orders. Most importantly, an order placed today (Period 49) simply cannot arrive before the game ends. Therefore, the optimal action is to order 0 units to avoid unnecessary ending inventory or costs for arrivals that occur after the horizon.",

Current inventory setup is: On-hand: 0, In-transit: 120 (consisting of 120 units ordered at Period 46, expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 50). Since Period 50 is the final period, any inventory on-hand after Period 50 arrivals will be used to satisfy Period 50 demand. However, any 'order' placed now (at the start of Period 50) will arrive in Period 54 (due to the 4-period lead time), which is outside the game's horizon. Therefore, ordering any units now would incur no benefit (as they won't arrive in time to be sold) and could potentially complicate the final state if the simulation accounts for terminal pipeline costs, although the primary reason is that they simply arrive too late. Looking at the history, the 120 units ordered in Period 46 are due to arrive now (P46 + 4 = P50). Period 50 demand is expected to be around the current mean of ~115-120 units.
