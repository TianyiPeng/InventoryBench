Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available (118, 130, 72, 58, 121), yielding an average demand of 99.8 units per period and a standard deviation of 32.8. Since lead time L=4, the review+lead period covers 5 periods (1+L). Currently, there is zero inventory (on-hand and in-transit), so we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the mean and standard deviation of all historical samples to set the parameters, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the expected demand over the next 5 periods with an appropriate safety buffer based on the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio (approx 80% service level).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 154 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, these units have not arrived yet (arrived=0). Demand in Period 1 was 89, but since starting inventory was 0, we sold 0 units. The 154 units are currently 'In-transit'. I will stick with the promised lead time (L=4) for now as there is no historical evidence yet to suggest otherwise. For demand estimation, the historical samples provided (P1-P5: 118, 130, 72, 58, 121) show a mean of ~100. However, the actual observed demand in Period 1 was 89. Given the low number of observations and the fact that we have a pool of historical data, I will use 'default' methods to allow the backend to use all available historical sample data to establish a baseline mean and variance.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For the 'chips(Regular)' SKU, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 301 units in transit (ordered in P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Based on the sequence of events, the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4), meaning the first arrival will be visible at the start of Period 6. The demand for the first 5 samples provided is 118, 130, 72, 58, and 121 (Mean ~100). However, game history for Period 1 and 2 shows demand of 89 and 41 respectively, which is lower than the initial samples. Since we have zero inventory on hand and are waiting for the lead time to elapse, we must maintain a base stock that covers the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the 'default' lead time of 4 and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent patterns while we wait for the pipeline to start arriving.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1-3 have not arrived yet, which is expected based on the definition of lead time (P1 order should arrive in Period 5). There is zero on-hand inventory, leading to lost sales for the first three periods. Demand has been fluctuating (89, 41, 91), with an average around 74 units. Given we are at the beginning and have 428 units in-transit (P1-P3 orders total 428), we need to ensure our base stock level covers the lead time + 1 period (5 periods total). I will use the default method for lead time as there is no evidence of deviation yet. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use all available samples to stabilize the forecast, as 3 periods is the minimum window for recent_N and the overall mean is currently the most representative signal.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 5's arrival phase and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Therefore, it is normal that 'arrived=0' has been reported for Periods 1-4. The cumulative in-transit inventory is 510 units (154+147+127+82). Demand for the first 5 periods has been 118, 130, 72, 58, 121 (average = 99.8). The history provided in 'Game History' for demand (89, 41, 91, 95) seems to differ slightly from 'Historical Demand Data' (118, 130, 72, 58, 121); I will prioritize the 'Historical Demand Data' for the forecast as it typically represents the full ground truth. Using the 5-period average (~100) and the promised lead time L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (~500 units). Since in-transit is 510 and on-hand is 0, we are roughly at the target level. I will use 'default' lead time and 'recent_N' for demand to stabilize the forecast using all available data points (N=5).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, Period 1's order arrived exactly at the start of Period 5 (after 4 periods), confirming the promised lead time (L=4) holds for now. Our first arrival occurred in Period 5, satisfying 97 units of demand and leaving us with 57 units on-hand. In-transit inventory is 356 (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4). Historical demand samples are 118, 130, 72, 58, 121 (avg ~100) and game history demands are 89, 41, 91, 95, 97 (avg ~83). Combining these 10 data points, the mean demand is 91.2 with a standard deviation of 25.5. I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (N=10) to establish a stable baseline while we have limited data. mu_hat should cover (1+L) periods, roughly 91.2 * 5 = 456. sigma_hat will cover sqrt(5) * 25.5 \u2248 57. The backend will calculate these based on the samples provided.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being met (Order 1 arrived in Period 5, Order 2 arrived in Period 6). Demand for the first five historical samples was [118, 130, 72, 58, 121], but the actual realized demand in the game history (Periods 1-6) is [89, 41, 91, 95, 97, 96]. These values fluctuate but seem to be averaging around 85-95 lately. The current on-hand inventory is 108, and in-transit is 306 (orders from Periods 3, 4, and 6). Because the lead time is stable at 4, I will use lead time L=4. For demand, the last 4 periods (P3-P6) show relative stability (91, 95, 97, 96), so I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This should help the OR engine set a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $325.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from Periods 5, 6, and 7 confirm that the actual lead time is indeed 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand has shown a slight upward trend in recent periods (P1-5 avg: ~83; P6-7 avg: ~104). To capture this recent increase without overreacting to noise, I am using a recent_N approach for demand estimation. For L, since the observations match the promise perfectly, 'default' is appropriate. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use N=5 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime which seems to be hovering around 100 units per period. Pipeline inventory (244) plus current on-hand (123) equals 367, which covers over 3 periods of demand at the current rate; however, since L=4, we must continue ordering to maintain the base stock for the (L+1) horizon (500-600 units total).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods based on first three arrivals (P1, P2, P3). Demand appears to have shifted from an initial average of ~80 to ~100 over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $245.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a clear shift. The first four periods had an average demand of 79 units, while the subsequent four periods (P5-P8) show a sustained and higher average of 98.75 units. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime. The confirmed lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as seen in all four concluded shipments from P1 to P4 arriving in P5 to P8 respectively), matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently healthy with 115 on-hand and 274 in-transit (orders from P6, P7, and P8), which covers the pipeline for the 4-period lead time window. Using recent_N=4 ensures the OR backend targets the 98.75 mean instead of the all-history mean (~88.7) which would under-order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 5: Average demand increased from 79 (P1-P4) to ~99 (P5-P8), a ~25% increase.

Daily Profit: $460.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, demand spiked to 141 units, depleting all 115 units of on-hand inventory and resulting in stockouts. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed for previous orders (P1-P4). Although no units arrived in Period 9, none were expected as no order was placed in Period 5. The pipeline inventory (389 units) contains orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9, which are expected to arrive in P10, P11, P12, and P13 respectively. Regarding demand, we previously identified a regime shift at Period 5. Including the recent Period 9 outlier (141), the average demand from Period 5 to Period 9 is 107.2 units (97, 96, 112, 90, 141), compared to the earlier average of 79. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this higher mean and recent volatility. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' as it aligns with the promised 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 samples ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand level and helps recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Potential second demand shift or high volatility detected; Period 9 demand (141) is a significant outlier (40% above the previous regime mean of 99). Stockout occurred in Period 9.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Period 10 demand was 100, following a high of 141 in Period 9. The demand regime from Periods 5-10 averages 106 units, compared to the initial average of 79. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6). Note that no order was placed in Period 5, which explains why no arrival was recorded in Period 9 conclude. The current in-transit (434 units) consists of orders from P7 (65), P8 (112), P9 (115), and P10 (142). Orders from P7 are expected to arrive during P11 resolution. To stabilize inventory against recent volatility (std dev ~18 in the current regime) and the recent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the higher demand mean (avg ~106) and increased variance since Period 5. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for approximately 530 units of demand plus a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~106 units/period (Periods 5-10). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (ending on-hand: 0 for three consecutive periods). Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, and P7 arrivals were all exactly 4 periods). However, the order placed in Period 5 (which should have arrived in Period 9) is missing, suggesting a lost shipment. Demand analysis: Periods 1-4 averaged 79. Since Period 5, demand has shifted higher, averaging ~104 units (Periods 5-11). To recover from recent stockouts and compensate for the lost P5 shipment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (the current demand regime) to ensure the base stock is calculated against the higher consumption rate. I will maintain the lead time at the promised 4 periods as there is no evidence of a drift, only a single lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Order placed in Period 5 is confirmed lost (promised lead time 4, now at Period 12 with no arrival). Current demand regime (P5-P11) average is 103.6 units, up from P1-P4 average of 79.

Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we confirm that the order placed in Period 5 is lost (it's been 7 periods). The order from Period 8 arrived exactly on the promised lead time of 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because we stock out frequently. Demand in Period 12 was high (153), confirming the upward trend. The average demand from Period 5 to 12 (the current regime) is approximately 109.75 units. Since we are dealing with high demand volatility and a lost shipment in the recent history, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this higher demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the (L+1) period demand of approximately 110 * 5 = 550 units. Pipeline inventory is currently 441, but this includes the lost Period 5 order. However, the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation is based on 'In-transit', which is 441. Since the OR backend cannot 'see' the lost order, I will use L=explicit with a value of 4 to maintain the timing and allow the OR backend to calculate the capped order based on the 441 in-transit units. Note that the OR engine will likely order a larger amount to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 5-12 stabilized at an average of ~110 units (up from ~79 initially). High volatility remains present with spikes up to 153. One shipment (Period 5) is confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are experiencing persistent stockouts. The inventory at the start of Period 13 was 115 units, but demand was 130, resulting in 0 ending on-hand inventory. The shipment from Period 5 is confirmed lost. Since Period 5, a new demand regime has emerged (P5-P13), with an average demand of approximately 112 units per period, compared to the initial 79 units (P1-P4). The variance has also increased significantly, with peaks reaching 153. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=9 (covering the current regime from Period 5 to 13) to capture the higher mean demand. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=9 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the increased volatility. The lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods for all successfully delivered shipments. These parameters aim to increase the base stock level to prevent further lost sales in this higher-demand/higher-variance environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 5 to Period 13 has stabilized at a higher average of ~112 units (up from ~79) with increased volatility (peaks >150).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 5. For Periods 5-14 (10 samples), the mean demand is 110.5 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. Current inventory status: On-hand is 45 units, and In-transit is 463 units. Note that the order from Period 5 is definitively lost. Recent demand remains volatile (ranging from 89 to 153). I am using recent_N (N=10) to capture this higher demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate for all delivered shipments (P1-P4, P6-P10 arrivals all arrived in 4 periods), so I am using the 'default' method for L. The combination of N=10 and the OR backend's service level logic should provide a buffer against the observed volatility while accounting for the lost Period 5 shipment which is no longer in the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $243.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed a lead time of 4 periods for the shipment ordered in Period 11. The order from Period 5 remains lost. The demand regime from Period 5 through Period 15 has stabilized at a higher level compared to the initial periods. Calculating the mean from Period 5 to 15 (N=11) gives an average demand of approximately 108 units ((97+96+112+90+141+100+89+153+130+97+84)/11 = 108.1), whereas the first 4 periods averaged ~79 units. Volatility is also higher in this current regime. To ensure sufficient stock over the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 11 samples (N=11) to capture this sustained higher demand level. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods, which is consistent with the most recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 5-15 stabilized at ~108 units (up from ~79 initially). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods despite the single lost shipment from Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe that the actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P12 order arrived in P16). The shipment from P5 is confirmed lost. Demand has shown high volatility recently: after a period of elevated demand (averaging ~110 from P5-P13), the last two periods have seen a significant drop (P15: 84, P16: 43), with P16 being the lowest since P2. This suggests a potential downward regime shift or a mean-reverting correction from the previous high period. Given the service level target (Profit $4 / (4+1) = 0.8), we need to maintain sufficient inventory while accounting for this recent drop to avoid excessive holding costs. Using the last 12 periods (P5-P16) provides a balanced view of the 'high' regime and the recent downturn (N=12). This captures the mean of ~103 units while incorporating the increased variance (sigma). L is set to default as the promised 4 periods aligns with observed performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly in P16 (43 units), marking a sharp drop from the P5-P15 average of 108 units. Monitoring for a sustained downward shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-57.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following a confirmed demand regime shift around Period 5 (average ~108), the last two periods (P16 and P17) have shown a significant drop in demand to 43 and 39 units respectively. While not yet a 3-period trend required for a 'Carry-over Insight' update, this sharp decline suggests a potential seasonal drop or regime shift. Our current inventory position (On-hand: 213, In-transit: 316) is quite high relative to this new demand level. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level against the previous higher mean, I am shifting to a recent_N (N=6) approach for mu_hat. This captures the recent downward trend (P12-P17 avg approx 91) more effectively than the long-term average. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, despite the single loss back in Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe a significant downward shift in demand starting from Period 16. The average demand for the most recent three periods (P16-P18) is ~53 units, compared to the previous regime (P5-P15) of ~108 units. This reflects a ~50% drop. Current on-hand inventory is high at 264 units, and with the reduced demand, the existing pipeline is sufficient. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals in P17 and P18 for orders from P13 and P14). To avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this new lower regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=3) to account for the current volatility profile. This will allow the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level lower, likely resulting in zero or very small orders until inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand decreased from ~108 to ~53 (-51%) based on the last 3 periods (P16: 43, P17: 39, P18: 78).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-137.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted downward starting from Period 16. Analyzing the most recent period (P19 demand = 43) alongside previous periods (P18: 78, P17: 39, P16: 43), the average demand for this new regime (N=4) is approximately 50.75 units, a significant drop from the prior regime (~108 units). Current on-hand inventory (309) and in-transit (112) total 421 units, which is extremely high given the new demand forecast (covering approximately 8 periods). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further buildup of excess inventory and minimize holding costs while the backend policy naturally restricts ordering, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered mean and volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand decreased from ~108 to ~51 (-53%) based on P16-P19 data. Inventory levels are substantially high relative to current demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-126.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand dropped from ~108 units (P5-P15) to approximately 55 units (P16-P20). Specifically, the last 5 samples are 43, 39, 78, 43, and 51, yielding a mean of 50.8 units. Current on-hand inventory is 330 units, with 40 units in transit (ordered P17, expected P21). Given the current demand average of ~51, the total inventory (370 units) covers approximately 7.25 periods of demand, which exceeds the required base stock for a 4-period lead time. To manage holding costs and allow inventory to burn down toward the new lower equilibrium, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the lower demand regime and adjust the lead time parameter back to the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed at Period 16: average demand decreased from ~108 to ~51 (-53%) based on P16-P20 data. Holding costs are currently high due to over-stocking during the transition.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-72.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 16. The average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P16-P21) is approximately 52 units (43, 39, 78, 43, 51, 57), compared to the previous regime's average of ~108. Current on-hand inventory is 300 units, which covers nearly 6 periods of demand at the current rate. The in-transit inventory is minimal (13 units from Period 18). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My objective is to reduce the high holding cost by allowing inventory to bleed down while maintaining a service level based on the new, lower demand mean and variance. I set N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower regime (P16-P21) and L to default (4). The backend's base-stock logic will correctly order 0 units until on-hand + in-transit drops below the calculated base-stock level.

The demand regime for chips(Regular) has sustained a significant downward shift since Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 22 is approximately 50.7 units (43, 39, 78, 43, 51, 57, 42), down from the previous regime's average of ~108. At the start of Period 23, the on-hand inventory is 271 units, and there are 0 units in-transit (all previous orders up to Period 18 have arrived, and no orders were placed in Periods 19-22). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Based on the current average of ~51 units/period, the expected demand for 5 periods is ~255 units. Since on-hand inventory (271) already exceeds this coverage requirement, no new orders should be triggered. The OR backend will naturally calculate a base stock lower than the pipeline inventory, resulting in a zero order. I will use recent_N=7 to capture the new low-demand regime and maintain L at the promised value of 4, as lead times have been consistent.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 23 (8 samples): 43, 39, 78, 43, 51, 57, 42, 80. The average demand for this period is 54.125 units with a standard deviation of 15.6. The current on-hand inventory is 191 units, which is extremely high (covering roughly 3.5 periods of the current average demand). In-transit inventory is 7 units from an order placed in Period 23. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory and the low demand, the OR backend's capped policy will naturally reduce or zero-out orders to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current lower demand regime exactly. L remains at the promised default of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed at Period 16: average demand decreased from ~108 to ~54 (-50%) based on P16-P23 data. High inventory levels (191 units) persist, resulting in significant holding costs.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift at Period 16 is well-established. From P16 to P24, the average demand is 52.2 units (43, 39, 78, 43, 51, 57, 42, 80, 34). This is a significant decrease from the prior regime (~108 units/period). On-hand inventory is currently very high (157 units) compared to this new demand level, and there are 89 units in transit. The goal remains to reduce existing stock to minimize holding costs while the backend policy naturally tapers ordering. I will use the last 9 periods (the length of the current regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the promised lead time of 4 as the actual lead time has consistently returned to 4 (despite the P5 loss and recent zero-arrival periods which align with zero-orders placed in P19-P22).

Daily Reward (R_t): $183.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 25 (10 samples), the mean demand is 53.8 units per period, compared to the previous regime's average of ~108. The current observation for Period 26 shows an on-hand inventory of 89 units and in-transit inventory of 134 units. The in-transit total includes orders from Period 23 (7), Period 24 (82), and Period 25 (45). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, these are expected to arrive in Periods 27, 28, and 29 respectively. The pipeline inventory (89 on-hand + 134 in-transit = 223) is quite high relative to the current demand mean of ~54. To reduce holding costs while maintaining a service level for the lower demand regime, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (covering the low-demand regime P16-P25). L will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the historically stable lead time of 4 periods (excluding the single lost shipment from Period 5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 16. In the last 11 periods (P16-P26), the mean demand is approximately 58.3. However, there has been a recent uptick in demand over the last 4 periods (P23: 80, P24: 34, P25: 68, P26: 106), averaging ~72. Period 26 resulted in a stockout (on-hand is 0). Although on-hand inventory is 0, there are 210 units in-transit (ordered in P23, P24, P25, P26). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the promised lead time of 4, orders from P22 should have arrived (but P22 order was 0), and the P23 order (7 units) is expected to arrive during P27. Since the pipeline (210) is meant to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, and the current regime mean is ~58-72, the pipeline is relatively healthy but must be monitored for the recent demand increase. I will use recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the low-demand regime since P16 while accounting for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand uptick detected (P23-P26 average ~72 vs P16-P22 average ~50), though still significantly lower than the P5-P15 regime (~108). Stockout occurred in P26 due to depleted safety stock from the high-inventory period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is emerging from a stockout phase caused by a significant demand uptick that followed a period of deliberate inventory reduction. Demand has risen from an average of ~51 (P16-P22) to ~106 in P26 and 125 in P27, suggesting a new higher-demand regime similar to the P5-P15 period (~108). Inventory is currently 0, with 298 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the target service level is 80%. I will use the last 5 periods (P23-P27) to estimate the mean demand, capturing the recent upward trend (~83 units/period). This results in a mu_hat (L+1) of 415. Setting sigma_hat to the standard deviation of this same period (approximately 35 per period, scaled by sqrt(5)) allows the OR backend to build a safety stock buffer to prevent further stockouts while awaiting the arrival of in-transit orders.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime detected starting Period 23: average demand has increased to approximately 83 units/period (P23-P27), up from the previous low-regime average of 51.

Daily Reward (R_t): $328.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a new demand regime that started around Period 23. Average demand from Period 23 to Period 28 is approximately 86.7 units (80, 34, 68, 106, 125, 107), which is a significant increase from the low-demand regime of ~51 observed in Periods 16-22. The system has experienced stockouts for the last three periods (P26-P28) because on-hand inventory was depleted while waiting for orders placed after the long pause (P19-P22). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P23 order arrived in P27, P24 order arrived in P28). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this new higher-demand regime (P23-P28) while avoiding the influence of the previous low-demand period. This ensures the OR backend raises the base stock level to satisfy the increased demand and mitigate stockout risks.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime starting Period 23: Average demand increased to ~87 units/period (P23-P28), up from ~51 in the previous regime. Volatility has also increased with peaks reaching 125 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 23. From P16-P22, average demand was ~51. Since P23, the average has increased to approximately 91 units/period (P23-P29: 80, 34, 68, 106, 125, 107, 116). Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced consecutive stockouts because arrivals (based on orders from the low-demand regime P23-P25) values of 7, 82, and 45 units are insufficient to meet the new demand level. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime (P23-P29). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite one historical loss at P5. The backend will use these parameters to raise the base stock level, aiming to stop the current stockout streak while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 23: Average demand increased to ~91 units/period (P23-P29), up from ~51 in the previous regime. Increased volatility and consecutive stockouts observed as old orders (low volume) arrive into a high-demand environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again in Period 23, increasing from approximately 51 units/period (P16-P22) to a new mean of approximately 93 units/period (P23-P30). Recent demand has shown significant volatility with peaks reaching 125 units (P27) and remaining consistently above 100 in the last four periods (125, 107, 116, 117). A stockout occurred in Period 30 because the arrival (76 units) was insufficient for the current demand level. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sustained high demand and recent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 samples (P23-P30) to align with the current regime. This will increase the base stock level to satisfy the higher volume and increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime starting Period 23 confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~93 units/period (P23-P30), representing an 82% increase from the previous low regime (~51). High volatility is present (std dev ~28).

Daily Reward (R_t): $380.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 23, increasing from a low of ~51 to a current average of ~100 units/period (P23-P31 average is approx 100.2). The last segment (P28-P31) shows even higher demand (107, 116, 117, 148). Consequently, the system is experiencing stockouts because orders placed during the low-demand regime (P19-P22 were 0, P23 was 7) are now arriving and are insufficient to meet current needs. The pipeline is currently full with higher orders (435 units in transit), but on-hand is zero. I am setting L to 'calculate' as lead time is consistently 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime starting at Period 23, ensuring the base stock level targets this higher average and accounts for the increased volatility (std dev ~31 in this period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 23 has reached a sustained average of ~100 units/period (P23-P31), with recent periods (P28-P31) showing an even higher average of ~122. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $349.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 23. From Period 23 to Period 32, the average demand is 100 units/period (total 999 units over 10 periods). The most recent 5 periods (P28-P32) average 117.4 units, indicating a possible further escalation or high volatility (std dev ~19.5). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The inventory currently shows 43 units on-hand with 424 units in-transit. Given the high demand and the recent stockout history (P26-P31), I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while buffering against the observed volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is grounded in the current high-demand reality (~100/period) rather than the older low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 23 has stabilized at an average of ~100 units/period (P23-P32), with significant volatility (peaks up to 148). This marks a 96% increase from the previous low-demand regime (~51).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began around Period 23. Over the last 11 periods (P23-P33), the average demand is 97.4 units per period. More recently, the average over the last 6 periods (P28-P33) is 116.8 units, showing sustained high volume with significant volatility (peaks up to 148). Currently, on-hand inventory is 68 units, and the pipeline inventory is 379 units (orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (standard deviation of ~25-30 in this regime) and a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1 (suggesting a target service level of 80%), I will use the last 11 samples (P23-P33) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current regime's mean while accounting for the recent surge in volatility to prevent further stockouts as seen in Periods 29-31.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime starting Period 23: Average demand 97.4 units/period (P23-P33), representing a 91% increase from the previous low regime. Recent 6-period average is 116.8. Volatility remains high (StdDev ~25).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 23, increasing from ~51 to a sustained higher level. Analyzing the most recent data from this regime (P23-P34, 12 samples), the average demand is 97.4 units. However, looking at the last 7 periods (P28-P34), the average is higher at 116.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.7. The inventory position is currently recovering from a series of stockouts caused by the previous low-order volume arriving into a high-demand environment. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), we aim for a high service level. Setting mu_hat using the last 12 samples (recent_N=12) captures the current regime, while the OR backend's safety stock calculation (using sigma_hat from the same period) will buffer against the observed volatility. This ensures we cover the L+1 period lead time risk.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started in Period 23 remains stable, with an average of 100.2 units per period over the last 13 periods (P23-P35). Recent demand has shown slightly higher variability but has stayed within the expected high-regime bounds (P35 demand: 88). Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 31 order in Period 35. On-hand inventory is low (13 units), but there is a substantial pipeline of 471 units. I will set mu_hat using the recent 13 periods (N=13) to capture this stabilized high-demand regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the ~100 unit average and maintains service levels to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 23 is confirmed stable at an average of ~100 units/period (P23-P35: avg 100.2, std dev 28.5). This represents a sustained 96% increase from the previous low-demand regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 23, with an average of approximately 100 units per period (P23-P36 avg: 97.7; P31-P36 avg: 106). Following the peak observe in P31 (148 units), recent demand has softened slightly (P35: 88, P36: 67), but remains within the established volatile high-demand regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 76 and a significant pipeline of 421 units, the system is well-stocked for the current lead time (L=4). Using recent_N=14 for mu_hat (covering the start of the current regime at P23) to capture the higher mean while acknowledging the volatility with recent_N=10 for sigma_hat. This helps the backend calculate a base stock that ensures high service level for a 100+ unit demand environment while preventing excessive overstocking given the large in-transit volume.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 23. From P23 to P37, the average demand is approximately 99 units per period. The most recent 10-period average (P28-P37) is 108 units, but the last two periods (P36: 67, P37: 95) show a slight cooling or standard volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 75 and in-transit at 369 (which covers the next 4 periods of arrivals), the pipeline is healthy. I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat (covering the P23-P37 regime) to capture the current mean of ~99, and recent_N=15 for sigma_hat to reflect the current regime's volatility. This helps the backend maintain a base stock that accounts for the ~100 unit/period demand while being mindful of the significant holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 23, with an average of approximately 100 units per period (P23-P38 mean: 98.7, std dev: 25.6). Recent demand has fluctuated but remains within this regime. Leading up to Period 39, we have 84 units on-hand and 357 units in-transit (orders from P35, P36, P37, and P38). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on recent arrivals. I will use the recent_N method with N=16 (covering P23-P38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized high-demand regime and its associated volatility. This will ensure the OR backend maintains a base stock level sufficient to handle the ~100 unit/period demand while accounting for the significant variance observed in this period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 23, with an average demand of approximately 101.4 units and significant volatility (standard deviation ~26.4). The most recent 5-period average (P35-P39) is 104.8 units, confirming that the high-demand regime persists. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P35 order in P39. Currently, on-hand inventory (88) and in-transit units (336) are sufficient to cover the next 4 periods (promised lead time) plus the current review period. I will use recent_N=17 (P23-P39) for demand and inventory parameters to capture this current regime's mean and volatility while ignoring the older, lower-demand history. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that targets an 80% service level (q = 4/(4+1)) balanced against holding costs.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 23, with an average of approximately 101.4 units per period (P23-P40). Specifically, the last 8 periods (P33-P40) show an average demand of 105.5 units, indicating sustained volume. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 37, 38, 39, and 40. Current inventory positioning: On-hand is 44, and In-transit is 390. To maintain a high service level given the $4.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost (75% critical ratio, translated by OR backend logic), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the stable 18-period regime since P23. This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~100 unit/period consumption while accounting for the high volatility observed (StdDev ~27).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 23 remains stable at ~101 units/period (P23-P40 avg: 101.4) with consistent lead times of 4 periods.

Current on-hand inventory is very low (8 units), though in-transit inventory is high (477 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=19 to capture the entirety of the current stable high-demand regime, ensuring the base stock level accounts for both the sustained mean and the observed volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a stable regime since Period 23, with an average demand of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation of about 26. We are currently in Period 43. Analyzing the lead time, the last shipment arrived from Period 38 in Period 42, confirming a consistent lead time of 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 18, and we have 444 units in transit (orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42). Given that the game ends at Period 50, and the lead time is 4, orders placed after Period 45 will not arrive in time to satisfy demand. We must maintain a base stock level that covers demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Using the recent stable regime (N=20, covering P23-P42), the OR backend will calculate a base stock based on the mean of ~101 and the captured volatility. This ensures we maintain service levels while accounting for the high reward/holding cost ratio (4:1).

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable since Period 23, with an average of approximately 100 units per period (P23-P43 average is 100.1). Lead times are consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P39 order arrived in P43). Current on-hand inventory is 64 units, and in-transit inventory is 427 units (covering orders from periods 40, 41, 42, and 43). Based on a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, suggesting we should aim for a base stock that covers roughly the 80th percentile of demand over the (L+1) period horizon. I will continue using recent_N with N=20 to capture the statistics of the current regime (starting at P23), which balances the mean of ~100 with the high observed volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 23, with a mean of approximately 101 units per period and a standard deviation around 28. Recent demand (P41-P44) has shown a slight softening (78, 95, 63, 60), but this is within the expected volatility range. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P45-P50) and a lead time of 4, the order placed this period (P45) will arrive in Period 49 and cover the final period's demand. I will use the established stable regime (since P23) to set parameters, using N=22 (P23 to P44) to capture the current mean and variance accurately while ignoring the previous low-demand regime. This ensures a balanced inventory levels as we approach the end of the simulation, mitigating the high holding costs seen in earlier transitions.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a stable regime since Period 23, with an average of approximately 101 units per period. The last 5 periods (P41-P45) show demand of [78, 95, 63, 60, 130], averaging 85.2, indicating some recent volatility but no clear sustained shift from the ~100 mean. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 137 units, with 271 units in-transit (orders from P42, P43, P44, P45). Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). I will use recent_N with N=23 (the start of the current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while smoothing out the periodic fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 23, with an average of approximately 101 units per period. The recent 5-period average (P42-P46) is 89.4, while the overall average for this regime (P23-P46) is 100.2. Lead times remain consistently at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs. Current inventory (on-hand 112 + in-transit 337 = 449) is very high compared to expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (~400 units). Given the high in-transit volume already exceeding expected total remaining demand, I will set mu_hat to a slightly lower 'recent_N' average to prevent the OR backend from over-ordering in these final stages, while maintaining L=4 to ensure valid pipeline calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $406.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the simulation (Period 48 of 50). The game ends at Period 50, and since the lead time is consistently 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 48) will arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game's horizon. Consequently, the 'In-transit' inventory of 332 units (orders from P44-P47) will arrive in Periods 48, 49, 50, and 51 respectively. Specifically, P44 arrives in P48, P45 in P49, and P46 in P50. The current on-hand inventory (82) plus expected arrivals for the remaining periods (P44: 60 units, P45: 47 units, P46: 138 units) provides a total of 327 units to cover demand for Periods 48, 49, and 50. Given the stable demand regime starting at P23 (mean ~101), we have sufficient inventory to satisfy expected demand (~303 units) without placing new orders that would only incur holding costs or arrive too late. Therefore, I will set parameters to stop new ordering while maintaining the current demand model for stats.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 23 remains stable at an average of ~101 units/period (P23-P47 avg: 101.4). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $258.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 23, with a mean of approximately 101.4 units and significant volatility (StdDev ~25-28). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable (last few arrivals all confirmed a 4-period lead time). Currently, the game is at Period 49 out of 50, meaning this is the final decision phase. Any order placed now at Period 49 with an 4-period lead time will arrive in the arrival resolution phase of Period 53. Since the game ends after Period 50, no order placed now will arrive in time to be sold. Therefore, to maximize the total reward (Profit - Holding Cost), I will set the base stock level such that it does not trigger a new order. Given the on-hand inventory (62) and a massive in-transit pipeline (407 units, including orders from P45-P48 which will arrive in P49-P52), any further ordering would only potentially increase holding costs in a hypothetical next period without increasing sales in Period 50. I will use the 'explicit' method for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the stable regime and then target a base stock less than the current pipeline to ensure the order quantity is zero.

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable in a high-demand regime since Period 23, with an average of approximately 101.4 units/period (P23-P48). In Period 49, a stockout occurred (demand=119, starting inventory=109), resulting in zero ending inventory. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since we are at Period 50, the OR backend needs to calculate orders for the current and subsequent 4 periods (L=4). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 is appropriate here as it covers the majority of the current stable regime (starting from Period 30) while excluding the transitionary volatility from the much lower regime. This will allow the backend to maintain a service level consistent with a profit/cost ratio of 4:1.
