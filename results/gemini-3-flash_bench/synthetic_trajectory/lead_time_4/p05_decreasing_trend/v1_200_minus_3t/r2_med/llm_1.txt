The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and be visible in Period 6's start. Based on the historical demand provided (P1: 217, P2: 207, P3: 170, P4: 131, P5: 185), the average demand is approximately 182 units. Since the lead time is 4 periods, my current order must cover demand for periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (L+1 periods) because the next possible arrival from a Period 2 order would not occur until Period 6. Summing the historical demand for Period 1 through 5 gives a total of 910 units. To ensure I can satisfy customer demand throughout the lead time and account for variance (Standard Deviation is approx 33), I will set a target inventory level. 910 units covers the mean; adding a small buffer for safety stock (approx 1 standard deviation) brings the target to roughly 950 units. Therefore, I will order 950 units to establish the pipeline.",

The game is approaching its conclusion at Period 50. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P45) will arrive in P49. On-hand inventory is 158 units, and in-transit inventory is 210 units (arrivals scheduled for P45, P46, P47, and P48). Total pipeline inventory is 368 units. Given the remaining 6 periods of demand (P45-P50) and an average demand of ~90 units/period, total expected demand is approximately 540 units. Current pipeline is 368 units, leaving a deficit of 172 units. However, I must avoid excess ending inventory (Period 50) due to holding costs. By the time the P45 order arrives in P49, there will only be 2 periods of demand left (P49-P50). Total units needed for P45-P50 is ~540. Current inventory + projected arrivals (P20+P10+P30+P150) = 368. An order of 150 units today will bring the total supply for the rest of the game to 518 units, which aligns closely with expected demand (~530-540) while minimizing final holding costs.",
