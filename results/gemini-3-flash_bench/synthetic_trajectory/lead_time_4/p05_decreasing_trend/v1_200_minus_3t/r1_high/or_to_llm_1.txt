Total units in-transit are 727 (238 from P1, 244 from P2, 245 from P3). Because of the 4-period lead time, we have been stocking out for the first three periods (Sold=0 against Demand of 217, 213, 163).

The OR recommendation is 240 units, calculated using promised lead time and historical demand.\n\n4. **Strategy**: In a 4-period lead time environment (L=4), the relevant pipeline target is (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Expected demand over 5 periods is roughly 194 * 5 = 970 units. \n4.

The OR agent uses a capped policy that factors in safety stock (z* based on 19.0/20.0 fractile is high, ~1.64).

Demand Analysis: The carry-over insight from Period 26 noted a demand shift downward (~135 over P21-25). Recent demand in Period 26 (112) and Period 27 (79) confirms a significant sustained softening. The mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 134, while the last 5 periods average 113. Scaling for L+1 (5 periods), the total expected demand is roughly 565-670 units.\n3. Inventory Position: We currently have 371 units on-hand and 329 in-transit (orders from P24, P25, P26), totaling 700 units. This already covers the expected demand for the next 5 periods given the new lower regime.\n4. OR Comparison: The OR algorithm recommends 221 units, likely because it still factors in high early demand (P1-P15) and sees a drop in pipeline (due to P27 ordering 0). However, adding 221 to our current 700 inventory position results in 921 units, which at current demand levels represents over 8 periods of supply, leading to high holding costs.\n5.
