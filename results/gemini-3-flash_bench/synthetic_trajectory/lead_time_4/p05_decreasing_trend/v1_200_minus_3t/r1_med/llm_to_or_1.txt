Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we only have historical demand data for 5 periods (mean = 182, std \u2248 33.6) and no prior on-hand inventory or in-transit orders, we must initialize the ordering process. The environment requires us to cover demand for (L+1) periods. Given the product 'chips(Regular)' and the lack of specific calendar dates, I will use the default methods based on the 5 available data points to establish a baseline for the OR engine's service level calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 238 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, zero units arrived in the arrival phase of Period 1 (confirmed by the Period 1 conclude message showing arrived=0). Consequently, since we started with 0 inventory, all 217 units of demand in Period 1 were lost. We currently have 238 units in-transit. For Period 2, I will keep the lead time at the promised 4 periods. Since we only have one demand observation (217), I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 to capture the most recent (and only) demand level, which helps the OR engine calculate the base stock for the (L+1) horizon. Given the lack of variance data, 'default' or 'recent_N' for sigma will rely on the standard deviation of available points.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 4 periods. This means the orders placed in Period 1 (238 units) and Period 2 (273 units) are currently in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. We are currently experiencing stockouts (0 on-hand) because we started with 0 inventory, and demand (P1: 217, P2: 213) is exceeding supply until those orders arrive. The backend OR logic uses L to calculate base stock as \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302. Since we have no concluded arrivals yet, I will use the 'default' method for L (which uses the promised lead time of 4). For demand (mu_hat), the first two periods show demand of 217 and 213; with a lead time of 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using 'default' for mu_hat will use the mean of the available samples (215) multiplied by 5, which is appropriate given the relatively stable start.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (totaling 756 units) are currently in-transit and are not expected to arrive until at least Period 5 (at the earliest, if lead time is 4). Consequently, starting inventory has been 0 and sales have been 0 despite positive demand. Demand is currently averaging 197.67 units per period based on the first three periods (217, 213, 163). I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the specific average and volatility seen so far, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) = 5 period lead time plus review interval.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (238 units) is scheduled to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5. However, the 'Period 4 conclude' message (the latest available) only shows arrivals up to the end of Period 4. We will only see if the Period 1 order arrived in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (P1 order is the first due). Demand has been relatively consistent over the first 5 periods (217, 207, 170, 131, 185; Note: Game history shows slightly different demand values from the context summary\u2014I follow the 'conclude' values: 217, 213, 163, 181, and the summary for P5: 185). The average demand is ~192. With L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+4)=5 periods of demand. 192 * 5 = 960. Given the high stockout risk (on-hand 0), I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to stay responsive to the early data trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $647.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods was confirmed by the arrival in Period 5 of the order placed in Period 1 (5 - 1 = 4). Demand over the first 5 periods has been relatively stable with a slight downward trend (217, 213, 163, 181, 177), averaging 190.2 units per period. Since we have only 5 data points and the lead time is confirmed at 4, I will use 'default' for L (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (N=5) to establish a baseline forecast. The total pipeline (In-transit + On-hand) is 827 units, which covers approximately 4.3 periods of average demand (827 / 190). Given L=4, we need to cover L+1=5 periods of demand (approx 950 units). The system will calculate the order based on this coverage requirement.

Daily Reward (R_t): $631.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met: Period 1's order arrived in Period 5 (L=4) and Period 2's order arrived in Period 6 (L=4). Demand across the first 6 periods has been relatively stable, with samples: 217, 213, 163, 181, 177, 193. The mean demand is approximately 190.67 units/period. On-hand inventory is 141, and we have a large pipeline in-transit (662 units) consisting of orders from Periods 3, 4, and 6. For Period 7, I will use the promised lead time (L=default) and base the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) on all available 6 samples to ensure a stable base stock calculation. The OR backend will automatically calculate the order size by subtracting the significant in-transit inventory from the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $624.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the first 7 periods has been relatively stable with an average of 191.4 units (samples: 217, 213, 163, 181, 177, 193, 202). Current on-hand inventory is 184, and in-transit inventory is 598 units (representing orders from Periods 4, 6, and 7, as Period 5 was an order of 0). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7. Since there are no clear demand regime shifts or seasonality indicators provided in the dates, I will use a balanced approach. For L, I use 'calculate' to rely on the confirmed lead time of 4. For mu_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the full recent history of demand. Given the stability, 'recent_N' with N=7 for sigma_hat will also provide a representative volatility measure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $478.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the supply chain is consistently following the promised lead time of 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 through 4 have arrived exactly after 4 periods (arriving in the arrival phase of periods 5 to 8). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 191 units since sales began (Period 5 to 8 avg: 188.5; all samples avg: 191). With 250 units on-hand and 567 units in-transit (orders from Period 6, 7, and 8), the inventory position is healthy. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (N=8) to capture the full history of demand while acknowledging the lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting L to 'default' uses the confirmed 4-period lead time. Parameters are aimed at maintaining a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1) with a service level based on the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (80% critical ratio), which the OR backend handles via these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $540.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand for the last 9 periods has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 187 units (P1-P9). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P5-P9) show a mean of 182.4. The promised lead time (L) is 4, and empirical data from P5-P8 confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. In Period 9, no order arrived, which is expected since no order was placed in Period 5. The next arrival (the order from P6) is expected in Period 10's arrival phase. On-hand inventory is 92, and pipeline inventory is 741. I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L at the confirmed value of 4 to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. This approach helps the OR backend maintain a service level consistent with a profit-to-cost ratio of 4:1 while accounting for the confirmed lead time.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable, with a mean of approximately 188 units over the last 5 periods (P6-P10). The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (P6's order arrived in P10). Note: P5's order was 0, explaining the 'arrived=0' in P9 conclude. With on-hand at 73 and 683 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, P10 totaling 683), the pipeline is well-stocked for the 4-period lead time. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable trend and default for lead time as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $676.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11. However, the order from Period 5 (which should have arrived in Period 9) is visibly missing from the conclude messages, suggesting it might be a lost shipment or significantly delayed. Demand across the first 11 periods is relatively stable with a mean of 186.5 units and a standard deviation of approximately 18.5. For Period 12, I will use the established Lead Time of 4. Since L=4, the OR engine needs to cover 5 periods of demand (1+L). Using the 'default' method for mu_hat will calculate (1+4) * 186.5 = 932.5. Given the high in-transit amount of 701, the OR engine's capped policy will ensure we don't over-order while maintaining the base stock level to account for the missing Period 5 shipment and upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Shipmend from Period 5 (L=4 expected) is missing/lost as of Period 11 conclude.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13, the promised lead time is 4. Analysis of historical arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12) consistently shows an actual lead time of 4 periods. However, the order from Period 5 (217 units) remains missing after 7 periods (expected Period 9), confirming it is likely lost. Demand is relatively stable. The mean of all 12 samples is ~183.5. Given the lost shipment from Period 5, the current pipeline (In-transit: 687) is lower than it should be if that shipment were still coming. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the targeted 'base_stock'. By utilizing 'default' for L (4), the base stock will target (1+4)=5 periods of demand. Setting mu_hat to 'default' will use the mean of all samples (183.5 * 5 \u2248 918). With current on-hand (127) and identified pipeline (687), the backend will order to close the gap. I will use 'default' for all parameters as the demand variance is stable and the lead time of 4 is confirmed, allowing the system to naturally compensate for the lost unit count through the pipeline calculation.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14. Demand for chips(Regular) has been stable. The mean demand of all 13 periods is approximately 183. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Our carry-over insights confirm L=4 is consistent, however, the shipment from Period 5 is confirmed lost (it should have arrived in Period 9 resolution, but is now 4 periods overdue beyond that). Total in-transit is 664 units (Orders from Periods 10, 11, 12, 13). Specifically, Period 10's order (111 units) is expected to arrive during the Period 14 resolution phase and be visible in Period 15's start. Demand remains stable with no clear seasonal or regime shift detected (mean ~183, last 5 periods mean ~173). I will use L=4 (default), and a conservative recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=13 to capture the full stable history. The OR backend will calculate the base stock for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~915 units). With On-hand (125) + In-transit (664) = 789 units, the system will order enough to reach that target, accounting for the lost Period 5 shipment which is no longer in the pipeline.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we have 74 units on-hand and 721 units in-transit. Over the last 14 periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 180 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11, P8->P12, P9->P13, P10->P14) consistently show an actual lead time of 4. However, the order from Period 5 (which should have arrived in Period 9) is now 6 periods overdue and is confirmed lost. Because the lead time is stable at 4 when deliveries occur, I will maintain L at the default (promised) value of 4. Since there is no significant trend or seasonal shift detected in the demand samples (ranging from 131 to 217), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=14 (all available samples from the start) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the full (L+1) horizon of 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $542.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am managing chips(Regular) at Period 16. Analyzing the history, demand has remained relatively stable without significant shifts. The average demand across all periods is approximately 180.2 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11, P8->P12, P9->P13, P10->P14, P11->P15). However, a critical observation remains from Period 5: the order placed then never arrived (it should have arrived in Period 9 if L=4). Because the OR backend calculates 'pipeline inventory' by summing all previous orders minus arrivals, that lost order (0 units) from Period 5 is still counted as 'In-transit' by the backend. This causes the backend to underestimate the required order size because it thinks 0 units are coming when they aren't. To compensate, I set mu_hat explicitly to the expected demand over (L+Review) periods, which is (4+1) * 180 = 900. By keeping mu_hat at this level while the backend 'In-transit' count is inflated by the missing Period 5 order, I ensure we maintain sufficient stock to avoid stockouts. I use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized significantly in the last 6 periods (P11-P16), averaging approximately 165 units, which is lower than the initial historical average. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, with regular arrivals for orders placed in P6 through P12. Notably, the order from Period 5 remains lost (missing from 'arrived' records as of Period 16 conclude, despite all subsequent orders arriving), which is accounted for in the system's in-transit total. Since demand has shifted downwards and is now exhibiting lower variance, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this stable, lower-demand regime. This prevents over-ordering based on the higher early-game demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: mean demand decreased to ~165 units compared to previous periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $281.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant regime shift. Between Period 1 and Period 11, the average demand was approximately 188 units. However, from Period 12 to Period 17, the mean demand dropped to approximately 146 units. Period 16 and 17 specifically showed even lower demand (125 and 124). Therefore, I am using a recent_N method with N=7 to capture this lower demand regime (starting around Period 11/12). Regarding lead time, the promised lead time of 4 periods remains the consistent observation for all successful deliveries (P13 arrived in P17), despite the loss of the Period 5 order. The 'calculate' method is appropriate for L as it will incorporate the observed consistency of 4-period arrivals. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend adjusts to the lower current demand levels, preventing excessive overstocking while maintaining service levels for the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand from Periods 12-17 decreased to ~146 units (approx. 22% reduction from the initial 188 average).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the current environment shows a stabilized lower demand regime. As noted in the carry-over insights, demand shifted downward around Period 11, with the mean demand from Periods 12-18 averaging approximately 146 units per period. The on-hand inventory is healthy at 238 units, and there are 444 units in-transit. Lead times have consistently remained at the promised 4 periods for all successfully delivered shipments (excluding the confirmed lost shipment from Period 5). To align the OR backend with this lower demand regime and ensure inventory levels do not balloon due to the lower sales velocity, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (covering the stable lower demand period from P12 onwards, N = 18 - 12 + 1 = 7). This uses a more accurate, recent statistical basis for the (1+L) period demand forecast. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. The demand for the last 8 periods (P12-P19) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 146.4 units (samples: 158, 176, 162, 163, 125, 124, 145, 172) compared to the initial periods. Current on-hand inventory is 220 units. In-transit inventory of 398 units includes orders from P16 (150 units), P17 (37 units), P18 (103 units), and P19 (108 units). The shipment from P5 is officially confirmed lost. Given the lower stabilized demand, I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this new regime. This will result in an expected demand over (L+1)=5 periods of 5 * 146.4 = 732 units. Since our pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 220 + 398 = 618 units, the system will order roughly 114 units to reach the base stock level, effectively adjusting for the lower demand while covering the lead-time risk.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent 9 periods (P12-P20), the mean demand is approximately 144.7 units, a significant decrease from the early game average of ~188 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, although we account for the known lost shipment from Period 5. With on-hand inventory at 188 and 434 units in-transit (P17-P20 orders), total pipeline inventory is 622 units. Given the lead time (L=4) plus the decision period (total 5 periods), and a mean demand of ~145, the expected requirement is ~725 units. The OR backend will calculate the order based on recent_N=9 to capture this lower demand mean and current variance. This strategy aims to reduce holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Periods 12-21) shows a stabilized average of approximately 157 units per period, down from the earlier average of ~188 units. Period 21 ending on-hand inventory is 63. Pipeline inventory is currently 588 units. This pipeline includes the order from Period 18 (103 units), Period 19 (108 units), Period 20 (186 units), and Period 21 (191 units), totaling 588 units. The order from Period 5 remains lost (as noted in carry-over insights). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 10 samples (N=10) captures the current stabilized demand regime (avg ~157). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the recent volatility. L is set to default (promised 4) as arrivals from Periods 13 to 17 confirmed this lead time.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P12-P22), the mean demand is approximately 147.3 units per period. Prior periods (P1-P11) averaged approximately 188 units. This reduction necessitates adjusting mu_hat to prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level defined by the critical ratio q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P22 received order from P18). There is one known lost shipment from Period 5, which the backend pipeline calculation handles as it stays 'in-transit' indefinitely, though its effective removal from current planning is managed by setting the base stock against the actual received history. I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the current lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 12, with an average demand of approximately 146 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is low at 32 units, but there is a significant amount in-transit (646 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P19 arrived at P23). Although one shipment (P5) was lost long ago, subsequent shipments have arrived reliably. I am using a recent_N window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat starting from Period 12 to reflect the current lower demand regime (N=12). This ensures the OR backend calculates the base stock based on the most relevant demand data without being skewed by the higher initial demand periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the demand context shows a sustained lower regime that began around Period 11, with recent demand (Periods 18-24) averaging 144 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on recent arrivals (orders from Periods 17-20 arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is currently 110 units with 581 units in-transit (orders from P21-P24). The inventory pipeline is healthy. I will set L to 'default' (4 periods). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 (covering Periods 18-24) to capture the current lower demand phase (approx 144 * 5 = 720 for a 4+1 period window). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect current volatility. These parameters will allow the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock for the current demand level while accounting for the established 4-period lead time.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a lower-than-initial regime that began around Period 11-12. Over the last 10 periods (P16 to P25), the average demand is approximately 149.9 units, which aligns with the previously identified 'lower regime' of ~146 units. Recent volatility remains relatively stable. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P17 through P21). The missing shipment from Period 5 remains unaccounted for, but subsequent shipments have arrived reliably. Since the 'recent' demand regime has been stable for over 10 periods, I will use a window of N=10 for both demand and volatility (sigma) to tune the base stock to the current market reality. Lead time L is set to its prometed/observed default of 4.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 12, with an average demand of approximately 140-145 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 26) was 112, following 165 in Period 25. Over the last 10 periods (17-26), the mean demand is 137.9. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 195 units, and there is a significant in-transit pipeline of 456 units (orders from P23, P24, P25, and P26). Given the lower demand profile and high pipeline, the goal is to prevent excess holding costs while maintaining a service level that reflects the $4.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio (target cycle service level ~80%). I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the demand history shows a notable downward trend. The average demand from Period 12 to Period 17 was ~146 units, and the more recent demand from Period 22 to 27 has further decreased to an average of ~118 units (112, 130, 108, 165, 112, 79). Specifically, the last three periods (25-27) averaged 118.6 units. To prevent excessive holding costs (which are $1 per unit, a significant 25% of profit), it is necessary to adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) downwards to reflect this lower regime. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this most recent localized demand shift since Period 22. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P17 through P23 (all arriving exactly 4 periods later). Monitoring the in-transit inventory is crucial; there are 465 units in the pipeline (Orders from P24, P25, P26, P27), which is sufficient to cover approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 22: mean demand decreased further to ~118 units (approx. 37% reduction from the initial P1-P10 average).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 22, demand has ranged from 79 to 165, with the most recent three periods (26, 27, 28) showing a significant dip to 112, 79, and 90. This indicates a sustained lower demand pattern. I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, covering the period from P22 to P28, to reflect this lower mean (~114 units/period) and moderate volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 245 and in-transit at 344 (total 589), and an expected demand of roughly 570 units over the next 5 periods (L+1), the current pipeline is healthy. The backend will use these lower parameters to adjust the base stock downward, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining the service level for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized starting Period 22: mean demand decreased to ~114 units (Periods 22-28), representing a significant drop from both the initial and intermediate regimes.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 22. In the most recent 8 periods (P22-P29), demand has averaged 108.1 units, significantly lower than the initial average of ~188 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations (e.g., P25 order arrived in P29 conclude). The current on-hand inventory (242) plus in-transit stock (291) is 533 units, which is quite high relative to the current demand (~108/period). At a lead time of 4, the target pipeline (L+1 periods) should be approximately 5 * 108 = 540 units. We are currently close to this target but slightly overstocked on hand (242). I will use the recent demand regime (N=8) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower demand and prevent excessive holding costs, as our current inventory already covers nearly 5 periods of demand.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 22, the demand has averaged approximately 114 units (Periods 22-30: 112, 130, 108, 165, 112, 79, 90, 89, 149). The most recent period (P30) saw a slight uptick to 149, but the overall trend remains significantly lower than the starting periods. Current on-hand inventory is 244 units with 212 units in-transit (orders from P27, P29, P30; P28 was 0). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the new demand mean, I will use a recent_N (N=9, covering the start of the current regime in P22) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the lower demand mean of ~114-116 and helps the OR engine avoid over-ordering while we work through existing stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple downward regime shifts. Period 32 shows the demand has stabilized in a lower tier since Period 22. In the last 10 periods (P22-P31), the average demand is approximately 114.2 units per period (112, 130, 108, 165, 112, 79, 90, 89, 149, 108). The current on-hand inventory (243) and in-transit units (267) provide a high stock level relative to this decreased demand. The backend OR logic uses the base stock formula: base_stock = (1+L) * mu_hat + z * sigma_hat * sqrt(1+L). With L=4, the pipeline should cover 5 periods of demand. 5 * 114.2 = 571, while current inventory + in-transit = 510. To capture the recent lower demand trend and prevent excessive holding costs, I am using recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Periods 22-32) shows a significant decrease, with demand averaging approximately 114 units. Over the last 5 periods (P28-P32), the average demand is 105 units. I will use recent_N=11 (from the start of the current regime) to capture this lower mean while maintaining some stability against fluctuations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent 'Period N conclude' messages (e.g., P27 order arrived at P31). Although Period 32 conclude shows 0 units arrived, this is consistent with the order from Period 28 being 0. Pipeline inventory is currently high (379 units), which when added to on-hand (154) significantly exceeds the requirements for the (L+1) horizon at current demand levels. The OR backend's capped policy will minimize orders to prevent excess holding costs while demand is low.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 22, with an average demand of approximately 114 units. However, there is a significant discrepancy regarding the Period 28 order (0 units ordered) and the missed arrival from Period 28 (nothing arrived in Period 33 conclude). The current on-hand inventory is 66 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 423 units includes several periods of orders (P30: 72, P31: 162, P32: 112, P33: 77), which totals 423 units. My lead time analysis confirms a stable 4-period arrival window (observed consistently except for the known P5 loss). Period 32 conclude shows 0 arrived because the P28 order was 0. For Period 34, I will use a recent demand window of 12 periods (P22-P33) to capture the current low-demand regime (~115 units/period) while maintaining the promised lead time of 4. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering 5 periods of demand at the current rate.

In the most recent 13 periods (P22-P34), the average demand is approximately 111.5 units, with a standard deviation of about 24.5 units, indicating a significant drop from the initial average of ~188. I will use recent_N=13 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. Regarding lead time, the shipment from Period 28 (ordered 0 units) is technically 'concluded' in the sense that nothing will arrive, but the shipment from Period 31 (ordered 162 units) is still in transit as expected. However, the shipment from Period 32 (ordered 112 units) is not due until Period 36 conclude. The arrival in Period 33 (ordered P29) and Period 34 (ordered P30) both confirm a consistent lead time of 4 periods. Therefore, I will stick with the default promised lead time of 4. The current inventory position (On-hand: 40 + In-transit: 474 = 514) is quite high compared to the established demand (111.5 * 5 = 557.5), but the OR backend's capping mechanism will prevent over-ordering while I maintain these parameters to ensure service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P22-P34): Average demand is 111.5 units, significantly lower than previous regimes.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 22. In the most recent block (Periods 22-35), the average demand is approximately 111.5 units per period. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, etc.) confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, with the exception of a lost shipment from Period 5 and a zero-arrival in Period 32 (which corresponds to an order of 0 units in Period 28). At the start of Period 36, we have 119 units on hand and 403 units in-transit. The in-transit units cover orders from Periods 32, 33, 34, and 35. Following the lower demand regime, I will use a recent_N approach (N=14, covering P22 to P35) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current lower consumption rate (~111.5 units/period) and avoids overstocking given the holding cost. The lead time L is set to 'default' (4) as it remain stable.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 22. The mean demand from Period 22 to Period 36 is approximately 110 units. While the promised lead time remains 4 periods, history shows a consistent 4-period lead time for most successful deliveries. However, an order from Period 28 (which was 0 units) and orders from Period 33 onwards are still in transit. Specifically, the 'In-transit' quantity of 364 includes orders from P33 (77), P34 (123), P35 (91), and P36 (73), totaling 364 units. The next expected arrival is the P33 order (77 units) in Period 37 conclude (visible in P38). Currently, on-hand inventory is 118, which is slightly above one period's average demand. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=15 (covering the post-P22 regime) targets a base stock that accounts for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (~550 units). Given current inventory (118) and in-transit (364), the pipeline is 482 units. The OR backend will order the difference to reach the safety stock level, while the cap will prevent excessive over-ordering given the low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4) but high visibility of lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P22-P36): Average demand is 110.1 units, maintaining the significant drop identified in previous periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 22. In the most recent 16 periods (P22-P37), the average demand is approximately 110.8 units per period, showing a significant drop compared to early periods. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P29 to P33. However, order Period 28 resulted in 0 units being ordered, which effectively creates a gap in the delivery pipeline. Currently, we have 94 units on hand and 400 units in transit (orders from P34, P35, P36, and P37). The total pipeline plus on-hand (494 units) is sufficient to cover approximately 4.5 periods of the current average demand (110.8 * 4.5 = 498). To maintain alignment with the OR engine's base-stock calculation during this stable low-demand period, I am using recent_N (N=16) to capture the current mean and variance accurately, ensuring the service level is maintained without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P22-P37): Average demand is 110.8 units, confirmed sustained lower volume for 16 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime starting at Period 22. In the last 17 periods (P22-P38), the mean demand is approximately 110.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 24.3 units. This regime is significantly lower than the initial average of ~188 units. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals from P31-P34). Current on-hand inventory is 148 units, and in-transit is 374 units (total pipeline of 522). Since the base stock target (covering L+1 periods) for this regime is approximately 554 units (5 periods * 110.8), the current inventory position is nearly aligned with the target. I will use the recent 17-period window (N=17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this lower-demand regime and avoid over-ordering, as the holding cost ($1.0) is significant relative to profit ($4.0).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a significantly lower mean of approximately 110 units since Period 22. The most recent demand (Period 39) was 111, consistent with this 18-period regime. I am using recent_N=18 to capture this specific mean and variance, which allows the OR backend to adjust the base stock level to current market conditions rather than including the higher demand from the first half of the game. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by regular arrivals including the Period 35 order arriving in Period 39. With on-hand inventory at 128 and in-transit at 342 (total pipeline 470), the system is well-covered for the next 5 periods (L+1) given the current demand rate (~550 units required), suggesting a small replenishment is appropriate to maintain the service level while minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P22-P39): Average demand is 110.8 units, sustaining the ~37% volume reduction for 18 consecutive periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime starting around Period 22. In the last 19 periods (P22-P40), the average demand is approximately 107.9 units. The most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) show a mean of 89.6, but given the volatility, I will use a slightly larger window (N=10) to capture the current stable state more reliably while respecting the downward trend. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (excluding the P28 anomaly). Currently, On-hand is 147 and In-transit is 380, totaling 527. With an expected lead time of 4, our 'pipeline' covers (L+1)=5 periods. If demand is ~108, we need ~540 units to cover the lead time. The current total of 527 is very close to this, indicating the OR backend will place an order appropriate to the service level (Profit $4 / Holding $1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $290.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, lower-volume regime since Period 22. The average demand from Period 22 to Period 41 is approximately 105.7 units per period, which is a significant reduction from the earlier parts of the game. Lead times have consistently returned to 4 periods, with the exception of the lost shipment from Period 5 and a missing shipment from Period 28 (which is now considered lost). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime. For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=20 to reflect the current volatility of this regime. Current on-hand inventory is 150, and in-transit is 267. With a lead time of 4, the policy needs to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At ~106 units/period, the target base stock is approximately 530 units. Current pipeline (150+267=417) is below this, so the OR backend will trigger an order to bridge the gap while respecting the safety stock determined by the profit/holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P22-P41): Average demand is 105.7 units, continuing the significant drop observed since P22. Period 28 shipment is confirmed lost as of Period 33 conclude (not arrived by P32).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since Period 22. In the most recent 21 periods (P22-P42), the average demand is approximately 105.7 units per period, showing a significant reduction from the initial regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, with orders consistently arriving accordingly (except for identified lost shipments in P5 and P28). Currently, there are 146 units on-hand and 317 units in-transit (orders from P39, P40, and P42). Given that the backend order logic aims to cover (L+1) periods of demand, and considering the current inventory position relative to the stabilized demand (avg ~106), I will use 'recent_N' with N=21 to capture the current regime's mean and variance precisely. This helps the OR backend maintain a service level optimized for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding overstocking due to the historical higher demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P22-P42): Average demand is 105.5 units, maintaining the ~37% volume reduction for 21 consecutive periods. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods despite historical lost shipments.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from Period 22. In the most recent 22 periods (P22-P43), the average demand is approximately 103.6 units, reflecting a significant drop compared to the initial periods. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods, with only occasional lost shipments (P5, P28). Currently, the pipeline inventory (364 units) is substantial relative to the 142 units on-hand, which should provide coverage for the 4-period lead time given the current demand rate (~104 units/period). I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=22 to capture this sustained lower demand regime while maintaining L at the promised 4 periods. Since demand volatility also appears to have decreased along with the mean, 'recent_N' for sigma_hat is also appropriate to avoid overstocking due to historical higher variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P22-P43): Average demand is approximately 103.6 units, confirming a long-term reduction of roughly 45% from original levels (P1-P10).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 22. In the most recent periods (P40-P44), demand has been consistently low (54, 110, 101, 63, 61), bringing the average for this regime down to approximately 103 units. Lead time is reliably 4 periods (P40 order arrived in P44). The current on-hand inventory is 192, and in-transit is 309, totaling 501 units. With an estimated (1+L) period demand of ~515 units (5 * 103), the current pipeline is nearly sufficient. I will use recent_N with N=23 (covering the start of the regime at P22 to P44) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stabilized low-demand behavior while providing enough historical data to smooth out volatility. L will remain at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P22-P44): average demand is ~103.6 units, confirming a sustained ~45% reduction from the initial P1-P10 levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite historical lost shipments.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a further decline from the average established in the P22-P44 regime (~103.6). In the last four periods (P42-P45), demand has dropped significantly (101, 63, 61, 60), averaging only 71.25 units. This suggests a new downward shift. The 'In-transit' quantity of 362 units is very high relative to this new demand level, equivalent to over 5 periods of inventory at current consumption rates. The Period 41 order was 0, and subsequent orders (P42-P45) are already in the pipeline. To avoid excessive holding costs in the final 5 periods of the game, I am reducing mu_hat to reflect the most recent 4-period demand average (N=4) and using a short-term sigma_hat (N=4) to account for the reduced volatility at these lower levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite the lack of arrival in P45 (P41 order was 0, so no arrival was expected).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 42: Demand dropped to ~71.25 units (4-period average P42-P45), a ~31% decrease from the previous P22-P41 regime (~103.6).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 42. While the previous regime (P22-P41) averaged ~105.7 units, the most recent 5 periods (P42-P46) show demand values of 101, 63, 61, 60, and 61. This represents a sustained drop to an average of ~69.2 units. For Period 47, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime and avoid excessive inventory accumulation. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on recent history (P42 order arrived P46). On-hand inventory is 218 units with 215 in-transit, which is sufficient for current demand levels, likely resulting in a zero or small order from the OR backend after applying the lead-time and demand parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42 sustained: Mean demand decreased to ~69 units (P42-P46), a ~35% reduction from the P22-P41 average (~106).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-4.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 42. Recent observations (P42-P47) show demand values of 101, 63, 61, 60, 61, and 64 respectively. While Period 42 was higher, the last five periods have consistently hovered around a mean of ~62. Using recent_N=6 captures this drop. Current On-hand (260) plus In-transit (109) totals 369 units. Given the new average demand of ~68 and a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1), which is approximately 340 units. Since 369 > 340, the OR backend will correctly order 0 or very little, which is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand environment. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite the historical missing shipment in Period 41 (ordered P37 arrived P41, but P41 ordered P45 is missing/skipped in arrival logic, though P42 arrived P46 and P43 arrived P47).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42 sustained: Mean demand for P43-P47 is ~62 units, confirming a ~40% reduction from the previous P22-P41 regime (~104).

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new, lower-volume regime starting around Period 42. Recent demand samples (P42 to P48) are: 101, 63, 61, 60, 61, 64, 75. While P42 was an outlier (101), the last six periods (P43-P48) show a very consistent mean of approximately 64 units. Given this sustained shift, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture this low-volume regime. On-hand inventory is currently high at 241 units, which is nearly 4 periods of the current demand (4 * 64 = 256). With 56 units in-transit (ordered P45, expected P49), the total pipeline covers expected demand for the immediate future. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite historical losses. The OR backend will likely recommend a very small or zero order to bleed off the excess on-hand inventory and minimize holding costs while the new regime settles.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 43: Mean demand for P43-P48 is ~64 units, representing a ~40% reduction from the previous P22-P41 regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime starting from Period 43. Analyzing the most recent seven periods (P43-P49), demand values are [63, 61, 60, 61, 64, 75, 54], resulting in a daily mean of approximately 62.6 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P45 order arrived in P49 conclude). For Period 50, I am setting L=4 and using recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this specific low-demand regime. This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~40% reduction in volume compared to the P22-P41 period, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $4.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio. Current on-hand inventory is 240, which is enough to cover nearly 4 periods of demand at the current rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 43: Mean demand for P43-P49 is ~63 units, confirming the sustained ~40% reduction from the previous P22-P41 regime (~104 units).
