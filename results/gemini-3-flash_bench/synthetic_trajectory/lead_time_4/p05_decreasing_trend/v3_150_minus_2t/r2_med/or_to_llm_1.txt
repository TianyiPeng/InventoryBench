Since pipeline is 681, the 'order_raw' is nearly 0 or very small (base_stock - pipeline). The 'cap' logic provides a small buffer of 43 units. \n5. Strategic Adjustment: Following the OR recommendation is prudent. We have a massive amount of inventory arriving starting next period (Period 6).

The in-transit pipeline comprises orders from P34 (0 units), P35 (45 units), P36 (90 units), and P37 (120 units). Based on the lead time, the P34 'arrival' (which was 0) occurs in P38, P35 arrives in P39, P36 in P40, and P37 in P41. Demand has shown significant regime shifts, most recently stabilizing around an average of 74-80 units since P28, although the last period (P37) saw a spike to 108. The OR recommendation of 162 units is based on long-term historical averages which include higher demand periods, leading to an overestimation given the current lower demand regime. To maintain a base stock that covers 5 periods (L+1) of demand at the current average (~80-90 units/period), we need approximately 400-450 units in the system. Total current inventory (73 on-hand + 255 in-transit) is 328 units. Calculating (5 * 90) - 328 = 122 units.

Demand has trended lower recently (Period 28-36 avg ~77), but the last two periods (P37: 108, P38: 77) show a bit more volatility. My target pipeline should cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using a conservative recent average of ~85 units/period, the target stock is 425 units. \n\n3. **Pipeline Check**: In-transit is 365. Adding the expected arrivals: P39(45), P40(90), P41(120), P42(110) = 365. This matches the 'In-transit' figure exactly, confirming no orders are lost.\n\n4. **OR Baseline & Adjustment**: The OR recommendation is 161. Current gap (Target 425 - In-transit 365) is 60. However, the system is currently at 0 on-hand, and demand in Period 39 (which occurs after this decision) will be lost if arrivals don't cover it. Arrival in P39 is 45 units. If demand is 85, we lose 40 sales. I need to build a larger buffer to recover from the stockout. Given the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, being over-stocked is preferable to stockouts.

Period 45 recorded a very low demand of 31 units. The long-term historical mean is significantly higher, but recent performance suggests a cooling trend. \n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand inventory is 202 units. In-transit inventory is 327 units (from orders P42, P43, P44, P45). Total pipeline is 529 units. \n4. **Critical Timing (Game End)**: We are at Period 46 of 50. Orders placed now (P46) will arrive in Period 50 (P46 + 4 lead time). Orders placed after today (P47-P50) will NOT arrive before the game ends. Therefore, this is the FINAL order that will contribute to sales. \n5. **Requirement Calculation**: Total periods remaining for this and future arrivals to cover is P46, P47, P48, P49, and P50 (5 periods). Using a conservative recent average of ~85 units/period to avoid stockouts, total demand needed is ~425 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 529 units. \n6. **Conclusion**: We already have enough inventory to cover all demand through the end of the game based on current demand trends.

On-hand inventory is currently high at 301 units, which is enough to cover over 4 periods of demand at the recent average of ~72 units. The pipeline (in-transit) consists of 185 units (orders from P43: 30, P44: 115, P45: 40). These are expected to arrive in Periods 47, 48, and 49 respectively.

Demand has significantly cooled in the last 6 periods (averaging ~67, with the last two periods at 31 and 43).

Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (48+4), which is outside the simulation window. Therefore, any order placed now will not be sold and will only contribute to lost profit and zero utility.\n\n2. **Inventory & Demand Analysis**: Current on-hand inventory is 268 units. There are 155 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 44, 45, 47). Based on the 4-period lead time:\n   - Period 44 order (115 units) arrives in Period 48.\n   - Period 45 order (40 units) arrives in Period 49.\n   Recent demand (P45-P47) has been low (31, 43, 63), averaging around 46 units. Even with a potential rebound to the previous mean of ~72 units, the available stock (268 on-hand + 115 arriving today = 383) is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50). Total expected demand for the remaining periods is likely around 150-210 units.\n\n3. **OR Recommendation Override**: The OR recommendation of 159 units is based on a base-stock policy that does not account for the approaching end of the game (terminal period).

Given that we are in Period 49 of a 50-period game, the primary objective is to avoid excessive holding costs on the final inventory. \n5. **Strategy**: With 311 units on hand and 40 units incoming (Total = 351 units), and even assuming a generous demand of 80 units/period for the final two periods (P49 and P50), we would end the game with ~191 units.

There are no pending in-transit units because the last orders were placed in Period 45 and have now arrived in Period 49.\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Demand has undergone multiple regime shifts. The most recent shift occurred around Period 45, with demand significantly decreasing. Average demand from Period 45-49 is approximately 53.6 units per period. Prior to that (P41-P44), it was ~82 units. The trend is clearly downward or stabilizing at a much lower level than the long-term historical mean.\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand inventory is currently 292 units. There are 0 units in-transit. Total inventory = 292.\n4. **Strategic Calculation**: To cover the lead time (4) plus the current review period (1), we need enough stock for 5 periods. Using the recent average demand of ~54 units, the required stock is 5 * 54 = 270 units. Even with a safety stock buffer, 292 units is more than sufficient to cover the next 5 periods of demand.\n5. **OR Adjustment**: The OR recommendation of 158 units is based on historical averages that include much higher demand periods (P1-P40). Following the OR recommendation would lead to excessive overstocking and high holding costs.
