Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 6 (having just seen demand for Period 5). The product 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161. The mean demand is 136.4 with a standard deviation of 17.9. Since there is no on-hand inventory and no in-transit units yet, we need to establish a base stock to cover the review period (1) plus the lead time (4). I will use the 'default' method for L (4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the initial demand characteristics. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4)*mean and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+4)*std, which are approximately 682 and 40 respectively.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 166 units, but they have not arrived yet (Promised Lead Time is 4 periods). Consequently, all 165 units of demand in Period 1 were lost because starting inventory was 0. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 166 in-transit. The demand history shows: P1=130, P2=147, P3=128, P4=116, P5=161 (pre-game samples) and P1=165 (actual). The mean of the 6 samples is 141.17, with a standard deviation of 17.86. Since the holding cost equals profit ($1.00), the backend's internal target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock will target the median demand. Given the promised lead time (L=4), we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use the default method for L to stick to the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to include all available data points (including the first actual period) while weighting towards current observations.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for Period 1 and Period 2 was 165 and 145 respectively (avg ~155). The 'Samples' provided in the prompt (130, 147, 128, etc.) seem lower than the actual realized demand in the game history for P1 and P2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, no orders (placed in P1 or P2) could have arrived yet if L=4. On-hand is 0, so we have lost sales. Total pipeline is 340 (166 from P1 + 174 from P2). I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the slightly higher demand seen in the actual game history versus the seeds, and keep lead time at 'default' (4) since we haven't seen any arrivals to contradict the promise yet.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (totaling 166+174+175 = 515 units) are currently in-transit. Per the 'Lead Time Definition', an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 4 is expected to arrive during Period 1+4=5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations for Periods 1-3 are expected and do not yet indicate a lead time shift or lost orders. Demand has been relatively stable (165, 145, 135) with an average of 148.3. However, provided historical samples (130, 147, 128, 116, 161) suggest a similar mean (~136). Inventory is currently zero, leading to lost sales, which is expected during the initial lead time buffer. I will use a conservative recent_N approach for demand to capture the slightly higher observed demand in the game history compared to the pre-game samples. Since no lead times have concluded yet, I will stick with the default (promised) lead time of 4.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In-transit inventory is 689 units (orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4). According to the game mechanics, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is scheduled to arrive during Period 1+4=5. However, this arrival only becomes visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message, which I will see at the start of Period 6. Therefore, the current on-hand inventory of 0 is expected. Demand history (P1-P5: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161) shows a mean of approximately 136.4. Since the in-transit amount (~689) roughly covers 5 periods of demand (136.4 * 5 = 682), the system is tracking well with the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the full available history while remaining responsive to the current trend. L is set to 'default' as there is no evidence yet to suggest the promised lead time of 4 is inaccurate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Promised lead time is 4. From the Period 5 conclude message, we confirmed the first order (placed Period 1) arrived exactly at Period 5, meaning the actual lead time is indeed 4 periods. Since 'arrived' occurs after the decision phase, we currently see 22 units on-hand from that first arrival. Demand over the first 5 periods has been [130, 147, 128, 116, 161] (based on provided samples) or [165, 145, 135, 112, 144] (based on conclude history). Averaging history gives ~140 units/period. With L=4, the pipeline inventory (ordered in P2, P3, P4, P5) is 174+175+174+29 = 552. The base stock targets (1+L) periods, so 5 * 140 = 700. Our current total position (22 on-hand + 552 in-transit = 574) is slightly below this. I will use the 'default' L (4), and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using all 5 available history periods (N=5) to capture the current demand level accurately.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe a steady state for 'chips(Regular)'. The historical demand (Periods 1-6) shows a stable average of approximately 141 units (130, 147, 128, 116, 161, 145 - including initial data and conclude messages). Specifically, the last three periods exhibit demand of 112, 144, and 145, averaging 133.6, while the overall mean is 137.9. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. Current on-hand inventory is 51, and in-transit inventory is 505 (representing orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). With L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the target service level q = 0.5; the backend's base stock will thus target the mean demand over the lead time plus review period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand and lead time to capture the most stable recent performance.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the first 7 periods averages 144.5 units (165, 145, 135, 112, 144, 145, 170). The recent demand in Period 7 (170) is higher than the previous periods, but there is no confirmed regime shift yet. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as seen in the 'conclude' messages for Periods 5, 6, and 7 (orders from P1, P2, and P3 arrived with lead_time=4). Promised lead time (L=4) aligns with observations. Current inventory position: On-hand = 56, In-transit = 479 (Orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). A total of 535 units are available to cover demand until the order placed now (P8) arrives in P12 (spanning periods 8, 9, 10, 11, 12). Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is q = 0.5, meaning base stock effectively targets the median demand over (L+1) periods. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full recent demand profile while excluding the very first data point if needed, though here 7 covers all concluded demand records.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, and P4). Current on-hand inventory is 97, and in-transit inventory is 482 (from orders placed in P5, P6, P7, and P8). Demand has been relatively stable, with an average of 142.5 units over 8 periods and a slight uptick in recent periods (P5-P8 average is 148). Given the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). High holding costs relative to profit suggest avoiding excessive safety stock. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the slight increase in demand from the last few periods while using default for L and sigma_hat to maintain stability.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (Orders from P1-P5 arrived exactly at P(N+4)). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable with a slight uptick in variability recently. The mean demand over the first 9 periods is approximately 142 units (165, 145, 135, 112, 144, 145, 170, 133, 124). Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (2 units) because the order from P5 was exceptionally small (29 units). However, there is a significant pipeline of 614 units (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Using L=4, the backend needs to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full observed demand distribution as the mean is stable but variance exists. Setting L to 'default' (4) is appropriate given the arrival consistency.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods as predicted (orders from P1-P6 arrived exactly after 4 periods). This stability justifies using the default lead time. Current inventory (23 on-hand + 579 in-transit) must cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1=5 periods). Historical demand across the first 10 periods averages approximately 138 units per period (combined with pre-game samples, the mean is roughly 136). The demand in P9 and P10 (124 and 106) suggests a slight softening, but not yet a sustained regime shift. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the relevant history while discounting the potentially noisier start. With profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) being equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock will be near the mean. The high in-transit amount (579) suggests past orders were quite high, so the OR backend will likely order a smaller amount to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Through Period 11, the confirmed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown moderate fluctuations without a clear structural break. Over the last 11 periods, the average demand is approximately 140.5 units per period. In-transit inventory stands at 518 units, which includes orders from Period 8 (177), Period 9 (161), Period 10 (92), and Period 11 (88). The Period 8 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of the current period (Period 12). Given that the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5 (Phi(0)=0.5), making the base stock essentially (1+L) * mu_hat. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full history's mean and variance, providing a stable forecast for both demand (mu_hat) and risk (sigma_hat) while maintaining L at the confirmed value of 4.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from Period 5 through Period 12 consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods (e.g., Period 8 order arrived in Period 12). Demand for chips(Regular) appears stable without significant regimes or seasonality trends in the recent history; the average demand across all 12 periods is approximately 139.3 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 517 units aligns correctly with the pending orders from Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12 (161+92+88+176 = 517), confirming no shipments have been lost. I will use a lead time (L) of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture the current demand volatility while smoothing out early noise, aiming to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-71.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 14. Historical demand analysis shows a recent drop in demand: Period 13 recorded 73 units, whereas the previous 5 periods averaged approximately 125 units. Although Period 13 is a single data point, the variability is notable. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P9). On-hand inventory is 144, and in-transit inventory is 464 (consisting of orders from P10-P13: 92+88+176+108=464). Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, setting the critical ratio at 0.5, which aligns the base stock level with the mean of demand over the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand to capture the stable mean while acknowledging the recent lower entry, and 'default' for lead time since the 4-period promise is being met consistently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-50.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a visible decline in the most recent periods (Periods 13 and 14: demand 73 and 93), compared to the earlier average around 140. The overall average demand across all 14 periods is approximately 131. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals from P1 through P10 orders. Currently, we have 143 units on hand and 417 units in transit (orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)), meaning the base stock should target the median demand over the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it captures the recent downward trend better than the full history while maintaining enough samples for stability. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The average demand over the last 15 periods is approximately 132 units, however, the last 3 periods show a slight downward trend (73, 93, 146). The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across 11 observed arrivals (P5 through P15). Currently, there is 85 units on-hand and 410 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, and P15). With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The pipeline of 410 units + 85 on-hand (total 495) is sufficient to cover approximately 3.7 periods of demand at the historical average. Given that holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the OR backend will target the median demand (base stock at \u03bc\u0302). I will use recent_N (N=8) for demand (mu_hat) to capture recent volatility while maintaining stability, and calculate for lead time as it has been perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 152 and in-transit is 344 units. Historical lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by deliveries in P5 through P16). Demand has shown significant variance recently, with a notable drop in Period 13 (73) followed by values ranging from 93 to 146. To calculate mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the current demand level (approx. 114 units mean) while responding to the recent volatility. This window (P12-P16: 126, 73, 93, 146, 109) provides a balanced estimate of mean demand (109.4) and standard deviation for the SKU during this regime. Given that L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend captures this recent behavior without being heavily skewed by the higher demand seen in the earliest periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from Period 1 to 13). On-hand inventory is 140, and in-transit inventory is 287 (representing orders from Periods 14, 15, 16, and 17). Demand appears to be stable with a slight decrease in the average over the last 5 periods (P13-P17 avg \u2248 108) compared to the overall average (P1-P17 avg \u2248 130). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5) will target the median. I will use the recent 5-period average for demand to account for the recent lower volume slightly and maintain the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data from Period 5 through Period 18 consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Consequently, I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to leverage this stable historical performance. Regarding demand forecasting, I analyzed the last 18 periods (excluding the initial 5 samples provided in the prompt, as the conclude messages show slightly different realized demand). The demand is relatively stable but exhibits some variance (ranging from 73 to 170). The mean demand over the last 10 periods (Periods 9-18) is approximately 118.7 units per period. Setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 will capture this contemporary mean while smoothing out the noise. Sigma_hat is also set using the same window (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. With a profit and holding cost of $1.0 each, the service level target (q) is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock will target covering the mean demand over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). Current in-transit (356) and on-hand (55) total 411 units, which covers about 3.5 periods of demand; the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to bridge the gap to the 5-period target.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a stable mean with no significant regime shifts or seasonal spikes identified in the given dates (Period_1 to Period_19). Lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory reconciliation: On-hand is 30, and there are 438 units in transit (orders from Periods 16-19), which align with the lead time and previous order quantities. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand over the protection interval (L+1 periods). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it is stable and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full sample mean and variance for a robust base stock calculation.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival from Period 1 through Period 16 (confirmed up to Period 20 conclude). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable without significant regime shifts or seasonal spikes. The recent demand (Periods 11-20) averages 124 units, compared to the overall average of 131 units. Given the consistency of both lead time and demand patterns, I am using 'calculate' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 to capture the most current stable regime. This will help the OR backend maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level/median demand).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is exhausted (on-hand 0, lost sales in Period 21). The lead time is consistently 4 periods, which means the base stock must cover demand over L+1=5 periods. My current pipeline (in-transit) is 524 units, consisting of orders placed in Periods 18 through 21. Demand has been relatively stable, with a recent 5-period average (P17-P21) of approximately 117.8 units/period. The overall game average is approximately 127.8 units/period. Given the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend sets base stock equal to mu_hat. To ensure the inventory levels catch up with the recent stockout while accounting for recent demand trends, I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current mean more accurately than the full history, which includes early noisier data. Sigma_hat will use the default calculation across all samples to provide a stable estimate of volatility. L is set to calculated as it has been reliably 4 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently low (10 units) following a stockout in Period 21. Demand has stabilized after Period 12, roughly fluctuating between 73 and 146. Looking at the last 10 periods (P13-P22), the average demand is approximately 110.4 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrivals). I will set L to 'calculate' to use the observed lead time of 4. For mu_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime (averaging ~110), covering the 5-period risk window (L+1). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=10 to capture recent volatility. This configuration aims to stabilize the base stock and recover from the recent stockout while minimizing holding costs (which equal profit, meaning a roughly 50% service level target is naturally balanced, though the backend's q-calculation will handle the specific z-score).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-7.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 90 units, and there are 382 units in-transit. Based on the history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by recent arrivals in Periods 22 and 23). For our Period 24 decision, the order we place now will arrive at the end of Period 28. In the interim, we expect arrivals from orders placed in Periods 20 (170 units), 21 (77 units), 22 (42 units), and 23 (93 units). Demand has been relatively stable, with recent periods (P18-P23) showing values of 130, 106, 120, 109, 104, and 83. The mean of these 6 samples is 108.6. Given the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.0), the backend logic q = p/(p+h) = 0.5 will target the median demand (z*=0), requiring base stock to be \u03bc\u0302. Setting L to 4 (default) and using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 captures the current demand stability while ignoring earlier higher-variance periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a noticeable decline and stabilization in the most recent period segment. While the initial demand (Periods 1-5) averaged 146 units, the mean demand over the last 12 periods (Periods 13-24) has dropped to approximately 107 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods average 100 units. To avoid over-ordering and incurring high holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I am narrowing the demand window to the last 12 samples (recent_N=12) to capture this lower regime. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals, so 'calculate' is appropriate. I will use a tighter window for volatility (recent_N=12) to match the demand mean window, ensuring the safety stock reflects the current stable but lower demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Average demand decreased from ~140 (early periods) to ~107 units (Periods 13-24).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Between Periods 13 and 25, the average demand is approximately 107 units per period, a decrease from the earlier average of ~140 units. This shift was previously noted in the carry-over insights. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=13 to capture this specific regime (Period 13 to Period 25). The actual lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods across all arrivals recorded in history, matching the promised lead time. Therefore, I will use 'calculate' for the lead time L, which will average these consistent observations. This configuration will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the current lower demand and its historical volatility, while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). Current on-hand inventory is 134 units, which is slightly above the current mean demand, but there is significant pipeline inventory (309 units) intended to cover the lead time horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Between Periods 13 and 26, the demand averaged approximately 105.3 units per period, a significant decrease from the earlier average of ~140. For Period 27, I will continue to use a recent window (N=14) to capture this lower regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival history (most recently the Period 22 order arriving in Period 26). The current on-hand inventory (82) plus the in-transit pipeline (361) totals 443 units. With an expected demand of roughly 525 units over the review and lead time (105 * 5), the OR backend should order to cover the gap while being tempered by the holding cost, which equals the profit ($1.00).

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 13. Over the last 15 periods (P13-P27), the average demand is 105.3 units with a standard deviation of 19.4. Lead time effectively remains at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent 'conclude' messages. The current on-hand inventory is 69 units, and in-transit inventory is 358 units. To maintain the service level across the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), the base stock should cover approximately 526 units (105.3 * 5). Given the pipeline inventory (358 + 69 = 427), the OR engine will determine the appropriate order amount. I will use a recent_N of 15 to capture this sustained lower-demand regime while excluding the higher noise from the first 12 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 13. Calculating the mean demand from Period 13 to 28 (16 periods), the average is approximately 104.5 units per period. The in-transit inventory is currently 391 units (orders from P25, P26, P27, and P28), which is significantly higher than the expected demand over the next 4 periods (~418 units). However, given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand (~522 units). With 53 units on hand and 391 in transit (total 444), the system will likely place a small replenishment order. To ensure the OR backend uses the most relevant data, I am setting N=16 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, covering the entire current demand regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 13. The average demand from Period 13 to Period 29 is approximately 101 units per period, down from the earlier average of ~140. Most recently, the last 5 periods (25-29) show an average of 90.6 units. Given the inventory level (88 on-hand + 372 in-transit), we are well-covered for the lead time (L=4). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P25 order arrived on P29). I will use a conservative recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=17, covering the period from P13 to P29) to ensure the OR backend captures this sustained lower demand regime while smoothing out weekly volatility. Sigma will be calculated using the same window to reflect current variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~101 units per period (Period 13-29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 13. Over the last 10 periods (Periods 21-30), the average demand is approximately 94.2 units, which is consistent with the previously identified shift from ~140 units to ~100 units. The lead time has remained extremely stable at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect the current demand volatility. For lead time, 'calculate' is appropriate given the consistency observed in the history. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will target via the base stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-49.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 13, the average demand has been approximately 98.7 units per period, consistently lower than the early periods (~140). The most recent 10-period average (Periods 22-31) is 90.5, while the last 5 periods (Periods 27-31) average 84.2, suggesting an ongoing slight downward trend or high variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrivals). Currently, on-hand inventory is 112, and in-transit is 301. The backend formula calculates base_stock = mu_hat + z * sigma_hat. Using recent_N (N=19, from Period 13 to 31) for mu_hat will set a forecast based on the stabilized regime of ~100 units/period (total 500 units for L+1). Setting sigma_hat to recent_N (N=19) appropriately captures the volatility of this specific regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-103.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a continued downward trend, with the most recent regime (Periods 29-32) averaging approximately 61 units, significantly lower than the previous stabilized mean of ~101 units identified at Period 30. This suggests a potential new shift or extreme seasonal dip. To react to this effectively without over-correcting, I am setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the most recent demand behavior (last 5 samples: 67, 97, 63, 57, and the unrecorded Period 32 demand which was 57). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is healthy at 160 units, and the in-transit pipeline (286 units) should cover demand through the lead time, but mu_hat must be adjusted down to prevent excessive holding costs in this lower demand environment.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime suspected starting Period 29: average demand dropped further to ~71 units (Periods 29-32 average) from the previous ~101 unit average.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear downward shift in recent periods. Initial demand (Periods 1-12) averaged ~140, followed by a regime that stabilized around ~101 (Periods 13-28). Starting Period 29, a further significant drop is evident: the last five demands are 67, 97, 63, 57, and 80, averaging 72.8 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 163 and 203 units in-transit (orders from P30, P31, P32), total pipeline inventory is 366 units. At the current estimated demand of ~73, this inventory covers approximately 5 periods (L+1), suggesting we should continue to restrain ordering to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this lower volume regime while using default calculate for lead time and default for variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 29-33 average demand is 72.8 units, a ~28% drop from the previous ~101 unit average.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 29. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P29-P34) is approximately 74 units (67, 97, 63, 57, 80, 80). This is a confirmed drop from the previous average of ~101 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (138 units) and substantial in-transit inventory (148 units), we are currently overstocked relative to the new demand level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time observed in history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-8.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted downwards significantly. Analysis of the most recent data (Periods 29-35) shows an average demand of approximately 76.8 units per period (67, 97, 63, 57, 80, 80, 94). This is significantly lower than the previous regime (~101 units). I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and volatility correctly. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on historical concludes (e.g., Period 35's arrival was ordered in Period 31). On-hand inventory is currently high (102), and there are 174 units in-transit. By using the recent lower demand statistics, the OR backend will naturally reduce the order quantity to bleed off excess inventory while maintaining the required service level for the new regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Period 29-35 average demand is ~77 units, a sustained decrease from the previous ~101 unit average.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 29. The average demand from Period 29 to Period 36 is approximately 78 units (samples: 67, 97, 63, 57, 80, 80, 94, 80). The 'carry_over_insight' confirms a shift occurred at Period 29, and the last 8 periods of data consistently reflect this lower level. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture this specific regime perfectly. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is confirmed by multiple arrivals in the history (e.g., Period 32 order arriving at Period 36). Current inventory (On-hand: 112, In-transit: 187) is being managed against this lower demand forecast to minimize holding costs while ensuring service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, the 'Period 33 conclude' message showed zero arrivals, which is expected as the order on Period 33 was 0 units. However, we have in-transit inventory from orders in Period 35 (84 units), Period 36 (103 units), and Period 37 (88 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 29, we've observed a lower demand regime. The demand in the last 5 periods (Periods 33-37) was 80, 80, 94, 80, 108, averaging 88.4 units. This is slightly higher than the previous estimate of ~77, suggesting a moderate recovery or higher variance. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the expected demand over (L+1) periods. To avoid over-reacting to the recent 108 demand spike while acknowledging the shift from 77, I will use N=9 for demand mean (Period 29-37) which covers the entire localized low-demand regime. This period is critical as on-hand inventory has dropped to 4 units, so we rely on the upcoming Period 34 order (which was 0 units) and Period 35 order to arrive soon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29-37 shows an average of ~81 units (Periods 29-37: 67, 97, 63, 57, 80, 80, 94, 80, 108).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting around Period 29. Calculating the average demand from Period 29 to Period 38 (samples: 67, 97, 63, 57, 80, 80, 94, 80, 108, 77) gives a mean of 80.3 units. This represents a significant and sustained drop from the earlier ~101 unit average. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this specific regime. Regarding lead time, we have observed a consistent actual lead time of 4 periods (matches promised) until very recently. However, the 'Period 37 conclude' and 'Period 38 conclude' messages show arrived=0. Based on the 4-period lead time, Period 37 should have seen the arrival of the Period 33 order (0 units ordered) and Period 38 should have seen the arrival of the Period 34 order (0 units ordered). Thus, the arrival of 0 units is consistent with the order history, not a lead time shift or lost shipment. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand with 384 in-transit. Setting parameters to maintain the current service level for the detected demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further around Period 29: average demand for Periods 29-38 is 80.3 units (~20% lower than the Period 13-28 average of ~102).

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 29, stabilizing at a lower average. For Periods 29-39, the average demand is 82.2 units, a significant decrease from the previous regime of ~102. Recent demand (last 5 periods) is 94, 80, 108, 77, and 101, showing higher variance despite the lower regime average. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 35 order in Period 39. However, orders from Periods 33 and 34 were 0 (due to high on-hand inventory at the time), and the orders from Periods 36, 37, and 38 (totaling 280 units) are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Periods 40, 41, and 42 respectively. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have faced stockouts in the last two periods, I will use recent_N (N=11, covering the current regime since Period 29) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the overall lower regime average with the recent volatility and ensures we capture the current demand distribution accurately to recover service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29-39 confirmed: average demand is 82.2 units (SD ~15.8), approximately 20% lower than the Period 13-28 regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the supply chain is recovering from a significant disruption where orders from Period 33 and Period 34 (totalling 0 units) resulted in zero arrivals during Periods 37 and 38, leading to stockouts. Currently, on-hand inventory is 17 units, and 308 units are in-transit. Demand since Period 29 has stabilized into a new regime with an average of approximately 82.2 units per period (Period 29-40: 67, 97, 63, 57, 80, 80, 94, 80, 108, 77, 101, 86). While lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods, I will continue using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (corresponding to the start of this demand regime at Period 29) to ensure the OR backend accurately captures the current mean and volatility. This helps prevent over-ordering based on the higher demand seen in early periods (P1-P28) while ensuring we carry enough stock to cover the (L+1) horizon.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 29-41) shows a mean demand of approximately 83.3 units (calculated from Period 29: 67, 97, 63, 57, 80, 80, 94, 80, 108, 77, 101, 86, 93). This confirms the shift noted in previous carry-over insights. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P37 order arrived P41). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 to capture this post-Period 29 regime accurately while excluding the much higher initial demand samples. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the current lower demand environment, appropriately balancing service levels against the $1.0 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29-41 confirmed: average demand is 83.3 units, approximately 20% lower than the Period 13-28 regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 29) shows an average demand of approximately 83.3 units. Period 42 demand was 76 units, continuing the pattern of lower volatility compared to the initial periods. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 39, 40, 41, and 42 which all followed a 4-period lag). On-hand inventory is 43, and in-transit is 299 units. Since the backend calculates base stock using mu_hat and sigma_hat, and applies a cap, I will use recent_N with N=14 (Periods 29-42) to capture the current demand mean and variance accurately. This ensures mu_hat is based on the 83.3 units/period average while excluding the higher demand from early periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29-42 confirmed: average demand is 82.8 units with lower variance compared to earlier regimes.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 29. For Periods 29-43, the average demand is 82.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5 units. Choosing N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this entire recent stable regime (Periods 29-43 total 15 samples). Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 39 order in Period 43. Current on-hand inventory is 0, so the system must rely on pipeline inventory (354 units) which covers roughly 4.3 periods of demand (354 / 82.2). The OR backend's base-stock calculation using these parameters will ensure we target enough inventory to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods) while accounting for the current stockout.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 29. The average demand across Periods 29-44 is approximately 82 units per period (67, 97, 63, 57, 80, 80, 94, 80, 108, 77, 101, 86, 95, 76, 76, 84), with a standard deviation of roughly 14.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, corroborated by 'conclude' messages for orders from Periods 35-40 all arriving with a lead time of 4. Current on-hand inventory is 9 units, with 320 units in-transit. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. To capture the current regime precisely, I will use a N=16 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which encompasses the data since the detected shift in Period 29. This provides a mean of ~82 and accounts for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29-44 confirmed: average demand is ~82.3 units with a standard deviation of ~14.5.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting around Period 29. The average demand from Period 29 to Period 45 (17 samples) is approximately 81.6 units. Period 45 showed a significant drop to 31 units, but it's too early to declare a new regime after only one outlier; however, it suggests avoiding over-ordering. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in multiple 'conclude' messages, including the most recent arrivals). On-hand inventory is 66, and in-transit inventory is 316. Given the current date is Period 46 and the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (L=4) will arrive in the arrival resolution phase of Period 50. Since demand resolution occurs after arrival in Period 50, this is the last order that will impact the final period's availability. I will use 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture the demand regime since Period 29 (mean ~82, std ~16), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the remaining periods without excessive holding costs.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward trend in the last two periods (Period 45: 31 units, Period 46: 43 units), differing from the established regime of ~82 units seen since Period 29. Given that we have only two data points for this sharp drop, I will use a conservative window for mu_hat (recent_N=5) to capture this downward shift while tempering it with slightly older data to avoid over-reacting to potential outliers. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., Period 42 order arrived in Period 46). On-hand inventory is 123 units and in-transit is 232 units, which is quite high relative to the recent demand of 31-43 units. The OR backend needs parameters that reflect this lower demand to prevent excessive holding costs, especially as the game approaches its final periods (Period 47 of 50).

Carry-over insight: Possible new demand regime shift starting Period 45: average demand for P45-P46 is 37 units compared to the previous regime's 82 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-70.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has exhibited a significant downward shift starting around Period 45. In Period 45 demand was 31, Period 46 was 43, and Period 47 was 63. The average of these three periods is 45.6, which is a nearly 45% drop from the previous average of ~82.3. Given we are near the end of the game (Period 48 of 50), it is critical to lower the base stock to avoid excessive holding costs on the ending inventory. Current on-hand inventory is 133 and in-transit is 159 (total 292), which already covers over 6 periods of demand at the new lower rate (45.6 * 6 = 273). The backend will automatically subtract PIPELINE from the calculated BASE_STOCK. By selecting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect this new regime, the OR engine will determine the target level is likely below our current pipeline, thus naturally triggering a small or zero order to deplete the high inventory. Since lead time has been consistently 4 periods, I will continue using the default/calculated lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 45: average demand dropped from ~82 to ~46 units (P45-P47: 31, 43, 63).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-48.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 45. The average demand for the period P45-P48 is 52.25 units (31, 43, 63, 72), representing a ~37% drop from the previous average of ~82 units. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this new lower-demand level for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed behavior (P44 order arrived P48, lead_time was 4). Current inventory (120 on-hand + 100 in-transit) is 220 units. With the new average demand around 52, this covers roughly 4.2 periods, which is sufficient given the 4-period lead time. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will cause the OR backend to align base stock levels with the current lower demand trend, avoiding excessive holding costs as we head toward the end of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 45 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~82 to ~52 units (P45-P48 avg: 52.25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-86.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 45. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P45-P49) is 53.6 units (31, 43, 63, 72, 59), which is roughly 35% lower than the previous regime (which averaged ~82 units). This lower demand level has now been sustained for 5 periods, allowing for a 'recent_N' approach with N=5. On-hand inventory is currently high (145 units) relative to this new demand level, and pipeline inventory is 58 units (orders from P46 and P49). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods will allow the OR backend to adjust the base stock downward to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining the target service level for the new demand distribution.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 45 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~82 to ~54 units (P45-P49 average: 53.6).
