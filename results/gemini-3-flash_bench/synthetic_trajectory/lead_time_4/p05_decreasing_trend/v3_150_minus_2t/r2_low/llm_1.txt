Since this is Period 1 and no orders have been placed yet, actual lead time is unknown, but I'll assume 4 for now. (d) Inventory assessment: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. (e) Final Order Logic: To cover demand for the lead time (4) plus the current period (1), I need to satisfy demand for 5 periods. 136 * 5 = 680 units.

On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning Period 1 demand (165) was not met, and Period 2 demand will also result in lost sales.

At an average of 145 units/period, the pipeline target is ~725 units. Since 680 units are already in-transit, I will place a small order of 45 units to reach that target, accounting for the stockout risk and the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which suggests a conservative 'Newsvendor' approach.",

Given the game ends at Period 50 and the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, orders placed now (P44) will arrive in P48. My current inventory position is 523 units (153 on-hand + 370 in-transit). The remaining demand periods are P44 through P50 (7 periods). At an estimated 90 units/period, total remaining demand is approximately 630. With 523 units already in the system, I need roughly 107 more units to cover demand through P50. However, orders placed in P45, P46, etc., will also arrive before the end. To avoid ending with excessive inventory (holding cost = $1.0), I will target a total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) that covers demand until P48/P49. Current pipeline of 523 units covers approx. 5.8 periods of demand. An order of 70 units maintains a steady flow without creating a large surplus at the game's end.",

Currently, I am in Period 45. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, order decisions made now will cover demand until Period 50 (the final period). My goal is to satisfy demand while minimizing ending inventory in P50 to avoid high holding costs. Current position: On-hand (169) + In-transit (340) = 509 units. Expected arrivals over the next 4 periods (based on historical orders): P45 (100 units from P41), P46 (100 units from P42), P47 (70 units from P43), P48 (70 units from P44). Given high on-hand levels and the pipeline, the current 509 units easily cover the remaining 6 periods of demand (P45-P50) if demand averages ~85 units/period (Total Req: ~510). Ordering more now would only increase holding costs or result in significant leftover inventory at the end of the game (P50). Therefore, I will place an order of 0 to bleed down the existing stock.",

Analysis: (a) Calendar/Product: No specific calendar triggers are noted for the late-game period, but 'chips(Regular)' usually have stable demand. (b) Demand Analysis: Recent demand has dropped significantly (Period 45: 31, Period 46: 43). The prior regime was ~91, but the last two periods suggest a downward shift or variance. Even using a conservative average of ~70 units for the remaining 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50), total required stock is approximately 280 units. (c) Lead Time: Confirmed at 4 periods. Orders placed now (P47) will arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends). (d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 295. Current In-transit is 140 (70 from P43, 70 from P44). The P43 order arrives in P47 (visible P48), and the P44 order arrives in P48 (visible P49). (e) Decision: Total units available to satisfy demand for the remaining periods (P47-P50) include 295 (on-hand) + 70 (arriving P47) + 70 (arriving P48) = 435 units.

Currently, we have 300 units on hand, and we have observed a recent demand regime shift to lower levels (averages around 40-70 units).
