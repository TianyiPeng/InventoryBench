Based on the promised lead time of 4 periods, this large order is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 and will be visible to me at the start of Period 6. Currently, In-transit inventory is 800 and On-hand is 0. To maximize profit, I need to cover demand for the lead time duration plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). At an average demand of ~140, 5 periods of demand equals ~700 units. My current pipeline (800 in-transit) already covers this expected demand through Period 5. However, since I am currently stocked out and lost sales in Period 1, I should consider if additional orders are needed. Given the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 2) won't arrive until Period 6. By the time the Period 1 order arrives (Period 5 conclude/Period 6 start), I will have 800 units. If demand stays around 140/period, I will consume roughly 140 units in Period 6, 7, etc. I will place a small supplemental order to ensure I don't stock out immediately after the first big shipment arrives, accounting for the 0 on-hand start.",

Since P1 and P2 resulted in 272 lost sales due to zero starting inventory, I need to build a stock buffer once the first shipment arrives. e) Final Order Logic: The pipeline (800) covers approximately 5.8 periods of demand (800 / 138). Given a 4-period lead time, the P1 order should arrive in P5. My next decision (P3) covers demand in P3, P4, P5, P6, and P7 (L+1 coverage). Total expected demand for 5 periods is ~690 units.

  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 37, averaging approximately 64 units per period (P37-P44 range: 40-79). The current on-hand inventory is 273 units, with 30 units in-transit (ordered Period 42, expected Period 46). Total pipeline inventory is 303 units. Given the remaining 6 periods (P45-P50) and an average demand of ~65, the total expected remaining demand is roughly 390 units. However, holding costs are $1/unit while profit is $19/unit, and the current stock (303) covers over 4.5 periods of demand. With only 6 periods left and a 4-period lead time, any order placed now (Period 45) would arrive in Period 49, leaving only two periods (P49 and P50) to sell that stock. To avoid high ending inventory holding costs and potential waste, I will place a small order to bridge the gap toward the end of the game while prioritizing depletion of the current high on-hand stock.",

Note that the order from P41 was 0, which explains the 'arrived=0' in the P45 conclusion (P41 + 4 lead time = P45 arrival). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the game ends at Period 50, I need to cover demand for Periods 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50. Total expected demand for these 5 periods at an average of 63 units is 315 units. Currently, total inventory (on-hand 218 + in-transit 70) is 288 units. To ensure I fulfill all demand through the end of the game while minimizing holding costs (which are $1 per unit), I will place a small order to reach the target of approximately 315-320 units total.

The P45 order is expected to arrive in Period 49 and the P46 order in Period 50. Total available inventory (121 on-hand + 70 in-transit) is 191 units. Since 191 units covers the estimated 186 units of demand for the rest of the game, no further orders are necessary.

Given this is the penultimate decision period (Period 49), any order placed now will arrive in Period 53 (49 + 4), which is beyond the game's end at Period 50. Therefore, the current on-hand inventory (92 units) and any incoming shipments scheduled for Period 49 or 50 are all that can be used to satisfy remaining demand. Since the game ends in 2 periods and current on-hand (92) already exceeds the likely total demand for P49 and P50 (estimated ~120 total, but on-hand will cover a significant portion and holding costs apply), placing a new order is useless as it won't arrive in time to be sold.",

In-transit inventory is 30 units, consisting of the order from Period 46 (expected to arrive in Period 50). This indicates that for Period 50, the available inventory after arrival will be 71 units (41 + 30). Given the lead time is 4 periods, I must cover demand for the current period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Total requirement = 5 * 62 = 310 units. Total pipeline = 41 (on-hand) + 30 (due Period 50) = 71 units. A gap of 239 units exists. However, this is the final period of the simulation (Period 50 of 50).
