Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 204, 155, 134, 72, and 108, averaging approximately 135 units per period. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we start with 0 On-hand and 0 In-transit inventory, we need to order enough to cover the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). A simple base-case demand estimate is around 135 units/period. Therefore, we should aim for an inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) of roughly 135 * 5 = 675 units to satisfy demand until the first shipment arrives in Period 5. Given the high profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), a slight buffer is preferred to avoid stockouts. I will place an initial order of 675 units.",

Period 48 (Period_48) VM Action:

{
  "rationale": "We are currently in Period 48 of a 50-period game. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 48 arrive in Period 52 (outside the game), Period 47 orders arrive in Period 51 (outside), Period 46 orders arrive in Period 50, Period 45 orders arrive in Period 49, and Period 44 orders arrive in Period 48. Current inventory state: On-hand (10) + In-transit (50). The In-transit consists of orders from P44 (20 units arriving this period) and P45 (30 units arriving P49). Demand for the most recent regime (P43-P47) averages ~28 units/period. Forecasted demand for P48-P50 is approximately 30 units/period (Total 90 units). Current inventory pipeline: On-hand (10) + Arriving P48 (20) + Arriving P49 (30) + Arriving P50 (Order to be placed now). Total needed for P48-P50 is ~90 units. Available without new orders: 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 units. Shortfall for P50 is 30 units. To maximize profit and end with minimal stock (avoiding holding costs on the final period), I will order enough to cover Period 50. Since P48 is the last period where an order can arrive within the game (arriving P52 is too late, but P44/P45/P46 orders are still in play), I must check P46: any order placed in P46 arrives in P50. Looking at history, P46 order was 0. This means the only stock available for the final periods are the Current On-hand (10), P44 arrival (20), and P45 arrival (30). Total = 60 units. Expected demand for P48, P49, P50 is ~30 each (90 total). We will likely stock out in Period 50. However, an order placed in Period 48 arrives in Period 52 (after the game). Therefore, any order placed now is useless for sales and only incurs holding costs if it were to somehow count, or simply wastes capital. Action: 0.",

Period 49 (Period_49) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are at Period 49 of 50. In this game environment, orders arrive during the arrival phase of Period N+L and are visible at the start of Period N+L+1. Since L=4, an order placed during the decision phase of Period 49 will arrive during Period 53 (49+4). However, the game concludes at the end of Period 50. Therefore, any order placed now will never arrive within the game's timeframe and will only incur costs without the possibility of being sold. Our current inventory consists of 2 units on-hand and 30 units in-transit (ordered in Period 45, expected to arrive during Period 49 and be visible in the Period 49 conclude message at the start of Period 50). This 30-unit arrival, combined with the 2 units on-hand, provides a total of 32 units to satisfy demand for the final two periods (49 and 50). Given the recent demand average of ~25 units (P44-P48 average is 25.2), this is likely sufficient. Regardless of inventory needs, placing an order in Period 49 or 50 is strictly suboptimal as the goods cannot arrive before the game ends.",

However, the game concludes at the end of Period 50. In the sequence of events, demand resolution follows the decision phase. Current on-hand inventory is 7 units, and recent demand (P48-49) has averaged 26.5 units. Since any order placed now cannot arrive before the game ends and would only incur holding costs if it were somehow to arrive (which it won't under the L=4 rule), the optimal action is to order 0 units and attempt to satisfy as much remaining Period 50 demand as possible with the existing stock.",
