My target is to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand to ensure stock availability once the first order arrives. Based on the average of 135 units per period, the required pipeline is approximately 675 units. Since On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 0, I must place a substantial initial order.

I already have 700 units in transit which covers this requirement. However, I must consider that the current Period 1 demand of 207 was higher than the historical average, though previous data suggests a downward trend (204 -> 155 -> 134 -> 72 -> 108).

  "rationale": "We are currently at Period 50, which is the final period for decision-making. In this scenario, any order placed now will arrive in Period 54 (due to the 4-period lead time) and cannot be sold within the game's 50-period horizon. The objective is to maximize total reward, which includes subtracting holding costs for ending inventory. At the start of Period 50, we have 1 unit on hand. Additionally, an order of 102 units placed in Period 46 is expected to arrive during Period 50. Since the Demand Resolution phase occurs after the Arrival Resolution phase, these 102 units plus the 1 unit existing on-hand (total 103) will be available to meet Period 50's demand. Historical demand has recently averaged around 25-35 units. Therefore, we will likely end the game with a significant inventory surplus (approximately 70-80 units). Placing any further order would only increase 'in-transit' units that cannot arrive in time to be sold and would serve no purpose in maximizing the final reward score. Thus, the optimal action is to order 0.",
