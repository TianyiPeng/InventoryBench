Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no arrivals history yet to infer the actual lead time, I will use the 'default' lead time (4). Moving forward, 'on-hand + in-transit' needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The historical demand data provided (P1-P5) shows a mean of 134.6 and a standard deviation of 52.3. However, I have only 'observed' Period 1's demand (204) in this specific simulation context, but I will consider the full provided history to set the initial policy. I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR engine to use all provided samples for the initial calculation.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 217 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4. As expected for a multi-period lead time, no units arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0 in the Period 1 conclude message). Demand in Period 1 was 191 units, but since on-hand inventory was 0, zero units were sold, resulting in lost profits. The current in-transit inventory is 217 units. Based on historical data (Periods 1-5 mean demand is approx 135), the Period 1 demand of 191 is high but within a reasonable range for a new product launch or initial spike. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and base my projections on all available historical demand samples to stabilize the forecast, as there is not yet enough evidence of a sustained regime shift.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, while 444 units are in-transit (orders from Period 1 and 2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, so the first arrival is expected in Period 1+4=5. Consequently, we have had 0 sales in Periods 1 and 2 despite demand occurring. Demand has been 191 and 113 in the first two periods, with five historical samples provided (204, 155, 134, 72, 108). The average of all available samples (including the two game-play periods) is (204+155+134+72+108+191+113)/7 \u2248 140. Given the promised lead time L=4, the base stock should cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Since no shipments have concluded yet, there is no evidence to override the promised lead time or the historical demand distribution.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3, but according to the sequence, the first order (from Period 1) is not expected to arrive until the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (L=4 means N+L = 1+4=5). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' and 'sold=0' results in the history for Periods 1-3 are expected and follow the lead time definition. Our on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 662 units in transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has shown a downward trend (191, 113, 149), with the provided historical samples suggesting an average demand around 134 units. I will use the default lead time (4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (including the 5 historical samples provided) to capture the base demand level while covering the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (217 units) are expected to arrive during the Period 5 resolution phase, meaning we will only see the 'conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 719 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4). Historical demand over the first 4 periods showed a decline (191, 113, 149, 108), averaging 140.25 units per period. Since no orders have reached their expected arrival date yet (P1 order is due this period), there is no evidence yet to deviate from the promised lead time of L=4. Given the downward trend in demand, using a more recent sample window (N=3) for mu_hat captures the current lower demand level (avg ~123) while maintaining a safe buffer for the (L+1)=5 period horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on 'Period 5 conclude', the order from Period 1 arrived after exactly 4 periods (promised lead time = 4). History shows demand (Period 1-5) as 191, 113, 149, 108, 61. There is a visible downward trend in demand over the first 5 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 156, and there are 502 units in-transit (from orders placed in Periods 2, 3, and 4). Since the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, these in-transit units should arrive in Periods 6, 7, and 8. The mean demand of all samples (124.4) multiplied by (1+L) would be too high given the recent decline. However, using recent_N (N=5) for demand captures the full window including the recent drops. I will set L to default (4) as it is confirmed. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the actual observed variability and mean while the system stabilizes from the initial zero-inventory phase.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand showing a downward trend from ~190 to ~60 units over 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-33.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe that the lead time is steady at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of Period 1 and 2 orders in Periods 5 and 6 respectively). Demand for chips(Regular) has significantly cooled from the initial peak in Period 1 (191 units) to a much lower range (Avg of last 3 periods: 79.6 units). The on-hand inventory is currently high (313 units) with substantial stock in transit (331 units). Given the Promised Lead Time (L=4) and the current period (Review=1), our target pipeline should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent demand average of ~80 units, the required base stock is approximately 400 units. Since on-hand + in-transit (644 units) already significantly exceeds this, the OR backend will correctly order 0 units or the minimum allowed. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to reflect the lower demand regime, preventing over-ordering while maintaining safety stock for the downward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand decreased from ~150 (P1-P3) to ~80 (P4-P6), a ~47% reduction. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-86.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime shift: Period 1-3 averaged ~151 units, while Period 4-7 averaged ~82 units. The last three periods (P5-P7) show demand of 61, 70, and 89, suggesting stabilization around a lower mean of approximately 80 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as evidenced by P1, P2, and P3 orders arriving exactly at P1+4, P2+4, and P3+4). Current inventory is high (On-hand: 442) due to the large early orders (P1-P3) arriving while demand was dropping. With L=4, the pipeline inventory includes orders from P4 (57) and P6 (56), totaling 113. Total inventory position is 555. Since a 5-period demand (L+1) at the new regime (~80/period) is only ~400 units, and we have 555, we are already overstocked. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'default' for L as the promised and actual lead times are aligned at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the 'chips(Regular)' inventory situation shows a significant surplus. On-hand inventory is 395 units, following the arrival of P1-P4 orders (lead time confirmed at 4 periods). Recent demand (P4-P8) has averaged 86.4 units (72, 108, 61, 70, 89, 104 in the full series, with the last 5 samples being 108, 61, 70, 89, 104). The carry-over insight noted a regime shift down to ~80 units starting around P4. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target pipeline (L+1) should cover roughly 5 periods of demand. 5 periods * 85 units = 425 units. Currently, On-hand (395) + In-transit (56 from P6) = 451 units. Since 451 > 425, we are overstocked relative to current demand levels. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime and use the default lead time (4) which matches observed history. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 periods to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-50.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10. Based on confirmed 'conclude' messages from Periods 5-8, the actual lead time L is consistently 4 periods (matches promised). The demand regime shifted around Period 4-5. Looking at Period 5 to Period 9, the demand samples are [61, 70, 89, 104, 69]. The mean of these last 5 periods is 78.6 units. The high on-hand inventory (326 units) resulted from large initial orders (P1-P3) arriving while demand was dropping. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent mean of 78.6, the required base stock is approximately 393 units plus a safety buffer. Current total inventory (on-hand 326 + in-transit 76) is 402 units. This is very close to the expected demand needs for the lead time horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to solidify this lower-demand regime and avoid over-ordering, given the high holding costs relative to profit (holding is 25% of profit).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Demand has stabilized since Period 4. The average demand from Period 4 to Period 10 is approximately 82 units per period (108, 61, 70, 89, 104, 69, 66). Currently, we have a very high inventory level (On-hand: 316, In-transit: 44), totaling 360 units. Given the mean demand of ~82, we have over 4 periods of supply on hand. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy that subtracts pipeline inventory. Setting mu_hat to reflect the recent stable regime (last 7 periods) will prevent excessive ordering while we bleed off the current surplus. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower-demand regime accurately.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level compared to the initial periods. Over the last 8 periods (P4-P11), the average demand is approximately 81.5 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (observed across P5, P6, P7, P8, and P10). Current on-hand inventory (231) plus in-transit units (126) equals 357 units. With lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. 5 periods * 81.5 units/period = 407.5 units. Our current inventory position (357) is slightly below this, but given the high holding cost ($1.0) and moderate profit ($4.0), being conservative is prudent to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set L to 4, mu_hat to cover 5 periods of recent demand (N=8), and sigma_hat based on the same period to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable in the low-regime (~82 units/period) for 8 consecutive periods (P4-P11). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the demand for chips(Regular) remains in the low-demand regime identified around Period 4. The average demand from Period 4 to Period 12 is approximately 81.8 units, which is significantly lower than the initial periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10. Currently, on-hand inventory is 186 units with 211 units in transit (ordered in P9, P10, P11, and P12). Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The expected demand over 5 periods is ~409 units. Our current pipeline (On-hand + In-transit) is 186 + 211 = 397 units, meaning we are well-positioned. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering P4-P12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the stabilized lower demand regime and use the default lead time which matches observations.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower level compared to the initial periods. Over the last 10 periods (P4-P13), the average demand is approximately 75 units, significantly lower than the P1-P3 average. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, and P13). In P13, we see the order from P9 arrived, maintaining this 4-period pattern. On-hand inventory is 151, and in-transit inventory is 221 (representing orders from P10, P11, P12, and P13). Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using a recent window of N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat reflects the current low-demand regime (mean ~75.1, std ~18.5). This approach helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the observed volatility in this regime.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 130 units with 240 units in-transit. Demand from Period 4 to 14 has stabilized into a lower regime, with a mean of approximately 72 units per period, significantly lower than the initial periods (P1-P3). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple arrivals (orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P9, and P10 all arrived with L=4). However, there is a noted variability in the most recent demand (P12-P14: 45, 55, 45). To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focusing on the last 11 periods (P4-P14) where the low-demand regime has been sustained. Setting N=11 ensures the calculation excludes the initial high-demand spikes. I will use the 'default' lead time of 4 as it perfectly matches historical observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime compared to the initial periods. The mean demand from Period 4 to Period 15 is approximately 70 units, but more importantly, the demand in the last four periods (P12-P15) has averaged 47.75 units, suggesting a further slight softening or stabilization at a very low level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4), meaning we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current on-hand inventory is 166, which covers about 3.5 periods of the recent low demand. Pipeline inventory is 192 (orders from P12, P13, P14, P15), which is quite high relative to the current sales rate. The OR backend will calculate base stock using L=4 and demand stats. I will use recent_N=12 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stable low-demand period since Period 4, and recent_N=5 for volatility (sigma_hat) to reflect the lower variance seen lately. This prevents over-ordering while maintaining a buffer for the 5-period risk window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized further: Mean demand for P12-P15 decreased to ~48 units/period, down from the previous low-regime average of ~80.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. Initially around 150 units (P1-P3), it dropped to ~80 (P4-P11), and has now settled into a lower regime of ~48 units per period over the last five periods (P12-P16: 45, 55, 45, 46, 50). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock policy should cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. I will use the recent_N method with N=5 to capture this latest demand regime. Current on-hand (201) plus in-transit (133) equals 334 units, which is significantly higher than the expected 5-period demand (~240 units). The OR engine will likely order 0 or very small amounts due to the excess inventory, which is appropriate to minimize holding costs while the current stock burns down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 16: Mean demand for P12-P16 is approximately 48 units/period, a significant reduction from the previous ~80 units/period regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime starting from Period 12. Analysis of the most recent 6 periods (P12-P17) reveals a mean demand of approximately 50.5 units per period (45, 55, 45, 46, 50, 62). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate, as confirmed by arrivals through Period 17 (the P13 order arriving exactly in P17). Current inventory levels are high (On-hand: 169 + In-transit: 103 = 272 total), whereas the required pipeline for 5 periods (L+1) at the current demand rate is approximately 250 units. Therefore, I will use recent_N=6 to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default method for lead time as the observed L matches the promised L of 4. This will allow the OR backend to gradually reduce replenishment orders until inventory aligns with the current lower demand phase.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime starting from Period 12. For the last 7 periods (P12-P18), demand has averaged 49.3 units per period (45, 55, 45, 46, 50, 62, 38). Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P13 through P18 conclude messages), matching the promised lead time of 4. There are currently 174 units on-hand and 60 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 15 and 16). Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. With an average demand of ~50, we need approx 250 units total pipeline. As current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 234, a small replenishment order is expected. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime, and default for L as actual lead time matches promised.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed for Period 12-18: Mean demand is 49.3 units/period (+/- 6.4 std dev). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 12. For the last 8 periods (P12-P19), the mean demand is approximately 48.25 units per period with a standard deviation of 7.4. Applying the 'recent_N' method with N=8 reflects this current stable environment better than including the initial high-demand periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (promised lead time). The current on-hand inventory (163) plus in-transit (51) equals 214 units, which is significantly above the expected total demand for the review + lead time period (approx. 5 * 48 = 240 units, but with a high service level requirement q=0.8, the safety stock target is also relevant). However, given high on-hand levels relative to current demand, the OR backend's capped policy will moderate further ordering to manage holding costs while maintaining the service level.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a low-volume regime starting around Period 12. For the period range P12-P20, the average demand is approximately 48.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 8.0 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every order arrival from P5 through P20 (14 consecutive arrivals). Currently, on-hand inventory is 129 units and in-transit is 67 units, totaling 196 units of pipeline inventory. Given a lead time of 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an expected demand of ~242 units (5 * 48.4) to cover current and lead time periods, the backend will calculate an order to bridge the gap between 196 and the calculated base stock. I am setting N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of this current stable demand regime (P12-P20).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime since Period 12. Analysis of Period 12 to Period 21 shows a mean demand of approximately 48.8 units per period (with a standard deviation of about 8.5). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16 all arriving exactly 4 periods later. The current on-hand inventory is 87 units and there are 130 units in-transit (from orders in Periods 19, 20, 21), totaling 217 units of pipeline inventory. Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. At a mean of ~49, the required base stock is approximately 245-260 units depending on the safety factor. I am using recent_N (N=10) to capture this stable low-demand regime (P12-P21) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and setting L to 'calculate' as the lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime starting from Period 12. Analysis of the most recent 11 periods (P12-P22) shows a mean demand of approximately 49.9 units per period (sum: 549) with relatively low variance. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (e.g., P16 order arrived in P20). Currently, on-hand inventory is 31 units, while in-transit inventory is 172 units (sum of orders from P19-P22). This pipeline of 172 units plus 31 on-hand (203 total) covers roughly 4 periods of demand at the current rate (4 x 50 = 200). Since the order placed in Period 23 will arrive in Period 27 (providing 5 periods of lookahead: P23-P27), I will use N=11 to capture the stabilized regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The OR backend will balance the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1) to maintain a target service level suitable for the current demand distribution.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime starting from Period 12, with mean demand averaging approximately 49 units per period (P12-P23 range: 38 to 62). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is low (11 units) but we have a large pipeline in-transit (206 units). Specifically, orders from Period 20 (42 units), Period 21 (63 units), Period 22 (42 units), and Period 23 (59 units) are expected to arrive in Periods 24, 25, 26, and 27 respectively, totaling 206 units. Given the lead time L=4, we must calculate parameters to cover Demand across (L+1)=5 periods. The backend OR policy calculates base stock as (1+L) * mean + z * sqrt(1+L) * std. Using the stable regime P12-P23 (N=12), the mean is 49.08 and std is 7.5. This results in a target inventory level (~280 units) that is already nearly satisfied by the pipeline + on-hand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture this current stable demand regime accurately and 'default' for lead time as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~48-50 units/period since Period 12. Recent demand (P19-P24) averaged 47 units/period, confirming this regime. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P19 order arrived P23, P20 order arrived P24). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (19 units) but in-transit inventory is high (207 units), representing several upcoming deliveries from orders placed in P21 (63), P22 (42), P23 (59), and P24 (43). Given the promised lead time L=4, the pipeline coverage needed is (L+1) or 5 periods of demand. At 50 units/period, the target base stock is ~250 units. With current on-hand (19) + in-transit (207) = 226 units, the OR engine will naturally place a small adjusting order. I will use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat to capture the current stable low-demand regime since Period 12, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility in this period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime. Since Period 12, the mean demand has hovered around 46-48 units per period, consistently lower than the previous ~80 units regime. Over the last 5 periods (P21-P25), the mean demand is 39.4 units, with a noticeable dip to 20 units in Period 25. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 62 and in-transit units at 174 (covering orders from P22, P23, P24, and P25), the pipeline is sufficient to cover about 6 periods of demand at the current rate (~40 units/period). I will use recent_N with N=14 to capture the stability of the current low-demand regime (P12-P25) while acknowledging the slight downward drift. This balances the service level while preventing excess holding costs in a declining demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability further confirmed for Period 12-25: Mean demand has trended slightly lower to ~46 units/period (compared to previous 49.3). Period 25 showed a significant dip to 20 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a low-regime state since Period 12, with a slight further decrease observed recently. Specifically, over the last 15 periods (P12-P26), the mean demand is approximately 45 units. The most recent demand (P25-P26) shows even lower figures (20 and 32 units respectively). The service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80 suggests we should maintain a lean inventory to avoid high holding costs relative to profit. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Given the stability of the current regime, I am using recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established lower demand level while discounting the much higher initial periods. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current consumption rates (L+1 = 5 periods of demand), preventing over-ordering as we have 72 units on-hand and 147 in-transit.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume regime since Period 12, with a further stabilization observed from Period 16 onwards. Over the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the mean demand is approximately 43 units per period. The most recent three periods (P25-P27) show even lower demand (20, 32, 32), averaging 28 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 99 and in-transit at 115 (totaling 214 units), and a predicted demand of ~215 units over the next 5 periods (L+1), we are currently well-stocked. I will use recent_N=12 to capture the current stable demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring we don't over-react to the very low P25 demand while still reflecting the overall lower trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable in the low-volume range: Mean demand from P16 to P27 is 43.0 units/period. Period 25-27 specifically show a tighter range of 20-32 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime. Since Period 16, mean demand has been approximately 43.0 units per period. The most recent three periods (P25-P27) showed even lower demand ranging from 20-32 units, although Period 28 saw a slight rebound to 47. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P24 order arrived in P28). With 95 units on hand and 97 units in-transit (total 192), and an expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1) of roughly 215 units (43 * 5), current inventory is nearly sufficient. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 to capture the stable behavior since the P16 shift, providing a balanced forecast that accounts for recent variability while smoothing out the outlier in P25. Sigma_hat is set with 'recent_N' N=13 to reflect the current regime's volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 29, the mean is approximately 43.4 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 11.2. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual arrivals (confirmed by the Period 29 conclude message showing the P25 order arrived with lead_time=4). On-hand inventory is currently 91 units and in-transit is 115 units, totaling 206 units. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock should cover L+1=5 periods of demand. At the current mean, 5 periods of demand is ~217 units. The OR backend will calculate the order based on recent_N=14 to capture this stable low-demand window (P16-P29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-volume regime since Period 12, with a more recent shift from Period 16 onwards averaging approximately 43.1 units per period (P16-P30). Recent demand (P25-P30) has been slightly lower but consistently within the 20-50 range. Lead time is highly consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by all observed arrivals since P5). Inventory currently sits at 60 units on-hand with 130 units in-transit (orders from P27-P30). Given the high holding cost compared to profit ($1.0 vs $4.0), and the fact that current pipeline inventory (190 total) covers over 4 periods of demand at the current rate (~43 units/period), I will use the recent_N method (N=15, covering the current stable regime since P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. L will be kept at 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time history.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-volume regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 42 units per period (P16-P31). The most recent demand samples (P28-P31: 47, 34, 46, 36) support this, averaging 40.75 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P29, P30, and P31). With an on-hand inventory of 51 and 150 units in-transit (covering orders from P28-P31), the pipeline is healthy. I will use recent_N=16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime since Period 16, and use the default lead time (L=4) as it aligns perfectly with historical performance.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a stable low-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 17 periods (P16-P32), the mean demand is approximately 43.1 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 10.3. There is no evidence of recent seasonal spikes or significant shifts in the last few periods (P30-P32 demand was 46, 36, 51). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently verified by recent arrivals (e.g., P28 order arrived in P32). On-hand inventory is currently low (25 units), but there are 158 units in-transit, which covers the expected demand over the lead time. To maintain the service level while managing holding costs, I will use 'recent_N' for all parameters with N=17 to capture the characteristics of this stable regime perfectly.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a consistent low-volume regime. Over the last 15 periods (P19-P33), the mean demand is approximately 40.5 units/period with a standard deviation of about 10.9. The lead time remains highly reliable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from P25-P29 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The Current Status shows 45 units on-hand and 163 units in-transit (orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33). Given the lead time (L=4) and review period (1), we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a mean of ~40.5, our target pipeline + on-hand should be around 202.5 units plus a safety stock. The current total inventory position is 208 units (45 + 163), which aligns well with the target. I will use a recent_N of 15 for demand to capture this stable regime while excluding the much higher initial demand of the game. L is set to 'calculate' as it has been consistently 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability further confirmed for Period 19-33: Mean demand is 40.5 units/period (std dev 10.9). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime since Period 19, with an average demand of approximately 40.5 units per period and a standard deviation of 10.9. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistently accurate based on the arrival of orders from Period 25 through Period 30. Current on-hand inventory is 20 units, and there are 149 units in transit (ordered in Periods 31-34). Total pipeline inventory is 169 units. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Estimating for 5 periods: 40.5 * 5 = 202.5. The current total (169) suggests a small order is likely required to maintain service levels. I will use recent_N with N=16 (covering Periods 19-34) to capture the current stable demand mean and volatility while excluding earlier higher-demand regimes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $268.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown an increasing trend in recent periods (P34: 55, P35: 69), deviating from the long-term stable mean of ~40 units observed between P19-P33. This has resulted in a stockout at the end of Period 35 (on-hand = 0). While the Carry-Over Insights suggest stability around 40.5 units, the recent 2-period surge requires a more responsive forecast to prevent further lost sales, especially since L=4 is long. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent trend and slightly higher variance while still maintaining some historical grounding. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1), helping to recover from the current stockout and match the apparent demand upswing.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight uptick in volatility over the last 5 periods (P32-P36), with demand values of 51, 28, 55, 69, and 19. The mean demand for this recent window is 44.4 units/period, which is slightly higher than the average of 40.5 noted in Period 34. Due to the recent stockout in Period 35 (where demand 69 exceeded on-hand inventory), I am increasing the demand forecast slightly to ensure better service levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P31 and P32 orders arrived in P35 and P36 respectively, both with 4-period lead times). I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the most current demand fluctuations while respecting the stable lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in P35-P36 (range 19-69), causing a brief stockout in P35. Mean demand for P32-P36 is 44.4 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-2.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility and a slight downward trend in the very last few periods (P36: 19, P37: 13), though P35 was a peak (69). The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P28-P37) is approximately 39.8 units. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 54 and 194 units in-transit (covering orders from periods 34, 35, 36, and 37), the pipeline is well-stocked. To account for the recent volatility while acknowledging the low demand in the last two periods, I will use a recent_N window for demand and sigma. N=10 captures the current low-volume regime while including the recent volatility spike (P35) to ensure the sigma_hat provides an adequate safety buffer, preventing a repeat of the P35 stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $150.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown increased volatility starting from Period 35, with recent demand values of 69, 19, 13, and 44. This follows a long stable period of ~40 units. The mean demand for the last 7 periods (P32-P38) is approximately 39.1, but the volatility (sigma) has increased significantly compared to the P19-P33 regime. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With only 12 periods remaining, I need to stabilize the pipeline inventory to account for the current 'On-hand' of 26 and a large 'In-transit' of 178. The backend OR engine will calculate a base stock based on demand over (L+1)=5 periods. Setting L to 4 reflects the proven lead time. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the latest demand trend including the high-demand period 35, and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=7 to account for the recent increase in volatility, ensuring enough safety stock to prevent another stockout while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased starting Period 35 (range 13-69). Current mean demand (P32-P38) is 39.1 units/period with significantly higher variance than the previous P19-P33 regime.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility phase since Period 35, with demand ranging from 13 to 69 units. While the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P30-P39) is approximately 36.1 units, the recent fluctuations make the standard deviation higher than in previous stable regimes. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With 66 units on hand and 152 in-transit (Total pipeline: 218), and an expected 5-period demand (L+1) around 180-200 units, the inventory position is currently healthy. I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this increased volatility while maintaining a responsive forecast, as the product has experienced a stockout recently (P35) due to this variance. The service level (q) is high (0.8), so the OR backend will prioritize avoiding stockouts despite the holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P35-P40) has been highly volatile, ranging from 13 to 69 units, with a mean of approximately 33.8 units/period. The Carry-over insight for Period 39 correctly identified this increased variance. Currently, we have 93 units on hand and 94 units in transit (ordered in P37, P39, and P40). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the OR backend targets a roughly 80% service level. I will use the recent_N method with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime (P35-P40) without being overly influenced by the previous very stable low-demand period. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent spikes while not over-ordering during the subsequent dips.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains elevated (P35-P40 range: 13-69); mean demand for this 6-period window is ~33.8 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a period of increased volatility since Period 35, with demand ranging from 13 to 69 units. The mean demand for this recent high-volatility window (P35-P41) is approximately 34.3 units per period (19, 13, 44, 20, 38, 41, and include P35's 69). This is lower than the previous regime (~40 units), but the volatility is much higher, requiring a larger safety stock. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P37 order arrived P41). I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this specific volatile regime. Using N=7 covers the transition from P35 to the present, allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock based on the most relevant recent variance while accounting for the lower mean.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a more volatile period since Period 35, with a recent 8-period (P35-P42) mean of 32.1 units/period and high variance (range 12-69). The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 93 units, and the pipeline inventory is 106 units (consisting of orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42). Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 199, which covers roughly 6 periods of the current average demand. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), maintaining a higher service level is beneficial to prevent stockouts like the one seen in P35. To capture the current volatility and mean while smoothing out the very recent dip (12 units in P42), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering P35-P42) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the increased variance and lower mean demand of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains elevated since Period 35 (range 12-69); mean demand for the most recent 8 periods (P35-P42) is 32.1 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we observe high demand volatility that began around Period 35. Recent demand samples (P35-P43: 69, 19, 13, 44, 20, 38, 41, 12, 42) result in a mean of 33.1 units. The most recent period (P43) had a demand of 42. However, there's a missing shipment from Period 38 (ordered 0, but technically a lead-time slot) and the shipment from Period 41 (ordered 22) is expected in P45. Currently, on-hand inventory is 85 and in-transit is 72. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we are ordering for a 5-period window (L+1). To remain responsive to the high volatility while acknowledging the lower mean, I am using a recent window of N=9 (P35-P43) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 allows the backend to capture the current volatility and mean shift accurately since the regime change at Period 35.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-87.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a low-volume, high-volatility phase starting around Period 35. The most recent demand (Period 44) was exceptionally low at 1 unit, which significantly pulled down the recent average. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P35-P44) is approximately 29.7 units. However, given the extreme volatility (range 1 to 69), a slightly more responsive window (recent_N=7) is used for mu_hat to capture the most recent downward trend while acknowledging the volatility. The current on-hand inventory (91) plus in-transit (109) totals 200 units, which is ample against current demand. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (P40 order arrived in P44). The parameters aim to maintain a high service level given the high profit margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), while reacting to the lower mean demand observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme since Period 35 (range 1-69). Period 44 recorded a significant low of 1 unit. Mean demand for P35-P44 has dropped to ~29.7 units/period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility phase since Period 35, with recent values ranging from 1 to 69 units. The mean demand for the most recent 11 periods (P35-P45) is approximately 32.0 units per period, with a standard deviation of 21.6. Period 45 demand spiked to 63 units after a record low of 1 unit in Period 44. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (confirmed by multiple arrivals, including the P41 order arriving in P45). With on-hand inventory at 50 units and 87 units in-transit (orders from P42, P43, and P44), and only 5 periods remaining in the game (P46-P50), the strategy focuses on maintaining service levels through the final horizon while mitigating holding costs. I will use N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime and set L=4 to match the stable observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: High demand volatility confirmed from P35-P45 (range 1-69, std dev ~21.6). Mean demand stabilized around 32 units/period in this 11-period window.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility phase since Period 35, with demand samples ranging from 1 to 69. The mean demand for this recent high-volatility window (P35-P46) is approximately 32.1 units per period. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods throughout the game history. Given that we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 47 of 50), and on-hand inventory (50) plus in-transit (113) totals 163 units, our pipeline is well-stocked relative to current demand levels. I will use the last 12 periods (P35-P46) to capture the current high-variance regime, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the increased volatility (sigma_hat) to avoid stockouts while targeting the stabilized mean (mu_hat).

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 50). The primary goal is to minimize ending inventory (holding costs) while maintaining a sufficient service level for the final three periods (48, 49, 50). The lead time is consistently 4 periods, meaning any orders placed from Period 47 onwards will not arrive before the game ends (P47 order arrives P51, P48 arrives P52). Current on-hand inventory is 25, and there is a significant pipeline of 159 units. Specifically, looking at the history: P43 (0 units), P44 (44 units), P45 (0 units), P46 (69 units). Based on lead time L=4, the P44 order (44 units) is expected to arrive during Period 48, and the P46 order (69 units) is expected during Period 50. This provides a total expected supply of 25 (on-hand) + 44 (P48 arrival) + 69 (P50 arrival) = 138 units. Recent mean demand (P35-P47) is approximately 32 units/period, suggesting total expected demand for the remaining 3 periods is ~96 units. The existing pipeline already exceeds this. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=13) to capture the current volatile regime, but keep L at default. The backend OR logic will naturally minimize ordering as the pipeline inventory (159) far exceeds the base stock level calculated for a 32-unit mean demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we observe the game is nearing its conclusion (Period 50). The current demand context remains characterized by the high volatility regime that began around Period 35. The mean demand over the last 14 periods (P35-P48) is approximately 32.4 units, with a wide range of 1 to 69 units. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 44 order in Period 48). Currently, on-hand inventory is 36 units and in-transit is 135 units. The in-transit inventory consists of orders from P46 (69 units), P47 (46 units), and P48 (20 units), which are expected to arrive in P50, P51, and P52 respectively. Since the game ends at Period 50, only the arrival in P50 is relevant. I will set the parameters to reflect this recent volatility and lower mean demand using a lookback period (N=14) to capture the current regime since the last major shift. This ensures the base stock reflects the current risk profile while the cap prevents excessive ordering as the simulation ends.

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are at the end of the simulation. The inventory at the start of Period 49 was depleted (ending on-hand 0) due to a demand of 49 units exceeding the available 36 on-hand units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since Period 35, demand has been highly volatile (range 1-69). The mean demand over the last 15 periods (P35-P49) is approximately 33.5 units. To ensure coverage for the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (total 5 periods), and accounting for high volatility (std dev ~21.6), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 15-period lookback window to capture this higher-variance regime. L is kept at the default promised lead time of 4, which aligns with historical observations.

Carry-over insight: High demand volatility regime (P35-P49) confirmed: mean demand ~33.5 units/period, range 1-69, std dev ~21.6. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
