Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1. The historical data provided (Period 1 to 5) suggests a mean demand of approximately 175.2 units and a standard deviation of 15.6. Since we have no historical arrival data yet, I will use the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4). To account for the 'current period plus lead time' window (L+1 = 5 periods), the base stock calculation needs a mu_hat covering those 5 periods. Using the 'default' method for the first decision is prudent as it establishes a baseline using all available history. However, given that demand feels relatively stable but has a slight variance, I'll rely on the default backend calculations which will aggregate the provided samples. The OR backend will use the formula: base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302 with z* derived from the high service level (19/(19+1)=0.95 quantile), which should build sufficient safety stock for the lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The initial demand in Period 1 was 225, which exceeded the initial on-hand inventory of 0, resulting in significant lost sales. We placed an order of 202 units in Period 1, which is now in-transit. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, this shipment is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the start of Period 6 (Period 5 conclude). At this stage, we only have one demand observation (225) and five pre-game historical samples (avg: 175.2). The Period 1 demand (225) is significantly higher than the pre-game average, suggesting a possible upward shift or high volatility. Given we have no concluded lead times yet, I will use the promised lead time (L=4). For demand estimation (mu_hat), I will include the recent high observation to ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (202 units) and Period 2 (225 units) are currently in-transit (total 427 units). Following the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 6 decision phase. Because on-hand inventory is currently 0, we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1 and 2. Historical demand data shows five samples: 187, 189, 158, 158, 184 (Mean \u2248 175.2). I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat, which allows the backend to utilize all available historical samples and the promised lead time of 4. This ensures that the base stock level (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is calculated based on the full demand distribution, balancing the high profit margin ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Consequently, our current 'on-hand' inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts from Periods 1-3. Total units in-transit (648) match the sum of orders from Periods 1-3 (202 + 225 + 221). Historical demand samples (187, 189, 158, 158, 184) show a mean of 175.2 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 15.6. Given L=4, the base stock should cover L+1 (5) periods of demand. I will use the default method for L (promised lead time) and recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the available historical demand data for the chips(Regular) SKU. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to achieve a high service level given the high profit ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Consequently, our on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced lost sales for the first four periods. The total in-transit quantity of 873 units represents orders from Periods 1-4. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock must cover L+1 (5) periods of demand. Historical demand for the first 5 samples is (187, 189, 158, 158, 184), with a mean of 175.2 and a standard deviation of 15.42. I will use the 'default' methods to allow the OR engine to use all available samples for these baseline calculations, as no significant demand regime shift or lead-time deviation is yet confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3798.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived at the start of Period 5 after a lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 185.5 units (225, 159, 165, 179, 200). Current on-hand inventory is low (2 units), but there are 770 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5), which are expected to arrive in Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively. Since the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, I will use the 'default' lead time of 4. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' calculations based on all available samples (N=5) to stabilize the base stock calculation, as the demand appears relatively stable without a clear regime shift yet.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2813.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by arrivals in Period 5 (from P1 order) and Period 6 (from P2 order). The current on-hand inventory is 75 units, and there are 755 units in-transit (orders from Periods 3, 4, 5, and 6). Demand has been relatively stable, with the most recent samples being 225, 159, 165, 179, 200, and 152. The mean of these 6 samples is 180. I will prioritize recent demand patterns to set the mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since the lead time is stable at 4, I will use the default (promised) lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use the last 6 samples to capture the recent mean and variance, balancing the replenishment against the 4-period lead time + 1 period coverage (L+1=5).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 arriving in Periods 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Demand has been relatively stable with no clear seasonal trend or shift detected in the last 7 periods (mean demand ~178). Current on-hand inventory is 129, with 707 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). The order from P4 is expected to arrive during Period 8 resolution. I will continue to use the promised lead time (L=4) as it aligns with observations. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' (all-sample) calculations to maintain stability, as the sample size is still small (N=7) and no clear regime shift is evident.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of concluded periods 5 through 8 confirms the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8), which matches the promised lead time. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable across the first 8 periods. Calculating the mean demand from all 8 samples (225, 159, 165, 179, 200, 152, 167, 168) gives an average of approximately 176.88. Since there are no distinct seasonal spikes or regime shifts observed yet in the data, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat for the (L+1) period window. The pipeline inventory (610 units) is well-distributed, with orders arriving every period to meet the stable demand of ~177 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2755.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from Period 5 through 9 (orders from P1-P5) consistently show an actual lead time of 4 periods. The average demand across all 9 concluded periods is approximately 174.1 units. Recent demand (last 4 periods: P6-P9) is slightly lower, averaging 159.75 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time since the observed lead time matches the promised lead time. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the overall stable demand pattern while incorporating the initial higher demand samples. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=9 to ensure adequate safety stock for the lead time plus current period (L+1=5 periods). Current on-hand is 133, and in-transit is 673, totaling 806 units across the pipeline, which aligns with approximately 4.6 periods of average demand.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Historical analysis shows that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history across the first 10 periods shows a mean of approximately 170.7 units (Sum=1707). Over the most recent 5 periods (P6-P10), demand has been slightly lower, averaging 155.8 units (152, 167, 168, 152, 140). The SKU has a high critical ratio (~0.95), meaning we should favor service level over holding cost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 203 and in-transit is 617. I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the slight downward trend in demand, while using the default method for sigma_hat to maintain a safe buffer based on full history volatility, and the default lead time (4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2884.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in all arrivals from P5 to P11). Demand has remained relatively stable: the mean demand over all 11 periods is 167.0, while the mean of the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is slightly lower at 158.0. Given the consistent lead time (L=4) and stable demand pattern, the base stock should cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current inventory position is 697 (213 on-hand + 484 in-transit), which covers roughly 4.2 periods of mean demand. Since demand has stabilized slightly lower than the initial periods, I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full distribution while recognizing the stable lead time. The service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, which the OR backend will handle via z-score. I will use 'default' or 'recent_N' for the OR backend to calculate the appropriate levels.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 12 periods, with an average of approximately 161 units per period and no clear upwards or downwards trend. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (matches promised). As of Period 13, on-hand inventory is 209 units and in-transit is 566 units, totaling 775 units of pipeline inventory. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Using a mean of 161, expected demand over 5 periods is 805 units. My current total inventory (775) is slightly below this target. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the full stable regime and ensure the OR backend orders enough to reach the base stock level required for the high service level (Profit >> Holding Cost).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable since Period 1: avg ~161 units/period with moderate variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1989.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained steady since Period 1, with an average of approximately 161 units per period and a slight downward trend in the most recent observations (last 3 periods: 163, 132, 118). The lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised, confirmed by 9 consecutive arrivals (P1 to P9). On-hand inventory is currently at 253, and we have a pipeline of 557 units. Since there are no regime changes or lead-time drifts detected, I will use a recent window (N=13) to calculate demand statistics to stay responsive to the slight downward trend while maintaining a stable forecast for the OR backend. This approach balances the high service level requirements (high profit relative to holding cost) with the current healthy inventory levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2533.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 161 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals from Periods 1 through 10, all of which arrived with an actual lead time of 4. Currently, the system has 260 units on-hand and 511 units in-transit (orders from Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14). Since the lead time is stable at 4, I will use 'default' for L. For demand forecasting, the last 14 periods (all available history) provide a robust estimate of the stable regime, so I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this mean and variance. This ensures the base stock calculation covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while balancing the $19.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2960.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~150 units over the last 10 periods (P6-P15), which is slightly lower than the all-time average of 162. Using a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will better capture this current regime while smoothing out the early period spikes. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time, so I will use 'calculate' to rely on the observed historical consistency. The system has 610 units in transit and 137 on-hand, which is sufficient given the 5-period window (L+1) we are managing, but we must maintain the base stock level to account for potential demand variability and the 19:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~150 units/period (P6-P15 average: 150.2) compared to early high spikes.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean compared to the initial periods. Over the last 10 periods (P7-P16), the average demand is approximately 145.2 units per period (167+168+152+140+163+132+118+147+163+122)/10. The promised lead time L=4 is consistently being met as observed in the 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is healthy at 225 units, and there are 465 units in transit (orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16). Given the consistent lead time performance, I will use L=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the current stable demand regime while filtering out the higher variance seen in the first few periods (P1-P5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~145 units/period over the last 10 periods (P7-P16), significantly lower than the initial P1-P5 average of ~185.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the initial 5 periods. From Period 7 to Period 17, the mean demand is approximately 144.9 units per period (sum: 1594 / 11 periods). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival since Period 5. The total pipeline inventory (On-hand 249 + In-transit 427 = 676) is healthy when compared to the (L+1) demand coverage required (approx 145 * 5 = 725). Given the stable demand regime since the drop after Period 5, I will use recent_N with N=12 (covering Periods 6-17) to capture the current lower mean and variance, which helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering based on the high initial demand (P1-P5). This aligns with the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1643.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained decrease over the last several periods. The mean demand for the most recent 10 periods (P9-P18) is approximately 136.6, which is lower than the earlier averages cited in carry-over insights. Recent demand specifically (P13-P18) has averaged 130 units, with Period 18 showing the lowest demand yet at 100 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent arrivals (P14 order arrived in P18). Current on-hand + in-transit is 696. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this downward shift while maintaining enough historical variance to handle potential spikes. This ensures the OR backend doesn't over-order into a declining demand trend while still targeting a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed at Period 18: 10-period average (P9-P18) dropped to 136.6 units, with most recent 5-period average (P14-P18) at 132.2 units.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained decline. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P10-P19) is 134.6 units, while the most recent 5-period average (P15-P19) is 129.2 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised. With an on-hand inventory of 264 units and in-transit inventory of 362 units (total pipeline of 626), the system is currently overstocked relative to the observed demand trend. I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend adjusts the base stock downwards, aiming to reduce holding costs while maintaining a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed at Period 20: 10-period average (P10-P19) is 134.6 units; 5-period average (P15-P19) is 129.2 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2511.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level compared to the start of the simulation. Analysis of recent demand indicates a sustained decrease: the 10-period average (P11-P20) is 134.8 units, while the 5-period average (P16-P20) is 125.0 units. The most recent demand (P20) was 142. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, with the P16 order arriving exactly as scheduled in P20. Given the consistent downward trend, I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent local demand distribution (mean approx 125) and using the default lead time (4 periods). This will help the OR engine reduce safety stock and base stock levels to avoid excessive holding costs on the current 187 units on-hand and 417 units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 10-period average (P11-P20) is 134.8; 5-period average (P16-P20) dropped further to 125.0 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained downward trend. The most recent 5-period average (P17-P21) is 121.6 units, while the 10-period average (P12-P21) is 129.0 units. Given the consistent decrease observed over the last several periods, I am setting N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower regime and prevent over-ordering which results in excessive holding costs. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 17 order in Period 21. Current on-hand inventory (197) and in-transit units (381) are factored into the OR backend calculation to reach the target base stock based on these updated parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 5-period average (P17-P21) is 121.6 units, confirming a shift below the previous 130-140 range.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained decrease. The 5-period average (P18-P22) is 121.4 units, and the 10-period average (P13-P22) is 128.4 units, significantly lower than earlier periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (193 units) and significant in-transit stock (358 units), the priority is to adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) downward to reflect this new regime and prevent excess holding costs. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent downward shift (~121 units/period), and recent_N with N=10 for sigma_hat to provide a stable volatility estimate over the recent period range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 5-period average (P18-P22) is 121.4 units, maintaining the downward trend from 130-140 range.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained decrease. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P14-P23) is 126.1 units, and the most recent 5 periods (P19-P23) average 114.0 units. Specifically, the last three periods recorded demand of 105, 124, and 97 units. Given this downward trend from the earlier 130-140 range, I am adjusting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the lower demand regime (avg 114.0) while maintaining responsiveness. Lead time continues to be stable at 4 periods based on historical conclude messages. Current on-hand inventory (158) plus in-transit (419) totals 577 units, which is approximately 5 periods of demand at the current average rate. Setting mu_hat to reflect the 5rd-period average (L+1 = 5) and using recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 5-period average (P19-P23) dropped to 114.0 units, confirming a level shift below the previous 120-130 range.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained decrease. The most recent 5-period average (P20-P24) is 115.2 units, and the 10-period average (P15-P24) is 120.4 units. This is a significant drop from the initial average of ~185. To avoid excessive holding costs in the face of this declining trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand level (~115 units/period). This represents a decrease from the previous regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by all historical arrivals arriving on schedule.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 5-period average (P20-P24) is 115.2 units, solidifying the shift below the 120 range observed in earlier periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent downward trend over the last several periods. The 5-period average (P21-P25) is currently 105.0 units, illustrating a significant decrease from the early periods and even the more recent 120-130 range. We are now in a lower regime centered around 100-110 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 393) plus On-hand (158) totals 551 units. With an expected demand of ~105 per period over the 5-period horizon (L+1), we need approximately 525 units in the system. The current total inventory of 551 is slightly above this requirement, but since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy with a specific service level and cap, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this latest downward shift and prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining availability for the lower demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 5-period average (P21-P25) dropped to 105.0 units, confirming a new sustained low level below the previous 114-120 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1285.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained downward trend. The most recent 5-period average (P22-P26) is 99.4 units, and the 10-period average (P17-P26) is 110.1 units. This confirms multiple regime shifts from the initial ~180 range down through 130 and now stabilizing around or below 100. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (178) and significant in-transit stock (317), the current pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) of demand at the current average. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level close to the critical ratio (19/20 = 0.95), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the most recent level shift (avg ~99). This will likely result in the OR backend placing zero or very small orders until the inventory position rationalizes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 5-period average (P22-P26) dropped further to 99.4 units, confirming a new sustained low level below the previous 105-115 range.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained downward trend. The most recent 5-period average (P23-P27) is 87.4 units (70, 77, 91, 108, 97 from the samples provided in history), which is a significant drop from the previous regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current inventory (On-hand: 231, In-transit: 262) is quite high relative to this new demand level. To prevent overstocking and minimize holding costs while the backend policy naturally adjusts, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and volatility regime. This allows the base stock level to reflect current market realities rather than historical highs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 5-period average (P23-P27) dropped to 87.4 units, confirming a further shift below the previous ~100 range.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a significant downward trend. The most recent 5-period average (P24-P28) has dropped to 85.4 units (samples: 108, 91, 77, 70, 81), which is a clear shift from previous levels. Given this sustained decline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (recent_N=5) to avoid over-ordering based on older, higher demand data. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by the latest arrival in Period 28 (ordered P24, lead_time 4). On-hand inventory (242) and In-transit (177) are quite high relative to current demand, so the OR backend should naturally reduce order quantities as these parameters are updated.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 5-period average (P24-P28) dropped to 85.4 units, confirming a new sustained low level below the previous ~100 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $977.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a significant and sustained downward trend. The most recent demand (Period 29) was 65 units, and the 5-period average (P25-P29) has dropped to 76.8 units (91, 77, 70, 81, 65). This is a stark decrease from earlier periods where demand was consistently above 130. Given this clear regime shift, I am using a recent_N method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to rapidly adjust the base stock level downward and avoid excessive holding costs. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which is consistently observed in the arrival data. With on-hand inventory at 258 and in-transit at 159, the total coverage is already significantly higher than expected demand for the next (L+1)=5 periods. The OR backend will likely minimize ordering due to this oversupply.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 5-period average (P25-P29) dropped to 76.8 units, confirming a further shift from the previous ~85 range observed in P28.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2201.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to show a significant downward trend, though Period 30 saw a temporary spike (124 units) compared to the previous four periods (average 73.25). Despite the spike, the 5-period average (P26-P30) is 81.0 units, and the 10-period average (P21-P30) is 87.8 units. The long-term trend (P1-P30) clearly shows a decline from ~180 to below 90. Current on-hand inventory is 155 units with 143 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the sustained overall decline and the recent volatility, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime while dampening the effect of the P30 spike. I will use the default lead time (promised L=4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 10-period average (P21-P30) is 87.8 units, reflecting a sustained shift below the previous ~100 level, despite a one-period spike in P30.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1477.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a sustained downward regime. The most recent 5-period average (P27-P31) is 85.0 units, which is consistent with the trend identified in recent Carry-over Insights (approx. 85-87 units), despite a single spike to 124 in P30. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 138, with a pipeline of 204. To prevent further stock accumulation during this low-demand phase, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower mean and reduced volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current ~85 units/period demand level rather than the historical high of ~150-180.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new lower level: 5-period average (P27-P31) is 85.0 units, confirming the shift below the previous ~100 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1875.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level compared to previous periods. The most recent 5-period average (P28-P32) is 91.2 units (81, 65, 124, 85, 101), though P30 and P32 highlight significant variance. The 10-period average (P23-P32) is 90.7 units. Given the steady downward trend followed by this stabilization, setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) provides a balanced forecast for the next 5-period window (L+1). L remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current volatility while accounting for the recent demand spikes. On-hand inventory is currently low (44), but with 321 units in-transit, the pipeline is sufficient to cover demand during the lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~91 units/period since Period 28 (P23-P32 average: 90.7), significantly lower than the ~185 observed at the start of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $713.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward trend throughout the game, starting at ~185 and most recently stabilizing at a lower level. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P24-P33) is 85.3 units, while the most recent 5-period average (P29-P33) is 83.2 units. Although the average over the last 5 periods suggests a slight decrease, the demand in P33 was particularly low (41), which might be an outlier or signal a further drop; however, P31 and P32 were 85 and 101 respectively. To balance the risk of stockouts against high holding costs in a declining trend, I will use a recent_N approach with N=10 to capture the current lower regime while providing enough buffer for the observed volatility (e.g., the spike to 124 in P30). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 66, and in-transit is 378, which is high relative to current demand, so the OR backend's capped policy will likely limit new ordering to prevent overstocking during this demand decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~85 units/period: 10-period average (P24-P33) is 85.3 units, confirming a significant sustained reduction from the initial ~180-200 range.

The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a downward trend, having stabilized at a much lower level than the initial periods. The recent 5-period average (P30-P34) is approximately 80.8 units (124, 85, 101, 41, 53). Although P30 saw a spike, subsequent periods (P31-P34) have averaged only 70 units. The 10-period average (P25-P34) is 94.1 units. I will use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat to capture this lower volume while weighting the recent decline more heavily than the full history. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to reflect the current volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, which is consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is low (18), but there is a significant amount in transit (438) relative to current demand levels ($mu_hat$ for $L+1$ will be ~470). My chosen parameters will guide the OR backend to maintain a base stock level appropriate for the ~80-95 units/period range, balancing the high service level requirement with the current downward demand shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 10-period average (P25-P34) is 94.1 units, while the most recent 4-period average (P31-P34) has dropped further to 70.0 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant and sustained downward trend. The most recent demand (P35) was 61 units, and the 5-period average (P31-P35) is 68.2 units. The 10-period average (P26-P35) is 81.3. This is a dramatic drop from the game's start (~180-200 units). To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand environment, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this newer, lower regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which I will continue to use via the default method. The inventory position (On-hand: 86 + In-transit: 335 = 421) is quite high compared to current demand levels, so the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in small or zero orders until the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 5-period average (P31-P35) is 68.2 units, confirming a sustained shift below the previous ~85 level observed in P34.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1510.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant and sustained downward trend over the course of the game. Most recently, the 5-period average (P32-P36) is approximately 65.2 units (86, 61, 53, 41, 101), which is a clear level shift from the ~85-90 range observed previously and a massive reduction from the initial ~180 range. The Period 36 demand of 86 is higher than the very low Period 33-35 values but still fits within this lower regime. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and reliable based on historical arrivals. To prevent excessive inventory accumulation in this declining demand environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this latest stabilization at a lower mean. With on-hand inventory at 124 and in-transit at 221, we are currently overstocked relative to the current demand (~65/period * 5 periods = 325 needed vs 345 total available), so the OR backend should naturally reduce or skip orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 5-period average (P32-P36) is 65.2 units, confirming a sustained shift below the previous ~85 level observed in P34.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1516.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of downward shifts throughout the game. Recent demand shows a significant decline from the initial levels of ~185 units/period to current levels. The 5-period average (P33-P37) is approximately 65.8 units (41, 53, 61, 86, 88), while the 10-period average (P28-P37) is 80.3. There is an upward movement in the last three periods (61, 86, 88), suggesting the decline may have bottomed out or is part of a high-variance pattern around a mean of ~70-80. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat to capture this lower demand regime while allowing the recent slight uptick to influence the forecast, ensuring enough stock for the current trend without excessive holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period X conclude' messages. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=10 to reflect the volatility in this lower demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 10-period average (P28-P37) is 80.3 units, significantly lower than the ~180-200 range at the start. However, the last 3 periods (P35-P37) show an uptick (61, 86, 88), suggesting a potential stabilization point around 70-80 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $719.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term downward trend, shifting from ~185 units initially to settled levels below 90 units in recent periods. The 10-period average (P29-P38) is 77.4 units. While there were brief upticks to 86 and 88 in P36-P37, Period 38 saw a drop back to 47. Given the context of the recent 5-period average (P34-P38) being 67 units, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this lower current demand regime while maintaining a buffer for occasional spikes like those seen in P30 and P37. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (174) plus in-transit (243) totaling 417 units is quite high relative to recent demand, so the OR backend's capped policy should naturally moderate the order size to avoid excessive holding costs while the current pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level: 10-period average (P29-P38) is 77.4 units; 5-period average (P34-P38) is 67.0 units, significantly down from the initial ~180-200 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant and sustained decrease throughout the game, starting from ~185 units and most recently stabilizing at a much lower level. Period 39 recorded exceptionally low demand of 10 units. The 10-period average (P30-P39) is approximately 69.7 units, but the most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) show a lower average of 58.4 units. Given this continued volatility and downward pressure, I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat (69.7) to allow for the possibility that Period 39 was an outlier while still acknowledging the general lower trend. The on-hand inventory is currently high (190) relative to this new demand level, and the pipeline is also significant (232). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 captures the current lower demand regime and its associated volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 5-period average (P35-P39) is 58.4 units, confirming a sustained shift below the previous ~80 units level, highlighted by a record low of 10 units in Period 39.

Daily Reward (R_t): $800.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant and sustained decline throughout the game. The most recent 5-period average (P36-P40) is 56.2 units, and the 10-period average (P31-P40) is 62.1 units. This is a dramatic drop from the initial ~180-200 unit range. The current on-hand inventory of 150 units, combined with an in-transit pipeline of 271 units, creates a total inventory position of 421 units. Given the projected demand of ~60 units per period, this stock will last approximately 7 periods, which far exceeds the lead time and the remaining game duration (10 periods). Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to reflect the recent lower demand levels. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. The OR backend will likely order 0 units this period due to the excessive inventory surplus relative to the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 10-period average (P31-P40) dropped to 62.1 units, reflecting a sustained shift below the previous ~80 level and far below the initial ~185.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1902.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term downward trend, shifting from an initial ~185 units/period to a more recent range of 50-70 units. However, Period 41 saw a significant rebound to 107 units, similar to the uptick seen in Period 30. Despite this volatility, the 10-period average (P32-P41) is 67.9 units and the 5-period average (P37-P41) is 60.4 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR engine naturally targets a high service level (~95%), making it sensitive to inventory levels. Currently, with 131 units on-hand and 183 in-transit (Total pipeline: 314), we are well-covered for the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5). Total pipeline (314) vs. 5-period demand (approx 5 * 65 = 325) suggests we are near the target base stock. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat (679 units across 10 periods) to capture the lower regime while acknowledging the recent spike, and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility observed in the last few periods (10, 50, 107). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in a low state but shows significant volatility: P41 spiked to 107 after a series of low readings (10, 47, 50, 88). 10-period average (P32-P41) is 67.9 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1290.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been on a long-term downward trend, though recent periods show significant volatility and a slight uptick. The recent 5-period average (P38-P42) is 58.2 units, while the 10-period average (P33-P42) is 66 units. Period 41 was a significant spike (107 units) following a very low Period 39 (10 units), suggesting that while the trend is down, the variance is high. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With 173 units on-hand and 179 units in-transit (Total pipeline: 352), and a target lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). A base stock calculated using the last 10 periods (avg ~66, total ~330) matches our current inventory position well. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current lower-demand regime while allowing for the recent volatility to be reflected in sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in a low-level, high-volatility state: 5-period average (P38-P42) is 58.2 units, and 10-period average (P33-P42) is 66.0 units, significantly lower than earlier intervals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $432.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained downward trend with significant volatility. The 10-period average (P34-P43) is 58.5 units, and the most recent 5-period average (P39-P43) is 55.0 units. Although there was a spike to 107 in P41, recent observations (31 in P43, 77 in P42, 50 in P40, 10 in P39) suggest the 'normal' level is now much lower than earlier in the game. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture this lower demand regime while allowing enough history to handle the high variance (sigma_hat). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns. The currently high on-hand and in-transit inventory (157 + 226 = 383) against a forecast of approximately 60 units/period (total 300 for L+1) suggests the OR backend will likely order minimally or zero until levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 10-period average (P34-P43) is 58.5 units; 5-period average (P39-P43) is 55.0 units, solidifying a shift well below the previous ~80-100 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-46.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a structural decline and high volatility. The most recent 5-period average (P40-P44) is 54.6 units, while the 10-period average (P35-P44) is 51.5 units, both significantly lower than the ~200 units observed at the start. Period 44 saw an exceptionally low demand of only 8 units. With 198 units on hand and 206 units in transit, the inventory position is extremely high relative to current demand levels (total pipeline covers ~7.4 periods of demand at a 54.6 units/period rate). The backend OR logic uses (1+L) periods, which for a lead time of 4 is 5 periods. Current total inventory (404) is already roughly 1.5 times the expected requirement for the next 5 periods (expected ~273 units). To prevent further accumulation of holding costs while maintaining service levels, I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 10 to capture the current low-demand regime and its associated volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 10-period average (P35-P44) has dropped to 51.5 units, significantly below the previous ~60-80 ranges; volatility remains elevated with recent extremes of 107 (P41) and 8 (P44).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the order from Period 41 (quantity 0) was 'completed' and resulted in 0 units arriving, exactly as expected. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Inventory management is now entering the final phase (Period 46 to 50). The demand regime remains in a low-level, high-volatility state. The 10-period average (P36-P45) is 54.3 units, and the 5-period average (P41-P45) is 53.6 units. Despite a spike to 107 in P41, recent demand has been 77, 31, 8, and 45. Given we are at Period 46 with a lead time of 4, any order placed now will arrive in Period 50. Total inventory (on-hand 153 + in-transit 209 = 362) is extremely high relative to the current demand level (~55 units/period). Even with 5 periods remaining, we have enough stock to cover demand exceeding 70 units per period without ordering more. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the current low-demand regime and high volatility, allowing the OR backend to recalculate the base stock. The high pipeline inventory will naturally prevent significant further ordering as the game concludes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 10-period average (P36-P45) is 54.3 units, confirming a sustained state well below previous levels; volatility remains high with recent values ranging from 8 to 107.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is in a sustained low state with high volatility. The most recent 10-period average (P37-P46) is 52.1 units, and the 5-period average (P42-P46) is 35.4 units, with the last two periods dropping significantly to 8 and 16. However, inventory is currently high (On-hand: 252, In-transit: 131, Total Pipeline: 383), whereas the total expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1) based on recent trends (~50 units/period) is only around 250 units. The OR backend needs to recognize this significant surplus to avoid further holding costs as we approach the end of the game (Period 50). Using 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat captures the downward trend while accounting for the high volatility (recent spikes versus extremely low values). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 10-period average (P37-P46) is 52.1 units, reflecting a further shift below previous levels; 5-period average (P42-P46) is 35.4 units.

=== Period 47 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=0, arrived=62 units (ordered on Period 43, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=314, demand=7, sold=7, ending on-hand inventory=307
Daily Profit: $133.00, Daily Holding Cost: $307.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-174.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an extremely low phase. The 10-period average (P38-P47) is 39.4 units, but the last 5 periods (P43-P47) show an even sharper decline to 21.4 units, with a very low current demand of 7. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 307), which is sufficient to cover any reasonable demand for the remaining 3 periods of the game (P48, P49, P50), especially given that Holding Cost is $1.0 vs a Profit of $19.0. Looking at the In-transit (69 units), we see orders from P44 (29), P45 (3), and P46 (37) pending. Note that the order from P41 (0 units) concluded correctly, and P42 (115) arrived early in P46. Since the game ends at P50, and we are at P48, only orders placed now would arrive in P52 (assuming L=4), which is past the game end. Even with early arrivals, the current On-hand of 307 compared to recent demand of <30 units ensures no stockouts. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to a very conservative level using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent plummet in demand and prevent any unnecessary ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 5-period average (P43-P47) dropped significantly to 21.4 units, with the most recent sample at Period 47 being only 7 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has continued its significant downward trend, with recent observations of 8, 45, 16, 7, and 40 units (P44-P48). The 5-period average is now 23.2 units per period, and the 10-period average (P39-P48) is 37.2. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 296 units, which is over 12 times the current 5-period average demand. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we are already carrying enough stock to cover demand for more than 10 periods, making new orders unnecessary. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P44 order arrived P48). I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime and minimize further accumulation of holding costs, though the OR backend will likely recommend zero orders due to the high inventory position.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: 5-period average (P44-P48) is 23.2 units, a further reduction from the previous ~35 range and significantly lower than early game levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $201.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the final period (50). The primary goal is to minimize ending inventory to avoid holding costs since there are no future periods to sell units, while still covering any remaining demand for this concluding period. The current on-hand inventory is 274 units, which is significantly higher than any recent demand sample (last 5 periods avg: 23 units; last 10 periods avg: 36 units). Given that the demand has consistently stayed below 50 units for the last several periods, the 274 units on-hand are more than sufficient to satisfy Period 50 demand. I will set the parameters to effectively stop ordering (base stock should be lower than on-hand + pipeline). Since the backend uses a base stock policy, providing very low mu_hat and sigma_hat values for the remaining horizon will result in a zero order. I'll use a recent_N strategy with N=5 to capture the most recent extremely low demand phase (avg 18.6 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease reached a floor: 5-period average (P45-P49) is 18.6 units, the lowest level in the game; inventory is now excessive for this demand level.
