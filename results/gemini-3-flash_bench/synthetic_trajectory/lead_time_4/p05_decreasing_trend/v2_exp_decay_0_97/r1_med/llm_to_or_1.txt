Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The historical data for 'chips(Regular)' shows five demand points: 187, 189, 158, 158, 184 (Mean: 175.2, Std Dev: 15.35). The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have no observation history yet and are just starting, I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. This relies on the OR backend using all available historical samples to set the base stock level. The calculation for mu_hat will be (1+L) * mean = 5 * 175.2 = 876, and sigma_hat will be sqrt(5) * 15.35 \u2248 34.33. This satisfies a 80% service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) while accounting for the lead time and review period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 202 units were ordered, but because the promised lead time is 4 periods, they are correctly 'in-transit'. Demand in Period 1 was 225, but with 0 starting inventory, sales were 0. We have 5 historical demand samples (187, 189, 158, 158, 184) plus the Period 1 actual demand of 225. The mean of these 6 samples is approximately 183.5. Given the promised lead time (L) of 4, the demand window to cover is (1+L) = 5 periods. Using the 'default' method for mu_hat will use the mean of all available samples (including the new Period 1 data) to calculate (1+L) * mean. For sigma_hat, 'default' will appropriately account for the observed volatility. L remains at the promised lead time of 4.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time is 4 periods. The arrivals for the orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 are expected to occur in Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Consequently, current on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 427 units in-transit (202 from P1 + 225 from P2). Historical demand for the first 5 samples provided (which seems to be pre-simulation data or a broader context) has a mean of 175.4. However, the first two simulation periods showed demands of 225 and 159 (average 192). Since 2 periods of data isn't enough to confirm a regime shift, I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat which incorporates all available historical samples (pre-sim + sim) to stabilize the base stock calculation while the lead time is still progressing. I will set L to 'default' (4) as we have seen no 'conclude' messages yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 have not yet arrived, which is expected as the first arrival (from Period 1) is scheduled for the arrival phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales, which is unavoidable at the start of the simulation given the 4-period lead time. The demand history (187, 189, 158, 158, 184) shows a mean of approximately 175.2. Since there are no confirmed lead-time deviations yet, I will use the 'default' lead time (4). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full available history while remaining sensitive to current patterns. This results in a base stock calculation covering (1+4)=5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (having just concluded Period 5). Promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the timing rules, an order placed in Period 1 with L=4 arrives during Period 5's arrival phase and is documented in the 'Period 5 conclude' message, which I will see at the start of Period 6. Since I am currently making the decision for Period 6 and the last history shown is 'Period 4 conclude', I have not yet seen any arrivals. This is expected behavior. The demand samples for periods 1-5 are [225, 159, 165, 179, 184] (Note: the prompt user-provided samples for 'chips(Regular)' differ from the game history demand; I will prioritize the 'GAME HISTORY' demand values). Mean demand is approx 182.4. With L=4, the pipeline inventory of 873 units (Orders from P1, P2, P3, P4) covers roughly 4.8 periods of demand. I will use 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the stabilization after the initial high demand in Period 1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $798.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, the first order (placed in Period 1) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4). Therefore, the 'In-transit' quantity of 759 units consists of orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5. Demand has been relatively stable, with samples: 225, 159, 165, 179, and 200. The mean demand is approximately 185.6 units per period. Since L=4, the pipeline should cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Currently, on-hand (2) + in-transit (759) = 761 units. 5 periods of average demand is ~928 units, suggesting we are currently under-stocked in the pipeline. To address this, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent behavior while including the initial higher demand peak. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $533.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand history shows relatively stable consumption: P1-P6 demand was 225, 159, 165, 179, 200, 152 (Mean \u2248 180, Std Dev \u2248 28). Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). The system now has 75 units on hand and 752 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). Since (1+L) = 5 periods, and average demand is ~180, the required base stock (covering lead time + current period) is approximately 900 units. Pipeline inventory (752 + 75 = 827) is slightly below the target, but the OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent over-ordering. I will use 'default' for L (4 periods), 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat to capture the current demand cluster, and 'recent_N' with N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $539.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Historical demand for the last 7 periods is [225, 159, 165, 179, 200, 152, 167]. The mean demand is approximately 178 units per period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3. Inventory management involves covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 657, and on-hand is 129, totaling 786 units. With a target base stock of roughly 5 * 178 = 890 (before safety stock), we need to ensure consistent ordering. Demand appears stable without significant regime shifts yet, so I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full sample mean and standard deviation. L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed through 4 consecutive arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the 8 periods observed (including initial seeding data) shows relative stability with a mean of ~175. Standard deviation is approximately 14.5. Given the current on-hand inventory of 186 and a large pipeline (in-transit) of 571, the system is well-covered for the (L+1)=5 period horizon. The current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 757) exceeds the likely base stock requirement (5 periods * 175 = 875, plus safety stock). I will use recent_N=8 to capture the full recent demand profile while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10. Based on the 'conclude' messages from Period 5 through Period 9, the actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand history shows relative stability with the last 5 periods (P5-P9) having an average demand of 167.8 units, while the initial given samples (P1-P5) averaged 175.2 units. The current on-hand inventory is 122, and the pipeline (in-transit) is 656, which includes orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9. Since lead time is 4, we expect P6's order (218 units) to arrive during P10 (visible in P11). I will use L=4 (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 to capture all recorded demand observations while the OR backend manages the pipeline relative to the 165-175 unit demand range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Analysis of the game history confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 10). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized since the initial samples; while early samples showed a mean around 175, the last 5 periods (P6-P10) show a slightly lower mean of 155.8 (152, 167, 168, 152, 140). The current on-hand inventory is 200 units, with 576 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Since the lead time is consistent with the promised 4 periods, I will use the 'default' method for L. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the more recent, lower demand trend (approx 156 units/period). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility (std dev approx 12.3). This approach helps the OR backend maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of actual demand while avoiding excessive holding costs from over-forecasting based on the initial period spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $489.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability over the last 11 periods, with an average demand of approximately 167 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P8-P11) have seen demand between 140 and 168. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by all arrivals from P5 through P11. Currently, we have 163 units on-hand and 476 units in-transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will set L to 4 using the 'calculate' method to utilize historical confirmation. For demand forecasting, although the initial sample data was slightly higher, the realized demand in the first 11 periods is more representative of current behavior. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the actual observed demand mean and variance while smoothing out minor fluctuations. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for (L+1)=5 periods of demand, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level compared to the initial five periods. The mean demand for Periods 1-5 was approximately 186, while the mean for Periods 6-12 is approximately 153. A changepoint in demand occurred around Period 6. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this more recent demand regime (Periods 6-12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in all 'conclude' messages from Period 5 to 12), matching the promised lead time, so using the default (promised) lead time of 4 is appropriate. The OR backend will calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand, ensuring sufficient coverage while the inventory on-hand (170) and in-transit (547) are factored into the order calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg decreased from ~186 to ~153 (-18%)

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 6. Pre-shift (P1-P5) average was ~185.6. Post-shift (P6-P13) average is 146.5. Including the provided historical samples (P1-P5), the post-shift mean of the last 8 periods (P6-P13) is roughly 146.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival from P5 to P13. Currently, there is 225 on-hand and 450 in-transit (orders from P10, P11, P12, P13). Using N=8 for mu_hat captures the 146.5 average, and the backend will calculate demand for (1+L)=5 periods, resulting in a base stock targeted around 732 units. Pipeline inventory (225 + 450 = 675) is currently healthy, so the backend will order the difference to maintain the service level while accounting for holding costs ($1/unit).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 6 from approximately 186 units per period to approximately 144 units per period (average of Periods 6-14). The most recent 3 periods (12-14) show an even lower average of 132 units, indicating a potential ongoing decline or stabilized lower state. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages for Periods 5 through 14. Current on-hand inventory is 216, with 416 units in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the mean demand since the Period 6 regime shift (Periods 6-14), providing a balance between responsiveness to the recent drop and statistical stability. For volatility, I will also use N=9 to reflect the variance of this lower-demand period. L remains at the promised default of 4.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 6. Based on the last 10 periods (P6-P15), the average demand is approximately 155 units per period. The promised lead time (L=4) has been consistently confirmed by arrivals from Period 5 through 15 (all 11 arrivals occurred with exactly 4 periods lead time). Current on-hand inventory is 79, with 534 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, P15). We need to maintain a base stock that covers L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current lower-demand regime while excluding the higher initial periods. The OR backend will use these to balance the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 6. From Period 6 to Period 16, the average demand is approximately 146.5 units per period, which is significantly lower than the initial samples (Periods 1-5 mean ~186). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across 12 consecutive arrivals (Periods 5-16). Currently, on-hand inventory is 167 with 493 units in-transit (orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16). I will use a recent window of N=11 (from Period 6 onwards) to capture the current demand regime's mean and volatility. Setting L to default (4) as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time perfectly.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 6 from a mean of ~186 to ~145. Recent demand (Period 6 to 17) has leveled off with an average of approximately 144.3 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in all concluded arrival messages from Periods 5 through 17. There are currently 529 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P14, P15, P16, and P17) and 114 units on-hand. To optimize the order for Period 18, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the current stable demand regime since Period 6. The lead time (L) is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 aligns perfectly with historical performance.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean of approximately 140 units since Period 6. Specifically, the average demand over the last 10 periods (P9-P18) is roughly 141 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P14. Currently, we have 118 units on-hand and 546 units in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18). With a lead time L=4, we need the base stock to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Choosing N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat accounts for the sustained lower demand regime while providing a stable estimate of volatility. Using the 'calculate' method for L is appropriate given the consistent 4-period delivery history.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) from Period 6 onwards shows a lower mean compared to the initial periods. Calculating the average demand from Period 6 to Period 19 involves 14 samples. The mean demand for these periods is approximately 141.6 units (calculated as: (152+167+168+152+140+163+132+118+147+163+122+129+100+132)/14). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the history. To set parameters for the OR backend, I will use a recent_N strategy for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=14 to capture this stable post-shift regime. The confirmed lead time remains 4, so I will used the default lead time parameter which matches the promised and observed value.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 6. Based on the last 15 periods (Periods 6-20), the average demand is approximately 143.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 18.2. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The current on-hand inventory is 157, and the in-transit pipeline is 449 units (representing orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, and 20), totaling 606 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A base stock target using a 5-period horizon with \u03bc \u2248 144 would be around 720 units (plus safety stock). The backend's capped policy will handle the order calculation based on these parameters. I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the stable demand regime since the last known shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $256.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 6 from a mean of ~186 to approximately 140-150. Over the last 10 periods (P12-P21), the average demand has stabilized at 131.1 units per period. The lead time has consistently remained at the promised 4 periods. Setting L to 'default' (4) is appropriate. To capture the current demand state while filtering out earlier, higher demand samples, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10. This ensures the OR backend uses a demand mean of ~131 and a more relevant local standard deviation. The current pipeline inventory (478) plus on-hand (164) is 642, which exceeds the likely base stock requirement for 5 periods (L+1), so the OR backend should naturally order conservatively to avoid excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 130-140 units (avg of last 10 periods is 131.1).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean compared to the initial periods. Over the last 10 periods (P13-P22), the mean demand is 131.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 18.2. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory levels are healthy, with 161 units on-hand and 396 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P19, P20, P21, and P22). To maintain a service level balance given the $4 profit and $1 holding cost (critical ratio of 0.8), I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) based on the most recent 10-period regime to avoid being skewed by the higher demand seen in the first 10 periods.

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P14 to P23) is approximately 120.1 units per period, showing a significant drop compared to the early periods. The lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 122 units and a large pipeline (in-transit) of 458 units, we are currently well-stocked. The pipeline covers the next several periods of expected demand (approx. 5 periods worth at 120 units/period). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stable demand regime (approx 120 units/period) while maintaining the default lead time (L=4). This ensures the base stock calculation targets the current consumption rate rather than the higher historical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: avg of last 10 periods (P14-P23) is 120.1 units, down from the previous 131.1 avg observed at P22.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 14. The average demand for the last 11 periods (P14-P24) is approximately 119.9 units, significantly lower than the historical mean and previous regimes. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 172 units and 391 units in transit (expected arrivals from P21-P24 orders), the pipeline is well-stocked. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this established lower-demand regime while remaining responsive to any slight fluctuations. The lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised 4 periods consistently.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the mean demand is 117.3 units, significantly lower than the initial average. The last 5 periods show an even lower average of 105 units. I will use recent_N with N=10 for both demand and lead time to capture this stabilized regime. The lead time has consistently stayed at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (222) and significant in-transit stock (337), the system is well-covered for the (L+1) period horizon. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will help the OR backend correctly adjust the base stock to these lower demand levels, reducing the safety stock and mitigating excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: avg of last 10 periods (P16-P25) is 117.3 units, continuing the downward trend from P24's observation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an observable downward trend. The most recent demand (Period 26) hit a new low of 77 units. Comparing recent windows: the average demand of the last 10 periods (P17-P26) is approximately 110.5, while the last 5 periods (P22-P26) average 98.8. This indicates a clear cooling of demand compared to earlier regimes (which were 120+). I will use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilization at a lower level while maintaining enough sample size for variance estimation. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P22 order arrived P26), so 'default' (promised lead time of 4) is appropriate. The OR engine will use these parameters to lower the base stock level, reducing inventory and holding costs while maintaining the 80% service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: the last 10 periods (P17-P26) average 110.5 units, continuing the downward trend from P26's observation (avg of 117.3 at P26).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent downward trend over the last several periods. The average demand for the most recent 10 periods (P18-P27) is approximately 107.5 units, which is a significant drop from the mean demand earlier in the game. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P24-P27) have demand values of 108, 91, 77, and 70, indicating a potential acceleration of this downward trend. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at 4 periods as consistently observed. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. To prevent excessive inventory buildup and associated holding costs, I am shifting mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to the most recent 10-period window to better capture this lower demand regime. The on-hand inventory (234) and in-transit units (288) combined with the lower demand mean that the order quantity for this period will be naturally constrained by the base stock calculation to align with the lower forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: the last 10 periods (P18-P27) average 107.5 units, continuing the downward trend noted in previous insights (P27 avg was 110.5).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent downward trend over the last several weeks. The average demand for the most recent 10 periods (P19-P28) is 102.1 units, significantly lower than the initial historical samples (~175) and previous stabilization points. Specifically, the last four periods (P25-P28) have demand values of 91, 77, 70, and 81, suggesting a new lower regime possibly under 90 units per period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 244 and In-transit at 242, the total pipeline is 486 units, which is quite high relative to the current demand levels (covering nearly 5 periods of demand at ~100 units/period). I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this downward shift while maintaining enough buffer for variance. sigma_hat is also set using the last 10 periods to reflect the reduced volatility associated with the lower volume. This approach will likely result in lower order quantities to reduce holding costs while the current excess inventory is consumed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: the last 10 periods (P19-P28) average 102.1 units, continuing the downward trend noted in previous insights (P28's previous 10-period window was 107.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its significant downward trend. The most recent 10-period average (P20-P29) has dropped to 96.3 units, compared to 102.1 units just one period ago. The last five periods (P25-P29) are even lower, averaging 76.8 units. The on-hand inventory (266) plus in-transit stock (228) totaling 494 is very high relative to this new demand level, equivalent to over 6 periods of supply at recent averages. To prevent excessive holding costs while the inventory depletes, I am reducing mu_hat significantly. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture this persistent decline while maintaining some stability in the forecast, as the 10-period average reflects the current regime better than the long-term historical mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: the last 10 periods (P20-P29) average 96.3 units, down from 102.1 in the previous window. A sharper drop is visible in the last 5 periods (avg 76.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $305.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the last 10 periods (P21-P30) shows a continued downward trend, averaging 94.2 units. Within this window, the last 5 periods (P26-P30) show significant volatility with a spike in P30 (124 units) following several low-demand periods. Despite the P30 spike, the overall trend is downward (the previous 10-period average at Period 29 was 107.5). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4), and current high combined inventory (On-hand: 191 + In-transit: 211 = 402), which covers over 4 periods of recent peak demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the lower regime while acknowledging recent variance. Sigma_hat is also set to the last 10 periods to reflect the increased volatility observed in the P30 data point.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: the last 10 periods (P21-P30) average 94.2 units, down from 96.3 in the P20-P29 window, despite a single-period spike in P30.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a downward trend, although Period 30 saw a temporary spike. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P22-P31) is 92.3 units, compared to 94.2 in the previous window. Looking at the most recent 5 periods (P27-P31), the average is 85.0 units, which is a more realistic target given the recent history of 70, 81, 65, 124, and 85 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 167 and in-transit at 259 (covering expected arrivals from orders in P28, P29, P30, and P31), the pipeline is sufficient. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime while accounting for the recent volatility seen in P30.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: the last 10 periods (P22-P31) average 92.3 units, continuing the downward trend (previous 10-period avg at P31 was 94.2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $293.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a downward trend, though it has shown some volatility in the last few periods (P30: 124, P31: 85, P32: 101). The 10-period moving average has dropped from 120.1 (at P24) to 92.3 (at P32). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P28-P32) average 91.2 units. Given the transition from higher historical demand levels, the 'recent_N' method with N=5 is chosen for mu_hat to capture this lower average and prevent over-ordering as the regime settles. Lead time is physically confirmed as 4 periods consistently. The inventory position (On-hand: 111, In-transit: 257) is substantial relative to the current demand levels (~3.6 periods of coverage in transit alone), so the OR backend should naturally moderate the order size based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Demand regime stabilization continues; the 5-period average (P28-P32) is 91.2 units, significantly lower than the full history mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a downward trend and high volatility. Period 33 demand was 41, the lowest observed so far, following a period of 101. The average demand of the last 10 periods (P24-P33) has dropped to approximately 84.4 units. Given this sustained decrease, I am using a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime more accurately than the full history mean. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns (P29 order arrived in P33), so L remains at 'default'. Pipeline inventory (305) and on-hand (143) are currently high relative to the lower demand, so the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a conservative order to minimize holding costs while the inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand regime decrease continues; 10-period average (P24-P33) is ~84.4 units, down from 92.3 at P32. Demand reached a new low of 41 in P33.

To avoid excessive holding costs in this declining environment, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this most recent level (approx 81 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 5 periods to reflect recent volatility rather than the much higher variance seen in the early stages of the game. On-hand plus pipeline inventory is currently 413 units, which is quite high relative to the recent demand (approx 5 periods of cover at current rates), so the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a small or zero order this period to lean out the inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: the last 10 periods (P25-P34) average 81.8 units, compared to 84.4 units at P34, with the most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) averaging 80.8 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a clear downward trend. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P26-P35) has fallen to 78.8 units, while the most recent 5-period average (P31-P35) is even lower at 68.2 units. Specifically, the last three periods (P33-P35) saw demand values of 41, 53, and 61, indicating a shift toward a lower volume regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, with the P31 order arriving exactly in P35 as expected. Given the consistent decline, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture this lower demand level (avg ~68.2 per period) and avoid over-ordering, which would escalate holding costs. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N with N=10 to reflect the volatility within this lower-demand regime. This approach aligns the OR backend's base-stock calculation with the current downward trajectory while maintaining sufficient safety stock for the observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: the last 10 periods (P26-P35) average 78.8 units, down from 81.8 at P35; the most recent 5 periods (P31-P35) average 68.2 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $217.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained downward trend. Comparing the last 10 periods (P27-P36, avg ~78.8) to the previous 10-period window (P26-P35, avg ~81.8), the mean demand is decreasing. The most recent 5-period average (P32-P36) is even lower at 65.4 units. Since this trend has been persistent for over 15 periods, I will continue using a short window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the OR engine to adapt to this lower regime without over-ordering. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (verified through P32 order arriving in P36). With 127 units on hand and 195 units in transit, the inventory position is relatively high compared to recent demand levels, so the OR model's capped policy should naturally reduce order quantities.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: the last 10 periods (P27-P36) average 78.8 units, down from 81.8 at P35; the most recent 5 periods (P32-P36) average 65.4 units, indicating a further softening of demand.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained downward trend. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P28-P37) is approximately 73.9 units, significantly lower than the historical mean. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P33-P37) average 65.8 units, though P36 and P37 showed slight upticks (86 and 88 units) compared to the low of 41 in P33. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture this lower demand regime (avg 73.9 * (1+4) = 369.5) while ensuring we don't over-order given the current high inventory levels (On-hand: 160, In-transit: 182, Total: 342). Using recent_N for sigma_hat will adjust to the lower volatility observed in this recent period. The OR backend will see that the current pipeline inventory (342) is nearly sufficient to cover the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (mu_hat), likely resulting in a small or zero order to manage holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: the last 10 periods (P28-P37) average 73.9 units, down from 78.8 at P36, confirming the lower demand floor.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained downward trend. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P29-P38) is approximately 78.6 units, while the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) average 67.0 units. Current on-hand inventory is 131 units, and there are 261 units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. I will set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand floor (~67.0 * 5 = 335). The pipeline inventory (392) already exceeds the required base stock calculated from this mean, so the OR backend will likely minimize new orders. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the latest arrival (P34 order arrived in P38).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: the last 10 periods (P29-P38) average 78.6 units, but the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) indicate a lower floor averaging 67.0 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward trend over the last several periods, reaching a new low of 10 units in Period 39. The 10-period average (P30-P39) is approximately 68.6 units, but the most recent 5-period average (P35-P39) has dropped to 58.4 units. Given this sustained weakening of demand, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture this latest floor. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (177 units) relative to recent demand, and with 205 units in-transit, the pipeline is well-stocked. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine if any additional order is necessary, likely resulting in a zero or small order to avoid excessive holding costs while the inventory levels align with the lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) average 58.4 units, down from the P34-P38 average of 67.0 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained downward trend. The most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) averaged 52.8 units (61, 86, 88, 47, 10, 50), with P39 being an outlier low. Looking at the last 10 periods (P31-P40), the average is 62.5 units (85, 101, 41, 53, 61, 86, 88, 47, 10, 50). This confirms a significant shift from earlier periods. Given the high on-hand inventory (127) and a substantial amount in-transit (205), which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next lead time window (~5*62.5 = 312.5), the OR engine needs to be throttled to prevent excess holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods to capture this lower demand regime more accurately, as N=7 provides a stable but responsive window. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: most recent 10 periods (P31-P40) average 62.2 units, down from the P25-P34 average of 81.8 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a structural decline. Recent history shows a significant drop: the average demand of the last 10 periods (P32-P41) is approximately 63 units, while the average of the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is slightly higher at 60.4 units due to a spike to 107 in P41. Despite this spike, the overall trend since P30 is consistently lower than the historical mean. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P37 order arriving in P41). On-hand inventory is 128 units, and in-transit is 97 units (from P38). With a lead time of 4, the target inventory must cover 5 periods of demand. Given the current downward regime, I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior while smoothing out the P41 spike. Sigma_hat will also use N=10 to account for recent volatility. This conservative approach prevents over-ordering in a declining market while maintaining a buffer against volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: most recent 10 periods (P32-P41) average 63.3 units, significantly lower than earlier periods (e.g., P25-P34 avg was 81.8).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a significant downward trend. The most recent 10-period average (P33-P42) is 60.0 units, while the most recent 5-period average (P38-P42) is 64.2 units, indicating some stabilization at a lower floor compared to earlier periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on recent 'conclude' messages (P41 and P42 arrivals both had a lead time of 4). Our current position is: On-hand (148) + In-transit (115) = 263 units. This pipeline must cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Given the recent average of ~64, the pipeline depth of 263 is slightly above the expected 5-period demand (320), but well within the safety stock parameters. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime more accurately than the full history, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on high initial demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: most recent 10 periods (P33-P42) average 60.0 units, down from the P32-P41 average of 63.3.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a downward trend, with the most recent 10-period average (P34-P43) dropping to 56.0 units, and the most recent 5-period average (P39-P43) dropping even further to 55.0 units. Current on-hand inventory is 117 units, and there are 212 units in-transit (ordered in P42 and P43), which is substantial given the current demand floor. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Since we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 44 of 50), and the pipeline already covers roughly 4-5 periods of demand at the current rate, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the most recent demand softening (avg ~55) while avoiding excessive overstocking as the game nears conclusion.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: most recent 10-period average (P34-P43) is 56.0 units, down from the P33-P42 average of 60.0 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-77.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a significant downward trend, with the most recent 10-period average (P35-P44) dropping to 53.0 units and the last 5 periods averaging only 46.6 units. Specifically, Period 44 saw a very low demand of 8 units. Because of this sustained and accelerating decline, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent (and lowest) demand floor, preventing excessive overstocking as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P38 order arrived P42). On-hand inventory is 109 and in-transit is 230 (total 339), which already significantly exceeds the expected demand for the remaining 6 periods (avg 46.6 * 6 = 279.6). The OR backend's capped policy will likely result in small or zero orders because the pipeline is already full relative to the new lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: most recent 10-period average (P35-P44) is 53.0 units, down from 56.0 (P34-P43); last 5-period average (P40-P44) is 46.6 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained downward trend. The most recent 10-period average (P35-P44) is 53.0 units, and the last 5-period average (P40-P44) is even lower at 46.6 units. To align with this shifting regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to prioritize recent lower demand signals while maintaining some stability. Regarding lead time, we saw a missing arrival from the P35 order (expected P39) and the P36 order was 0, but P37 and P38 orders arrived on time (P41 and P42). However, P39 (ordered 0), P40 (ordered 0), P41 (ordered 0), and P42 (ordered 115) should have resulted in an arrival in P46. Given the 'In-transit' quantity is high (230 units) relative to current demand, and on-hand is 64, the pipeline is sufficient. I will maintain L=4 (default) as the physical arrivals in P41 and P42 confirmed the 4-period lead time remains the standard, despite the gap in P43-P45 which corresponds to periods where orders were 0 (P39, P40).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: most recent 10-period average (P35-P44) is 53.0 units, down from 56.0 (P34-P43); last 5-period average (P40-P44) is 46.6 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a significant downward trend, with recent averages reaching new lows. The most recent 5-period average (P42-P46) is approximately 35.4 units (77, 31, 8, 45, 16), which is much lower than the 10-period average of 53.0 units noted at P45. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P42 order arriving at P46. Currently, we have 163 units on-hand and 159 units in-transit (orders from P43, P44, and P46). Given that the game ends at P50, and our lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (P47) will arrive at the start of P51 (after the game ends). Therefore, making a large order is unnecessary as it will only increase holding costs without contributing to sales. However, the OR engine's 'capped policy' will manage the actual order size. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the current low-demand regime (~35 units/period) and L=4 to match the confirmed lead time. This helps the backend calculate a lower base stock, preventing excessive accumulation of inventory as we approach the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: most recent 5-period average (P42-P46) is ~35.4 units, down from the P40-P44 average of 46.6 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-225.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to decline sharply. The 5-period average (P43-P47) is approximately 21.4 units, with the most recent sample in P47 dropping to 7 units. My current on-hand inventory of 253 units, combined with the 62 units in-transit (orders from P44 and P46), already provides roughly 14 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. This significantly exceeds the 5-period (L+1) planning horizon. To minimize holding costs and account for the clear downward trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 periods (P38-P47), as this window better reflects the current low-demand environment compared to the full historical average. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. No further ordering is required given the inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: most recent 5-period average (P43-P47) is ~21.4 units, down from the P42-P46 average of 35.4 units; P47 record low of 7 units observed.

Daily Profit: $160.00, Daily Holding Cost: $231.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-71.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a severe downward trend, hitting record lows in recent periods (e.g., 8 units in P44, 16 in P46, 7 in P47). The most recent 5-period average (P44-P48) is approximately 22 units, which is significantly lower than even the softened demand observed just ten periods ago. My current position is heavily overstocked with 231 units on-hand and 44 units still in the pipeline, while the expected demand for the remaining review+lead time window (L+1 = 5 periods) is roughly 110 units based on recent trends. Given that the game ends at Period 50 and I already have more than double the required stock to cover the remaining two periods of demand, I will set mu_hat to a conservative figure using the most recent 5 periods to minimize further holding costs. Any ordering at this stage would only increase ending inventory and reduce total reward, especially since an order placed now (P49) wouldn't arrive until after the game concludes (P53).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: most recent 5-period average (P44-P48) is ~22.2 units, a further significant drop from the P43-P47 average of ~21.4 (impacted by the P48 demand of 40). Overall trend remains sharply bearish.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-106.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a significant downward trend, with the most recent 10 periods (P40-P49) averaging 28.9 units compared to historical levels over 100. Period 49 demand was 25 units. The on-hand inventory is currently very high (206 units), which is approximately seven times the recent average period demand. Given the lead time is 4 periods, and we have 44 units in transit (expected in P50), the total pipeline and on-hand inventory (250 units) is far in excess of the projected demand (1 + 4 = 5 periods) at current consumption rates (~30 * 5 = 150 units). To prevent further accumulation of holding costs and avoid ordering unnecessary stock when the inventory is already sufficient for nearly two months of current demand, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this low-demand regime (avg P43-P49 is ~24.6 units). This will trigger the OR backend's capped policy to likely place a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: most recent 10-period average (P40-P49) is 28.9 units; most recent 5-period average (P45-P49) is 26.6 units, confirming a sustained lower floor.
