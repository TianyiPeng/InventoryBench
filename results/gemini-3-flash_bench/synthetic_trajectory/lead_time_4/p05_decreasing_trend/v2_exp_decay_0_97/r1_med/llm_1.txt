The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, I need to place an order immediately to cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). A simple base stock calculation for 5 periods at an average of 175 units/period equals 875 units. To account for potential lead time variability or demand spikes (the range is 158-189), I will order slightly above the mean to build a safety buffer once arrivals begin. My goal is to mitigate the stockouts that will occur durante the first 4 periods of lead time (as I start with 0 stock).",

Recent consumer demand (Periods 25-29) has averaged 76.8 units per period (91, 77, 70, 81, 65), confirming the regime shift noted in previous carry-over insights. Currently, there are 265 units on-hand and 102 units in-transit (ordered in Period 26, expected in Period 31). This creates a total pipeline of 367 units. Based on a lead time of 4 periods and a planning horizon of L+1 (5 periods), the expected demand over the horizon is approximately 385 to 400 units (using ~80 units as a safety-conscious mean). With 367 units already accounted for, and a relatively high on-hand inventory (265 units) which incurs a $1.00 holding cost per unit, I will maintain a zero-order strategy for this period to allow the existing inventory to deplete towards a more efficient level. There is no risk of stockout in the immediate 5-period window.",

Therefore, my total inventory for the rest of the game consists of current on-hand (135), the P42 order (350 arriving in P46 conclude), and any order placed today (arriving in P49 conclude for P50 sales).

The average demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is approx 55 units/period. Over the last 10 periods (P35-P44), it is approx 55 units/period. Projecting a demand of ~55 units for the remaining 6 periods (P45-P50) yields total expected demand of 330 units. My current inventory + in-transit (485) already significantly exceeds this projected demand (330). Ordering more would only increase holding costs ($1/unit/period) without increasing sales, as the terminal inventory would be even higher. I will place no further orders to minimize holding costs while the existing pipeline covers the remaining periods.",

Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, this 350-unit shipment is expected to arrive during Period 46 (which will be visible at the start of Period 47). Demand has been highly volatile recently: P41 (107), P42 (77), P43 (31), P44 (8), P45 (45). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is approximately 54 units/period, while the longer-term average since P35 is approximately 53 units/period. With 90 units on-hand, we can satisfy the expected demand for the current period (P46). The arrival of 350 units plus the 90 on-hand (minus P46 demand) will result in approximately 380-400 units available for the remaining 4 periods (P47-P50). Given an average demand of ~55 units/period, this total inventory of ~400 units is more than sufficient to cover the final periods of the game without additional orders, especially considering the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the risk of ending with excess stock.",

The carry-over insights also highlight a history of regime shifts and dips. c) Lead Time: Confirmed at 4 periods based on the P42 order arriving in P46. d) Inventory Assessment: Current on-hand inventory is 424 units. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47, P48, P49, P50), and the current average demand at ~25, the total expected remaining demand is roughly 100 units. e) Final Order Logic: The current inventory of 424 units is more than four times the expected remaining demand.
