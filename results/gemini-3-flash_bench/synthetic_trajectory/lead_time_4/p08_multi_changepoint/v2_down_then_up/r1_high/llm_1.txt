There's a slight downward trend in the last two periods, but the sample size is small. c) Lead Time: The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since it is Period 1, I have no arrival history yet.

With L=4, my order today must cover demand for Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (L+1 periods). e) Order Logic: Expected demand for 5 periods based on the average (~94) is 470 units.

Total pipeline inventory is currently 500 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of demand (~100 units/period). Since the lead time (L) is 4 periods, I need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand to ensure continuity of supply once the first shipment arrives. My current pipeline of 500 units exactly matches this forecast (5 * 100). However, because I started with 0 inventory and there is a 4-period arrival delay, I am currently out of stock and will remain so until the Period 1 order arrives. I will not place an additional order this period to avoid overstocking once the initial large order of 500 arrives, as my current in-transit plus future orders should aim to balance the (L+1) window.

  "rationale": "The chips(Regular) SKU is in a high-demand regime that began around Period 38. The average demand from P38-P44 is approximately 124 units per period, representing a significant increase from the previous mean of ~68. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The goal is to maximize total reward over the remaining 5 periods (P45-P50). Inventory on hand is 205, and in-transit is 580 (P41: 130, P42: 150, P43: 200, P44: 100). Pipeline review: Arrival scheduled for Period 45 (from P41) is 130 units. Period 46 (from P42) is 150. Period 47 (from P43) is 200. Period 48 (from P44) is 100. Total inventory available to cover demand until the end of the game (6 periods: P45-P50) is 205 (on-hand) + 580 (in-transit) = 785 units. Expected demand for 6 periods at mean 125 is 750 units. Therefore, the current pipeline almost perfectly covers the remaining game duration with a small safety buffer. Ordering significantly more would likely lead to excess ending inventory and high holding costs in P50. A small order of 50 units is placed to maintain a safe service level against potential spikes in the final periods.",

With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P47, P48, P49, P50), the primary goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs.

The total supply available for the rest of the game is 247 (on-hand) + 350 (in-transit) = 597 units.

Currently, we have 310 units on hand. Demand has recently averaged approximately 120-130 units. Projecting forward: Period 49 demand (~130) and Period 50 demand (~130) total ~260 units. Our current on-hand inventory of 310 is already sufficient to cover these last two periods without incurring additional holding costs for unnecessary stock or risking stockouts. The 50 units in transit (ordered in P45) are expected to arrive in Period 49 and will further bolster the ending inventory.
