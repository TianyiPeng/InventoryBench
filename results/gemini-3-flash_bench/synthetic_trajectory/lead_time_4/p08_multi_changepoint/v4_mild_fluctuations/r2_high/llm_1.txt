The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since orders placed in Period 1 arrive in Period 5 (L=4) and become usable for Period 6's demand, I need to cover demand for Periods 1 through 5 with current inventory and the Period 1 order. Starting on-hand inventory is 0. Total demand for the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 5 periods) is roughly 5 * 86 = 430 units. To account for demand variability (peak seen at 126) and ensure a high service level, I will target a slightly higher buffer. I'll order 450 units to establish a pipeline that accounts for the 4-period lead time and ensures stock is available by the time this order arrives in Period 5.",

Initial demand data shows Period 1 demand was 87 units, and given the historical samples (84, 55, 79, 85, 126), the mean demand is approximately 86 units per period. Since On-hand inventory is currently 0, I am experiencing stockouts and will continue to do so until the first shipment arrives. To manage inventory for the 'Lead Time + 1' window (5 periods), I need enough stock to cover demand from Period 2 through Period 6. Estimated demand for this window is ~430 units (5 * 86). I already have 450 units in transit arriving Period 5, which covers the first 5 periods of demand. However, I must place an order now to cover Period 7 (since an order placed in Period 2 arrives in Period 6 and serves Period 7 demand due to the observation delay).

Therefore, to ensure coverage for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods), I aim for a pipeline total (on-hand + in-transit) of approximately 550\u2013600 units to include a small safety stock buffer, given the volatility (high of 166 in P25). Currently, on-hand (75) + in-transit (380) equals 455 units. This is below the required coverage for 5 periods of demand (5 * 110 = 550).

The current on-hand inventory is 330 units. In-transit inventory consists of 180 units (90 ordered in P42, 90 in P43). Given the lead time of 4 periods, the P42 order will arrive during Period 46 and the P43 order will arrive during Period 47. At the start of Period 48, we will have consumed 2 periods of demand and added 180 units to our current 330, likely leaving us with over 350 units on-hand to cover the final 3 periods. The current demand regime has stabilized around 83-90 units/period (P40-P45 avg: 88.8). Total expected demand for the remaining 5 periods is approximately 450 units (5 * 90). Our total current supply (on-hand 330 + in-transit 180) is 510 units, which exceeds the total remaining demand. Placing any further orders would only increase holding costs without increasing revenue, as the on-hand inventory plus scheduled arrivals are sufficient to avoid stockouts through Period 50.",

Expected arrivals in Period 47 and 48 (from orders in P43 and previously inferred pipeline) amount to 90 units total (the current 'In-transit' figure). Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~85-95 units (most recent 3-period average is 103, but 10-period average is ~90). With 318 units on hand and only 4 periods of demand remaining (Periods 47, 48, 49, 50), the total expected demand is approximately 360-400 units.

The recent demand regime (P44-P47) averages approximately 100 units per period (91, 116, 102, 91). For the remaining 3 periods (P48, P49, P50), expected total demand is approximately 300 units.
