Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Initial history shows 5 periods of demand (84, 55, 79, 85, 126). The mean of these 5 samples is 85.8, and the standard deviation is approximately 25.8. Since this is the first decision period and we have a small sample size, I will use all available historical data (N=5) to set the baseline forecast. For L, I will use the promised lead time of 4. mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * mean = 5 * 85.8 = 429. sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(1+L) * std = sqrt(5) * 25.8 \u2248 57.69. Using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for demand statistics reflects the initial regime.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 128 units, which is currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect it to arrive until Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 conclude message). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we lost demand of 87 units in Period 1 because the game started with 0 inventory and a 4-period lead time makes an immediate stockout inevitable. Historical demand samples (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) show a mean of 85.8 and a standard deviation of 25.8. I will use 'default' for L (4 periods) and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to establish a baseline while we wait for the first shipment to arrive. The backend will calculate the base stock based on the promised lead time and all available demand history.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods, which means orders from Period 1 are expected to arrive in Period 5. Consequently, we have had 0 stock on hand and 0 sales for Periods 1 and 2, which is expected. The historical demand data provided (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) for Periods 1-5 indicates an average demand of 85.8 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 252 (128 from P1 + 124 from P2). Given the promised lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. 5 periods * 85.8 avg = 429 units. Since current pipeline is 252, we need additional orders. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the provided historical demand samples (84, 55, 79, 85, 126), and 'default' for L and sigma_hat as there is no evidence yet to deviate from promised lead time or total volatility.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4 sequence: N=1 -> Arrival=1+4=5). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations in Periods 1-3 are expected and do not indicate a lead time shift or lost shipment yet. On-hand inventory is 0, and all demand is currently being lost, which is the expected behavior for a lead time of 4. Total In-transit is 379 units (O1:128 + O2:124 + O3:127). Demand over the first 3 periods has been relatively stable (87, 86, 62). However, historical data provided in the prompt shows a significant spike in Period 5 (84, 55, 79, 85, 126). Since current demand matches the early part of that pattern, I anticipate the spike in Period 5 demand. I will use the 'default' lead time of 4 and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=3 to capture the most recent local average, while allowing the OR backend to handle the base stock calculation for (L+1) = 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1 arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (after this decision). Therefore, it is normal that 'arrived=0' is seen in all history (P1-P4) so far. No shipments are confirmed lost yet. However, we have experienced 100% lost sales (stockouts) for 4 periods because we started with 0 inventory and a 4-period lead time. Demand history (samples provided: 84, 55, 79, 85, 126; game history demand: 87, 86, 62, 80) shows a significant spike in Period 5 (126 units). This suggests a possible regime change or upward trend. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent volatility and the demand jump more heavily while waiting for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed in Period 1) arrived in Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods (L=4). Historical demand across the first 5 periods (including those before the stock arrival) averages 74.6 units (84, 55, 79, 85, 126 from stats; though the conclude messages show slightly different realized demand: 87, 86, 62, 80, 58). Using the provided seed statistics (mean=85.8), demand is relatively stable. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand fluctuations while we build history. On-hand inventory is 70 and in-transit is 400 (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), which is sufficient to cover demand for the 4-period lead time window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1526.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. Promised lead time (L) is 4. Historical arrivals for orders placed in Period 1 and 2 arrived exactly in 4 periods (P5 and P6 respectively), confirming L=4 is consistent. Demand has been relatively stable: Period 1-6 demand values are 87, 86, 62, 80, 58, 86. The average demand per period is ~76.5. Currently, on-hand inventory is 108 and in-transit is 276. Since L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At an average of 76.5, the required base stock is approximately 382.5. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 108 + 276 = 384, which is very close to our requirement. Period 5 showed a significant spike in the prompt historical data (126), but the actual play history for Period 5 was 58. Because the actual demand history provided in the 'conclude' messages differs from the seed data (Period 1-5 in the intro), I will prioritize the observed game history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand (mu_hat) to capture all observed game behavior, and 'default' for L and sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods based on P1 and P2 orders arriving in P5 and P6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1305.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing regular chips with a confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Historically, demand over the first 7 periods has been relatively stable with a mean of 76.57 units and a standard deviation of approximately 12.3. The latest demand in Period 7 was 77. We have 158 units on hand and 219 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 4, 5, and 7). Calculations for the OR backend: mu_hat should reflect the demand for (1+L) = 5 periods. Using the mean of all 7 samples (76.57 * 5 \u2248 382.8). sigma_hat for 5 periods is sqrt(5) * 12.3 \u2248 27.5. Since the demand shows no significant regime shift yet, I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat which utilizes all historical samples, providing a stable baseline. Lead time is confirmed as the default 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1317.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the confirmed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 1 through 4. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Historical demand across the last 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 76.6 units (87, 86, 62, 80, 58, 86, 77, 77). There is no strong evidence of a seasonal spike or regime shift yet, though Period 5's demand was slightly lower than average. My parameter strategy uses a recent window N=8 to capture current volatility while staying close to the historical average. On-hand (146) + In-transit (247) = 393 total units in the pipeline. With a mean of ~77, the expected demand over 5 periods is ~385. The backend will use these parameters to determine if the small current surplus (393 vs 385) requires a small replenishment or none, considering the high Profit/Holding ratio which favors a slightly higher service level.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a consistently confirmed lead time of 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5 through P9). Demand has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 77.3 units over the last 9 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 147 units, and there are 194 units in transit (expected from orders in P7, P8, and P9). Given the promised lead time of 4, our review+lead period covers 5 periods (L+1). mu_hat is derived using the mean of all historical samples (approx 77) multiplied by 5, resulting in a target of 385 units. sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of all samples adjusted for the 5-period window. This approach ensures we maintain a high service level while the OR backend manages the pipeline inventory and replenishment.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 all arrived exactly 4 periods later). However, in P10 conclude, arrived=0 units even though we ordered 0 units in Period 6. This is consistent with the lead time logic. The on-hand inventory is 52 units, and there are 303 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Demand has been relatively stable, ranging from 58 to 95 over the last 10 periods. The last 5 periods (P6-P10) show an average demand of 83.6. I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand stability. Given the lead time is reliably 4 periods, I will stick with the default lead time (4). The OR engine will use these to maintain a base stock that covers 5 periods (L+1) of demand, ensuring we don't stock out given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and P7). Note that in P10, the arrival for the order placed in P6 was 0 units, but p6's order quantity was 0, which is consistent. The lead time appears stable at 4. Demand history (Periods 1-11) shows values: 87, 86, 62, 80, 58, 86, 77, 77, 83, 95, 92. Recent demand (P10-P11) shows a slight uptick (~93) compared to earlier periods, but overall the mean remains around 80. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture this slight upward trend while maintaining stability. Sigma is set to default. The goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods) and account for the 324 units currently in transit.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 80 units since Period 1. There is a potential missing shipment: Period 10's conclude message showed 0 units arrived, even though Period 6's order of 0 units was due (which explains the 0 arrival), but Period 10 also shows the order from Period 6 was 0. Looking at arrivals, orders from P1-P5 arrived with a consistent lead time (L) of 4. Period 11 saw P7's arrival (L=4) and Period 12 saw P8's arrival (L=4). This confirms L=4 is reliable. Current on-hand is 52 and in-transit is 343. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 395. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. 5 periods * 80 units/period = 400. We are slightly below this level. I will use recent_N (N=12) for demand mean and sigma to capture all available game history while allowing for recent variability. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been consistently 4 units as promised.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently zero (out-of-stock) due to a missed arrival in Period 10. The order placed in Period 6 (ordered=0) naturally resulted in no arrival at Period 10, creating a stockout gap since Period 13. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on all observable arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P7->P11, P8->P12, P9->P13). Demand remains stable with a slight upward trend in recent periods (avg ~88 in last 5 vs ~78 historically). To recover from the stockout and cover the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5), I am using a recent window for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the higher recent demand (approx 86-95 range) and ensuring the pipeline is replenished. The target base stock focuses on high service level (0.95 quantile) given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1691.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the history (Orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P7, P8, P9, and P10 all arrived exactly after 4 periods). An order from P6 was for 0 units. The demand has remained relatively stable over the last 14 periods, with no strong evidence of a regime shift, though a slight uptick is visible from P10 onwards. The mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 80.9 units. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 captures the most recent demand behavior while maintaining a stable forecast against minor fluctuations. The on-hand inventory is low (19), but there are 349 units in-transit, which should cover current needs as they arrive systematically every period based on previous orders.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since the game started, with an average demand of approximately 83 units per period. I have analyzed the delivery history: the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. However, there is a missing shipment from Period 6 (ordered=0), which effectively creates a gap in arrivals at Period 10. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (13 units), but the pipeline is substantial (339 units). Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat effectively captures the representative mean of approximately 85 per period, scaled by (1+L). I will maintain L at the default (4) as the data confirms this rhythm. The service level for this SKU is very high due to the high profit/holding cost ratio ($19/$1), so the OR backend will target a high base stock to avoid stockouts while managing the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2375.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward shift in Period 16 (138 units) and Period 5 (126 units), with an overall mean demand around 83 units across all samples. However, there's a stockout in Period 16 (sold 125, demand 138), and on-hand inventory is currently 0. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With L=4, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the recent spike, using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 captures the slightly higher average of approximately 100 units/period (average of P12-P16: (71+86+90+97+138)/5 = 96.4), which provides better protection against stockouts than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is set to default to handle variability across the full dataset while acknowledging the high recent variance. This configuration aims to aggressive replenish stock to meet the increased demand and clear the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected: Period 16 demand (138) significantly exceeds historical average (~83), leading to stockout; average of last 5 periods increased to 96.4 units (+16%).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) due to a demand surge starting in Period 16 (138 units) and continuing in Period 17 (99 units), combined with tight inventory management in previous periods. The carry-over insight confirms a demand shift. Historical demand was approx. 80-85, but the average of the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is 102 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data (P5-P17). To recover and prevent further lost sales during this higher demand regime, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent increase in mean and volatility. This will raise the base stock level to account for the new demand average of ~100 units per period across the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: average demand over the last 5 periods is 102 units (+23% vs initial baseline), confirming a sustained higher demand level.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high demand, with recent periods (P16-P18) showing values of 138, 99, and 129, significantly higher than the initial average of ~83. This has resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0 for P16, P17, P18) because arrivals are trailing the demand spike. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Since we are in a clear high-demand regime, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current mean (average of P14-P18 demand is ~110.6). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility observed during this shift. L is set to 'calculate' as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 4 periods. These settings aim to increase the base stock level to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the current demand trend.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Demand has shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16; the average demand over the last 5 periods (16-20) is 114.2 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~83. This confirms the sustained regime shift noted in carry-over insights. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and the last four periods resulted in lost sales due to stockouts, I need to set parameters that account for the higher demand level (L+1=5 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime and help the OR backend calculate a base stock that restores inventory levels and meets the increased demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-19 average demand is 118 units, representing a 42% increase from the initial baseline (~83).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20) is 119.6 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~83 units. The system is currently in a stockout situation (on-hand inventory is 0) because recent arrivals (based on orders from lower-demand periods) are insufficient to meet this higher demand. Since the lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods, I must set the mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new regime. Using the last 5 periods (N=5) captures the current high-demand state while excluding the older, lower-demand data. This will increase the base stock level to satisfy the higher mean and variance, mitigating further stockouts as the in-transit inventory arrives.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 16-20 average demand is 119.6 units, a 44% increase over the initial baseline (~83 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher regime starting around Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to 21 is approximately 119.5 units, which is a significant increase from the initial baseline of ~83 units. Recent periods (18-21) show demand consistently above 100 units (129, 106, 126, 119). I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this entire high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival history (most recently the P17 order arriving in P21 with a 4-period lead time). On-hand inventory is very low (9 units) due to recent stockouts during the transition, but the large in-transit pipeline (531 units) should soon replenish stock. The OR backend needs to maintain a high base stock to satisfy the new demand level while considering the 4-period lead time (L+1=5 periods of risk).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high-demand regime (P16-P21): mean demand increased to ~120 units (+45% vs baseline). Lead time stability at 4 periods reaffirmed.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, demand dropped significantly to 59 units after five consecutive periods of high demand (averaging ~120). This could be an outlier or the beginning of a downward shift. However, following the 'BE CONSERVATIVE' rule for Carry-over Insights, I will maintain the high-demand profile for one more period to avoid under-ordering if this was just a single-day fluctuation. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The the stockout situation has improved, with on-hand inventory now at 87 and a healthy pipeline of 506 units (covering roughly 4 days of high demand). Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat (covering Period 16-22) captures the shift toward higher demand while acknowledging the recent low sample. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to account for the increased volatility seen during this high-demand regime and the recent drop.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 23, the samples are: 138, 99, 129, 106, 126, 119, 59, 102. While Period 22 was an outlier (59), the overall average for this 8-period regime is approximately 110 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~83 units. This confirms the previously recorded upward shift. For Period 24, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this new regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) estimation. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which is handled by the 'calculate' method. The OR backend will balance the high profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1) by maintaining a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate given the recent high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Period 16-23) confirmed: Mean demand is approximately 110 units representing a ~33% increase from the initial baseline (~83 units).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 24 (9 samples), the mean is approximately 112.7 units (compared to the initial baseline of ~83). The most recent demand at Period 24 was 136, reinforcing this higher level despite a dip at Period 22. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent arrivals (e.g., Period 20 order arriving in Period 24). To capture this higher demand regime while smoothing out the noise from the dip in Period 22, I will use a recent_N window of 9 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient for the (L+1) = 5 period risk horizon based on the current higher demand level (~113 units/period) while accounting for the increased volatility (standard deviation ~24.5) observed in this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3077.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a significant and sustained upward regime shift starting around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent block (Periods 21-25), demand values are 119, 59, 102, 136, and 166. While Period 22 was low, the subsequent trend and the spike to 166 in Period 25 indicate increasing volatility and a higher mean. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P16-P25) is approximately 114 units, whereas the last 5 periods (P21-P25) average 116.4 units. I will use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat to capture this elevated demand level while smoothing out the outlier in Period 22. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on systematic arrivals from Period 1 through Period 21. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect this stability. For sigma_hat, recent_N with N=10 is appropriate to account for the increased variance observed during this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift continues to evolve: Period 21-25 average demand is 116.4 units, with a notable peak of 166 units in Period 25, suggesting increasing volatility within the established high-demand regime.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher-demand regime starting around Period 16. Over the last 11 periods (P16-P26), the mean demand is approximately 115.5 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~83. The most recent 5 periods (P22-P26) show an average of 110.8 units, but with high volatility (standard deviation ~41), including a peak of 166 units in P25. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 98 and in-transit at 466 (orders from P23-P26), the pipeline is relatively full. Using recent_N=11 for mu_hat captures the entirety of this high-demand regime to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the increased mean, while recent_N=11 for sigma_hat will capture the increased volatility to protect against stockouts during peaks. Setting L to default (4) as lead-time observations remain consistent.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P26) mean demand is 115.5 units (+39% vs. baseline) with significantly increased volatility (std ~36, peak 166).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 16 onwards) has established a new mean of approximately 115 units, compared to the initial baseline of 83 units. Over the last 12 periods, demand has averaged 114.5, with significant volatility (std ~28.6). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P23-P27) show an average of 120 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high stockout frequency in P16-P20 and the current on-hand inventory of 52, I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the full scope of the high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the base stock reflects the current mean and volatility while protecting against the recent peak of 166 units seen in Period 25.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 28, the mean demand is 111.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 28.5. This is a significant increase from the initial baseline demand of approx 83. The most recent demand (P28: 77) was lower, but volatility remains high (P25: 166). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (L=4), meaning we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Given the sustained demand shift, I will use recent_N with N=13 (covering the period since the shift began) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using recently observed stats ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current regime while the OR's internal capping logic prevents excessive over-ordering. L is set to calculate to maintain the confirmed 4-period lead time average.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16 from a baseline of ~83 units to a higher mean. Analyzing the last 14 periods (P16-P29), the average demand is 113.8 units with an increased standard deviation of approximately 27 units. The most recent demand (P29) was 142, confirming that demand remains significantly elevated. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, with orders consistently arriving after 4 periods (as confirmed by the P25 order arriving in P29). Inventory is currently well-supported by 447 units in-transit, but given the higher mean and volatility, I will use a recent window (N=14) to capture the current demand regime and its volatility for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. L will stay at the promised 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 21-30) shows a mean of approximately 112.9 units, which is consistent with the established high-demand regime identified around Period 16. Although there was a peak in Period 25 (166 units), the most recent demand points (Period 29: 142, Period 30: 132) confirm we are still in this elevated phase compared to the initial baseline of ~83. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P26 order arrived in P30). I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this stable 'new normal' demand and its associated volatility. This N=10 window covers the entire established high-demand regime from P21 onwards, providing a robust estimate for the base stock calculation while accounting for the recent increase in variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2493.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with the average demand over the last 16 periods (P16-P31) being approximately 117 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~83 units. Recent volatility is significant (standard deviation ~28 in this new regime), with peaks reaching 166 units and several instances above 130. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 27 order in Period 31. To account for this higher demand level and increased volatility, I am using a recent_N window of 16 periods (representing the length of the current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the appropriate service level (95% critical ratio) against the more recent, higher demand distribution rather than the long-term historical average, which would under-order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2113.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 32 is approximately 114.5 units, which is significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~83. Recent performance (last 7 periods, P26-P32) shows a mean of 115 units with moderate volatility (std ~23). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 32 of the order placed in Period 28. Current on-hand inventory is 72 units, and pipeline inventory is 496 units. To maintain a high service level given the profit margin ($19) versus holding cost ($1), the base stock needs to cover L+1 periods of demand (~115 * 5 = 575). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=17 to capture the full extent of the high-demand regime while filtering out the initial low-demand baseline. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture the increased volatility of this regime.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P32) mean stabilized at ~115 units (+38% vs baseline) with sustained volatility (std ~23). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2622.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 115 units and increased volatility (std ~26). Period 33 experienced a stockout (demand 158 vs 138 on-hand), leaving the current on-hand inventory at 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high service level target (criticality 0.95), I'm using the 'recent_N' method with N=18 (covering the start of the regime shift at P16 to P33) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately. The in-transit inventory is high (541 units), which will be accounted for by the OR backend's base-stock policy to prevent excessive over-ordering while addressing the immediate stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16 to 33 maintains a mean of ~115 units with sustained volatility; stockout in Period 33 confirms the need for robust safety stock in this regime.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains significantly higher (approx. 115 units/period) and more volatile (std ~23-36) than the initial baseline (approx. 83 units/period). Recent demand in Period 33 (158 units) caused a stockout, confirming that the backend needs to account for this higher mean and variance. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=19 to capture the entirety of this high-demand regime (Periods 16-34). sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' with N=19 to ensure sufficient safety stock for the observed volatility. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in Period 34 (ordered in P30).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains established at a higher baseline compared to the start of the game. For the high-demand period (P16-P35), the mean demand is approximately 115.5 units with a standard deviation of about 27.2. In the most recent 10 periods (P26-P35), the mean is 117.8 units, showing the regime is stable but volatile. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend's target service level (q) is high (~0.95), which is appropriate for preventing stockouts observed in periods like P16-P20 and P33. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the full extent of this higher-demand regime while excluding the initial lower-demand baseline. This approach provides the backend with the necessary statistics to maintain an adequate base stock (L+1 periods of demand) plus safety stock to buffer against the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $901.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 16 from a baseline of ~83 units to a high-demand regime averaging approximately 115 units. Over the last 10 periods (P27-P36), the mean demand is 109 units with a standard deviation of approximately 32.7, indicating sustained volatility. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods throughout the history. In Period 36, demand dropped significantly (57 units), but this is likely a stochastic fluctuation rather than a regime shift, as previous fluctuations (e.g., P22, P34) were followed by returns to higher levels. Current on-hand inventory is 182 units with 444 units in transit. Given the target service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the full breadth of the high-demand regime (P16 onwards) while smoothing out the most recent low demand spike. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P34-P37) shows values of 79, 112, 57, and 120, indicating continued volatility around the established high-demand mean (~115). The stock-out in Period 33 was addressed by subsequent arrivals, and on-hand inventory has recovered to 173 units with a healthy pipeline of 379 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P33 order arriving in P37). I will continue to use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (mu_hat) to capture the higher mean and volatility of the current regime (N=22, since the shift at P16). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the sustained higher standard deviation (~23-30) seen in this regime, ensuring sufficient safety stock for service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1554.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 114 units and sustained volatility (standard deviation around 25-30 units). Recent demand in Periods 34-38 has been slightly lower (avg 92.4 over the last 5 periods), but the overall period 16-38 average remains around 113.8. Stockouts in earlier periods (P33, P16-P20) were driven by high volatility and demand spikes, necessitating a robust safety stock. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods since the beginning. Currently, we have an on-hand inventory of 232 and a significant pipeline (350 units), totaling 582. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Using the regime mean (~114), five periods of demand equals 570 units. My current inventory position (582) is close to this target. I will use a recent_N of 23 for mu_hat (covering the entire high-demand regime since P16) to ensure the OR engine captures both the sustained mean and the regime-specific volatility for sigma_hat.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 16 continues to hold, with a mean demand of approximately 115 units and sustained volatility. Recent periods (P34-P39) show slightly lower but variable demand (79, 112, 57, 120, 94, 94), averaging 92.6 units. However, looking at the full high-demand regime from P16-P39, the mean is approximately 112 units with a standard deviation around 25. Actual lead time has been remarkably consistent at 4 periods since the start of the game. On-hand inventory is healthy at 210 units, with 367 units in-transit (orders from P36, P37, P38, P39). To ensure we continue to cover the (L+1)=5 period demand window while acknowledging the most relevant recent demand behavior, I will use recent_N with N=24 (covering the entire high-demand regime from P16 to P39). This provides a robust estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat that balances recent dips with the proven potential for spikes (e.g., 158 in P33, 166 in P25).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 25 periods (P16-P40), the mean demand is approximately 109.8 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 27.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, as evidenced by the Period 40 arrival (ordered Period 36, lead_time 4). The current on-hand inventory (233) is relatively high, and there's a substantial in-transit pipeline (347 units), indicating that the system is well-stocked for near-term demand. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=25 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established regime's behavior while providing enough buffer for the observed volatility. For Lead Time, I will continue using the 'calculate' method as it has remained stable at 4 periods throughout the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1481.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been characterized by higher mean and volatility since Period 16 (avg ~115). However, very recent demand (Periods 36-41) has moderated, averaging approximately 88 units. Despite this recent cooling, the wider high-demand regime context and the history of stockouts (Period 33) necessitate maintaining a robust base stock. The on-hand inventory is 191, and there are 381 units in-transit, totaling 572 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=20) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the sustained high-demand regime characteristics while moderating slightly for the recent lower observations, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level (~95% given profit/holding ratio) across the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a more recent stabilization around 110-115 units per period. Over the last 10 periods (P33-P42), the average demand is 96.4 units, though this include some lower recent values (P40-P42 avg=83). Given the context of the high-demand shift observed earlier and the profit margin (19:1), it is safer to maintain a forecast that accommodates the established regime mean of ~115 while adjusting for recent fluctuations. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am using recent_N (N=20) for demand and sigma to capture the high-demand regime's characteristics while allowing more recent data to influence the distribution. Current on-hand (238) and in-transit (335) are healthy, covering roughly 5-6 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1173.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, the inventory position (on-hand 252 + in-transit 323 = 575) is currently healthy relative to lead-time demand. The confirmed high-demand regime from Period 16 (mean ~115) has shown signs of softening recently, as the average demand over the last 10 periods (P34-P43) has dropped to approximately 86.1 units, which is closer to the original baseline (~83). However, given the sustained volatility observed throughout the period (e.g., peak of 158 in P33 and 166 in P25), I will use a recent_N window of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current slowing trend while acknowledging the volatility of the later game phase. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, so 'calculate' is appropriate for L. This setup allows the OR backend to maintain a safe but not excessive inventory as we approach the final periods (current period 44 of 50).

Carry-over insight: Recent demand deceleration: Average demand over P34-P43 has decreased to 86.1 units, significantly lower than the P16-P33 average of ~115, returning closer to the initial baseline of ~83.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. From Period 16 to 33, demand averaged ~115 units. However, since Period 34, demand has decelerated, averaging 86.1 units over the last 11 periods (P34-P44), which is close to the initial baseline of ~83 units. For Period 45, I am setting mu_hat using the last 11 samples (recent_N=11) to capture this lower demand regime and avoid over-ordering, as on-hand inventory (249 units) is currently high. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=11 to reflect current volatility. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (arrival in P44 from order in P40 confirms L=4).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted from a high-demand regime (avg ~115) back to a level closer to the initial baseline. From Period 34 to Period 45, the average demand is 89.0 units. The most recent demand (P45=116) is a slight uptick but consistent with the current observed volatility (std ~16.5 over the last 12 periods). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 213 units and in-transit is 177, totaling 390 units, which is quite high compared to current demand levels. I will set mu_hat to look at the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture this recent lower-demand regime (P34-P45) more accurately than the full history, while using default settings for L and sigma_hat to maintain safety stock targets given the high profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean (~89 units) from Period 34-45 compared to the previous high-demand peak.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean compared to the Period 16-33 high-demand peak. Over the last 13 periods (P34-P46), the average demand is approximately 89.2 units. Recent performance (P44-P46) shows demand fluctuating around 91, 116, and 102 units, supporting this lower baseline compared to the previous ~115 average. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Inventory levels (On-hand: 189, In-transit: 233) are currently substantial, likely due to high orders placed during the previous high-demand regime. Using recent_N=13 for mu_hat captures this current regime (starts at Period 34). sigma_hat is also calculated using recent_N=13 to account for the reduced volatility in this period compared to the previous peak. L is kept at calculate to leverage the stable historical lead time performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1554.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, demand is currently in a stabilized lower regime. Since Period 34, the average demand has been approximately 89 units, which is a significant reduction from the high-demand peak (P16-P33 avg ~115) and aligns closely with the initial baseline. Most recently (P44-P47), demand has hovered between 91 and 116. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (validated by P43 order arriving in P47). The on-hand inventory is 175 units, and in-transit inventory is 258 units. To avoid overstocking while approaching the end of the game (Period 50), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering the lower regime since Period 34) to align the OR backend with the current demand level (~89 units/period). This provides a balanced forecast for the (L+1) window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2305.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~90-100 units following a deceleration from the P16-P33 peak. Recent demand (P45-P48) has been 116, 102, 91, and 124, indicating a slight upward creep from the deceleration floor. The current on-hand inventory is 51, and there is a high pipeline of 346 units. Period 48 conclude shows arrived=0 for an order expected from P44 (promised lead time 4), but P44 actually had ordered=0. Looking back, the last actual order placed was P43, which arrived in P47 (lead_time=4). P44 order was 0, so no arrival was possible in P48. P45 order (22 units) is expected to arrive in P49 resolution. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N (N=15) to capture the stabilized demand regime since the deceleration started around P34, while managing the high pipeline inventory against the 51 on-hand units to avoid excessive holding costs as the game approaches the final period (Period 50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1387.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the product experienced a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0) despite an arrival of 22 units from Period 45. The inventory situation is currently critical with 0 on-hand and 449 units in-transit. The delivery from Period 44 (ordered 0) effectively created a gap in arrivals at Period 48, contributing to the stockout. The arrival in Period 49 had an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 34, the demand regime has stabilized to a lower mean compared to the previous peak; the average demand from P34 to P49 is approximately 91.5 units. I will use a recent_N with N=16 to capture this lower but slightly volatile demand regime (mean ~92, std ~22). This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that accounts for the current 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=5). The 'calculate' method for L is appropriate as lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods throughout the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P34-P49 stabilized at a mean of ~91.5 units, significantly lower than the P16-P33 peak (~115) but slightly higher than the initial baseline (~83).
